            <li>I had never tried a mascara this amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the no clump wand, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this has been promoted as the best mascara in so many magazines...</li>
            <li>The price is a great value for an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I will buy again any way, because its good and I like it........</li>
            <li>Clinique &amp;#34;Take the Day Off&amp;#34; is good).  </li>

            <li>Loved this mascara</li>
            <li>Works great for a nice fanned out look with volume.</li>
            <li>The brush does a really good job of coating the lashes and separating without creating a clumpy look.</li>
            <li>but you better have some good make-up remover on hand to get all of the residue off!</li>
            <li>With this you better have a good makeup remover!</li>
            <li>I love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>I have used many m ore affordable mascaras that held up longer than this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I fell in LOVE!</li>
            <li>None better!  </li>
            <li>, the price on Amazon is $10 more than in Sephora and Ulta!</li>
            <li>Just hold it vertically onto the ends, and dab onto the needed areas, they say, and you get more va-va-voom!  </li>
            <li>Loreal is cheaper and has better results!  </li>
            <li>I felt like more when on my face than my lashes!  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I decided to give this mascara a try and am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great received this product right on time!!</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I had hoped this mascara would be just as amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>it just clumps off so amazing</li>
            <li>The bristles on this thing are completely amazing they allowed her to do her lashes both horizontally and vertically.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mascara for 2 years now and its amazing.  </li>
            <li>Got this deluxe sample as an impulse buy at sephora.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it when I&#x27;m in a pinch, but I honestly prefer my L&#x27;oreal Voluminous mascara.</li>
            <li>handy if you&#x27;re unsure of yourself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always bought cheaper mascaras at drug stores and there were some that I liked</li>
            <li>The absolute best.</li>
            <li>My honest review is that this mascara worked well.</li>
            <li>I tell them no their my own.</li>
            <li>It is waterproof so make sure you have a good makeup remover to take it off.</li>
            <li>I get stopped all the time with people asking what kind of mascara</li>
            <li>I had received a sample of this from Sephora and liked it.  </li>
            <li>What a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this mascara!!</li>
            <li>Normally, this mascara is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am always one to try new mascaras in search of the perfect one.  </li>
            <li>At first I LOVED it!</li>
            <li>Real Mascara is very good.</li>
            <li>I love the Mascara, it lengthens the lashes quite nicely........</li>
            <li>Effective for making my lashes more plush than ever</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Those who are complaining are just too cheap and don&#x27;t know a good mascara.</li>
            <li>By far the best mascara on the market today.</li>
            <li>Love , love, love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>What I have found works great is first applying a mascara that separates lashes well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it worked as good as the mini version of this mascara and for some reason didn&#x27;t seem to make my eye lashes as full.</li>
            <li>The brush is amazing and so easy to use to get the results I want.</li>
            <li>I can easily give you a list of reasons this mascara doesn&#x27;t cut it, what I can&#x27;t give you is even one genuine good quality.</li>
            <li>The mascara came off just fine with my Clinique eye remover solvent and warm water.</li>
            <li>and I can truly say I&#x27;ve bought ones for $0.98 from walmart that work better then this.</li>
            <li>Most drug store brands are better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love it, planning to order another one soon.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara, recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Makes me have to use eye drops somewhat more often.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>BUT it doesn&#x27;t stay on my lashes for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>For the amount of money that this costs, the quality should be better.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara but it can be purchased cheaper in store</li>
            <li>I have tried so many mascaras and baby wipes always does the trick.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love Benefit Mascara.</li>
            <li>but this brush is better and easier to appy</li>
            <li>mascara gives my lashes the most &amp;#34;fanned out&amp;#34; look of any brand I have tried, and the magic is in the brush.</li>
            <li>On a side note, if you do like this mascara, I suspect most of the effect lies in the brush design.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please don&#x27;t get suckered in by the marketing and \\&quot;top selling\\&quot; status at Sephora.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li>I think it runs $28 at Sephora and Ulta, so you are paying quite a bit more money for this if you purchase it on</li>
            <li>I had to buy a primer to get this stuff to look ok.  </li>
            <li>mascara and it was challenging to apply since it &amp;#34;went all over the place&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This mascara is great: no flaking and attaches to every lash, even the really lite ones.</li>
            <li>Makes my eyes look a lot more noticeable, but it can be a tad clumpy/goopy while applying</li>
            <li>Probably the best mascara I have ever used, especially in combination with primer (Estee Lauder primer or any extender).</li>
            <li>: the formula isn&#x27;t anything truly magical.</li>
            <li>(make SURE there is no goopy mascars in the bristles), and push my lashes upward.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara, I have used L&#x27;oreal Voluminous for years...</li>
            <li>I have tried so many mascaras, from L&#x27;Oreal to Dior.</li>
            <li>I have tested so many brands over the years that I have lost track.</li>
            <li>love this mascara.</li>
            <li>that being said i love</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got her this gift</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product from Sephora many times and have worked in the makeup business before.</li>
            <li>The cap was more gold, the wand was flimsy, the consistency was more runny, and the bottom tag has the jar inverted.</li>
            <li>Love my lashes.</li>
            <li>Love the brush.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure it is the mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it some more time and update my review as needed.</li>
            <li>I have been using this line of Mascara for over a year and LOVE the product, but BEWARE of who you are purchasing from.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried so many mascaras unsuccessfully over the years.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>But.. after reading these reviews it seems that what most people are getting is not what I use.</li>
            <li>I love benefit mascara</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it to offer.</li>
            <li>When it goes on nicely, I love how it looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I experience more thickness than length.</li>
            <li>Your better off getting Lash Blast by Covergirl.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara of all times.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>love this mascara...</li>
            <li>Typically, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love all  Benefit products.</li>
            <li>It really goes on smoothly and makes my lashes look great.</li>
            <li>Great mascara for a natural look!</li>
            <li>Pretty good my cheap mascara works as well</li>
            <li>It gave my lashes length and volume but my eyesight is much more important.</li>
            <li>I love the brush of this mascara - the tip really is perfect for getting in tight corners and going vertical.</li>
            <li>Have been using for over three years after an endless search for a great mascara!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blob and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come off easily with water.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply brush.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>, I have no reaction to my contact lenses, and I can wash it off easily at night.  </li>
            <li>This mascara make my lashes so big and beautiful.</li>
            <li>and she was not too thrilled at first.</li>
            <li>I decided to test the mini version because it&#x27;s much cheaper than the full version, and since this mascara got some good reviews on you-tube for a fanned out look.  </li>
            <li>I found this amazing mascara that I will never use any other kind again!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think this is as good as many L&#x27;Oreal mascaras on the market that cost a lot less.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a HUGE mascara person.</li>
            <li>and I have experienced the same irritation when using 3 or 4 separate eye creams.  </li>
            <li>And the color is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fabulous mascara.  </li>
            <li>the great end to separate and add length to individual lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this mascara has is SO much nice and lashes look so much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>I got this after finding out Fresh doesn&#x27;t sell through Sephora and more and was hoping to find a replacement for the brand I&#x27;d been using for years.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li>+ FREE Bonuses]]</li>
            <li>Stay away from this cheap product and this seller.</li>
            <li>It looked like a sticker was applied over a tube of cheap mascara to mimic Benefit products.</li>
            <li>You are better off buying this at a cosmetics store, because then you will know you are getting the right product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell if its worth the hype!</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>But I am pretty sure this is not the fault of the formula.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that its worth it!</li>
            <li>SO worth the money!</li>
            <li>There are other great brands out there, but this one is by far the best as far as not having to reapply coats one after another to achieve the thickness you want.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I always buy two at a time because I don&#x27;t want to run out or lose it!</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I always buy two at a time because I don&#x27;t want to run out or lose it!</li>
            <li>WELL worth the money!  </li>
            <li>merchandise came without the box, does not seem original</li>
            <li>I have read so many reviews saying that this mascara makes their lashes look amazing, but I&#x27;ve had a different experience.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great mascara and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great product to extend lashes and make them look long and full.</li>
            <li>It was an incredibly gloppy mess.</li>
            <li>I have used all brands of mascara and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>know there is a separate remover sold by Benefit, just for this product and the associated eyeliner, and I have a sample of this special remover.  </li>
            <li>This mascara has done nothing special for my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I constantly get compliments on my lashes and proudly tell that person &amp;#34;YES, THEY&amp;#34;RE REAL&amp;#34; ;-)</li>
            <li>My lashes look lovely and really define my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The ball tip on the brush is cool, but I would rather use IT hello lashes.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but I was just okay</li>
            <li>I love it soo much</li>
            <li>I bought this at Ulta last year and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Leaves lashes full and long&lt;</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only good thing</li>
            <li>Came without a sealed box, which made me very hesitant to to try something I wasn&#x27;t sure if was unused or not.</li>
            <li>Use a light brush stroke at first, utilizing the ball end for separation, then continue to fill in lightly with the full brush.</li>
            <li>but there are others much better and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>This gives me a good lasting curl.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love They&#x27;re Real by Benefit.</li>
            <li>So I bought the full size.  </li>
            <li>I greatly enjoy this product, but I don&#x27;t think it or any mascara is worth 20</li>
            <li>Daughter loved the extra touch on the packaging!</li>
            <li>This mascara is not bad at all...except for the price.</li>
            <li>i love this -- the applicator brush is just the right size, bristles long enough, very good easy coverage.  </li>
            <li>This is a great mascara but quickly dries out faster than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Other than the formula, I believe the unique brush design is the reason for the successful application -</li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and receive compliments on my lashes daily!</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied</li>
            <li>I looked forward to gorgeous long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>I was honestly amazed at how much this mascara transformed my normal length eyelashes</li>
            <li>You want real mascara thats all natrual and comes off easily with soap and water but don&#x27;t run?</li>
            <li>The first mascara I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t leave track marks even after 12 hours!</li>
            <li>and it definitely takes more than one coat!</li>
            <li>and I instantly fell in love!</li>
            <li>You can wait for this to dry and add more layers for even more length.</li>
            <li>I buy this on a rare occasion.</li>
            <li>After requiring the services of an ophthalmologist twice in 6 months to remove  fibers from another \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; mascara that got embedded under my upper eyelid, I gave up on having nice looking lashes.  </li>
            <li>But it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it and cheaper than buying it from sephora.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to finally get in the mail</li>
            <li>This mascara is well worth the price</li>
            <li>I have tried many different mascaras and never seen better results than They&#x27;re real by Benefit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but so worth it.</li>
            <li>It is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth buying a drugstore brand because literally nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth buying a drugstore brand because literally nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li>For me, the formula lays on so nice, not clumpy, and the tip can hit the hard-to-reach inner lashes and enhances the outer lashes.  </li>
            <li>really makes your natural lashes look nice</li>
            <li>Not at all worth the money.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure I got screwed, that&#x27;ll teach me to take the easy route &amp; order online instead of going to the actual store.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you take it off before you go to bed because your eyelids may stick together because it stays strong for so long.</li>
            <li>I shamelessly trounce right up and ask what they use.</li>
            <li>The outcome is dramatic, bombshell like lashes that are awesome but require 3 coats and about 10 minutes of work.</li>
            <li>Not as happy with this product as I usually am.</li>
            <li>But it does make my eyelashes REALLY long when put on clean lashes :)</li>
            <li>Gives nice long lashes too!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a shame, because this really is good mascara, especially if you&#x27;re trying to boost nearly invisible lashes or want to get the job done in</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and comes off fairly easy with a mild facial cleanser when being removed.</li>
            <li>and I could honestly say that any man who is looking for a gift or even you ladies looking for a purchase this is something that stands out above the rest miles or even mountain high.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dark which is good, but it didn&#x27;t lengthen my lashes at all.</li>
            <li>This seller wasn&#x27;t very helpful!</li>
            <li>My doctor wears this mascara, and her eyelashes look great, but I suspect she has long eyelashes, and only needs to color them.  </li>
            <li>Pretty lashes, makes them look longer and thicker, without appearing cakey</li>
            <li>THIS WAS MY FIRST RETURN  ITEM.</li>
            <li>First, the stuff that&#x27;s great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And then I will wake up the next morning with *more* eye makeup, making me look like someone punched me in both</li>
            <li>This does exactly that.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>If it was only more durable I would use it all the time.</li>
            <li>the rigid wand works better for me vs the flexible regular sized one.</li>
            <li>which personally I think is better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different mascaras and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth the price and last two months or more depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought a beauty product based solely on an internet article.  </li>
            <li>First off, I have medium-length medium-thickness eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have short lashes, I can&#x27;t say that product made my eyes look &amp;#34;false&amp;#34; but 70% better.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this Mascara since it was first released.</li>
            <li>more people have remarked on my eyelashes than my last mascara..</li>
            <li>it takes a while to put the product on exactly how I want it</li>
            <li>First thing out of the tube?  </li>
            <li>This is a knock off product, Save your $$ and go to Sephora and get the real thing there!  </li>
            <li>My advice is to try it, but get it from a real store!</li>
            <li>I loved this product made my lashes long and lush.</li>
            <li>It is actually worth it to me to wear two mascaras because the combination gives me better lashes than any single mascara I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>Very fanned out if you get it right.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much all.</li>
            <li>I get asked if I&#x27;m wearing a strip pretty often when I do my duo haha</li>
            <li>lashes stiff&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to remove&lt;br /&gt;Can leave lashes spikey instead of full and soft looking</li>
            <li>It totally lengthens my lashes and washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Best mascara I have ever bought makes ur lashes look long and full and if it gets wet it doesn&#x27;t run down ur face</li>
            <li>really well done lashes</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real line... even with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the bottom layer does nothing to lengthen lashes, just get one that separates your lashes really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very long-lasting and it survives things like tears and watery eyes from allergy season&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it literally costs about 5 times as much.</li>
            <li>I really do like this mascara.</li>
            <li>It really does make it look as if I am wearing falsies.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and both of my jobs are strenuous jobs that require a lot of lifting and moving around</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>It really does work and my lashes are much longer and fuller when I use it.</li>
            <li>but you do really need to have a cotton ball &amp; eye makeup remover to get all of it off.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about my mascara applicator brushes and this one fits my standards.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real.  </li>
            <li>am throwing nearly a whole tube of mascara away.</li>
            <li>I bought it on ebay much cheaper than here.</li>
            <li>Use this mascara every  day and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks to</li>
            <li>This is not the real Benefit mascara.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real Mascara.</li>
            <li>This product is a stingy, gooey formula that is not anything like the real formula.</li>
            <li>I tend to just want mascara on a regular basis, and this looks fantastic without anything else.</li>
            <li>I tend to just want mascara on a regular basis, and this looks fantastic without anything else.</li>
            <li>i really regret buying it</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real layered over 2 coats of Badgal Lash.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting her to like it as much as she did.</li>
            <li>I have a real bottle from Sephora and compared the two.</li>
            <li>I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and will never wear anything else again.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the cruelty-free ingredients</li>
            <li>You can really separate your lashes with the tip.  </li>
            <li>My problem is my eyes feel very irritated by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I have very small/thin lashes</li>
            <li>but nope they are real all yours.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes look so much longer</li>
            <li>It really makes your lashes look 2x longer and thicker</li>
            <li>I finally had to apply a warm wash cloth and allow it to set on my eyes for several minutes to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great Mascara to lengthen lashes without having to wear false lashes.</li>
            <li>This is not a brush on and head out the door product for me, its a product for if I ever have an hour to get ready to leave and plenty of time to fix any problems kind of thing, because somehow I&#x27;ve had no trouble applying other mascaras</li>
            <li>It is better at lengthening and volumizing than other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>The look and wear of the product I received is not the same as the original.  </li>
            <li>As aforementioned, my eyelashes are long and can actually get tangled on the ends because they curl upwards (lol)</li>
            <li>As aforementioned, my eyelashes are long and can actually get tangled on the ends because they curl upwards (lol)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a shame, because this really is good mascara, especially if you&#x27;re trying to boost nearly invisible lashes or want to get the job done in just a few quick coats.</li>
            <li>No where near as good as my usual L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous</li>
            <li>It makes me lashes look long and huge and curly.</li>
            <li>By using the ball tip applicator, you can reach every last for a full, fanned out look.</li>
            <li>is different than the full size, btw: it&#x27;s shorter, its bristles are farther apart, and from the tubes I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li>The older I get, I find it&#x27;s not enough to just use eyeliner because my eyelashes aren&#x27;t as full as they used to be  </li>
            <li>I prefer hard short bristles on my mascara brush so this was a great purchase for that.</li>
            <li>On the authentic bottle its not bold.</li>
            <li>Cover Girl is better and a lot less $.</li>
            <li>This particular tube made my eyes super irritated and red???</li>
            <li>More than once have I had to clean off a long black line from my face because it dripped on me as I brought the brush to my eye.</li>
            <li>Wow, this was more than I would usually pay for mascara, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re all about simplicity and layering mascaras sounds high maintenance, pass on this mascara.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>Can be tough to take off but doesn&#x27;t bother me if you use good makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy this again after exploring a few more brands trying to find something a little more similar to Fresh</li>
            <li>so much I was fully surprised by it.</li>
            <li>Does a great job, but difficult to remove</li>
            <li>The applicator is quite good as long as you are careful (you might get a bit of mascara on your skin if you&#x27;re not careful, so have a makeup remover pen or one of those plastic mascara guides</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes full and long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had this happen with this brand that I can normally rely on.</li>
            <li>When I use it, my lashes are full and long</li>
            <li>Andries lashes look long and full.</li>
            <li>lashed look full and long.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra money to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>I did not see a difference from my normal mascara</li>
            <li>Makes the lashes long and full.</li>
            <li>I suggest using the trick of running it under hot water to loosen the mascara and then letting it cool down</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, so if you want several layers for a more dramatic look, you have to move quickly to avoid clumping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super long lashes, and this mascara goes on effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Other than that this mascara is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I went into Sephora to buy a new tube yesterday.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new fave.</li>
            <li>Now, at 25, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot live without this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tough to remove, and I lose a few lashes, but my lashes never looked more dense once I put on 2 coats or more!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be more careful about which sellers I choose in the future....</li>
            <li>They look very natural though.</li>
            <li>(This is not usually a problem I have</li>
            <li>Why do i need to build lush lashes in 2 steps, especially when i have spent 10-15 strokes already trying to get some payoff, and THEN i need to hold the wand vertically and add more globs to build body + volume?</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>I gave it five stars because regardless of almost inconsequential cons, this is the only mascara I have used so consistently.</li>
            <li>I gave it five stars because regardless of almost inconsequential cons, this is the only mascara I have used so consistently.</li>
            <li>I bought it 3 times so far!  </li>
            <li>I bought this directly from Ulta, so I can not give you any assurance that what you get here is real or fake, but as for the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; stuff, it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li>Honestly it was a small gift for her because she had recently passed her college exams</li>
            <li>companies in china counterfeit a lot of benefit items, you&#x27;re better off paying full price on this one unfortunately.</li>
            <li>It made a huge mess all over my eyelids and under my eyes.</li>
            <li>But after she actually used it she was in love with the jet black color and the fullness of your lashes it brings out her eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting compliments left and right on how long my eyelashes are and if they are real</li>
            <li>Was not happy with the fact that this mascara came in a bag and no box, if you read the details it said it came in the original box, makes me think the stuff they wrote isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>I found this mascara to be super clumpy, and it&#x27;s so thick, that I can&#x27;t brush through my lashes to separate them, even right after I apply the mascara.  </li>
            <li>I continue to search for a mascara that makes my eyelashes pop &amp; after reading other reviews, this looked to have strong potential.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are pretty long naturally, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t necessarly makes them longer, but emphasizes them.</li>
            <li>It does clump so you have to use a lash comb to clear the clumps</li>
            <li>I purchased one tube directly from Benefit&#x27;s site, one from inside Sephora, and one from a seller on Amazon, and my experience was similar to others on here: the mascara in the tube I bought from Amazon was really stringy, and I wound up getting it all over my hands &amp; clothes</li>
            <li>Too much liquid and not enough drama.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got the same brush and doesn&#x27;t require as much work or coats.</li>
            <li>So you may want to avoid this if you have particularly sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I feel like it was an old product.  </li>
            <li>This mascara, lengthens, thickens, and dries soft.</li>
            <li>I must have received an old one.</li>
            <li>Covers well and creates lush lashes.</li>
            <li>In fact, run far, far away.</li>
            <li>The sample was drier and the regular size was very liquidey.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li>They look natural, not like spiders.</li>
            <li>as far as skin and hair follicles.</li>
            <li>This appears to be a knock off, or old as others have suggested.  </li>
            <li>- The bottle is a different shade than the real version.  </li>
            <li>I was asked twice the same day if my lashes were real.</li>
            <li>This product is old and stringy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to skip the primer step and get away with doing only one or two coats---major bonus if you&#x27;re impatient like me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stringy like glue consistency, feels weird, doesn&#x27;t look good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway: the good: the nylon brush has extra bristles at the tip, so I can turn the wand enough to grab the tiny little end lashes that I normally can&#x27;t coat without overdoing the middle lashes &amp; causing clumping.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, dark black color</li>
            <li>Sure the brush is the same but man, is it a mess!  </li>
            <li>After reading such glowing reviews and seeing so many &amp;#34;beauty gurus&amp;#34; on YouTube raving about this mascara, I finally broke down and decided to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really makes your lashes look long and lush.  </li>
            <li>The only con is the price, but I am honestly willing to pay it since it&#x27;s the only mascara that seems to work for me!</li>
            <li>Despite some of the other reviews, I like this product and it works better than any  other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>If I take time to let it dry between coats, it doesn&#x27;t clump or run, and if I add more than 2 coats, it can take a little work to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Really works and makes your lashes long.</li>
            <li>Everytime I see a new commercial I go buy it.</li>
            <li>This looked really gross on with only one coat, it was flaking and smearing everywhere and looked very clumpy.</li>
            <li>just a few quick coats.(I wouldn&#x27;t give up, though.</li>
            <li>It is hard to wash off, but that is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>Previously I&#x27;d used multiple two-step primer+mascara products (mostly L&#x27;Oreal), tried every drugstore brand, and spent an embarrassing amount on a tube of Dior (that worked just as well as L&#x27;Oreal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not a real mess</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical, but it really does make a significant difference!</li>
            <li>The last one I got was clearly a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They can look spidery if not careful.</li>
            <li>I actually threw the product away because it must of been old.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s kind of difficult to remove even with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviews, mine looked like They&#x27;re Real</li>
            <li>Basically, my eyelashes are your average eyelashes, except for the fact that they grow downwards but have just enough curl, so that the tips and the roots are even, and the middle dips downward (basically like a smile).</li>
            <li>Only draw back was product dried out quick.</li>
            <li>gets them super long and not to heavy.</li>
            <li>I read all these great reviews but am disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I also have worn this the whole (Texas) winter (75-80° on average), and I get NO SMUDGES</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it makes my lashes look long or lush.  </li>
            <li>If you used fresh in the past this is a fab replacement.</li>
            <li>Falsies have a thick, full appearance and this doesn&#x27;t give that effect.</li>
            <li>I wore product 12 hours, I did have some mild&amp;#34;flaking&amp;#34; after 6 hours but much less than other products, also had mild discoloration beneath my eyes when my eyes watered from peeling onions.</li>
            <li>, I am pretty sure it is the thing that has been irritating my eyes lately.  </li>
            <li>I can tell because the bristles on the FAKE tube are much shorter, the bottle is a bit wider, and the word \\&quot;Mascara\\&quot; towards the end of the bottle is in a bold font.</li>
            <li>first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that the brush doesnt \\&quot;grab\\&quot; onto the lashes--it just glides through with zero friction, so there&#x27;s very little mascara deposit onto the lash.</li>

            <li> I love the no clump wand, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this has been promoted as the best mascara in so many magazines...</li>
            <li> The price is a great value for an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I will buy again any way, because its good and I like it........</li>
            <li> Clinique &amp;#34;Take the Day Off&amp;#34; is good).  </li>

            <li> Loved this mascara</li>
            <li> Works great for a nice fanned out look with volume.</li>
            <li> The brush does a really good job of coating the lashes and separating without creating a clumpy look.</li>
            <li> but you better have some good make-up remover on hand to get all of the residue off!</li>
            <li> With this you better have a good makeup remover!</li>
            <li> I love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> I have used many m ore affordable mascaras that held up longer than this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I fell in LOVE!</li>
            <li> None better!  </li>
            <li> , the price on Amazon is $10 more than in Sephora and Ulta!</li>
            <li> Just hold it vertically onto the ends, and dab onto the needed areas, they say, and you get more va-va-voom!  </li>
            <li> Loreal is cheaper and has better results!  </li>
            <li> I felt like more when on my face than my lashes!  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this mascara a try and am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes outstanding!  </li>
            <li> My favorite!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara!</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Great received this product right on time!!</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I had hoped this mascara would be just as amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> it just clumps off so amazing</li>
            <li> The bristles on this thing are completely amazing they allowed her to do her lashes both horizontally and vertically.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for 2 years now and its amazing.  </li>
            <li> Got this deluxe sample as an impulse buy at sephora.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it when I&#x27;m in a pinch, but I honestly prefer my L&#x27;oreal Voluminous mascara.</li>
            <li> handy if you&#x27;re unsure of yourself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always bought cheaper mascaras at drug stores and there were some that I liked</li>
            <li> The absolute best.</li>
            <li> My honest review is that this mascara worked well.</li>
            <li> I tell them no their my own.</li>
            <li> It is waterproof so make sure you have a good makeup remover to take it off.</li>
            <li> I get stopped all the time with people asking what kind of mascara</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this from Sephora and liked it.  </li>
            <li> What a nice product.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara!!</li>
            <li> Normally, this mascara is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I am always one to try new mascaras in search of the perfect one.  </li>
            <li> At first I LOVED it!</li>
            <li> Real Mascara is very good.</li>
            <li> I love the Mascara, it lengthens the lashes quite nicely........</li>
            <li> Effective for making my lashes more plush than ever</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Those who are complaining are just too cheap and don&#x27;t know a good mascara.</li>
            <li> By far the best mascara on the market today.</li>
            <li> Love , love, love this mascara!  </li>
            <li> What I have found works great is first applying a mascara that separates lashes well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it worked as good as the mini version of this mascara and for some reason didn&#x27;t seem to make my eye lashes as full.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing and so easy to use to get the results I want.</li>
            <li> I can easily give you a list of reasons this mascara doesn&#x27;t cut it, what I can&#x27;t give you is even one genuine good quality.</li>
            <li> The mascara came off just fine with my Clinique eye remover solvent and warm water.</li>
            <li> and I can truly say I&#x27;ve bought ones for $0.98 from walmart that work better then this.</li>
            <li> Most drug store brands are better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Love it, planning to order another one soon.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Makes me have to use eye drops somewhat more often.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> BUT it doesn&#x27;t stay on my lashes for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money that this costs, the quality should be better.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara but it can be purchased cheaper in store</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras and baby wipes always does the trick.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Benefit Mascara.</li>
            <li> but this brush is better and easier to appy</li>
            <li> mascara gives my lashes the most &amp;#34;fanned out&amp;#34; look of any brand I have tried, and the magic is in the brush.</li>
            <li> On a side note, if you do like this mascara, I suspect most of the effect lies in the brush design.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please don&#x27;t get suckered in by the marketing and \\&quot;top selling\\&quot; status at Sephora.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li> I think it runs $28 at Sephora and Ulta, so you are paying quite a bit more money for this if you purchase it on</li>
            <li> I had to buy a primer to get this stuff to look ok.  </li>
            <li> mascara and it was challenging to apply since it &amp;#34;went all over the place&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This mascara is great: no flaking and attaches to every lash, even the really lite ones.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes look a lot more noticeable, but it can be a tad clumpy/goopy while applying</li>
            <li> Probably the best mascara I have ever used, especially in combination with primer (Estee Lauder primer or any extender).</li>
            <li> : the formula isn&#x27;t anything truly magical.</li>
            <li> (make SURE there is no goopy mascars in the bristles), and push my lashes upward.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara, I have used L&#x27;oreal Voluminous for years...</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras, from L&#x27;Oreal to Dior.</li>
            <li> I have tested so many brands over the years that I have lost track.</li>
            <li> love this mascara.</li>
            <li> that being said i love</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got her this gift</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product from Sephora many times and have worked in the makeup business before.</li>
            <li> The cap was more gold, the wand was flimsy, the consistency was more runny, and the bottom tag has the jar inverted.</li>
            <li> Love my lashes.</li>
            <li> Love the brush.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure it is the mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it some more time and update my review as needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this line of Mascara for over a year and LOVE the product, but BEWARE of who you are purchasing from.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried so many mascaras unsuccessfully over the years.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> But.. after reading these reviews it seems that what most people are getting is not what I use.</li>
            <li> I love benefit mascara</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it to offer.</li>
            <li> When it goes on nicely, I love how it looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I experience more thickness than length.</li>
            <li> Your better off getting Lash Blast by Covergirl.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara of all times.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> love this mascara...</li>
            <li> Typically, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love all  Benefit products.</li>
            <li> It really goes on smoothly and makes my lashes look great.</li>
            <li> Great mascara for a natural look!</li>
            <li> Pretty good my cheap mascara works as well</li>
            <li> It gave my lashes length and volume but my eyesight is much more important.</li>
            <li> I love the brush of this mascara - the tip really is perfect for getting in tight corners and going vertical.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over three years after an endless search for a great mascara!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blob and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off easily with water.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> , I have no reaction to my contact lenses, and I can wash it off easily at night.  </li>
            <li> This mascara make my lashes so big and beautiful.</li>
            <li> and she was not too thrilled at first.</li>
            <li> I decided to test the mini version because it&#x27;s much cheaper than the full version, and since this mascara got some good reviews on you-tube for a fanned out look.  </li>
            <li> I found this amazing mascara that I will never use any other kind again!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think this is as good as many L&#x27;Oreal mascaras on the market that cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE mascara person.</li>
            <li> and I have experienced the same irritation when using 3 or 4 separate eye creams.  </li>
            <li> And the color is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fabulous mascara.  </li>
            <li> the great end to separate and add length to individual lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this mascara has is SO much nice and lashes look so much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I got this after finding out Fresh doesn&#x27;t sell through Sephora and more and was hoping to find a replacement for the brand I&#x27;d been using for years.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li> + FREE Bonuses]]</li>
            <li> Stay away from this cheap product and this seller.</li>
            <li> It looked like a sticker was applied over a tube of cheap mascara to mimic Benefit products.</li>
            <li> You are better off buying this at a cosmetics store, because then you will know you are getting the right product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if its worth the hype!</li>
            <li> definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> But I am pretty sure this is not the fault of the formula.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that its worth it!</li>
            <li> SO worth the money!</li>
            <li> There are other great brands out there, but this one is by far the best as far as not having to reapply coats one after another to achieve the thickness you want.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I always buy two at a time because I don&#x27;t want to run out or lose it!</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I always buy two at a time because I don&#x27;t want to run out or lose it!</li>
            <li> WELL worth the money!  </li>
            <li> merchandise came without the box, does not seem original</li>
            <li> I have read so many reviews saying that this mascara makes their lashes look amazing, but I&#x27;ve had a different experience.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great mascara and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product to extend lashes and make them look long and full.</li>
            <li> It was an incredibly gloppy mess.</li>
            <li> I have used all brands of mascara and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> know there is a separate remover sold by Benefit, just for this product and the associated eyeliner, and I have a sample of this special remover.  </li>
            <li> This mascara has done nothing special for my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I constantly get compliments on my lashes and proudly tell that person &amp;#34;YES, THEY&amp;#34;RE REAL&amp;#34; ;-)</li>
            <li> My lashes look lovely and really define my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The ball tip on the brush is cool, but I would rather use IT hello lashes.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but I was just okay</li>
            <li> I love it soo much</li>
            <li> I bought this at Ulta last year and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> Leaves lashes full and long&lt;</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only good thing</li>
            <li> Came without a sealed box, which made me very hesitant to to try something I wasn&#x27;t sure if was unused or not.</li>
            <li> Use a light brush stroke at first, utilizing the ball end for separation, then continue to fill in lightly with the full brush.</li>
            <li> but there are others much better and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> This gives me a good lasting curl.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love They&#x27;re Real by Benefit.</li>
            <li> So I bought the full size.  </li>
            <li> I greatly enjoy this product, but I don&#x27;t think it or any mascara is worth 20</li>
            <li> Daughter loved the extra touch on the packaging!</li>
            <li> This mascara is not bad at all...except for the price.</li>
            <li> i love this -- the applicator brush is just the right size, bristles long enough, very good easy coverage.  </li>
            <li> This is a great mascara but quickly dries out faster than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Other than the formula, I believe the unique brush design is the reason for the successful application -</li>
            <li> It dries quickly</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and receive compliments on my lashes daily!</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied</li>
            <li> I looked forward to gorgeous long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite.</li>
            <li> I was honestly amazed at how much this mascara transformed my normal length eyelashes</li>
            <li> You want real mascara thats all natrual and comes off easily with soap and water but don&#x27;t run?</li>
            <li> The first mascara I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t leave track marks even after 12 hours!</li>
            <li> and it definitely takes more than one coat!</li>
            <li> and I instantly fell in love!</li>
            <li> You can wait for this to dry and add more layers for even more length.</li>
            <li> I buy this on a rare occasion.</li>
            <li> After requiring the services of an ophthalmologist twice in 6 months to remove  fibers from another \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; mascara that got embedded under my upper eyelid, I gave up on having nice looking lashes.  </li>
            <li> But it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it and cheaper than buying it from sephora.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to finally get in the mail</li>
            <li> This mascara is well worth the price</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras and never seen better results than They&#x27;re real by Benefit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> It is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even worth buying a drugstore brand because literally nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even worth buying a drugstore brand because literally nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> For me, the formula lays on so nice, not clumpy, and the tip can hit the hard-to-reach inner lashes and enhances the outer lashes.  </li>
            <li> really makes your natural lashes look nice</li>
            <li> Not at all worth the money.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure I got screwed, that&#x27;ll teach me to take the easy route &amp; order online instead of going to the actual store.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you take it off before you go to bed because your eyelids may stick together because it stays strong for so long.</li>
            <li> I shamelessly trounce right up and ask what they use.</li>
            <li> The outcome is dramatic, bombshell like lashes that are awesome but require 3 coats and about 10 minutes of work.</li>
            <li> Not as happy with this product as I usually am.</li>
            <li> But it does make my eyelashes REALLY long when put on clean lashes :)</li>
            <li> Gives nice long lashes too!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a shame, because this really is good mascara, especially if you&#x27;re trying to boost nearly invisible lashes or want to get the job done in</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and comes off fairly easy with a mild facial cleanser when being removed.</li>
            <li> and I could honestly say that any man who is looking for a gift or even you ladies looking for a purchase this is something that stands out above the rest miles or even mountain high.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark which is good, but it didn&#x27;t lengthen my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> This seller wasn&#x27;t very helpful!</li>
            <li> My doctor wears this mascara, and her eyelashes look great, but I suspect she has long eyelashes, and only needs to color them.  </li>
            <li> Pretty lashes, makes them look longer and thicker, without appearing cakey</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST RETURN  ITEM.</li>
            <li> First, the stuff that&#x27;s great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And then I will wake up the next morning with *more* eye makeup, making me look like someone punched me in both</li>
            <li> This does exactly that.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> If it was only more durable I would use it all the time.</li>
            <li> the rigid wand works better for me vs the flexible regular sized one.</li>
            <li> which personally I think is better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth the price and last two months or more depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought a beauty product based solely on an internet article.  </li>
            <li> First off, I have medium-length medium-thickness eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have short lashes, I can&#x27;t say that product made my eyes look &amp;#34;false&amp;#34; but 70% better.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this Mascara since it was first released.</li>
            <li> more people have remarked on my eyelashes than my last mascara..</li>
            <li> it takes a while to put the product on exactly how I want it</li>
            <li> First thing out of the tube?  </li>
            <li> This is a knock off product, Save your $$ and go to Sephora and get the real thing there!  </li>
            <li> My advice is to try it, but get it from a real store!</li>
            <li> I loved this product made my lashes long and lush.</li>
            <li> It is actually worth it to me to wear two mascaras because the combination gives me better lashes than any single mascara I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> Very fanned out if you get it right.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty much all.</li>
            <li> I get asked if I&#x27;m wearing a strip pretty often when I do my duo haha</li>
            <li> lashes stiff&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to remove&lt;br /&gt;Can leave lashes spikey instead of full and soft looking</li>
            <li> It totally lengthens my lashes and washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Easy to open.  </li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever bought makes ur lashes look long and full and if it gets wet it doesn&#x27;t run down ur face</li>
            <li> really well done lashes</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real line... even with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if the bottom layer does nothing to lengthen lashes, just get one that separates your lashes really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long-lasting and it survives things like tears and watery eyes from allergy season&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it literally costs about 5 times as much.</li>
            <li> I really do like this mascara.</li>
            <li> It really does make it look as if I am wearing falsies.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and both of my jobs are strenuous jobs that require a lot of lifting and moving around</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> It really does work and my lashes are much longer and fuller when I use it.</li>
            <li> but you do really need to have a cotton ball &amp; eye makeup remover to get all of it off.  </li>
            <li> I am very picky about my mascara applicator brushes and this one fits my standards.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real.  </li>
            <li> am throwing nearly a whole tube of mascara away.</li>
            <li> I bought it on ebay much cheaper than here.</li>
            <li> Use this mascara every  day and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks to</li>
            <li> This is not the real Benefit mascara.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real Mascara.</li>
            <li> This product is a stingy, gooey formula that is not anything like the real formula.</li>
            <li> I tend to just want mascara on a regular basis, and this looks fantastic without anything else.</li>
            <li> I tend to just want mascara on a regular basis, and this looks fantastic without anything else.</li>
            <li> i really regret buying it</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real layered over 2 coats of Badgal Lash.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting her to like it as much as she did.</li>
            <li> I have a real bottle from Sephora and compared the two.</li>
            <li> I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and will never wear anything else again.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the cruelty-free ingredients</li>
            <li> You can really separate your lashes with the tip.  </li>
            <li> My problem is my eyes feel very irritated by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I have very small/thin lashes</li>
            <li> but nope they are real all yours.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look so much longer</li>
            <li> It really makes your lashes look 2x longer and thicker</li>
            <li> I finally had to apply a warm wash cloth and allow it to set on my eyes for several minutes to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great Mascara to lengthen lashes without having to wear false lashes.</li>
            <li> This is not a brush on and head out the door product for me, its a product for if I ever have an hour to get ready to leave and plenty of time to fix any problems kind of thing, because somehow I&#x27;ve had no trouble applying other mascaras</li>
            <li> It is better at lengthening and volumizing than other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> The look and wear of the product I received is not the same as the original.  </li>
            <li> As aforementioned, my eyelashes are long and can actually get tangled on the ends because they curl upwards (lol)</li>
            <li> As aforementioned, my eyelashes are long and can actually get tangled on the ends because they curl upwards (lol)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a shame, because this really is good mascara, especially if you&#x27;re trying to boost nearly invisible lashes or want to get the job done in just a few quick coats.</li>
            <li> No where near as good as my usual L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous</li>
            <li> It makes me lashes look long and huge and curly.</li>
            <li> By using the ball tip applicator, you can reach every last for a full, fanned out look.</li>
            <li> is different than the full size, btw: it&#x27;s shorter, its bristles are farther apart, and from the tubes I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> The older I get, I find it&#x27;s not enough to just use eyeliner because my eyelashes aren&#x27;t as full as they used to be  </li>
            <li> I prefer hard short bristles on my mascara brush so this was a great purchase for that.</li>
            <li> On the authentic bottle its not bold.</li>
            <li> Cover Girl is better and a lot less $.</li>
            <li> This particular tube made my eyes super irritated and red???</li>
            <li> More than once have I had to clean off a long black line from my face because it dripped on me as I brought the brush to my eye.</li>
            <li> Wow, this was more than I would usually pay for mascara, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re all about simplicity and layering mascaras sounds high maintenance, pass on this mascara.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Can be tough to take off but doesn&#x27;t bother me if you use good makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy this again after exploring a few more brands trying to find something a little more similar to Fresh</li>
            <li> so much I was fully surprised by it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, but difficult to remove</li>
            <li> The applicator is quite good as long as you are careful (you might get a bit of mascara on your skin if you&#x27;re not careful, so have a makeup remover pen or one of those plastic mascara guides</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes full and long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this happen with this brand that I can normally rely on.</li>
            <li> When I use it, my lashes are full and long</li>
            <li> Andries lashes look long and full.</li>
            <li> lashed look full and long.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra money to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I did not see a difference from my normal mascara</li>
            <li> Makes the lashes long and full.</li>
            <li> I suggest using the trick of running it under hot water to loosen the mascara and then letting it cool down</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, so if you want several layers for a more dramatic look, you have to move quickly to avoid clumping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have super long lashes, and this mascara goes on effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Other than that this mascara is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I went into Sephora to buy a new tube yesterday.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my new fave.</li>
            <li> Now, at 25, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot live without this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tough to remove, and I lose a few lashes, but my lashes never looked more dense once I put on 2 coats or more!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be more careful about which sellers I choose in the future....</li>
            <li> They look very natural though.</li>
            <li> (This is not usually a problem I have</li>
            <li> Why do i need to build lush lashes in 2 steps, especially when i have spent 10-15 strokes already trying to get some payoff, and THEN i need to hold the wand vertically and add more globs to build body + volume?</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I gave it five stars because regardless of almost inconsequential cons, this is the only mascara I have used so consistently.</li>
            <li> I gave it five stars because regardless of almost inconsequential cons, this is the only mascara I have used so consistently.</li>
            <li> I bought it 3 times so far!  </li>
            <li> I bought this directly from Ulta, so I can not give you any assurance that what you get here is real or fake, but as for the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; stuff, it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly it was a small gift for her because she had recently passed her college exams</li>
            <li> companies in china counterfeit a lot of benefit items, you&#x27;re better off paying full price on this one unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It made a huge mess all over my eyelids and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> But after she actually used it she was in love with the jet black color and the fullness of your lashes it brings out her eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting compliments left and right on how long my eyelashes are and if they are real</li>
            <li> Was not happy with the fact that this mascara came in a bag and no box, if you read the details it said it came in the original box, makes me think the stuff they wrote isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> I found this mascara to be super clumpy, and it&#x27;s so thick, that I can&#x27;t brush through my lashes to separate them, even right after I apply the mascara.  </li>
            <li> I continue to search for a mascara that makes my eyelashes pop &amp; after reading other reviews, this looked to have strong potential.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are pretty long naturally, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t necessarly makes them longer, but emphasizes them.</li>
            <li> It does clump so you have to use a lash comb to clear the clumps</li>
            <li> I purchased one tube directly from Benefit&#x27;s site, one from inside Sephora, and one from a seller on Amazon, and my experience was similar to others on here: the mascara in the tube I bought from Amazon was really stringy, and I wound up getting it all over my hands &amp; clothes</li>
            <li> Too much liquid and not enough drama.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got the same brush and doesn&#x27;t require as much work or coats.</li>
            <li> So you may want to avoid this if you have particularly sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I feel like it was an old product.  </li>
            <li> This mascara, lengthens, thickens, and dries soft.</li>
            <li> I must have received an old one.</li>
            <li> Covers well and creates lush lashes.</li>
            <li> In fact, run far, far away.</li>
            <li> The sample was drier and the regular size was very liquidey.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> They look natural, not like spiders.</li>
            <li> as far as skin and hair follicles.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a knock off, or old as others have suggested.  </li>
            <li> - The bottle is a different shade than the real version.  </li>
            <li> I was asked twice the same day if my lashes were real.</li>
            <li> This product is old and stringy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to skip the primer step and get away with doing only one or two coats---major bonus if you&#x27;re impatient like me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stringy like glue consistency, feels weird, doesn&#x27;t look good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway: the good: the nylon brush has extra bristles at the tip, so I can turn the wand enough to grab the tiny little end lashes that I normally can&#x27;t coat without overdoing the middle lashes &amp; causing clumping.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, dark black color</li>
            <li> Sure the brush is the same but man, is it a mess!  </li>
            <li> After reading such glowing reviews and seeing so many &amp;#34;beauty gurus&amp;#34; on YouTube raving about this mascara, I finally broke down and decided to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really makes your lashes look long and lush.  </li>
            <li> The only con is the price, but I am honestly willing to pay it since it&#x27;s the only mascara that seems to work for me!</li>
            <li> Despite some of the other reviews, I like this product and it works better than any  other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If I take time to let it dry between coats, it doesn&#x27;t clump or run, and if I add more than 2 coats, it can take a little work to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Really works and makes your lashes long.</li>
            <li> Everytime I see a new commercial I go buy it.</li>
            <li> This looked really gross on with only one coat, it was flaking and smearing everywhere and looked very clumpy.</li>
            <li> just a few quick coats.(I wouldn&#x27;t give up, though.</li>
            <li> It is hard to wash off, but that is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> Previously I&#x27;d used multiple two-step primer+mascara products (mostly L&#x27;Oreal), tried every drugstore brand, and spent an embarrassing amount on a tube of Dior (that worked just as well as L&#x27;Oreal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a real mess</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but it really does make a significant difference!</li>
            <li> The last one I got was clearly a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They can look spidery if not careful.</li>
            <li> I actually threw the product away because it must of been old.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s kind of difficult to remove even with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews, mine looked like They&#x27;re Real</li>
            <li> Basically, my eyelashes are your average eyelashes, except for the fact that they grow downwards but have just enough curl, so that the tips and the roots are even, and the middle dips downward (basically like a smile).</li>
            <li> Only draw back was product dried out quick.</li>
            <li> gets them super long and not to heavy.</li>
            <li> I read all these great reviews but am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I also have worn this the whole (Texas) winter (75-80° on average), and I get NO SMUDGES</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it makes my lashes look long or lush.  </li>
            <li> If you used fresh in the past this is a fab replacement.</li>
            <li> Falsies have a thick, full appearance and this doesn&#x27;t give that effect.</li>
            <li> I wore product 12 hours, I did have some mild&amp;#34;flaking&amp;#34; after 6 hours but much less than other products, also had mild discoloration beneath my eyes when my eyes watered from peeling onions.</li>
            <li> , I am pretty sure it is the thing that has been irritating my eyes lately.  </li>
            <li> I can tell because the bristles on the FAKE tube are much shorter, the bottle is a bit wider, and the word \\&quot;Mascara\\&quot; towards the end of the bottle is in a bold font.</li>
            <li> first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that the brush doesnt \\&quot;grab\\&quot; onto the lashes--it just glides through with zero friction, so there&#x27;s very little mascara deposit onto the lash.</li>
            <li> I will do this the next time because the product is not cheap but well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> , it goes on smooth and makes your lashes look thick, I already have pretty thick, long lashes</li>
            <li> It took mine about a week to get to a good consistency (not too clumpy, or thick, or thin), so just be patient, and you will reap vast rewards!!!</li>
            <li> When I do that, I get a thick full set of lashes that looks almost fake, AND because the bottom layer is a different mascara, it&#x27;s easy to remove with face wash or makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Benefit &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real!&amp;#34; mascara for a few years now, but this particular tube is not like the rest.</li>
            <li> came w/o a box or sealed cap... not sure its the real stuff.</li>
            <li> the only problem,  and its minor</li>
            <li> But for the last week or so I have noticed my lashes are not fanned out and as long as they used to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful or burning, just irritating.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a Maybelline junkie; I have several empty tubes of various Lash Blast/Cat Eye Maybelline mascaras.</li>
            <li> Ok, so first of all it&#x27;s awful that amazon is clearly allowing sellers to sell ancient batches of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The too-thin formula and too-defining brush merely color the lashes black--- which is great for Western folks who just want to \\&quot;enhance\\&quot; their already-lush eyelashes--- but not for Asians who need serious volume and payoff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I am sure this is a fake \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s most likely a fake!</li>
            <li> I like that this mascara stays all day long and my lashes look really long.</li>
            <li> I like mascaras that make my lashes so long they touch the bottom of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My lashes are separated and long.</li>
            <li> I chose this mascara because of all the rave reviews I had been hearing for so long.</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes look really long</li>
            <li> Strange..</li>
            <li> Something in the formula makes the eyelashes look so long and dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyelashes tended to fall out with drug store brands, and I would have a lot of irritation in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-Naturally long lashes but not the thickness that I want.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes, mine are long, but not as long as this mascara makes it.</li>
            <li> A long, string of goo.  </li>
            <li> Could be because the lashes are so long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this mascara for years and this one has a strange smell and looks used.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews say it is pretty hard to get off at the end of the evening..</li>
            <li> but it dried out super fast!!! :-(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too clumpy and takes too long to dry.</li>
            <li> : in my experience, and from reading other reviews, I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re getting the real &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; product from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does make your eyelashes look really long!</li>
            <li> Unable to remove like the original mascara.</li>
            <li> Made my skimpy lashes long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this mascara for a very long time now.</li>
            <li> It does not have bristles that are very long</li>
            <li> It take very long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this tube was just old or defective.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s old or what,</li>
            <li> However, the formula is so wet that I have long globs of mascara hanging off my brush every time I take it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look full and fake.</li>
            <li> This one had such a different consistency and it is just so clumpy--not what it is usually like at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deep black.</li>
            <li> The applicator was different from my previous tube, which I still had to make comparisons.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side, but if you&#x27;re looking for a mascara that curls, separates and makes your eyelashes beautifully long, this mascara is worth the 23 dollars</li>
            <li> I actually get asked all the time if my eyelashes are actually that long and thick.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real, for once I have some thick looking lashes!</li>
            <li> I do like the mascara but not the brush which seems very rough and rigid with no flexibility but no wow factor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NOW, the pros, aka why you should just buy this if you have even a tiny little doubt.</li>
            <li> Can get expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> You can get a sample size of this for $10 if you are curious.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> If you have short, sparse, Asian-type lashes and need volume, this is a waste of your hard-earned cash.</li>
            <li> After carefully applying the mascara</li>
            <li> I have really short, sparse lashes, but am really impatient when it comes to makeup, so I am always looking for a faster, easier way to add volume &amp; length.</li>
            <li> It was sticky and stringy instead of just wet</li>
            <li> I have gone through roughly 3 or 4 tubes.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t understand makeup as well as I do now, and hadn&#x27;t tested a wide variety of brands.</li>
            <li> Mascara has a shelf life of about three months, and after the two month period, it&#x27;s harder to get mascara out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am going to go ahead and get the larger version since I wear mascara everyday.</li>
            <li> Goopy and gooie like wet tar.  </li>
            <li> This is the absolute worse mascara in the world.  </li>
            <li> It had some dried mascara on the outside.</li>
            <li> a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> If careful how you use it it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I saw my doctor&#x27;s receptionist who ordinarily does not wear makeup with long lashes and asked her if she was using a product to grow long lashes.  </li>
            <li> it layers over any other mascara I have on to add length.</li>
            <li> Once that has dried, you can layer this over it and you&#x27;ll have tons of separated long lashes.</li>
            <li> The tube was just thrown in the package alone with some other items I ordered.</li>
            <li> But I only by this small travel size</li>
            <li> This is nothing compared to Loreal or any other brand close to it.</li>
            <li> It had the wrong consistency, and it smelled funny.</li>
            <li> so the effect is pretty close to wearing falsies without looking fake.</li>
            <li> and my friend was in the &amp;#34;beauty chair&amp;#34; the other sales girl talked me into getting my makeup done too.  </li>
            <li> It seriously makes your lashes look extra long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is that this mascara doesn&#x27;t flake but the bad thing is it makes your lashes look thin.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;d been one of my old $4 tubes from Maybelline, I would&#x27;ve pitched it, but instead I spent a week fighting the gluey stuff and invariably wound up looking like Tammy Faye, or a 5-year-old who&#x27;d just discovered Mommy&#x27;s makeup).</li>

            <li> I usually buy directly from Sephora, but the product I received from Amazon must have been old or fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m probably just going to use this occasionally when I want a long-lasting and dramatic effect instead of using this daily (when it&#x27;s not worth the hassle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably just going to use this occasionally when I want a long-lasting and dramatic effect instead of using this daily (when it&#x27;s not worth the hassle).</li>
            <li> make it even more difficult to apply it without major smudges, especially on thin, short lashes.</li>
            <li> They really do look fake</li>
            <li> Benefit&#x27;s mascara changed the whole game!</li>
            <li> it ruins the curl on my lashes.</li>
            <li> The brush helps catch the small inner lashes and the few outer lashes which help make</li>
            <li> I have thin and short lashes, but after 2 coats of this mascara I have the long jet-black lashes I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> average</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not worth the money</li>
            <li> It also can have the consistency of molasses to me, so I have to be careful not to use to much or at least let the product dry on my lashes in between uses.</li>
            <li> No need to worry about pieces streaming down your face</li>
            <li> Money down the drain....</li>
            <li> I think this mascara was water down.</li>
            <li> but this is hands down one of the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is hands down one of the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figure if there is black on the wipe, the makeup is removed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have the same problems using this remover (which is a white cream instead of a liquid) as I do with the Clinique makeup remover -- it&#x27;s not 100%</li>
            <li> , black pigment</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t run off in rivulets of black and stain your eyes/face.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave black smudges when my eyelashes hit beneath my eyebrows, or smudge on the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> it gives my eyelashes a lift and slight curl, doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and lasts, however...</li>
            <li> Coming in a container that was slightly different than the authentic brand and the mascara itself was awful.  </li>
            <li> Previously used cover girl lash blast.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to order this product due to all of the negative reviews saying that it might be a fake, but it is EXACTLY like my sample size that I received from Ulta.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a random from an old batch (and nothing can be done other than pitching it)</li>
            <li> the tip of the brush also has little brush ends on it, making application in the corners of the lashes easier and thorough without a mess.</li>
            <li> Not worth it !</li>
            <li> it comes off in little flakes of plastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of mascaras over the years, and this product, while a little pricey, is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky to remove.</li>
            <li> All mascara is going to give you a little clump over time (or a lot depending on brand)</li>
            <li> All mascara is going to give you a little clump over time (or a lot depending on brand)</li>
            <li> Still a little clumpy on my lashes.</li>
            <li> The little round pokes at the end of the brush</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> My lashes are short and thin, and this product was recommended immediately when I asked at an Ulta store.  </li>
            <li> Makes my eyes itch, waste of $</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li> Clumpy and heavy mascara.</li>
            <li> but I did not know what I was missing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy and not accurate.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again or recommend it to anyone unless you have a lot of time on your hands to waste doing your lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few days but was done with it.</li>
            <li> Clumpy and seems dried up.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> However, this one took a few months to ship because it was shipped from China.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the mascara is gooey not smooth  -</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes clump together and look heavy.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this actually looks like false lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable to much less expensive drugstore brands and not worth the extra money.</li>

            <li> Instead they&#x27;re shorter, clumpy, and stiff.</li>
            <li> I actually work for benefit and occasionally when opening new testers I will find a goopy, stringy awful TR</li>
            <li> little tip on brush to get close to small lashes</li>
            <li> This CLUMPSSSS like crazy and goes on very veryyyyy thick making your eyelashes feel heavy like you have falsies on, but without the additional volume.</li>
            <li> Also, in the past I&#x27;ve dealt with mascara that is so heavy</li>
            <li> Worst part about this product is I started losing eyelashes right in the middle of both eyes after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the thin formula characteristic, Benefit realized this and marketed the ball-like tip of the wand as the volume depositor.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I love all of benefits cosmetics.</li>
            <li> It did very little to lengthen or thicken.  </li>
            <li> It coats heavily, yet it took the curl out of my lashes after applying it &amp; didn&#x27;t distribute evenly, no matter how hard I tried.</li>
            <li> Dried out!</li>
            <li> but the quality is not what it usually is.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this mascara, small flakes get into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;4)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what everyone else is complaining about, I&#x27;ve never had issues with this mascara being &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> It is a waste of your money!</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from the store though and thought I&#x27;d buy it from amazon this time.</li>
            <li> I found this mascara to be very messy to apply to my lashes.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to remember when you are so used to dipping and applying immediately.</li>
            <li> This can be hard to remove, though, so</li>
            <li> And it is hard to get off.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Smudges easily, hard to take off.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that some of the vendors are selling knockoff or expired product, but it&#x27;s hard to tell which ones.</li>
            <li> I suspect that some of the vendors are selling knockoff or expired product, but it&#x27;s hard to tell which ones.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the common element.  </li>
            <li> (Sephora and Ulta are at least $10 cheaper).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought every mascara known to women at least 3 times (because I couldn&#x27;t remember if I had tried  it before).  </li>
            <li> tried this mascara when I was younger, like several years ago, and hated it.</li>
            <li> Next, I&#x27;m learning how to apply false eyelashes which takes frustrating patience to learn!</li>
            <li> Step 3, I start at the base of the lashes (horizontally) and wiggle the wand, and sweep up in one fast stroke.</li>
            <li> No more false lashes to glue on, no more eyelash curler, and multitudes of compliments!</li>
            <li> ( I AM VERY LAZY PERSON</li>
            <li> It is definitely a dramatic mascara and makes lashes look thick and black just like false lashes.</li>
            <li> seriously it works wonders.</li>
            <li> This mascara worn by itself is next to impossible to remove, just like the gel liner from the</li>
            <li> It makes applying it a serious chore &amp; it gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase it Sephora when I run out, however, I have been working a lot and have been unable to go to the mall.</li>
            <li> Some mascaras look ridiculous if you don&#x27;t go all out with eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Some mascaras look ridiculous if you don&#x27;t go all out with eye makeup.</li>
            <li> the mascara itself is a little difficult to remove with just water and/or soap and water --</li>
            <li> It seems extremely unsanitary and dangerous.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it&#x27;s very hard to take off which can be a plus.</li>
            <li> spite of the fact that it&#x27;s not waterproof and will leak if you get it wet, it is almost impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> I have thin lashes and this mascara makes them longer and thicker without clumps.</li>
            <li> Not happy about my purchase.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on my thin lashes.</li>
            <li> Thought it was overpriced and not great.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve found Biore cleansing cloths work the fastest without irritating my eyes.)</li>
            <li> Every time I wear it people ask me am I wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I use to wear false eyelashes, but not anymore, I just use my Benefit</li>
            <li> The formula is very thin, which makes it hard to build up volume and length.  </li>
            <li> Every single time it happened :(</li>
            <li> This mascara has some serious lengthening and volumizing power!  </li>
            <li> I do this about 4-5 times, not waiting to dry, all that crap.</li>
            <li> I bought the regular sized mascara and hated it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to do your lower lashes and almost impossible to get in the corners.</li>
            <li> Think of everything you would NOT want in a mascara, like it&#x27;s difficult to apply, won&#x27;t adhear to lashes, won&#x27;t wash off even with remover, tacky feeling, clumpy out of tube, clumps lashes together, the list goes on.</li>
            <li> It was also difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> It looks identical to the fake pictured in the website below.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird purple gray metallic.  </li>
            <li> FAKE AND USED ONE AND WITHOUT BOX AND SO EXPENSIVE THAN OTHERS</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this mascara at all.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Got a fake.</li>
            <li> FOR THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY I WAS NOT IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to get off</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird too,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Could this possibly be fake?  </li>
            <li> I was shipped a fake bottle.</li>
            <li> Mine is never flaky or clumpy or a weird consistency.</li>
            <li> Well, needless to say, I walked out of the Benefit Counter spending almost $100</li>
            <li> whatever i got was definitely fake.</li>
            <li> It makes them look fake</li>
            <li> Clumpy and difficult to put on evenly.</li>
            <li> I am very frustrated I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m honestly really afraid to use a product that was not sealed.</li>
            <li> It makes your eyes POP like crazy.</li>
            <li> I decided to order it off amazon because I have prime and needed some desperately.</li>
            <li> (I mean, if you want to slather it on like peanut butter, yeah, you&#x27;re gonna look like ya got something crawlin on your eyeball!!!), but unless you are TRYING to look like Cruella DeVil, your gonna like the non-clumpiness and curl it gives you.</li>
            <li> I discovered www.youniqueproducts.com/lashedout and became obsessed!</li>
            <li> The one I purchased from Amazon is FAKE!</li>
            <li> After years of being unable to tolerate mascara, this is a godsend!</li>
            <li> I started using this, friends asked me if I was using Latise (rx eyelash grower) or had fake eyelashes on!</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is awful, sticky, messy!</li>
            <li> I have gotten asked if I am wearing fake eyelashes, however, this mascara is extremely difficult to get off!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very expensive.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very difficult to remove, and it takes my eyelashes with it when it does come off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very difficult to remove</li>
            <li> Very expensive</li>
            <li> , it is nearly impossible to get off.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad batch, as it was so stringy</li>
            <li> I think I was just sold a bad product.    </li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> I have never been so frustrated with a mascara before.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed...</li>
            <li> but I was equally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the results based on the cost.  </li>
            <li> i bought this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> That tip is annoying, I can&#x27;t get into the corners of my eyes with it, and there is zero thickening or lengthening going on.  </li>
            <li> and I hate clumps</li>
            <li> The trick to this mascara is start at the base of your eyelash in the inside of your eye and work to outer lashes.</li>
            <li> Wiggle the brush from base to tip.</li>
            <li> Which is IMPOSSIBLE!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the misrepresentation of this product.  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in what I received.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and hate it!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE mascara person. Everytime I see a new commercial I go buy it. Everytime I see someone walking around with really well done lashes I shamelessly trounce right up and ask what they use. So when Amazon says it&#x27;s thinks I might this, well, obviously I couldn&#x27;t say no.... Man do I wish I had. I&#x27;ve bought well over a thousand mascaras in my life and I can truly say I&#x27;ve bought ones for $0.98 from walmart that work better then this. Think of everything you would NOT want in a mascara, like it&#x27;s difficult to apply, won&#x27;t adhear to lashes, won&#x27;t wash off even with remover, tacky feeling, clumpy out of tube, clumps lashes together, the list goes on. I can easily give you a list of reasons this mascara doesn&#x27;t cut it, what I can&#x27;t give you is even one genuine good quality. Truly. Not one. Please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Dried out! Can&#x27;t tell if its worth the hype! This seller wasn&#x27;t very helpful!</li>
            <li> Too much liquid and not enough drama. I discovered www.youniqueproducts.com/lashedout and became obsessed!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, and honey, I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara but quickly dries out faster than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used. I have to lube it up with contact solution after a weeks use!. It&#x27;s also very expensive. I buy this on a rare occasion.</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes and this mascara makes them longer and thicker without clumps. It also stays on through workouts, swimming, etc. definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> After requiring the services of an ophthalmologist twice in 6 months to remove  fibers from another \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; mascara that got embedded under my upper eyelid, I gave up on having nice looking lashes.  My lashes are short and thin, and this product was recommended immediately when I asked at an Ulta store.  It is amazing.  It never runs, and fills out and lengthens lashes. It doesn&#x27;t blob and is easy to apply.  It is hard to wash off, but that is fine with me.  I&#x27;m almost through one tube, I wear it daily, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it at all.  My lashes look lovely and really define my eyes.  Thank you, Benefit!</li>
            <li> My doctor wears this mascara, and her eyelashes look great, but I suspect she has long eyelashes, and only needs to color them.  I found this mascara to be super clumpy, and it&#x27;s so thick, that I can&#x27;t brush through my lashes to separate them, even right after I apply the mascara.  Also, it&#x27;s very difficult to remove, and it takes my eyelashes with it when it does come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the drug store</li>
            <li> I like that this mascara stays all day long and my lashes look really long. I do not have a problem removing it.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara after reading a review.  I really don&#x27;t like it.  Most drug store brands are better.  The mascara is clumpy and the brush does nothing to help.  It did very little to lengthen or thicken.  It was also difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I love it ! My eyelashes are pretty long naturally, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t necessarly makes them longer, but emphasizes them. I have found it !</li>
            <li> I continue to search for a mascara that makes my eyelashes pop &amp; after reading other reviews, this looked to have strong potential. Maybe it&#x27;s my eyelashes or maybe I&#x27;m not applying it properly, but this isn&#x27;t it. It coats heavily, yet it took the curl out of my lashes after applying it &amp; didn&#x27;t distribute evenly, no matter how hard I tried.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes itch, waste of $</li>
            <li> Got this deluxe sample as an impulse buy at sephora. It&#x27;s ok. The outcome is dramatic, bombshell like lashes that are awesome but require 3 coats and about 10 minutes of work. They can look spidery if not careful. Very fanned out if you get it right. The mascara came off just fine with my Clinique eye remover solvent and warm water. The ball tip on the brush is cool, but I would rather use IT hello lashes. It&#x27;s got the same brush and doesn&#x27;t require as much work or coats.</li>
            <li> Love it, planning to order another one soon.Love this mascara, recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> What a terrific product.  My new favorite.</li>
            <li> Best mascara. This mascara makes my lashes fuller, longer and darker. Stays on all day and it&#x27;s waterproof even though it doesn&#x27;t say it is. Gives my lashes the volume they need. The price is a great value for an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara.  Doesn&#x27;t clump, makes lashes look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like the one I got at saphora</li>
            <li> Best mascara on the market today!</li>
            <li> best mascara ever! it looks like you put inserts in</li>
            <li> Best. Mascara. Ever. seriously it works wonders. gets them super long and not to heavy. doesn&#x27;t clump either.</li>
            <li> I love the Mascara, it lengthens the lashes quite nicely........the only problem,  and its minor, I have to use makeup remover to get it off or your piling it on and a shower won&#x27;t take it off.............I will buy again any way, because its good and I like it........little tip on brush to get close to small lashes.....love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, but I wish the price was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years. Thus arrived from China and is counterfeit! It looks identical to the fake pictured in the website below. It&#x27;s a weird purple gray metallic.  I am very disappointed in the misrepresentation of this product.  http://www.stephaniebrink.me/2013/12/15/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-a-real-and-fake-benefit-theyre-real-mascara/</li>
            <li> Pretty lashes, makes them look longer and thicker, without appearing cakey</li>
            <li> My friends are torn on liking this, but I have remained a fan for one reason- it layers over any other mascara I have on to add length. This mascara worn by itself is next to impossible to remove, just like the gel liner from the They&#x27;re Real line... even with makeup remover. Also, when worn alone, it clumps my lashes. What I have found works great is first applying a mascara that separates lashes well. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the bottom layer does nothing to lengthen lashes, just get one that separates your lashes really well. Once that has dried, you can layer this over it and you&#x27;ll have tons of separated long lashes. You can wait for this to dry and add more layers for even more length. When I do that, I get a thick full set of lashes that looks almost fake, AND because the bottom layer is a different mascara, it&#x27;s easy to remove with face wash or makeup remover. It is actually worth it to me to wear two mascaras because the combination gives me better lashes than any single mascara I&#x27;ve ever found. But if you&#x27;re all about simplicity and layering mascaras sounds high maintenance, pass on this mascara.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge.  It totally lengthens my lashes and washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> FAKE AND USED ONE AND WITHOUT BOX AND SO EXPENSIVE THAN OTHERS SO RETURNED. THIS WAS MY FIRST RETURN  ITEM. ( I AM VERY LAZY PERSON BUT SO UPSET)</li>
            <li> I have read so many reviews saying that this mascara makes their lashes look amazing, but I&#x27;ve had a different experience. I found it to not make my lashes look very good at all. I do like the mascara wand. It does grab the smaller lashes, and my lashes get separated easier, but length and volume, I&#x27;ve seen no change. I&#x27;ll continue to use it when I&#x27;m in a pinch, but I honestly prefer my L&#x27;oreal Voluminous mascara. It makes my lashes look great.</li>
            <li> I loved this product made my lashes long and lush. Only draw back was product dried out quick. I was told to add a couple of drops of visine to the product. I will do this the next time because the product is not cheap but well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I am sure this is a fake \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; product. I prefer hard short bristles on my mascara brush so this was a great purchase for that. However, the formula is so wet that I have long globs of mascara hanging off my brush every time I take it out of the tube. It is simple to wipe the tip before I use it but it&#x27;s hard to remember when you are so used to dipping and applying immediately. More than once have I had to clean off a long black line from my face because it dripped on me as I brought the brush to my eye.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that this mascara doesn&#x27;t flake but the bad thing is it makes your lashes look thin. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have a love-hate relationship with this stuff.  First, the stuff that&#x27;s great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It&#x27;s very long-lasting and it survives things like tears and watery eyes from allergy season&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) It is better at lengthening and volumizing than other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) It is a nice, dark black color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The applicator is quite good as long as you are careful (you might get a bit of mascara on your skin if you&#x27;re not careful, so have a makeup remover pen or one of those plastic mascara guides handy if you&#x27;re unsure of yourself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it is nearly impossible to get off.  I can remove some with a makeup remover wipe.  I figure if there is black on the wipe, the makeup is removed.  Not so.  If I wash my face or take a shower afterwards, I will find myself with a lot of mascara on my upper and lower lids.  I will go over that with eye makeup remover on a Q-tip (Clinique &amp;#34;Take the Day Off&amp;#34; is good).  I will go on about my evening.  And then I will wake up the next morning with *more* eye makeup, making me look like someone punched me in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there is a separate remover sold by Benefit, just for this product and the associated eyeliner, and I have a sample of this special remover.  Unfortunately, I have the same problems using this remover (which is a white cream instead of a liquid) as I do with the Clinique makeup remover -- it&#x27;s not 100% effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am pretty sure it is the thing that has been irritating my eyes lately.  I wear daily disposable contact lenses so it is not anything in my contact lens solution and I have experienced the same irritation when using 3 or 4 separate eye creams.  This mascara is the common element.  It&#x27;s not painful or burning, just irritating.  Makes me have to use eye drops somewhat more often.  So you may want to avoid this if you have particularly sensitive eyes.  (This is not usually a problem I have so it took me awhile to identify the culprit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably just going to use this occasionally when I want a long-lasting and dramatic effect instead of using this daily (when it&#x27;s not worth the hassle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably just going to use this occasionally when I want a long-lasting and dramatic effect instead of using this daily (when it&#x27;s not worth the hassle).</li>
            <li> Only used it twice...just arrived...on time.  So far I like it.</li>
            <li> This mascara clumped upon application.  I feel like it was an old product.  Not happy about my purchase.</li>
            <li> My friend who is a television personality recommended this product. No where near as good as my usual L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous and it literally costs about 5 times as much. Skip it.</li>
            <li> Effective for making my lashes more plush than ever</li>
            <li> I like mascaras that make my lashes so long they touch the bottom of my eyebrows. This does exactly that. This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump or give the the tarantula lashes. My lashes are separated and long. This can be hard to remove, though, so a good eye makeup remover is a must with this. But it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is not bad at all...except for the price. I have used many m ore affordable mascaras that held up longer than this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this mascara for a very long time now. This one had such a different consistency and it is just so clumpy--not what it is usually like at all. I don&#x27;t know what happened but the quality is not what it usually is.</li>
            <li> This mascara, lengthens, thickens, and dries soft. No need to worry about pieces streaming down your face but you better have some good make-up remover on hand to get all of the residue off!</li>
            <li> I love it. Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!  Makes my lashes full and long.</li>
            <li> I keep getting an email to rate this product and I deleted it the last 2 times because I don&#x27;t want to complain.  I actually threw the product away because it must of been old.  Normally, this mascara is wonderful.  Maybe I just got a bad batch, as it was so stringy I couldn&#x27;t even apply it.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mascara!!</li>
            <li> Benefit They&#x27;re Real Mascara is very good. And the color is fantastic. Loved it! is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I really do like this mascara. It lengthens my lashes and it goes on good.</li>
            <li> This mascara make my lashes so big and beautiful. It really does make it look as if I am wearing falsies. It makes me lashes look long and huge and curly. BUT it doesn&#x27;t stay on my lashes for more than 5 minutes. I have very oily skin and both of my jobs are strenuous jobs that require a lot of lifting and moving around so I sweat a lot especially in the summer time so I need a mascara that will stay on my face all day without smudging or coming off. I am very disappointed because I love all of benefits cosmetics. They have THE best blushes and cheek stains I have ever used and I had hoped this mascara would be just as amazing. If it was only more durable I would use it all the time. For the amount of money that this costs, the quality should be better.</li>
            <li> It really makes your lashes look long and lush.  It does clump so you have to use a lash comb to clear the clumps and it is over priced.</li>
            <li> After reading such glowing reviews and seeing so many &amp;#34;beauty gurus&amp;#34; on YouTube raving about this mascara, I finally broke down and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Though it does give some length, this mascara clumped when I applied a second coat.  Something my Stiletto mascara has never done. Also, for years I have used vitamin e oil to remove my eye makeup and it&#x27;s always worked great but with this stuff, the oil would not cut through it.  I finally had to apply a warm wash cloth and allow it to set on my eyes for several minutes to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; this stuff off.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara but it can be purchased cheaper in store</li>
            <li> ***2-14-15 UPDATE!!*** I went into Sephora to buy a new tube yesterday. When I got home to compared the two tubes. The one I purchased from Amazon is FAKE! I can tell because the bristles on the FAKE tube are much shorter, the bottle is a bit wider, and the word \\&quot;Mascara\\&quot; towards the end of the bottle is in a bold font. On the authentic bottle its not bold. Don&#x27;t waste your money! Just buy it from Sephora.    At first I LOVED it! I had never tried a mascara this amazing! I purchased it 3 weeks ago via Amazon. But for the last week or so I have noticed my lashes are not fanned out and as long as they used to be. Instead they&#x27;re shorter, clumpy, and stiff. Its almost as if I have used the entire tube. Which is IMPOSSIBLE! How could I use an entire tube of mascara within 2.5-3 weeks?? I&#x27;m not sure if this tube was just old or defective. But I am pretty sure this is not the fault of the formula. I think I was just sold a bad product.    *** I should also add that when I received it I noticed it did not come in a Benefit box. The tube was just thrown in the package alone with some other items I ordered. Perhaps someone used it? ***    The bottom line is that its worth it! But just take time and go to Sephora to buy it. Don&#x27;t buy it here! It&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied. This came without a box and I&#x27;m honestly really afraid to use a product that was not sealed. It seems extremely unsanitary and dangerous. This is mascara and any cosmetic should&#x27;ve sealed upon purchase to prove it wasn&#x27;t tampered with. I want my money back. Gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Benefit &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real!&amp;#34; mascara for a few years now, but this particular tube is not like the rest. It was an incredibly gloppy mess. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with this brand that I can normally rely on. It doesn&#x27;t seem like the same formula.</li>
            <li> It does everything I ever wanted a mascara to do. I love it! It finds all the eye lashes I didn&#x27;t even know I had!</li>
            <li> Always have been a Benefit fan. You get a lot for your money. And it actually does what they say. Go figure! Great price for a Great product. Go ahead plunge on yourself while on a budget.</li>
            <li> Love , love, love this mascara!  It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth the cost.  Enhances your lashes, doesn&#x27;t run and lasts all day.  Gives nice long lashes too! Great brush!!!  Have been using for over three years after an endless search for a great mascara!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed...</li>
            <li> The older I get, I find it&#x27;s not enough to just use eyeliner because my eyelashes aren&#x27;t as full as they used to be  This mascara gives the extra dimension needed, making my eyes look younger. Other than the formula, I believe the unique brush design is the reason for the successful application - the tip of the brush also has little brush ends on it, making application in the corners of the lashes easier and thorough without a mess. It does not take a lot of product at all. Next, I&#x27;m learning how to apply false eyelashes which takes frustrating patience to learn! But - I&#x27;ll use &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; to enhance it all.</li>
            <li> It does make your eyelashes look really long! I have gotten asked if I am wearing fake eyelashes, however, this mascara is extremely difficult to get off!! I have tried so many mascaras and baby wipes always does the trick. With this you better have a good makeup remover!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. They really do look fake it&#x27;s amazing. I would recommend 100x. It&#x27;s worth it and cheaper than buying it from sephora.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Maybelline junkie; I have several empty tubes of various Lash Blast/Cat Eye Maybelline mascaras. Benefit&#x27;s mascara changed the whole game! I was honestly amazed at how much this mascara transformed my normal length eyelashes and I fell in love. It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side, but if you&#x27;re looking for a mascara that curls, separates and makes your eyelashes beautifully long, this mascara is worth the 23 dollars it costs!&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely try to purchase this from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Fabulous mascara.  I would definitely recommend this product. Doesn&#x27;t flake or come off til u take it off. Worth the money</li>
            <li> I got the sample size in a kit and I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but I was just okay with the end result. This CLUMPSSSS like crazy and goes on very veryyyyy thick making your eyelashes feel heavy like you have falsies on, but without the additional volume. So it&#x27;s just okay at best</li>
            <li> I have been searching for years to find the ultimate in mascaras...and now I finally have! This product is PERFECTION! No more false lashes to glue on, no more eyelash curler, and multitudes of compliments! The brush is amazing and so easy to use to get the results I want. Thank you, Benefit!!!</li>
            <li> Great received this product right on time!!</li>
            <li> I chose this mascara because of all the rave reviews I had been hearing for so long. I was thrilled to finally get in the mail but I was equally disappointed. Like some of the other reviews, mine looked like They&#x27;re Real but the mascara was the weirdest consistency I have ever encountered. It was stringy (never seen that in a mascara before), clumped my lashes, gave no volume and dried really fast. Awful! I have never been so frustrated with a mascara before. The fact that I spent over $20 on this was even more frustrating. I must have received an old one.</li>
            <li> The best mascara on the market.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten some of the stringy sticky gooey nock off stuff.  I am not impressed with this mascara at all.  It clumps my lashes together, does not curl or length.  It actually stains my skin where lashes touch my eyelids or hands.  And it is hard to get off.&lt;br /&gt;How is Amazon, a trusted vender, selling such product???</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Clumpy and heavy mascara. Worst part about this product is I started losing eyelashes right in the middle of both eyes after a few weeks. Money down the drain....</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Benefit Mascara. It works wonders on my thin lashes. The price for two with shipping was cheaper than one container at Ulta! I scored big on this deal!</li>
            <li> Recommended by a NYC stylist. Great mascara.  Covers well and creates lush lashes. If you used fresh in the past this is a fab replacement.</li>
            <li> Got a fake. So gross, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS. I should have just got it at sephora. Not worth it !</li>
            <li> Great Mascara to lengthen lashes without having to wear false lashes. I wear this daily to make my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> After years of being unable to tolerate mascara, this is a godsend! I have no problems with itching or burning and glamourous lashes!</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best mascara I have ever used. I have always bought cheaper mascaras at drug stores and there were some that I liked but I did not know what I was missing. My mom had this mascara and told me to give it a try once when I was visiting her. I fell in LOVE! It makes your eyes POP like crazy. I always get compliments on my eyelashes when I wear this mascara. It does not smudge at all. I have gone swimming even with this on and no problems. This mascara is well worth the price and I will never buy another mascara.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Pretty good my cheap mascara works as well but this brush is better and easier to appy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this several times.  It really does work and my lashes are much longer and fuller when I use it.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever bought makes ur lashes look long and full and if it gets wet it doesn&#x27;t run down ur face it just clumps off so amazing</li>
            <li> None better!  This is the greatest product.  No clumping and longer lashes.</li>
            <li> Great mascara! But I only by this small travel size bc the rigid wand works better for me vs the flexible regular sized one.</li>
            <li> Loved it. This is definitely my new fave.</li>
            <li> Can get expensive but well worth it. (Sephora and Ulta are at least $10 cheaper). It stays on all day even during workouts and doesn&#x27;t smudge. It&#x27;s a deep black. Can be tough to take off but doesn&#x27;t bother me if you use good makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample with the Sephora birthday gift this year. I tried it for a couple of weeks before writing this review in order to be fair.&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Deep, black pigment&lt;br /&gt;nice wearing time - no flaking or smudging&lt;br /&gt;this mascara gives my lashes the most &amp;#34;fanned out&amp;#34; look of any brand I have tried, and the magic is in the brush. By using the ball tip applicator, you can reach every last for a full, fanned out look. That said, here are my cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves lashes stiff&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to remove&lt;br /&gt;Can leave lashes spikey instead of full and soft looking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, if you are looking for a lot of length and separation and a fanned out look, you might like this mascara. However, don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking this actually looks like false lashes. Falsies have a thick, full appearance and this doesn&#x27;t give that effect. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think this is as good as many L&#x27;Oreal mascaras on the market that cost a lot less. You can get a sample size of this for $10 if you are curious. On a side note, if you do like this mascara, I suspect most of the effect lies in the brush design. I will try using this brush with another mascara to see if I get the same effect, and I would encourage you to as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price on Amazon is $10 more than in Sephora and Ulta!</li>
            <li> This mascara has some serious lengthening and volumizing power!  I purchased mine from Ulta and Im on my third tube.  I love it soo much but you do really need to have a cotton ball &amp; eye makeup remover to get all of it off.  It doesn&#x27;t come off easily with water.  But it does make my eyelashes REALLY long when put on clean lashes :)</li>
            <li> FOR THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY I WAS NOT IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, Benefit has all the best mascaras!!!</li>
            <li> Looks good! Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I think this mascara was water down. Nothing like buying it from Sephora - I will always but from sephora! Never this buyer again!!</li>
            <li> If you have Asian lashes, this is NOT the mascara for you. In fact, run far, far away. The too-thin formula and too-defining brush merely color the lashes black--- which is great for Western folks who just want to \\&quot;enhance\\&quot; their already-lush eyelashes--- but not for Asians who need serious volume and payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that the brush doesnt \\&quot;grab\\&quot; onto the lashes--it just glides through with zero friction, so there&#x27;s very little mascara deposit onto the lash. The formula is very thin, which makes it hard to build up volume and length.  Me, i like to \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the brush \\&quot;Grabbing\\&quot; onto the lashes and lifting them up. this one feels like nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the thin formula characteristic, Benefit realized this and marketed the ball-like tip of the wand as the volume depositor. Just hold it vertically onto the ends, and dab onto the needed areas, they say, and you get more va-va-voom!  HA. HA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it just deposits globs of product that you then have to comb out to distribute.  it&#x27;s messy and not accurate. Why do i need to build lush lashes in 2 steps, especially when i have spent 10-15 strokes already trying to get some payoff, and THEN i need to hold the wand vertically and add more globs to build body + volume? that i then have to frantically comb thru to even out? Forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t get suckered in by the marketing and \\&quot;top selling\\&quot; status at Sephora. If you have short, sparse, Asian-type lashes and need volume, this is a waste of your hard-earned cash.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Ulta last year and LOVED it. Thought I&#x27;d save money and buy it through Amazon. Was very disappointed in what I received. It was nothing like the product I used last year. Same name, same packaging, vastly inferior product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras. When I use it, my lashes are full and long (what girl doesn&#x27;t want that?!) I am very picky about my mascara applicator brushes and this one fits my standards. It does not have bristles that are very long which personally I think is better. It stays on all day and comes off fairly easy with a mild facial cleanser when being removed. I would caution, however, that if you are going to buy this product, that you buy it in store or on Benefit&#x27;s website. I think it runs $28 at Sephora and Ulta, so you are paying quite a bit more money for this if you purchase it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Leaves lashes full and long&lt;br /&gt;2. Stays on all day&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. A bit pricey&lt;br /&gt;2. A bit difficult to get off</li>
            <li> I looked forward to gorgeous long eyelashes.  I found this mascara to be very messy to apply to my lashes.  And I was under the impression they wouldn&#x27;t clump up.  Wrong.  After carefully applying the mascara so it&#x27;s not a real mess, I have to take another brush and try to get the clumps out.  It takes me longer to do my eyelashes now than ever.  Once I go through the ritual of my lashes, they do look longer but still a lot of the lashes obviously stuck together.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again or recommend it to anyone unless you have a lot of time on your hands to waste doing your lashes.</li>
            <li> Loreal is cheaper and has better results!  I had to buy a primer to get this stuff to look ok.  That tip is annoying, I can&#x27;t get into the corners of my eyes with it, and there is zero thickening or lengthening going on.  It&#x27;s weird too, it&#x27;s like a layer of latex going on since when you rinse it off it comes off in little flakes of plastic.  That&#x27;s the only good thing, it doesn&#x27;t run off in rivulets of black and stain your eyes/face.  But it&#x27;s a crappy mascara.  Especially for that price AND having to buy a primer?!  Boo!</li>
            <li> Not as happy with this product as I usually am. The brush does not&lt;br /&gt;have the great end to separate and add length to individual lashes.&lt;br /&gt;But they last all day!</li>
            <li> I am always one to try new mascaras in search of the perfect one.  Did not like They&#x27;re Real.  Here are reasons why:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Did not lengthen or thicken eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;2)  Very difficult to remove and it comes off in flakes.  You have to keep washing and washing or wiping and wiping (depending on how you are removing it).  Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;3)  Whenever I wear this mascara, small flakes get into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;4)  I feel it actually made my eyelashes fall out.&lt;br /&gt;I am throwing nearly a whole tube of mascara away.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with the fact that this mascara came in a bag and no box, if you read the details it said it came in the original box, makes me think the stuff they wrote isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> This product did not ship as suggested. Came without a sealed box, which made me very hesitant to to try something I wasn&#x27;t sure if was unused or not. However I did use it. I do like the mascara but not the brush which seems very rough and rigid with no flexibility but no wow factor. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my L&#x27;Oréal lash extender tubes.</li>
            <li> SO worth the money! I have tried many different mascaras and nothing compares to this. It is definitely a dramatic mascara and makes lashes look thick and black just like false lashes. I was nervous to order this product due to all of the negative reviews saying that it might be a fake, but it is EXACTLY like my sample size that I received from Ulta. I am very satisfied and receive compliments on my lashes daily!</li>
            <li> I will never buy another mascara again. That&#x27;s pretty much all.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s old or what, but the mascara is SOO goopy &amp; stringy. It makes applying it a serious chore &amp; it gets everywhere. I&#x27;ve bought it from Sephora &amp; Macy&#x27;s before &amp; they were never like the one I received from here. Pretty sure I got screwed, that&#x27;ll teach me to take the easy route &amp; order online instead of going to the actual store.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all.  It didn&#x27;t feel like &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; mascara and it was challenging to apply since it &amp;#34;went all over the place&amp;#34;...I felt like more when on my face than my lashes!  I tried it for a few days but was done with it.</li>
            <li> You want real mascara thats all natrual and comes off easily with soap and water but don&#x27;t run? I found this amazing mascara that I will never use any other kind again! It&#x27;s made by Younique and called 3d moodstruck mascara. It&#x27;s $29 plus tax and shipping but it&#x27;s well worth the price and last two months or more depending on how much you use. You can order here...[...]  I love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best and I know good mascara. The absolute best. It curls Andries lashes look long and full.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great: no flaking and attaches to every lash, even the really lite ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what everyone else is complaining about, I&#x27;ve never had issues with this mascara being &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34;. The only time I have issues with clumping is if I apply several layers of this stuff. Other than that this mascara is fabulous. It noticeably makes my lashes longer and thicker. Also, in the past I&#x27;ve dealt with mascara that is so heavy it ruins the curl on my lashes. This mascara definitely does not have that problem! It&#x27;s a little pricey but I can&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> My honest review is that this mascara worked well. It made my eyelashes look really long just don&#x27;t over do it 3 to 4 strokes for best results. I bought it on ebay much cheaper than here.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve found.  Curls, lengthens &amp; does not flake.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Clumpy and seems dried up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got stubby short lashes, this stuff defines them and even curls them!  I don&#x27;t have to use my eyelash curler anymore, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge off either.  The best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this mascara and loved it. I bought the regular sized mascara and hated it. They are like two different products. The sample was drier and the regular size was very liquidey. Strange..</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras and never seen better results than They&#x27;re real by Benefit. The brush helps catch the small inner lashes and the few outer lashes which help make lashed look full and long. Something in the formula makes the eyelashes look so long and dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using this, friends asked me if I was using Latise (rx eyelash grower) or had fake eyelashes on! I would give this products (and basically anything else I&#x27;ve ever gotten from Benefit) 10 stars.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! The best mascara I have used. Those who are complaining are just too cheap and don&#x27;t know a good mascara. This is nothing compared to Loreal or any other brand close to it. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I was a bit skeptical, but it really does make a significant difference!</li>
            <li> Bought it after a recommendation from my niece.  Thought it was overpriced and not great.  Smudges easily, hard to take off.  Clumps.  Cover Girl is better and a lot less $.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the results based on the cost.  Can get similar results with a L&#x27;Oreal product 1/3 the cost.</li>
            <li> Can buy comparable product in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought every mascara known to women at least 3 times (because I couldn&#x27;t remember if I had tried  it before).  I will never need to try another - this is the one.  Easy to apply brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this item at all. It&#x27;s way too clumpy and takes too long to dry. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Use this mascara every  day and it really makes a difference. It is a bit pricey, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to They&#x27;re Real, for once I have some thick looking lashes! I love the brush of this mascara - the tip really is perfect for getting in tight corners and going vertical. I have thin and short lashes, but after 2 coats of this mascara I have the long jet-black lashes I&#x27;ve always wanted. Makes my eyes look a lot more noticeable, but it can be a tad clumpy/goopy while applying so it&#x27;s not quite perfect...but it&#x27;s close!</li>
            <li> I have super long lashes, and this mascara goes on effortlessly. Use a light brush stroke at first, utilizing the ball end for separation, then continue to fill in lightly with the full brush. Doesn&#x27;t leave black smudges when my eyelashes hit beneath my eyebrows, or smudge on the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> Probably the best mascara I have ever used, especially in combination with primer (Estee Lauder primer or any extender). I have used dozens of mascaras over the years, and this product, while a little pricey, is unbeatable. I hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Easy to use.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake.</li>
            <li> It was gummy and tacky. Unable to remove like the original mascara. I contacted seller with no response.</li>
            <li> This mascara is wonderful-- it gives my eyelashes a lift and slight curl, doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and lasts, however...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of the fact that it&#x27;s not waterproof and will leak if you get it wet, it is almost impossible to remove.  I have yet to find a remover up to the job.</li>
            <li> i bought this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, but I was disappointed. It&#x27;s comparable to much less expensive drugstore brands and not worth the extra money. It&#x27;s very dark which is good, but it didn&#x27;t lengthen my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Benefit mascara.  I have bought it before and it was an excellent product.  However, this one took a few months to ship because it was shipped from China.  The applicator was different from my previous tube, which I still had to make comparisons.  The mascara was clumpy.  Do not waste your money on this product.  In my opinion, this product should not even be sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  It&#x27;s a good mascara but there are others much better and much cheaper.  The brush is too fat.  It&#x27;s hard to do your lower lashes and almost impossible to get in the corners.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought a beauty product based solely on an internet article.  I decided to give this mascara a try and am I glad I did!  This has to be the best mascara I have ever used...bar none.  The brush has a spiky ball at the end that does an excellent job of separating lashes and pulling them up to their maximum length.  Definitely a Best Buy!</li>
            <li> The look and wear of the product I received is not the same as the original.  I definitely think it is a knock-off.</li>
            <li> Wow, this was more than I would usually pay for mascara, but worth every penny. Made my skimpy lashes long!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the wand for this mascara. I have really short, sparse lashes, but am really impatient when it comes to makeup, so I am always looking for a faster, easier way to add volume &amp; length. Previously I&#x27;d used multiple two-step primer+mascara products (mostly L&#x27;Oreal), tried every drugstore brand, and spent an embarrassing amount on a tube of Dior (that worked just as well as L&#x27;Oreal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway: the good: the nylon brush has extra bristles at the tip, so I can turn the wand enough to grab the tiny little end lashes that I normally can&#x27;t coat without overdoing the middle lashes &amp; causing clumping. (The wand on the mini/trial size of They&#x27;re Real is different than the full size, btw: it&#x27;s shorter, its bristles are farther apart, and from the tubes I&#x27;ve seen, doesn&#x27;t have the extra end bristles.) I&#x27;ve been able to skip the primer step and get away with doing only one or two coats---major bonus if you&#x27;re impatient like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The average: the formula isn&#x27;t anything truly magical. Don&#x27;t get me wrong--the mascara is good. If I take time to let it dry between coats, it doesn&#x27;t clump or run, and if I add more than 2 coats, it can take a little work to remove at the end of the day. (I&#x27;ve found Biore cleansing cloths work the fastest without irritating my eyes.) It doesn&#x27;t flake or bother my contacts. But depending on your preferences, you can get glossier lashes from the more expensive brands, or equally thick lashes from the drugstore brands; you just have to add a few more coats. The big difference, again, is the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: in my experience, and from reading other reviews, I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re getting the real &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; product from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon. I purchased one tube directly from Benefit&#x27;s site, one from inside Sephora, and one from a seller on Amazon, and my experience was similar to others on here: the mascara in the tube I bought from Amazon was really stringy, and I wound up getting it all over my hands &amp; clothes (I wouldn&#x27;t give up, though. If it&#x27;d been one of my old $4 tubes from Maybelline, I would&#x27;ve pitched it, but instead I spent a week fighting the gluey stuff and invariably wound up looking like Tammy Faye, or a 5-year-old who&#x27;d just discovered Mommy&#x27;s makeup). I suspect that some of the vendors are selling knockoff or expired product, but it&#x27;s hard to tell which ones. That&#x27;s a shame, because this really is good mascara, especially if you&#x27;re trying to boost nearly invisible lashes or want to get the job done in just a few quick coats.(I wouldn&#x27;t give up, though.

            <li> First off, I have medium-length medium-thickness eyelashes. Basically, my eyelashes are your average eyelashes, except for the fact that they grow downwards but have just enough curl, so that the tips and the roots are even, and the middle dips downward (basically like a smile). I bought this directly from Ulta, so I can not give you any assurance that what you get here is real or fake, but as for the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; stuff, it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!! It took mine about a week to get to a good consistency (not too clumpy, or thick, or thin), so just be patient, and you will reap vast rewards!!! Anyway, so step 1, I just... y&#x27;know... take it outta the bottle... and wipe the ball tip off on the edge of the tube before applying. Step 2 is optional, you can curl your eyelashes beforehand, but with this mascara I have shunned the metal contraption from my countertop. Step 3, I start at the base of the lashes (horizontally) and wiggle the wand, and sweep up in one fast stroke. I do this about 4-5 times, not waiting to dry, all that crap. I found that it must be the slant of the bristles or something, cause I get no clumps whatsoever (I mean, if you want to slather it on like peanut butter, yeah, you&#x27;re gonna look like ya got something crawlin on your eyeball!!!), but unless you are TRYING to look like Cruella DeVil, your gonna like the non-clumpiness and curl it gives you. Step 3, I take the ball (make SURE there is no goopy mascars in the bristles), and push my lashes upward. This gives me a good lasting curl. I also have worn this the whole (Texas) winter (75-80° on average), and I get NO SMUDGES AT ALL!!! Overall, this is a great mascara and well worth the money. Sorry for ranting, but I hope this helped. :)</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. Every time I wear it people ask me am I wearing false eyelashes. I tell them no their my own. I use to wear false eyelashes, but not anymore, I just use my Benefit They&#x27;re Real Mascara.</li>
            <li> Best mascara for my lashes. The brush never leave clots.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love They&#x27;re Real by Benefit. I usually buy directly from Sephora, but the product I received from Amazon must have been old or fake. It was sticky and stringy instead of just wet like I&#x27;m used to getting from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Easy to open.  Excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It wears forever! It is pricey but worth it. The first mascara I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t leave track marks even after 12 hours!</li>
            <li> I have short lashes, I can&#x27;t say that product made my eyes look &amp;#34;false&amp;#34; but 70% better.  I wore product 12 hours, I did have some mild&amp;#34;flaking&amp;#34; after 6 hours but much less than other products, also had mild discoloration beneath my eyes when my eyes watered from peeling onions. Overall very satisfied</li>
            <li> This product is a knock-off. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have been using this Mascara since it was first released. I have gone through roughly 3 or 4 tubes. I typically purchase it Sephora when I run out, however, I have been working a lot and have been unable to go to the mall. I decided to order it off amazon because I have prime and needed some desperately. Mistake. This product is a stingy, gooey formula that is not anything like the real formula. I am very frustrated I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Best mascara.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> more people have remarked on my eyelashes than my last mascara.. it&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara. It makes my lashes look full and fake. I got it as a sample and am hooked! It is waterproof so make sure you have a good makeup remover to take it off. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Well worth the extra money to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Loved this mascara but it dried out super fast!!! :-(</li>
            <li> Best mascara out there!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, I have used L&#x27;oreal Voluminous for years...this mascara has is SO much nice and lashes look so much thicker and longer. I love the no clump wand, it&#x27;s awesome. Since using I have actually been asked what mascara I use!! Never been asked that before!! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look longer and not clumped up.  I saw my doctor&#x27;s receptionist who ordinarily does not wear makeup with long lashes and asked her if she was using a product to grow long lashes.  She said she was just wearing Benefit mascara,  That is when I bought it, and I like the look.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara.  Does what it says it does.  Makes your lashes outstanding!  No clumps!!  Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> The only mascara I use!</li>
            <li> Big fat lashes that last all day. They look natural, not like spiders. My favorite!</li>
            <li> It works! I&#x27;m getting compliments left and right on how long my eyelashes are and if they are real</li>
            <li> This is either a counterfeit mascara, or it is expired. It had the wrong consistency, and it smelled funny. You are better off buying this at a cosmetics store, because then you will know you are getting the right product.</li>
            <li> Oh. My. God. This is the crowning glory of the mascara world. I have tried so many mascaras, from L&#x27;Oreal to Dior. I have tested so many brands over the years that I have lost track. I have:&lt;br /&gt;-Fair skin and red hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Sensitivity as far as skin and hair follicles. My eyelashes tended to fall out with drug store brands, and I would have a lot of irritation in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-Naturally long lashes but not the thickness that I want.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this mascara when I was younger, like several years ago, and hated it. However, I didn&#x27;t understand makeup as well as I do now, and hadn&#x27;t tested a wide variety of brands. Now, at 25, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot live without this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pros for this mascara outweigh the cons, so I&#x27;ll start with the cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It dries quickly, so if you want several layers for a more dramatic look, you have to move quickly to avoid clumping.&lt;br /&gt;2) Mascara has a shelf life of about three months, and after the two month period, it&#x27;s harder to get mascara out of the bottle. I suggest using the trick of running it under hot water to loosen the mascara and then letting it cool down so it isn&#x27;t too liquified.&lt;br /&gt;3) It is a little tricky to remove. What I have found that works is using oil-free liquid remover and then following up with a cleansing cloth, like Aveeno calming makeup remover cloths. OR you can use Benefit&#x27;s remover that is actually made for this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, the pros, aka why you should just buy this if you have even a tiny little doubt. I tried to cover everything I could think of for people as picky as I am:&lt;br /&gt;1) One coat does the trick. I actually get asked all the time if my eyelashes are actually that long and thick. Yes, mine are long, but not as long as this mascara makes it. It&#x27;s like a one trick pony, in the sense that it accomplishes everything in one trick. There are other great brands out there, but this one is by far the best as far as not having to reapply coats one after another to achieve the thickness you want.&lt;br /&gt;2) You don&#x27;t need eyeliner or eyeshadow to balance it out. Some mascaras look ridiculous if you don&#x27;t go all out with eye makeup. I tend to just want mascara on a regular basis, and this looks fantastic without anything else. It also looks great with done up eyes!&lt;br /&gt;3) There&#x27;s almost no clumping. As aforementioned, my eyelashes are long and can actually get tangled on the ends because they curl upwards (lol) so I run the risk of mascara causing my eyelashes to twist and therefore clump. All mascara is going to give you a little clump over time (or a lot depending on brand) but this is hands down one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The takeaway: I fully endorse this. I gave it five stars because regardless of almost inconsequential cons, this is the only mascara I have used so consistently. I love it so much, I always buy two at a time because I don&#x27;t want to run out or lose it! It&#x27;s not even worth buying a drugstore brand because literally nothing compares to this. BUY THIS.er another to achieve the thickness you want.&lt;br /&gt;2) You don&#x27;t need eyeliner or eyeshadow to balance it out.

            <li> By far the best mascara on the market today. It adds lift and volume without being chunky or clumpy.</li>
            <li> Everyone else is selling this item for $23.00&lt;br /&gt;I love this mascara. You will never want to use anything even again.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY pIT !&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not worth the money i really regret buying it</li>
            <li> This appears to be a knock off, or old as others have suggested.  :(  And, it&#x27;s cheaper if you just order from Sephora itself... do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t order this one!</li>
            <li> Ok, so first of all it&#x27;s awful that amazon is clearly allowing sellers to sell ancient batches of cosmetics. I actually work for benefit and occasionally when opening new testers I will find a goopy, stringy awful TR but it&#x27;s a random from an old batch (and nothing can be done other than pitching it) If you buy your product from an actual Macy&#x27;s/Ulta/Boutique/Sephora they will and can exchange it no problem. Amazon however has you at it&#x27;s mercy.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said i love They&#x27;re Real layered over 2 coats of Badgal Lash. I get asked if I&#x27;m wearing a strip pretty often when I do my duo haha</li>
            <li> Tough to remove, and I lose a few lashes, but my lashes never looked more dense once I put on 2 coats or more!</li>
            <li> I have used all brands of mascara and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Stays on and does not flake!  Took star off as it clumps and I hate clumps but it does stay put.</li>
            <li> this mascara rocks!! Works great for a nice fanned out look with volume.</li>
            <li> I got this after finding out Fresh doesn&#x27;t sell through Sephora and more and was hoping to find a replacement for the brand I&#x27;d been using for years. I quite like it, it goes on smooth and makes your lashes look thick, I already have pretty thick, long lashes so the effect is pretty close to wearing falsies without looking fake. The brush does a really good job of coating the lashes and separating without creating a clumpy look. I will probably buy this again after exploring a few more brands trying to find something a little more similar to Fresh but overall I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li> WELL worth the money!  I get stopped all the time with people asking what kind of mascara I&#x27;m wearing!!  LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> The trick to this mascara is start at the base of your eyelash in the inside of your eye and work to outer lashes. Wiggle the brush from base to tip. It dries quickly and I only use one coat! You can&#x27;t just slap this on, use it correctly and it&#x27;s the bomb! Baby oil takes it off like a charm and doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.</li>
            <li> I did not see a difference from my normal mascara</li>
            <li> Horrible. Takes forever to take off and irritates the eyes. Makes your eyes looks spidery</li>
            <li> I would have given this mascara a 5 but after a week or two of wearing it my vision is blurred. I also noticed that it&#x27;s very hard to take off which can be a plus. This stuff will literally stay on 24 hours. It gave my lashes length and volume but my eyesight is much more important.</li>
            <li> Great mascara for a natural look!</li>
            <li> Got this mascara as a gift. I&#x27;ve used it quite a bit and like the results! it takes a while to put the product on exactly how I want it and it definitely takes more than one coat! Like other reviews say it is pretty hard to get off at the end of the evening.. but that could also be a plus because I haven&#x27;t found this mascara to flake off.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara on a whim for my wife I was not expecting her to like it as much as she did. Honestly it was a small gift for her because she had recently passed her college exams and she was not too thrilled at first. But after she actually used it she was in love with the jet black color and the fullness of your lashes it brings out her eyes so much I was fully surprised by it. The bristles on this thing are completely amazing they allowed her to do her lashes both horizontally and vertically. I am so glad I got her this gift and I could honestly say that any man who is looking for a gift or even you ladies looking for a purchase this is something that stands out above the rest miles or even mountain high. The quality is just superb; this product disappoints in no aspect and is of the highest quality.  It also work best with [[ASIN:B00QDUX1UC False Eyelashes - 70 Pairs in 7 Different Styles Allows You to Select Your Look From Natural to Dramatic! + FREE Bonuses]]</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have found! Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great mascara that does not leave flakes on your face even after sleeping in it.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this from Sephora and liked it.  So I bought the full size.  This doesn&#x27;t even begin to resemble the sample based on the performance.  Sure the brush is the same but man, is it a mess!  First thing out of the tube?  A long, string of goo.  I end up with what appears to be chips and chunks of mascara on my lashes, then when trying to remove and separate, it ends up on my fingers, eyelids and under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could this possibly be fake?  Amazon, if you read these, look into this.</li>
            <li> merchandise came without the box, does not seem original</li>
            <li> It seriously makes your lashes look extra long. It&#x27;s not lumpy and doesn&#x27;t come off during the day. It&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product from Sephora many times and have worked in the makeup business before. I was shipped a fake bottle. The cap was more gold, the wand was flimsy, the consistency was more runny, and the bottom tag has the jar inverted. I have a real bottle from Sephora and compared the two. I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This will be a go to mascara for me. I greatly enjoy this product, but I don&#x27;t think it or any mascara is worth 20+ dollars. It also can have the consistency of molasses to me, so I have to be careful not to use to much or at least let the product dry on my lashes in between uses. I do plan to purchase again, but those are just a couple things I would change, otherwise a great mascara.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Love my lashes. Fast shipping and will never wear anything else again. Where has this product been all my life?!</li>
            <li> I decided to test the mini version because it&#x27;s much cheaper than the full version, and since this mascara got some good reviews on you-tube for a fanned out look.  This mascara truly does creat this look.  What a nice product.  For me, the formula lays on so nice, not clumpy, and the tip can hit the hard-to-reach inner lashes and enhances the outer lashes.  Thanks to the cruelty-free ingredients, I have no reaction to my contact lenses, and I can wash it off easily at night.  I am going to go ahead and get the larger version since I wear mascara everyday.</li>
            <li> this mascara is the best- really makes your natural lashes look nice</li>
            <li> Does a great job, but difficult to remove</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in search of a great mascara.  My granddaughter said this would be it.  I don&#x27;t think it makes my lashes look long or lush.  They look very natural though. Love the brush.  You can really separate your lashes with the tip.  My problem is my eyes feel very irritated by the end of the day.  I can&#x27;t wait to wash my makeup off when I get home.  Can&#x27;t say for sure it is the mascara but I&#x27;m thinking it is since I just started with this issue and I bought the mascara a couple of weeks ago.  I&#x27;ll give it some more time and update my review as needed.</li>
            <li> i love this -- the applicator brush is just the right size, bristles long enough, very good easy coverage.  the mascara itself is a little difficult to remove with just water and/or soap and water -- probably need to use oil-based makeup remover. but, it&#x27;s terrific mascara!</li>
            <li> I have been using this line of Mascara for over a year and LOVE the product, but BEWARE of who you are purchasing from.  Read their reviews.  The last one I got was clearly a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; item.  Coming in a container that was slightly different than the authentic brand and the mascara itself was awful.  Goopy and gooie like wet tar.  I was VERY impressed with how promptly Amazon handled the refund.  I will definitely be more careful about which sellers I choose in the future....just because it will ship &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; does not make them a &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; candidate to pick!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara! I have very small/thin lashes and I have tried so many mascaras unsuccessfully over the years. I received this as a birthday gift and I instantly fell in love! The only con is the price, but I am honestly willing to pay it since it&#x27;s the only mascara that seems to work for me!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worse mascara in the world.  What a waste of money!  Stringy like glue consistency, feels weird, doesn&#x27;t look good.  Comes off in clumps.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it worked as good as the mini version of this mascara and for some reason didn&#x27;t seem to make my eye lashes as full.</li>
            <li> This is a knock off product, Save your $$ and go to Sephora and get the real thing there!  How do I know it is a knock off?    - The bottle is a different shade than the real version.  - The wand is completely different  - The texture of the mascara is gooey not smooth  - The website listed on the bottle is [...] which doesn&#x27;t exist. The correct website is [...]    Stay away from this cheap product and this seller. It is a waste of your money!</li>
            <li> This particular tube made my eyes super irritated and red??? Tried it 3 times.  Every single time it happened :(</li>
            <li> Tends to smear under my eyes. Could be because the lashes are so long.  My friends using this don&#x27;t have the same problem. They suggested I powder my lashes before applying.</li>
            <li> Talk about spider lashes. This looked really gross on with only one coat, it was flaking and smearing everywhere and looked very clumpy.</li>
            <li> gooey, stringy, etc. it&#x27;s most likely a fake! look for a seam/indent at the bottom of the bottle, and look for a poorly-cut label. companies in china counterfeit a lot of benefit items, you&#x27;re better off paying full price on this one unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara since it came out and I absolutely love it. I usually buy it from the store though and thought I&#x27;d buy it from amazon this time. But.. after reading these reviews it seems that what most people are getting is not what I use. Mine is never flaky or clumpy or a weird consistency. It really goes on smoothly and makes my lashes look great. My advice is to try it, but get it from a real store! Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for 2 years now and its amazing.  My friend went to the mall to have her makeup done so I tagged along with no intention of buying anything.  Since there were two sales girls working and my friend was in the &amp;#34;beauty chair&amp;#34; the other sales girl talked me into getting my makeup done too.  Well, needless to say, I walked out of the Benefit Counter spending almost $100 and this mascara I will use forever! I bought it 3 times so far!  I constantly get compliments on my lashes and proudly tell that person &amp;#34;YES, THEY&amp;#34;RE REAL&amp;#34; ;-)</li>
            <li> came w/o a box or sealed cap... not sure its the real stuff. sent back for a refund... sketchy. would not buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this mascara for years and this one has a strange smell and looks used. It had some dried mascara on the outside.</li>
            <li> My fav mascara! I recommend it to everyone I know</li>
            <li> I love benefit mascara and I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it to offer.</li>
            <li> This is a gewey, weird-textured mascara. The little round pokes at the end of the brush make it even more difficult to apply it without major smudges, especially on thin, short lashes. I don&#x27;t understand why this has been promoted as the best mascara in so many magazines...</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my friend . like it .</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this for my birthday and LOVED it!! I ordered this and hate it!! It is sticky, gooey and stringy. My lashes stick together when I blink .... a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> whatever i got was definitely fake. It made a huge mess all over my eyelids and under my eyes. such a pain</li>
            <li> Works aammmaazing! I will continue to use this</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. When it goes on nicely, I love how it looks and feels. However, for whatever reason I end up with raccoon eyes 80% of the time. This is not a brush on and head out the door product for me, its a product for if I ever have an hour to get ready to leave and plenty of time to fix any problems kind of thing, because somehow I&#x27;ve had no trouble applying other mascaras but this one always ends up everywhere...ick! Also, it&#x27;s kind of difficult to remove even with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Despite some of the other reviews, I like this product and it works better than any  other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever.  I was asked twice the same day if my lashes were real.</li>
            <li> Great product to extend lashes and make them look long and full. It makes them look fake but nope they are real all yours.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara! Really works and makes your lashes long.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes clump together and look heavy. I experience more thickness than length. I&#x27;ve tried applying several coats before it dries, I&#x27;ve tried applying additional coats after each one dries. I have had habitual issues with this mascara despite great reviews on the product. I will be returning this item to Sephora.</li>
            <li> Very expensive but it works</li>
            <li> It take very long time to arrive. And  when it arrived it was ruined and looks like sticky oil</li>
            <li> This mascara has done nothing special for my eyelashes.  I read all these great reviews but am disappointed.  Your better off getting Lash Blast by Covergirl.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars I would.  This product is old and stringy.  The tube is a different color than the one you get at the store and the brush is different too!  I think it might be a knock off.  Save yourself the time and get it at the store.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. It makes my eyelashes look so much longer and it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara of all times. It really makes your lashes look 2x longer and thicker</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. I would recommend it to anyone. Just make sure you take it off before you go to bed because your eyelids may stick together because it stays strong for so long.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved the extra touch on the packaging!</li>
            <li> Not at all worth the money. Clumpy and difficult to put on evenly. Previously used cover girl lash blast. I will be going back to that.</li>
            <li> Makes the lashes long and full. I have been replacing this product each time a run out. If careful how you use it it doesn&#x27;t clump. I would like it to last longer. I have recommended it to all of my girl friends and family members.</li>
            <li> Still a little clumpy on my lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no clumping....makes beautiful eyelashes that are not gaudy.</li>
            <li> love this mascara...&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;sue</li>
            <li> Typically, I love this product. However, I feel as though I received a knock-off! The packaging was different, as was the actual tube of mascara. It looked like a sticker was applied over a tube of cheap mascara to mimic Benefit products. The mascara itself is awful, sticky, messy! Not at all like the Benefit products I am use to. Shipping also took almost a month! So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love all  Benefit products.</li>
