            <li>The Men&#x27;s After Shave (I-12 and Z-14) by Halston is the on;y after shave that leaves my face squeaky clean with just a hint of fragrance.  </li>

            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This brand wins the test.</li>
            <li>WOW WHAT CAN BE BETTER THAN HALSTON</li>
            <li>We had a positive experience with the purchase of this product!</li>
            <li>My reviews here on this product is totally with Halston and not associated or to be associated with Amazon as Amazon is the greatest hands down..</li>
            <li>Perhaps Halston watered down a good product.</li>
            <li>Great product.. hard to find splash aftershaves these days.  </li>
            <li>One of my favs - great but hard to find in stock</li>
            <li>First time I have ordered this product and the wife said she loves it.</li>
            <li>I decided I wanted to purchase another bottle of it recently many years later</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Pairs well with most cologne, and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly modern for something from the 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Amber is still very prevalent, along with a shot of citrus.</li>
            <li>Fast ship.  </li>
            <li>bottle of Halston Z-14 cologne from Amazon for a very, very cheap price, that&#x27;s almost half the price of what I&#x27;ve normally purchased it for.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Just what my 85 year old dad wanted!!</li>
            <li>All 3 bring me back to some fun times.</li>
            <li>it is, here is the new bottle.</li>
            <li>Must say it does leave a very soft snell.</li>
            <li>May be, this fragance is not popular, and looks as ordinary lotion, but believe me, it&#x27;s wonderful and durable, adn low cost.</li>
            <li>But for certain bodies, it&#x27;s the only scent</li>
            <li>also purchased the spray cologne separately and noticed the same thing, but as I had depleted my spray already I couldn&#x27;t be certain.</li>
            <li>People frequently ask me what after  shave I am wearing when I use this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using After Shaves for nearly 35+ years.</li>
            <li>It is a classic and the only place I can find it is on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a new 4.2 oz.</li>
            <li>The new bottle doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long and the scent isn&#x27;t nearly as distinctive as the bottle I purchased elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not real heavy but definitely woodsy.</li>

            <li> Not real heavy but definitely woodsy.</li>
            <li> -)&lt;br /&gt;Aftershave is hard to find thanks to those progressives who can&#x27;t leave the rest of us alone.</li>
            <li> Jovan Musk, Grey Flannel and now Halston Z-14.</li>
            <li> The product is as expected however was delivered much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Halston Z-14 was one of my favorites back in the late 70&#x27;s, mid 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> not much of a smell to it</li>
            <li> In fact my barber commented the other day that when I stop by for my cut that the cape he uses smells like Halston for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> you only needed a small amount of it to put on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s been watered down or perhaps the formulation has changed.</li>
            <li> My 80 year old dad lives this product and it&#x27;s very hard to find .</li>
            <li> Only complaint would be...</li>
            <li> /&gt;So decide if you could use a little &amp;#34;positive affirmation&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> and I am nothing but completely disappointed with it completely and totally</li>
            <li> Plus the strength of it has changed as well as in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, but hard to find sometimes in dept. stores.  </li>
            <li> shipping was slow.</li>

            <li> My husband love the smell.Will order again!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Great price.  Surprisingly modern for something from the 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The product is as expected however was delivered much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The Men&#x27;s After Shave (I-12 and Z-14) by Halston is the on;y after shave that leaves my face squeaky clean with just a hint of fragrance.  Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  Only wish they would bring-back their stick deodorant!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Purchased dozens of times.&lt;br /&gt;Not tasty and irritates eyes when used too generously! :-)&lt;br /&gt;Aftershave is hard to find thanks to those progressives who can&#x27;t leave the rest of us alone. Smite them, Lord.</li>
            <li> Great product.. hard to find splash aftershaves these days.  And this is a pleasant manly fragrance for a great price!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance,  love it.</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s an old favorite for my dad and he was very pleased to get it again! Halston Z-14 is a scent made for any man!</li>
            <li> I use this brand al the time for many years. I kow how it should smell. This one smelled mor like spice and cinnamon</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, and will definitely do business again. Thanks</li>
            <li> great would like to order the halston z-14 cologne</li>
            <li> The  only  smell  for  me  on  a Saturday  night . Had women tell me  that  they  could  just  eat  me up.</li>
            <li> This smells so good on my husband.  I like it better than I-12.  Not real heavy but definitely woodsy.</li>
            <li> We had a positive experience with the purchase of this product! We received it when we were suppose to.! Thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift.  It was well received and I&#x27;ve received so many comments on purchasing it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful gift to give to a male.</li>
            <li> What can I say you either like the fragrance or you don&#x27;t. This is&lt;br /&gt;a great price for a large size bottle</li>
            <li> Halston Z-14 was one of my favorites back in the late 70&#x27;s, mid 80&#x27;s. Loved it back in the dayz of glass coffee tables and the sparkly stuff...ah youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amber is still very prevalent, along with a shot of citrus. For an aftershave it hangs on for quite a while, both bracing and scent. Placing on your pulse points gives a mellower scent that lingers for a while, but not overpowering. The Halston Z-14 package also comes with a 2/1 pocket comb and mirror stamped \\&quot;Fragrance Net.com\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the swag, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done 3 reviews from the blast. Jovan Musk, Grey Flannel and now Halston Z-14. All 3 bring me back to some fun times. Buy it. Enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Nice aftershave. Good for day use. I normally use Nautica Voyage (aftershave) a wonderful product but it is 4 times more expensive and getting even more expensive so I tried this one I used years ago.  I like this one it is lighter and my wife also likes it. A good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a new 4.2 oz. bottle of Halston Z-14 cologne from Amazon for a very, very cheap price, that&#x27;s almost half the price of what I&#x27;ve normally purchased it for. I was happy to find it online at a very cheap price. When it arrived at my home, I unpackaged it and set it on the bathroom counter top. Later on, after taking a shower, I put on some of the Halston Z-14 Cologne and immediately noticed that the Z-14 didn&#x27;t smell like it should. I called to my wife and when she came upstairs, I asked her how she liked my new bottle of Z-14. She immediately replied, that&#x27;s not Halston Z-14 you have on. I replied yes it is, here is the new bottle. At this point I started closely smelling the cologne I had just put on my face. It smelled just ok, but trust me, it&#x27;s not the official Halston Z-14 Cologne,,,,.....THAT&#x27;S WHY IT&#x27;S A LOT CHEAPER THAT DEPARTMENT HALSTON Z-14</li>
            <li> Good classic scent. Pairs well with most cologne, and lasts long. In fact my barber commented the other day that when I stop by for my cut that the cape he uses smells like Halston for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like hailston</li>
            <li> Great product.  Out of the bottle it&#x27;s ok but it smells better after about 15 minutes after it has been put on.  Not over-powering.  I&#x27;d definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years..  It has a great blend of scents.  It is a classic and the only place I can find it is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product...arrived on time and in good condition.  My 80 year old dad lives this product and it&#x27;s very hard to find .</li>
            <li> I love the after shave product of Z 14.  People frequently ask me what after  shave I am wearing when I use this product. It works for me.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> One of my favs - great but hard to find in stock</li>
            <li> May be, this fragance is not popular, and looks as ordinary lotion, but believe me, it&#x27;s wonderful and durable, adn low cost.</li>
            <li> Classic, my favorite for 30 years..... Manly and rich smelling</li>
            <li> First time I have ordered this product and the wife said she loves it. So as the story would go, if she loves it then I have to like it. Must say it does leave a very soft snell.</li>
            <li> My dad used to wear this all the time until, all of a sudden, he could not find it locally.  He was told they had quit making it.  Imagine my surprise when I saw it on Amazon!  He is so happy to have his Halston Z-14 again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a variety to my aftershave collection. I shave every day...and like different scents, for different occasions. This has a wonderful, woodsy scent. It is manly. It was packaged well. Only complaint would be...shipping was slow. Over all...well worth the price. Nice product!!</li>
            <li> It arrived at the designated time and we were happy with the product. The price was good.</li>
            <li> I have been using After Shaves for nearly 35+ years. I ordered this product after reading some of the Amazon reviews and thank you to those that take the time to review products. This brand wins the test. Great Aroma, soothes the skin perfectly. I highly recommend this product. Use it... Gift it... Enjoy it !!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this COLOGNE/AFTERSHAVE especially at this seller&#x27;s EXTREMELY LOW PRICE..IT DOES NOT COME WITH A SPRAYER, I must have misread the description..ON TIME..GREAT FRAGRANCE FOR MYSELF</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragrance and the way it makes his face feel after shaving!  It arrived nicely packaged and very fast!</li>
            <li> Good item for my husband</li>
            <li> I wore this cologne years ago and decided to try it again.  Ah, good scent, good price, but I still don&#x27;t look like Brad Pitt!</li>
            <li> I used to wear Halston Z-14 many years ago and I always enjoyed the aroma of it as it had a very nice scent to it and I was complimented on it many times. I decided I wanted to purchase another bottle of it recently many years later and I am nothing but completely disappointed with it completely and totally and my reason for stating it as the aroma that Halston Z-14 it had years ago is not the same as the Halston Z-14 I purchased recently. Plus the strength of it has changed as well as in the past you only needed a small amount of it to put on and now you literally need a handful of it and any aroma it does have now fades within 3 hours. Halston Z-14 is another product that is out there today that carries the same name for years but not deliver the same product today as advertised. My reviews here on this product is totally with Halston and not associated or to be associated with Amazon as Amazon is the greatest hands down..</li>
            <li> A great product from Halston! I have tried Nivea for men aftershave balm before and this product scores way over it. Not only prevents post-shave rashes but also the aroma is just unparalleled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, but hard to find sometimes in dept. stores.  Product arrived on time with no issues.</li>
            <li> Just what my 85 year old dad wanted!!</li>
            <li> Halston Z-14 is NOT for everybody. But it IS for somebody.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s NOT for just ANYBODY. But for certain bodies, it&#x27;s the only scent you&#x27;ll need.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Halston&#x27;s Z-14 products for over a decade, now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never gotten anything but compliments, from the wife, from female co-workers, from the girls at church, even from passers-by on the street, and in stores. Lots of &#x27;em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So decide if you could use a little &amp;#34;positive affirmation&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Then try some Halston Z-14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: It may not suit you.&lt;br /&gt;After all, it&#x27;s NOT for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;But it IS for somebody.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, if you&#x27;re one of the lucky ones, it will be for YOUR body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you&#x27;ll know what it is, to be &amp;#34;...one of the few, the proud....&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Pleasant but masculine fragrance. Excellent for the price. The fragrance should be a tad stronger and would get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be more &amp;#34;woodsier&amp;#34;... but the wife is happy.</li>
            <li> great price for an old favorite</li>
            <li> For this monney is ok</li>
            <li> Best smell on the planet. Glad its still available.</li>
            <li> Fast ship.  Great stocking stuffer for my father.</li>
            <li> not much of a smell to it</li>
            <li> really enjoy the product enjoy the fragrance it&#x27;s a shame they quit making the original.</li>
            <li> I have another bottle of this that I purchased two years ago, and there is a notable difference in the strength of the product and the endurance of the scent. I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s been watered down or perhaps the formulation has changed. The new bottle doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long and the scent isn&#x27;t nearly as distinctive as the bottle I purchased elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the spray cologne separately and noticed the same thing, but as I had depleted my spray already I couldn&#x27;t be certain. Perhaps Halston watered down a good product.</li>
            <li> WOW WHAT CAN BE BETTER THAN HALSTON ANYTHING BUT THE Z14 IS MY SON&#x27;S VERY FAVORITE COLOGNE &amp; AFTER SHAVE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Love the scent and the deal! Fast Shipping!</li>
