    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best eye sunscreen I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Olay Pro-X, though generally wonderful, makes my eyes sting and turn red.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a excellent product of a comparable quality to Shiseido</li>
            <li>Very good</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why no one else makes a product like this, but I&#x27;m delighted that Shiseido does!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been so happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent performance, superior product quality, giving a sense of comfort when using bright eye-catching package design.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does a good job of moisturizing the eye area without leaving the eyelids so oily that makeup slides</li>
            <li>Works great at protecting my skin from the sun and makes my makeup go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get in you eyes, doesn&#x27;t sting, isn&#x27;t greasy, and isn&#x27;t toxic like most others.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an spf 30 or greater.</li>
            <li>However there is a better option price-vise that is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a sunscreen that is safe for the eye area.</li>
            <li>I like it, but in the winter I might like something with more hydrating capabilities (hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li>I had been using another top brand of eye cream with an spf for years and when I needed more I couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li>glad to have found it again.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use a concealer on top to correct for that.</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t have so many fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is fast absorbing,moisturizing,works good under makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, glides on easily, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I tried serveral eye creams with spf and couldn&#x27;t find one with a consistency that I liked in combination with a higher spf.  </li>
            <li>use changed consistency from smooth cream to chunky goop and ended up in a trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I basically would have to apply a light tone of make up to match the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>Overall, its a good product. :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got Zinc Oxide (9.3%), an excellent physical sunscreen that I really like to look for in my suncare</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say that it doesn&#x27;t have moisturizing benefits, it just doesn&#x27;t have that rich thirst quenching feel when applying it to the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer; however it just adds a white tone to the under eye area.</li>
            <li>while, yes, it is pricey, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Many people complain about the white color of the cream</li>
            <li>This is why so many products with SPF leave a white</li>
            <li>Healthy Defense Daily Eye Cream SPF</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first eye area sunscreen I&#x27;ve used that does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>Possibly even better than the discontinued Clarins product I used to use.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY sunscreen (and I&#x27;ve tried sooo many) that does not sting or make my eyes water.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s very delicate and sensitive), I invested in this wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li>SPF means sun protection factor and generally works because it contains particles that absorb or reflect sun light.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you may have skin that doesn&#x27;t easily absorb physical blockers or takes longer to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the high SPF, however, considering that my makeup is SPF 15 or 23 depending on which one I wear, after a trip to Grand Cayman and a couple of days wearing shiseido eye cream, the raccoon look slowly began.</li>
            <li>but I found it leaves some white residue on my skin and may not be a good fit for someone darker than very pale</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I only wish this was available twenty years ago when I was in my twenties</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product feels great, brightens the eye area and moisturizes well on my combination skin (slightly oily to slightly dry).  </li>
            <li>Applying daily, I noticed after about a week a significant increase and deepening in the wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>but you get  more product for less money-0.7 oz.</li>
            <li>If you are purchasing this you should do it more for the SPF benefits and less for the moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has moisturizing effect, but its main function is a sunblock for your eyes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you actually have white circles around your eyes after applying, you are most likely using way too much.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your makeup and/or other sunscreen is equally as effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I stumbled onto this little gem, I was most definitely pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blends seamlessly and protects for hours.</li>
            <li>I had skin cancer near the eye.</li>
            <li>do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I did find it much cheaper at our local retailer TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li>The only product with this high an spf that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes....</li>
            <li>This is a must-have for the summer to prevent the sun light from damaging the delicate skin around our eyes.</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer an eye cream that does not change my natural skin color.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to how it works for people with very dry or sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> Goes on nicely, a tiny amount goes a long way, no perfumes.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this to the gym and on long bike rides</li>
            <li> It has a floral scent which is very different from some other brands.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use that much to cover the delicate area around your eyes!</li>
            <li> The whitening effect does not work well with my dark circles - turns them an unfortunate shade but it is worth it to protect my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- A little bit goes a long way and also lightens and brightens your eyes.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I have not regretted using this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;You need very little so this tube looks like will last.</li>
            <li> so I apply when face is still wet from washing, or add a little water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are few other SPF 30 or close eye creams</li>
            <li> use about the size of half a pea for both of my eyes every day, and the tube has lasted me over three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality but expensive.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my concealer to protect my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> and this did not bother me in the least, nor did it cause my eye makeup to run or bleed.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit thick</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I always use this eye sunscreen after applying my regular eye cream in the morning. This sunscreen has moisturizing effect, but its main function is a sunblock for your eyes. This eye sunblock is not greasy. After you apply it, wait 5 minutes before you apply your makeup. This can help the sunblock to set on your skin. The scent of it is another reason I bought it. It has a floral scent which is very different from some other brands. This is a must-have for the summer to prevent the sun light from damaging the delicate skin around our eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye sunscreen I have ever tried.  Doesn&#x27;t get in you eyes, doesn&#x27;t sting, isn&#x27;t greasy, and isn&#x27;t toxic like most others.  I will use this product for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I like Shiseido eye products because you can slather them on and they don&#x27;t sting your eyes.  I can&#x27;t use alot of products for that reason - for instance, Olay Pro-X, though generally wonderful, makes my eyes sting and turn red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need very little so this tube looks like will last.</li>
            <li> Works great at protecting my skin from the sun and makes my makeup go on very smoothly. It is not oily at all and yet it protects me from the UBA/UBV rays..You don&#x27;t need to use that much to cover the delicate area around your eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a while.  I tried serveral eye creams with spf and couldn&#x27;t find one with a consistency that I liked in combination with a higher spf.  I was looking for an spf 30 or greater. When I stumbled onto this little gem, I was most definitely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is between a lotion and a cream.  It&#x27;s neither too runny or too think and it glides on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does a good job of moisturizing the eye area without leaving the eyelids so oily that makeup slides off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream also acts as an eye brightener. Many people complain about the white color of the cream but here are a couple of things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- SPF means sun protection factor and generally works because it contains particles that absorb or reflect sun light. For physical blockers (rather than chemical blockers), the product&#x27;s pigmentation is what lies between your skin and the sun and absorbs or reflects the sunlight.  This is why so many products with SPF leave a white tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A little bit goes a long way and also lightens and brightens your eyes.  If you actually have white circles around your eyes after applying, you are most likely using way too much. Alternatively, you may have skin that doesn&#x27;t easily absorb physical blockers or takes longer to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product feels great, brightens the eye area and moisturizes well on my combination skin (slightly oily to slightly dry).  I can&#x27;t speak to how it works for people with very dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Highest SPF I could find in a eye cream.It is fast absorbing,moisturizing,works good under makeup.However there is a better option price-vise that is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few other SPF 30 or close eye creams I tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Denese SPF 30 Defense Eye Cream&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Eye Cream SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;are both tinted that I do not mind, but also both of them after couple weeks use changed consistency from smooth cream to chunky goop and ended up in a trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lancome Bienfait Multi-Vital Eye SPF 28&lt;br /&gt;is OK but I found it leaves some white residue on my skin and may not be a good fit for someone darker than very pale complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarins Sun Wrinkle Control Eye Contour Care SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;is a excellent product of a comparable quality to Shiseido but you get  more product for less money-0.7 oz. for $25.</li>
            <li> Applying daily, I noticed after about a week a significant increase and deepening in the wrinkles under my eyes. I discontinued use and within a few days my skin returned to normal. It may work well as a sunscreen, but it is not the product for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! I mix it with my concealer to protect my delicate eye area. Blends seamlessly and protects for hours.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen that is safe for the eye area. I had skin cancer near the eye. I highly recommend this product. It is not too heavy. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I like the cream but you will still need to apply a moisturizer with it. Overall, its a good product. :-)</li>
            <li> This product is excellent performance, superior product quality, giving a sense of comfort when using bright eye-catching package design.Very good</li>

That&#x27;s not to say that it doesn&#x27;t have moisturizing benefits, it just doesn&#x27;t have that rich thirst quenching feel when applying it to the skin. I love the high SPF, however, considering that my makeup is SPF 15 or 23 depending on which one I wear, after a trip to Grand Cayman and a couple of days wearing shiseido eye cream, the raccoon look slowly began. So in terms of SPF protection, this gets five stars. Just make sure your makeup and/or other sunscreen is equally as effective.&lt;br /&gt;I swam in the ocean and not to say that this is waterproof but it obviously provided me long lasting protection. I like it, but in the winter I might like something with more hydrating capabilities (hyaluronic acid perhaps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have sensitive skin and this did not bother me in the least, nor did it cause my eye makeup to run or bleed.  High quality but expensive. I did find it much cheaper at our local retailer TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li> I had been using another top brand of eye cream with an spf for years and when I needed more I couldn&#x27;t find it.  I started looking on Amazon for a replacement and found the Shiseido.  I have not been disappointed. Goes on nicely, a tiny amount goes a long way, no perfumes. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The only product with this high an spf that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes....at all.&lt;br /&gt;So glad to have found it again.</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere for eye cream with SPF protection, and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found -- and the SPF level is 32! No burning or any adverse effects.  I&#x27;ve gone through one tube (which lasted a very long time) and I am now ordering a second.  I don&#x27;t know why no one else makes a product like this, but I&#x27;m delighted that Shiseido does!</li>
            <li> then buy on. This is a good moisturizer; however it just adds a white tone to the under eye area. Personally, I prefer an eye cream that does not change my natural skin color. I basically would have to apply a light tone of make up to match the rest of my face.  White residues is always an issue with some sunblock creams and this is not the exception.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes above and beyond the call of duty. It&#x27;s the first eye area sunscreen I&#x27;ve used that does not irritate my eyes. After I started using this, the darker coloring on my eyelids started to match the skin on the rest of my face. I wear it by itself or under my eye make-up. When I wear it under my eye make-up, it prevents my eye make-up from settling into my creases.    I only wish this was available twenty years ago when I was in my twenties, I wouldn&#x27;t have so many fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. Wont use anything else around the eyes. It is a bit thick so I apply when face is still wet from washing, or add a little water. Dissappears into skin and does not leave white eyes either. Never, ever had problems with it getting in eyes from sweat or sports either. A little goes a long way, and I have not regretted using this product</li>
            <li> This is my daytime eye cream. I used to use a non-SPF eye cream, but after realizing how damaging the sun can be to the eye area (it&#x27;s very delicate and sensitive), I invested in this wonderful stuff. I use it along side the SPF 60 Ultimate Sun Protection Lotion N after my morning routine. It&#x27;s moisturizing, glides on easily, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. It&#x27;s got Zinc Oxide (9.3%), an excellent physical sunscreen that I really like to look for in my suncare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also lasts quite a while- while, yes, it is pricey, it&#x27;s well worth the money you spend.&lt;br /&gt;I use about the size of half a pea for both of my eyes every day, and the tube has lasted me over three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties, so I was looking for an eye cream to prevent (rather than correct) signs of aging. This product has a silky feel and blends well with my concealer - even when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, this cream makes my eyes look brighter. I&#x27;ve worn this to the gym and on long bike rides and it&#x27;s never sweated off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been so happy with this product. With daily application, one tube has lasted me 11 months. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Possibly even better than the discontinued Clarins product I used to use. Doesn&#x27;t sting or make your eyes puffy. Fab stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY sunscreen (and I&#x27;ve tried sooo many) that does not sting or make my eyes water. The whitening effect does not work well with my dark circles - turns them an unfortunate shade but it is worth it to protect my skin. I sometimes use a concealer on top to correct for that.</li>
    </ol>
