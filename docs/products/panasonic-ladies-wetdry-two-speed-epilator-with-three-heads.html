            <li>It comes with an additional shaving head attachment and a bikini trimmer of which I have not used yet which is also very good.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>While it still works great on this area, I think waxing may stil be best for a couple reasons.  </li>
            <li>great product but not the best for bikini area.</li>
            <li>Great quality and excellent product.</li>
            <li>One day the pain will be gone, and I will look beautiful.</li>
            <li>I think this works great.  </li>
            <li>shaver head and bikini comb are also great offerings provided by Panasonic as well.  </li>
            <li>All 3 attachments for one unit is a great value from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>All things considered, this epilator gives great results.</li>
            <li>The shaver attachment works great but the tweezer attachment does not.</li>
            <li>That being said, the pain was still great on the legs so beware.  </li>
            <li>but I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li>It works absolutely great (when lathered up) on the armpits.  </li>
            <li>It still works great in the shower on my underarms.</li>
            <li>For me, it works great on my legs.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think the trimmer or shaver were that great.  </li>
            <li>Thanx for great buy</li>
            <li>Everything looked great until she tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>Because this works great.  </li>
            <li>just great.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great epilator.</li>
            <li>so for me it was a great buy</li>
            <li>I thought it would be great.  </li>
            <li>and it still worked great.  </li>
            <li>It works great, doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>This product has been a great.</li>
            <li>This product has been a great introduction to the world of electric shavers/epilators.</li>
            <li>Great product while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It worked great on the legs - while it worked.</li>
            <li>just bumped this up to 4 stars as it is still working great.  </li>
            <li>i bought it about a year ago and still working great</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower, but it works great</li>
            <li>It works great for me under the arms and the bikini area, but be warned, the instructions say it&#x27;s not for use in those areas.</li>
            <li>great addition to feminine grooming.</li>
            <li>a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Happy hair-removing!e slower speed instead.</li>
            <li>but it HURT MORE!!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t get every hair but its very nice</li>
            <li>I soak for about 10 minutes in very warm water with baking soda before I use the product and exfoliate before I get going.</li>
            <li>It is also very nice feature that you can recharge it and take it in the bath or shower with you.</li>
            <li>luck to those buyers who can use this, or are successful with this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my hairs have changed, they seem softer to the touch and finer :) I AM SO HAPPY!   </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes overnight to fully charge the battery and, as most of these rechargable devices, it works best when fully charged.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I am completely satisfied and happy with the results, 3 weeks without shaving... and counting, Oh God, this is  good!</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge wonderfully and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works good.</li>
            <li>I returned on Brown models and they are really a good investment.  </li>
            <li>I loved it to death, literally.  </li>
            <li>My friend bought one and loved it</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this epilator was a great surprise.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because it&#x27;s a Panasonic and the price was good.</li>
            <li>I have not had a chance to try out the epilator yet but the shipping was speedy and the product in good order.</li>
            <li>Here are the good points of the product:  </li>
            <li>shaving head works fairly well too.</li>
            <li>it was still a good deal if I had to replace it every 6 or 9 months.</li>
            <li>I like the waterproof feature and the good battery life.</li>
            <li>Very good product, very quick shipment.</li>
            <li>I do think my Emjoi does a better job, but it&#x27;s great to have one for in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money, and one of my best beauty purchases yet.</li>
            <li>all I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love this epilator and am so happy that I made the purchase.    </li>
            <li>The epilator glided over my armpit very smoothly which facilitated on the epilation of my armpit hairs!</li>
            <li>Being able to use the product in the shower is really great.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that I was asked to review this item, because I now can tell you all how happy I am with it.</li>
            <li>Great Product still works after more than 3 years.</li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer, while nice in theory, isn&#x27;t as good as my husband&#x27;s beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>also LOVE the trimmer/shaver head!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this multi-purpose tool!  </li>
            <li>and I love that it can be used in the shower!</li>
            <li>This epilator is amazing.</li>
            <li>The looks of this product is nice, but I doubt I will use it again.  </li>
            <li>If you use it as directed,  you won&#x27;t feel too much pain while epilating, it&#x27;s just wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be as effective as I had hoped, however.</li>
            <li>arrived on time, fast and perfect condition.</li>
            <li>, it holds a charge nicely, nice that you can use it in the shower, so for that I give it 2 stars.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product thrilled with the thought that I could use an epilator in the shower.  </li>
            <li>so I liked how you can take the product into the shower.</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants to try buyin epilator for the 1st time, this one is awesome.</li>
            <li>handy product....</li>
            <li>so the blades rest nicely perpendicular to your leg.    </li>
            <li>In the beginning to be honest, it was excruciating (forgive my spelling).</li>
            <li>its battery time is good and prolong i love it</li>
            <li>Really, the best one on the market.</li>
            <li>Doesnt hurt that much, so smooth, I love it!!</li>
            <li>a good brand, it is working very well, and I am happy to have had the oportunity to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mainly because it was priced attractively &amp; was hoping it would be a good epilator for the money.  </li>
            <li>So far very happy.</li>
            <li>I own it for more than 2 years now</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so maybe epilators can&#x27;t grab it.  </li>
            <li>Its handy, best for last moment use if you are rushing for any party and want to get avoid salon appointments.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES2045P is wonderful, pretty much pain free, great features, and well designed.</li>
            <li>I have to say it hurt like hell the first time (I had not ever waxed before), but the results have been great.</li>
            <li>I noticed it really pulls out the shortest of hairs beautifully.</li>
            <li>This was my very first epilator - I&#x27;ve tried shaving, waxing and depilatory creams before, but I wanted to give this method a try because it was recommended by good friends.  </li>
            <li>a rubberized handle would be a nice design improvement) and it is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This epilator is a joy to use, easy to clean, and the instructions are easy.  </li>
            <li>so I could make sure I was using it the way they say to use</li>
            <li>I used to be able to do both legs in about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>feature my wife loves the most is that she can use this in the shower or bath tub.  </li>
            <li>Even then, there were many leftover hairs.  </li>
            <li>So, I started researching the latest in epilators.  </li>
            <li>its the damn bumps or most people say ingrown hairs that are my biggest problem.</li>
            <li>But the results are outstanding.     </li>
            <li>I think they could improve the design to be more textured for a better grip.  </li>
            <li>I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do bikini line/</li>
            <li>Results are wonderful - my hair comes back slower and thinner than shaving.  </li>
            <li>This product saves me from having to clutter up my space with more stuff.    </li>
            <li>The shaving head also works quite nicely, but it&#x27;s an electric razor, so don&#x27;t expect it to be as smooth as shaving with a bladed razor.  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem buy from amazon, i have to say i am truly satisfied</li>
            <li>and I have to say this one is way better.</li>
            <li>I´ve just noticed that you have to insist more if you want to get rid of absolutly all the hairs, but it compensates for the painless performance.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I used many types of epilator</li>
            <li>It does an ok job of removing hair but</li>
            <li>, it works great and is convenient because its cordless and therefore travel ready.</li>
            <li>**: After using this for about a year now, I can give a more thorough review.</li>
            <li>It hurts more for longer hairs (like arm hairs)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more work).</li>
            <li>I love it now, but it took some getting used to.</li>
            <li>I love it though.</li>
            <li>I personally love this epilator.  </li>
            <li>This product is okay if you have the time (and the patience) to sit there and shave your legs for quite a while...</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>I have to add, for all of those people that think that maybe I was using the epilator incorrectly, that I read the directions thoroughly and more than once, just to make sure that I was using the epilator/shaver correctly.</li>
            <li>The Braun is better at picking up the shorter and low-lying hairs.</li>
            <li>One more lesson learnt - always listen to your girlfriends when it comes to shaving products.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Although she doesn&#x27;t like cordless devices, this one has good reviews and also included something really useful: a trimmer for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>Kinda hairy, but not disgustingly hairy.</li>
            <li>I use it on my bikini area and it&#x27;s my favorite way to trim so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am using this machine for more than 6 months now</li>
            <li>but i give it four stars because i get most of my hair plucked in under 5 mins.</li>
            <li>I love using this on my legs.</li>
            <li>Great thanks to panasonic, amazon, and the company that shipped this item to me.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>and you should be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I was not at all happy with thte performance as it doesn&#x27;t pull much hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Most epilators have a singe head, except for another epilator that I own-the emjoi emagin rechargeable.</li>
            <li>That one is better or \\&quot;faster\\&quot; for legs and arms.     </li>
            <li>Some people feel more pain than others.</li>
            <li>but some people say that even tatoos hurt more than this.</li>
            <li>That hurts more than this, but even with a peicing I don&#x27;t care about the pain because it is not going to hurt forever.</li>
            <li>Please try to find another better option before you decide to buy this epilator.</li>
            <li>but please note, what best for me not always will work for you - this thing is an example of such rule.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the shaver, but the epilator is ok.  </li>
            <li>the fact that usage over time makes the hair thinner and more sparse</li>
            <li>Be sure to shop around for the lowest price.    </li>
            <li>: I love being able to take it in the shower or bath.</li>
            <li>In fact, it works better with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I find myself having to go over areas more, and it does take longer.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this epilator.</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t used an epilator before, it is probably going to hurt more than you expect.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the epilator&#x27;s fault; you are pulling many hairs out by the root, this is going to hurt.</li>
            <li>Epilating takes longer then shaving, you will not be able to jump in and out of the shower like shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used epilators for over 20 years and have found the Panasonic ES2045P to be the best at not only epilating but also for use shaving underarms and bikini line.</li>
            <li>I have used it, and have gone through more than 4 times, and it did not get all the hair.  </li>
            <li>but i do think there may be better and am still searching for better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a slicker lather that slides better along your skin, and also lasts longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like I said, I don&#x27;t need to shave any more.    </li>
            <li>Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very good product, easy to use, and even when wet, and the price is just reasonable, love it so much, great!</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic!!!!</li>
            <li>particular epilator is great because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works OK &amp; from what I can tell it works best with soap lather rather than dry.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a bikini trimmer/razor than this product is good, but I wanted it to work as an epilator first and foremost...</li>
            <li>I  make sure my skin and my hairs are really wet with very warm water and then soap up good</li>
            <li>: Works best after a shower- towel dry legs to  Underarms:</li>
            <li>and I can easily say that the thing this machine does may be described by many things; but epilating is not one of them.</li>
            <li>If your legs get dry, vaseline might be the best restorer.</li>
            <li>Sometimes that works best for a dry quickie.</li>
            <li>and it foams super nice.   </li>
            <li>NOT Recomended BTW, as it&#x27;s prone to grab the loose skin so best way</li>
            <li>That being said, it does an excellent job when used wet.  </li>
            <li>WHICH WAS FREE :)</li>
            <li>Most importantly it can be carried in handbag on tours and outings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first attempt at epilators and I am very pleased with how it works so</li>
            <li>So far it works great.</li>
            <li>My legs have never been more smooth.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this machine; it does not give any pain, since it does not pull any hair!</li>
            <li>I have a very low pain threshold, and I loved this from Day 1!   </li>
            <li>and it was so quick and easy and PAINLESS!  </li>
            <li>There was some great bit of pain at first but the more I used it the less pain I experienced and</li>
            <li>The opening of the pores allows for easy and painless extraction of the hair from her legs.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t grab hair as easily as I would like, therefore it would take me a good hour to 45 minutes of using the epilator to achieve decent results.  </li>
            <li>I get a couple of ingrown hairs from using this, but they&#x27;re easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>This epilator is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>It was the best in its category and is useful addition to ur personal accessory kit.</li>
            <li>Easy to use...</li>
            <li>In the begining it worked somehow, but it wasn&#x27;t as good as my old epilator even after I used it for so many years.</li>
            <li>I bought this three years ago and I can say it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it in the shower or tub is a real plus too since epilating is best done with open pores.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers I think on the legs and armpits it works best in the shower when you are nice and lathered up with soap - the lather helps get rid of the friction as the head moves over the skin and it&#x27;s a much smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>I charged this Panasonic Wet/Dry Two Speed Epliator for more than 20 hours, which is what they recommend charging it before the first use, 20 hours, but I wanted to make sure it was fully charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you find that it&#x27;s pulling hairs and breaking them above the skin&#x27;s surface, instead of pulling them out like it&#x27;s supposed to (this is especially true for women whose body hair is very fine like mine</li>
            <li>On a positive note, the cordless function is nice, as is the wet/dry option.</li>
            <li>got this new one and its perfect, even better than the last one.</li>
            <li>An AWESOME feature because you just wash all the hairs down the drain and you can rinse the epilator clean</li>
            <li>I am a huge baby when it comes to pain</li>
            <li>but I use it in the shower (a huge plus with this one, and also the cordless option) and use shower gel.  </li>
            <li>but I swear it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy not have to shave my underarms or legs for weeks at a time.</li>
            <li>provided making it sound as though you could use it while plugged in.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my chin, really soapy with warm water</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;ll use it primarily for your legs then go for it</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone whether advanced or just beginning.</li>
            <li>I should have purchased the Braun to begin with, especially since one of my friends told me the Braun works great.</li>
            <li>Somewhat cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It works great and it is the only reason this epilator is not going to trash can.</li>
            <li>It leaves your legs smooth for days at a time.</li>
            <li>I got it primarily for the bikini area --</li>
            <li>works well and the shaver is nice and fast</li>
            <li>, convenient  Cons: does not remove a lot of the hair, takes a lot longer than more powerful epilators and even then does not remove a lot of the hair  </li>
            <li>so it works great on the upper lip and chin, and underarms.</li>
            <li>They say by plucking the hairs you are hair free for 4-6 weeks without having the hassle of shaving them every day.</li>
            <li>I then didn&#x27;t even get the &#x27;smooth&#x27; stage before I had stubble.  </li>
            <li>This one does not do as good of job as my old one.</li>
            <li>The model I had before this one had a light attachment which was very useful</li>
            <li>and makes cleaning the product quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>bought it to shave my legs, it seems to work just fine, and it true to the advertisment that I read when I bought it</li>
            <li>Also I found out in the instructions that there are certain areas you&#x27;re not supposed to use the epilator (I&#x27;ve used it on my arms, legs, and for the very fine hair on my stomach).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time epilator, and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Completely worth it!</li>
            <li>but I would suggest spending a bit more money and get a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>I always through about buying an epilator but still remembered the reviews on the original ones from years ago.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Ladies, and/or Gents, get yourself Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two Speed Epilator, with three heads, in a beautiful Pink.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet, but using it dry works great.    </li>
            <li>Ofcourse it does a clean job that stayed for 2 weeks unlike the razors which needs ur attention every 3 days.</li>
            <li>each time I stop it to clean the tip.</li>
            <li>My 25 year old epilady was ready for retirement, and this is a great upgrade.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>The battery life is only good for like 15 minutes or two body parts.</li>
            <li>really just OK.</li>
            <li>I am ready to move on and find a better epilator.     </li>
            <li>ITs cool.</li>
            <li>No ugly bumps or razor burn.</li>
            <li>And believe it is not painful.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be cool to not have to deal with stubble anymore, but it just does not work with my hair type.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never owned such a good epilator.</li>
            <li>My legs and shins were not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really not so bad.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad after that...   </li>
            <li>and not a bad item..</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several years now, and the hair on my legs has gotten thinner and more sparse from using it, and it is very quick and easy to remove the hair now with the epilator.</li>
            <li>I am sure the second time will be a lot better.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t completely pain free, but it was much better.  </li>
            <li>I tried using this product many ways under many different conditions, and it never, ever gave me the \\&quot;4-week sleek!\\&quot; of its advertising.  </li>
            <li>It took 40 minutes to do most of one leg, but left many hairs in even so.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it in the shower (though it is kind of slippery when wet ...</li>
            <li>I can take it wherever and shave quickly.</li>
            <li>Then its very gliding &amp; very cool.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this Epilator and would recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li>The epilator worked as advertised and as long as I did everything recommended it worked good.  </li>
            <li>it also has a small head, so even if it did work perfectly, you dont remove much hair at once.</li>
            <li>Although, useful and relatively quick.</li>
            <li>When I used it in the shower it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as just dry shaving.  </li>
            <li>My first epilator was the original Epilady.  </li>
            <li>my legs have straight hairs that are fine - didn&#x27;t remove.  </li>
            <li>This little thing is so great and so well priced.</li>
            <li>The tweezing method of the ceramic disks in this product is definitely the best design I&#x27;ve seen in action so far.</li>
            <li>The panasonic was a great waste of money.</li>
            <li>I do think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about the Panasonic Epilator is that it does not hurt as much as others..</li>
            <li>simply did not remove all the hair effectively.  </li>
            <li>BUT ITS SO WORTH</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not good on my legs, either, even wet in the shower.  </li>
            <li>As with all epilation, it is time consuming to do your legs, but the soap suds make it easier, and it&#x27;s worth it because you dont have to do it that often.   </li>
            <li>Most of all, the tweezing mechanism does not grab hairs of any length or thickness as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>But the thing is, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>But I tell you the pain is WORTH it.</li>
            <li>(just make sure to use a lot of soap lather when epilating wet, I think soap lather works better than shaving cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still the same and still effective</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator on a killer sale at a local store because it was a cordless model and seemed like it would be nice.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re going to get an epilator, this Panasonic Wet/Dry is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>highly recommend this epilator, it&#x27;s a quality product that works well and has fantastic features that make it super useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful, works really well.</li>
            <li>The shaver attachment all right</li>
            <li>so right now I don&#x27;t feel any pain at all.</li>
            <li>Right now it holds a charge for two epilating sessions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to stand using it on my underarms and more intimate areas with minimum pain - and believe me, I&#x27;ve used an epilator dry in those areas before and it hurt like a son of a gun!    </li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t used it wet, but I love how easy it is and</li>
            <li>Have to continuously go over the same area and does not grab very fine hair.</li>
            <li>This one works great, no pain and very few ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>The reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish the battery charge would last longer than 30 min, but that is enough time to do a great job on your legs and armpits.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a quality build, but the motor is not as strong as a model that works directly as a corded model.</li>
            <li>Does not remove all of the hair, few than more, waxing is much better and quicker comparing to this product.</li>
            <li>The best way was in the shower with a thick moisturizing body wash squeezed directly onto the epilator.  </li>
            <li>even 6 weeks later it is still very light.  </li>
            <li>I have previously used the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress and the Braun Silk Epil, and I have to say this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>The shaving head works fairly well, but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how quickly your hair grows back, it can last a good 2-3 weeks without having to re-epilate.   </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product and gave it the full benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li>This one is so much better once in a while you feel a little pinch but being able to use it in the shower really helps.  </li>
            <li>It says not to use within 2-3 days before going into a pool or hot tub, not to use before or during menstrating.</li>
            <li>I use a pool and hot tub often.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>This was also my first epilator.  </li>
            <li>I bought another Epilator from Braun and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I remembered it hurt when I first used it</li>
            <li>I would love to get my underarms waxed on a regular basis, but there is no way I could afford that.  </li>
            <li>What I wish I had known before I bought it:    That it takes 20 hours to charge the first time you use it, or after having not used it for a while.</li>
            <li>However, it takes multiple passes in all directions and circular movements to get most of the hair.</li>
            <li>I was reading that is better to use it without the skin protector thing, next time I´ll</li>
            <li>It works very well and no problem yet!</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator that I ever owned.</li>
            <li>so think about trimming those first (</li>
            <li>This was my first epilator.  </li>
            <li>but overall, i wasnt too pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using one</li>
            <li>If Panasonic could work on that they would have a stellar product on their hands.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that once you are in \\&quot;maintenance mode\\&quot; the process is not uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li>It helps too, to understand that epilating is a process and you cannot get it all done the first time you use the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Panasonic Wet/Dry epilator after my Emjoi Optima was either dropped or knocked of the vanity many times and one of the tweezing sides finally broke.  </li>
            <li>is to make sure you focus on specific spots on the leg, stretch the surface area out</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator about 6 months ago and it is my first one I&#x27;ve ever bought or used.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time</li>
            <li>At first I was using it on untrimmed hair and the epilator was getting clogged a lot.  </li>
            <li>Yes it hurt the first time</li>
            <li>This my second one and the first was so much better.</li>
            <li>The first one was a Philips Norelco Satinelle Ice, I didnt find this anymore.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to work for the most part but left some areas with hair.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this to me, it turns out very efficient!</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no way to pull your hair out completely pain free, so if this is the reason why you don&#x27;t wanna buy it, don&#x27;t buy an epilator, buy a trimmer.</li>
            <li>I used to have an epilady and after 7 years it died on me I wish I still had the old one it worked better than this new one.</li>
            <li>Every time you use it after the first is a whole lot better, especially if you&#x27;re keeping up.    </li>
            <li>The shipment was fast, the price is low and the quality the top.</li>
            <li>I got a small panasonic epilator that works pretty good</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it quite as much as I did when I first got it.</li>
            <li>My old one, which was Bruan, would do this fast and effectively, and actually remove the hair!</li>
            <li>One swipe over your leg and the hair is pretty much all gone.</li>
            <li>I have been using an electric shaver for a long time, and thought this might be a better alternitive.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never done electrolysis before, you&#x27;re going to be in for a real shock the first time you use this....</li>
            <li>I loved it until the battery wore out and I am not sure what to do about that.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair in the first sweep, but it gets a fair amount of it and prevents it from growing back for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure why, I&#x27;ve cleaned it out and have taken good care of it.</li>
            <li>I though this would be really effective because it has so many tweezers and a larger surface area to cover, but I found i had to use it on the same spot several times to get the hair out.</li>
            <li>Finding it works much better dry.  </li>
            <li>So yes, it is worth the pain and epilators are expensive but it does pay to be beautiful.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I have a hair trimmer made by Panasonic that has been going strong for over ten years</li>
            <li>I guess the people who make epilady don&#x27;t want to fix that problem, so I researched all the epilators I could find, and settled on this model because of the reasonable cost and the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty cool and the shaver works pretty well actually.</li>
            <li>I got in the shower, lathered up, did my face, my bikini line, my underarms AND my calves and thighs with nothing more then an occasional \\&quot;funny face\\&quot; in really sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet as it works great dry.  </li>
            <li>I cannot comment on using it wet, but it does work great dry.</li>
            <li>It does not capture every hair, especially the fine ones.</li>
            <li>While never as fast or as efficient as the plug-in for power epilators, it stopped pulling hair out, leaving the victim (me) with more like shaved legs.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with this item.</li>
            <li>I read these reviews, and was fascinated with the whole wet/dry/cordless thing.  </li>
            <li>It takes so much time to epilate and even after finishing it, let&#x27;s a lot of hairs.</li>
            <li>i gave it two stars because the trimmer worked very well</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten thinner and don&#x27;t grow as much.</li>
            <li>I should have spent more for an Emjoi.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Waxing does the whole area in one fell swoop</li>
            <li>as I mentioned before, I have used both the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress and Braun before this and never had this problem with the ingrowns.</li>
            <li>I really bought it for my underarms since shaving</li>
            <li>but I have to say that it really doesn&#x27;t work for my underarms.</li>
            <li>I also found that it didn&#x27;t grab the hair very well at all</li>
            <li>You have to follow directions and lather up a lot before the epilator starts to work really well.</li>
            <li>the only way i can get my legs smooth for longer than a day is to epilate, then shave.</li>
            <li>and I expected alot more pain.  </li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s really all I have to say.</li>
            <li>This product just really does not do the job.</li>
            <li>I was very please with this company that sold me the item.</li>
            <li>She cannot epilate one of her legs with the whole charge and then she has to wait 12 hours for this to charge and be ready again.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t catch and pull the hairs out very well.</li>
            <li>When I am in too much of a rush to finish epilating, I switch the head and shave the rest</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>She keeps asking me how much I paid for it.</li>
            <li>&quot; so much as maybe discomfort and just until you get used to it.</li>
            <li>But the pain I should say was very negligible.</li>
            <li>Some features were promising:</li>
            <li>and it really does help.    </li>
            <li>real well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li>The end result was a fairly smooth back that has remained so for about 4 weeks and</li>
            <li>The shaver works very well for under arms.</li>
            <li>Made very well but after 1.5 years it started to rattle.</li>
            <li>The problem I have with the razor is that it doesn&#x27;t give me a really close shave and doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>This thing made shaving much easier for her.</li>
            <li>my wife uses it all the time, thanks rvv.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and it has always worked really well.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really a pain,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Works very well and gets even the shortest hairs.  </li>
            <li>This makes the epilation much longer and not efficient at all.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It was my second choise, after I have had a Brown model for so many years, and it become old.</li>
            <li>The process is not painful at all, but this is because it barely removes any hairs from her legs.</li>
            <li>I would honestly avoid this product at all costs just because 30 minutes of charge is simply not enough for your legs but might be enough for underarms.</li>
            <li>Not only do I have the choice of using it while my skin is dry (great for a quick touch up) or wet (very helpful for epilation), but I can also shave, trim my bikini line or pluck out unwanted hairs.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I am pleased with this epilator.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate these seemingly small things because it helps keep the machine clean and is easily maintainable.     </li>
            <li>When I finally decided to buy this product I was excited to get it and start using it.</li>
            <li>It does hurt like hell the first few times, but I got through that ok,</li>
            <li>It really works though I haven&#x27;t had time to see how long I was hair free.  </li>
            <li>Because you use it in the shower, you can easily rinse and dry it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you are looking for a reasonably price product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>a huge fan of waxing, but not a huge fan of spending anywhere from 50 to hundreds of dollars every time I want to be smooth; and also not a huge fan of home waxing kits, which have pulled off more of my skin than they&#x27;ve pulled out my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With every kind and model there were positive and negative feedbacks.</li>
            <li>Its also pretty loud, even on the lower of the two speeds.</li>
            <li>i was surprised when i first used it.</li>
            <li>did my bikini area - again definately works better and hurts less when your skin is lathered up.  </li>
            <li>The more often you do, the less the pain gets.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using my epilator in the shower instead of using it dry.</li>
            <li>I choose this one mainly because of the price</li>
            <li>I have a beard trimmer I use for my bikini line which was only ten bucks which works better.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend to replace an older Remington epilator which had stopped working after 5 years.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it wet, which makes all the difference in the world as far as pain goes.</li>
            <li>Make sure to pull the under arm skin as tight as you can.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But maybe I&#x27;m spoiled and my expectations are too high.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely better than shaving, and less costly than waxing, but this model kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>The posibility to be used in the shower makes the process less messy and more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I will give it a little more time and see if it clears up.</li>
            <li>I mostly bought it because I have trouble with my bikini line and underarms--</li>
            <li>and I still am missing spots, this product was $30 more at Target</li>
            <li>I think this is normal with epilators.</li>
            <li>After many times of pulling out hair at the root, you are sort of destroying the root</li>
            <li>It cleans very very well, a little hurts tho... but worth it!</li>
            <li>I do like the wet option, but for a quick touch up the dry is just as fine.</li>
            <li>but when you are done it has to go right on the charger again for the next day.  </li>
            <li>She heard stores about how painful epliators could be but did not experience the pain and is now is enjoying the benefit of smoother leggs - less frequent shavers - 5 Stars for sure!!!</li>
            <li>I just spent about 30, and still have a significant amount of hair on my legs.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the other trimmer attachment as well.  </li>
            <li>Epilating was all new to me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to have to buy a new epilator.</li>
            <li>besides I think I may just buy a new one since this one does not work for me.</li>
            <li>At the time, I couldn&#x27;t afford a new machine.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to buy a new one instead of buying a voltage adaptor.</li>
            <li>I had to rub it several times on my skin to pull out the hair, there were certain hairs that it just did not pull out at all!</li>
            <li>For those people who are complaining that the charge didn&#x27;t last very long, keep this in mind: when used the first time, it needs to be charged a full 20 hours before use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shave head and bikini trimmer also work really well, although I only really use the trimmer b/c</li>
            <li>The shave head and bikini trimmer also work really well, although I only really use the trimmer b/c</li>
            <li>She loves it and was very surprised and the ease of use.</li>
            <li>received on time, need to be careful while usinging in the more delicate part of the body, works fine and</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>This seems totally excessive and disproportionate by most battery standards.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not supposed to go over the same area multiple times, but that was the only way to get even most of the hair.    </li>
            <li>I have used this model on my legs for 2 years now and after probably the first 3-4 times I used it, I felt only discomfort on my legs.</li>
            <li>First, batteries last nothing.</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this especially for my arm pits.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased goods through Amazon and it gives me confidence for future purchases</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time, and also It is my first time using an epilator.</li>
            <li>This is my second epilator, my first an Emoji.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to worry if it gets wet or you drop it in the sink full of water.</li>
            <li>I have more than average facial hair and it does say in the instructions not to use on face (didn&#x27;t know this until I got it)</li>
            <li>i have pretty sensitive legs and hair that grows back with the slightest chill in the air.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is you cannot use it while it is charging and then with a full recharge you can only use it for the hands.</li>
            <li>but i was looking more for an epilator, the rest was a plus, and the epilator function is not very good.</li>
            <li>comparison, my first epilator can do a decent 85-90% hair removal with a single run.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it wet or dry even.</li>
            <li>It is just tweezing really fast when you get right down to it.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have fine invisible hair, my hairs are thick and grow fast.</li>
            <li>and hurts much less than my original epilady.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic works ok, but not sure epilating in general is for me.</li>
            <li>After a while of using this, you do get used to the hair being pulled, but it has yet to stop being painful for me (more than a year of use), but it&#x27;s over within 2 minutes and is more efficient than tweezing.</li>
            <li>I used it so much that it finally just gave out on me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months so far and even let the hair grow out 1/4 inch and</li>
            <li>So for the price of one professional waxing session I bought this epilator.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts much longer than the manual says it will, I&#x27;ve used mine multiple times longer than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I ran over my chin a only a couple times and it got even the smallest thinest hairs you couldn&#x27;t really see.</li>
            <li>Idk... the frozen action did NOT help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a 4 years old epilator of another brand</li>
            <li>so far I like it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even get all the hair either, it leaves the short hairs that you can&#x27;t really see</li>
            <li>It breaks it off near the skin.</li>
            <li>: I suspect that because it is cordless, it has nowhere near the power that the epilady models I&#x27;m used to have.</li>
            <li>exactly how long</li>
            <li>She was using old fashioned razor blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough even for the armpit area and it pulls even the smallest hairs that you can&#x27;t even see.  </li>
            <li>I use in the tub with a lot of shower gel that I pour directly on the epilator&#x27;s head</li>
            <li>It DOES NOT hurt any more than the faster one - a common reason for avoiding it.</li>
            <li>It DOES NOT hurt any more than the faster one - a common reason for avoiding it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money and the results, for me at least , have been well worth it.</li>
            <li>The interchangeable shaver and trimer work well and are useful for getting longer hair short enough to epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love epilating but this one missed a lot of hair and was slow not like others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I find that it works better if you use soap or bath gel instead of shaving cream, and also go SLOWLY.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s sick and tired of hairs allover their floors and wants nice smooth hairless skin in the comfort of their own tub.</li>
            <li>so I dont have to clean up the mess afterwards.....</li>
            <li>This epilator is I think just as fast in speed as other epilators, but it is much, much quieter.</li>
            <li>Even though all the bad stuff I&#x27;ve mentioned I&#x27;m still pretty happy with my purchase because I only have to do it</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s try it for a little longer to see more long term results.ant to just shave instead</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s try it for a little longer to see more long term results.</li>
            <li>The reason why I like two heads is because I think it pulls out more hair in less amount of time than a single headed one.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve only tried it in the shower once, so maybe it works better wet than dry.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my arms (which is more painful than the legs!), but I love the results!</li>
            <li>Definitely shower first or if possible stay in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Now I see why it may be beneficial to spend the extra money on a high end model.</li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth surface and can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li>You get the same smooth results as waxing, but none of the mess; you won&#x27;t run out of wax strips or constantly throw money away buying new supplies or paying to have it done professionally since this has a rechargeable battery.     </li>
            <li>I recently got back to being able to afford a few luxuries.  </li>
            <li>I read the directions carefully, tried to get the soap exactly the consistency they recommend...  </li>
            <li>Given the way the old epilator felt, I&#x27;m very happy with this new one because I feel that the hair removal is much less painful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d buy this particular item again, but it worth the money I did spend on it.</li>
            <li>Initially there is a little pinching but after that, it is smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>I found that without lather the movement was somewhat jerky, the head didn&#x27;t slide over the skin and smoothly and it was more painful.</li>
            <li>I have an old braun epilator that I like--my only issue is that it is old and corded.  </li>
            <li>The price is better and the machine is way more gentle and less painful</li>
            <li>it is so fine you hardly notice.  </li>
            <li>Also, when it&#x27;s nearing empty battery, it slows down and becomes as good as dead.</li>
            <li>Wasted quite a pretty penny to buy this over fifty something bucks!</li>
            <li>I am a man and bought it to clean up my back hair, which while it isn&#x27;t heavy, I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>I find my legs are softer in general then</li>
            <li>Cordless - Battery doesn&#x27;t last too long, and if I forget to recharge it, it won&#x27;t be ready for me to use whenever I want to</li>
            <li>I had the old blue epilator and it stopped working (was y fault)</li>
            <li>I chose the Panasonic Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epliator with Three Heads (actually just two, but an attachment gives one of the heads dual functionality) because of the multi-functionality it offers.  </li>
            <li>no i&#x27;m trying to return it and go back to my old one \\&quot;braun\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it wet and had to spend too much time getting the water out of it.</li>
            <li>I have shaved, waxed, professional laser hair removal, personal home laser hair removal, hair removal creams and</li>
            <li>It barely grabs hairs and it ruined my bikini line, I now have scars because of it.</li>
            <li>Apparently that product is now discontinued.</li>
            <li>I tried it both ways and it barely removed any hairs from my legs.  </li>
            <li>I also find that after I use it I have red spots everywhere that a hair was pulled out and that my skin is sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have heavy hair growth, either - I&#x27;ve waxed or epilated enough in the past that there&#x27;s just not that much hair there any more.    </li>
            <li>I cannot use regular razors because my skin is sensitive and will itch incessantly after shaving.</li>
            <li>I usually keep a disposable razor in the shower for times I need a quick touch up</li>
            <li>I just make sure the hairs are very short and go very slow</li>
            <li>and therefore you are only in pain for a moment as opposed to several minutes with the epilator; because your bikini line is so sensitive, this makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li>I must say though, in the first few days I&#x27;ve owned this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure once I&#x27;m using this on a regular basis that I won&#x27;t have so much trouble missing hairs.    </li>
            <li>The wet option was the main selling point for me, and I did read the reviews, but I guess everyone is different, pain tolerance</li>
            <li>Folks who have never used an epilator before will likely be thrilled with this product but those who have used epilators for years will likely be left uninspired.  </li>
            <li>The hair is literally yanked from your body (more painful than tweezing!), but done so very quickly.</li>
            <li>Unlike a previous epilator I&#x27;d had, this one can&#x27;t be used while it is recharging, so that&#x27;s a real nuisance.</li>
            <li>However, the instructions clearly state how long the hair should be and that it may need to be used twice to get all of the hair since it grows at different paces.</li>
            <li>could barely use it, and it left my skin really red.  </li>
            <li>Mine holds a full charge for a LONG time, I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li>Eventually in time the hairs grow back less but softer, thinner, and lighter in color until one day you really wouldn&#x27;t be epilating very often, and the hairs will be less noticeable.</li>
            <li>So the first time is definitely the most painful, and it gets easier after that.</li>
            <li>I say this because I am not sure if the pain would be different on someone with more fatty tissue.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product primarily because I don&#x27;t have time to shave everyday, and I don&#x27;t like the mess of at-home waxing.</li>
            <li>Just as with tweezing, sometimes if you pull too hard, the hair breaks instead of popping out, so you pull a little slower and more focused.</li>
            <li>Just as with tweezing, sometimes if you pull too hard, the hair breaks instead of popping out, so you pull a little slower and more focused.</li>
            <li>You get used to the slipperiness after a while, and it&#x27;s not so much of a problem, but it takes a little practice.    </li>
            <li>It comes with a little cap, which I really appreciate (Braun does not).   </li>
            <li>It is gentle, but may take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>It works really well for the legs and arms too, but since the head is much smaller than other epilators it does take a long time to get done.</li>
            <li>It took at least twice as much time to epilate than the old epilator I had and missed hair.</li>

            <li> While it still works great on this area, I think waxing may stil be best for a couple reasons.  </li>

            <li> All things considered, this epilator gives great results.</li>
            <li> The shaver attachment works great but the tweezer attachment does not.</li>
            <li> That being said, the pain was still great on the legs so beware.  </li>
            <li> but I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li> It works absolutely great (when lathered up) on the armpits.  </li>
            <li> It still works great in the shower on my underarms.</li>
            <li> For me, it works great on my legs.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think the trimmer or shaver were that great.  </li>
            <li> Thanx for great buy</li>
            <li> Everything looked great until she tried to use it.  </li>

            <li> It works great, doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> This product has been a great.</li>
            <li> This product has been a great introduction to the world of electric shavers/epilators.</li>
            <li> Great product while it lasted.</li>
            <li> It worked great on the legs - while it worked.</li>
            <li> just bumped this up to 4 stars as it is still working great.  </li>
            <li> i bought it about a year ago and still working great</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower, but it works great</li>

            <li> great addition to feminine grooming.</li>
            <li> a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Happy hair-removing!e slower speed instead.</li>
            <li> but it HURT MORE!!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t get every hair but its very nice</li>
            <li> I soak for about 10 minutes in very warm water with baking soda before I use the product and exfoliate before I get going.</li>
            <li> It is also very nice feature that you can recharge it and take it in the bath or shower with you.</li>
            <li> luck to those buyers who can use this, or are successful with this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hairs have changed, they seem softer to the touch and finer :) I AM SO HAPPY!   </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes overnight to fully charge the battery and, as most of these rechargable devices, it works best when fully charged.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am completely satisfied and happy with the results, 3 weeks without shaving... and counting, Oh God, this is  good!</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge wonderfully and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works good.</li>
            <li> I returned on Brown models and they are really a good investment.  </li>
            <li> I loved it to death, literally.  </li>
            <li> My friend bought one and loved it</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this epilator was a great surprise.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s a Panasonic and the price was good.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to try out the epilator yet but the shipping was speedy and the product in good order.</li>
            <li> Here are the good points of the product:  </li>
            <li> shaving head works fairly well too.</li>
            <li> it was still a good deal if I had to replace it every 6 or 9 months.</li>
            <li> I like the waterproof feature and the good battery life.</li>
            <li> Very good product, very quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I do think my Emjoi does a better job, but it&#x27;s great to have one for in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money, and one of my best beauty purchases yet.</li>
            <li> all I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love this epilator and am so happy that I made the purchase.    </li>
            <li> The epilator glided over my armpit very smoothly which facilitated on the epilation of my armpit hairs!</li>
            <li> Being able to use the product in the shower is really great.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that I was asked to review this item, because I now can tell you all how happy I am with it.</li>
            <li> Great Product still works after more than 3 years.</li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer, while nice in theory, isn&#x27;t as good as my husband&#x27;s beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> also LOVE the trimmer/shaver head!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this multi-purpose tool!  </li>
            <li> and I love that it can be used in the shower!</li>
            <li> This epilator is amazing.</li>
            <li> The looks of this product is nice, but I doubt I will use it again.  </li>
            <li> If you use it as directed,  you won&#x27;t feel too much pain while epilating, it&#x27;s just wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be as effective as I had hoped, however.</li>
            <li> arrived on time, fast and perfect condition.</li>
            <li> , it holds a charge nicely, nice that you can use it in the shower, so for that I give it 2 stars.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product thrilled with the thought that I could use an epilator in the shower.  </li>
            <li> so I liked how you can take the product into the shower.</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants to try buyin epilator for the 1st time, this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> handy product....</li>
            <li> so the blades rest nicely perpendicular to your leg.    </li>
            <li> In the beginning to be honest, it was excruciating (forgive my spelling).</li>
            <li> its battery time is good and prolong i love it</li>
            <li> Really, the best one on the market.</li>
            <li> Doesnt hurt that much, so smooth, I love it!!</li>
            <li> a good brand, it is working very well, and I am happy to have had the oportunity to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because it was priced attractively &amp; was hoping it would be a good epilator for the money.  </li>
            <li> So far very happy.</li>
            <li> I own it for more than 2 years now</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so maybe epilators can&#x27;t grab it.  </li>
            <li> Its handy, best for last moment use if you are rushing for any party and want to get avoid salon appointments.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES2045P is wonderful, pretty much pain free, great features, and well designed.</li>
            <li> I have to say it hurt like hell the first time (I had not ever waxed before), but the results have been great.</li>
            <li> I noticed it really pulls out the shortest of hairs beautifully.</li>
            <li> This was my very first epilator - I&#x27;ve tried shaving, waxing and depilatory creams before, but I wanted to give this method a try because it was recommended by good friends.  </li>
            <li> a rubberized handle would be a nice design improvement) and it is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This epilator is a joy to use, easy to clean, and the instructions are easy.  </li>
            <li> so I could make sure I was using it the way they say to use</li>
            <li> I used to be able to do both legs in about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> feature my wife loves the most is that she can use this in the shower or bath tub.  </li>
            <li> Even then, there were many leftover hairs.  </li>
            <li> So, I started researching the latest in epilators.  </li>
            <li> its the damn bumps or most people say ingrown hairs that are my biggest problem.</li>
            <li> But the results are outstanding.     </li>
            <li> I think they could improve the design to be more textured for a better grip.  </li>
            <li> I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do bikini line/</li>
            <li> Results are wonderful - my hair comes back slower and thinner than shaving.  </li>
            <li> This product saves me from having to clutter up my space with more stuff.    </li>
            <li> The shaving head also works quite nicely, but it&#x27;s an electric razor, so don&#x27;t expect it to be as smooth as shaving with a bladed razor.  </li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem buy from amazon, i have to say i am truly satisfied</li>
            <li> and I have to say this one is way better.</li>
            <li> I´ve just noticed that you have to insist more if you want to get rid of absolutly all the hairs, but it compensates for the painless performance.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I used many types of epilator</li>
            <li> It does an ok job of removing hair but</li>
            <li> , it works great and is convenient because its cordless and therefore travel ready.</li>
            <li> **: After using this for about a year now, I can give a more thorough review.</li>
            <li> It hurts more for longer hairs (like arm hairs)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more work).</li>
            <li> I love it now, but it took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I love it though.</li>
            <li> I personally love this epilator.  </li>
            <li> This product is okay if you have the time (and the patience) to sit there and shave your legs for quite a while...</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> I have to add, for all of those people that think that maybe I was using the epilator incorrectly, that I read the directions thoroughly and more than once, just to make sure that I was using the epilator/shaver correctly.</li>
            <li> The Braun is better at picking up the shorter and low-lying hairs.</li>
            <li> One more lesson learnt - always listen to your girlfriends when it comes to shaving products.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Although she doesn&#x27;t like cordless devices, this one has good reviews and also included something really useful: a trimmer for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Kinda hairy, but not disgustingly hairy.</li>
            <li> I use it on my bikini area and it&#x27;s my favorite way to trim so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am using this machine for more than 6 months now</li>
            <li> but i give it four stars because i get most of my hair plucked in under 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I love using this on my legs.</li>
            <li> Great thanks to panasonic, amazon, and the company that shipped this item to me.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> and you should be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I was not at all happy with thte performance as it doesn&#x27;t pull much hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Most epilators have a singe head, except for another epilator that I own-the emjoi emagin rechargeable.</li>
            <li> That one is better or \\&quot;faster\\&quot; for legs and arms.     </li>
            <li> Some people feel more pain than others.</li>
            <li> but some people say that even tatoos hurt more than this.</li>
            <li> That hurts more than this, but even with a peicing I don&#x27;t care about the pain because it is not going to hurt forever.</li>
            <li> Please try to find another better option before you decide to buy this epilator.</li>
            <li> but please note, what best for me not always will work for you - this thing is an example of such rule.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the shaver, but the epilator is ok.  </li>
            <li> the fact that usage over time makes the hair thinner and more sparse</li>
            <li> Be sure to shop around for the lowest price.    </li>
            <li> : I love being able to take it in the shower or bath.</li>
            <li> In fact, it works better with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I find myself having to go over areas more, and it does take longer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this epilator.</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t used an epilator before, it is probably going to hurt more than you expect.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the epilator&#x27;s fault; you are pulling many hairs out by the root, this is going to hurt.</li>
            <li> Epilating takes longer then shaving, you will not be able to jump in and out of the shower like shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for over 20 years and have found the Panasonic ES2045P to be the best at not only epilating but also for use shaving underarms and bikini line.</li>
            <li> I have used it, and have gone through more than 4 times, and it did not get all the hair.  </li>
            <li> but i do think there may be better and am still searching for better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slicker lather that slides better along your skin, and also lasts longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like I said, I don&#x27;t need to shave any more.    </li>
            <li> Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very good product, easy to use, and even when wet, and the price is just reasonable, love it so much, great!</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic!!!!</li>
            <li> particular epilator is great because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works OK &amp; from what I can tell it works best with soap lather rather than dry.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a bikini trimmer/razor than this product is good, but I wanted it to work as an epilator first and foremost...</li>
            <li> I  make sure my skin and my hairs are really wet with very warm water and then soap up good</li>
            <li> : Works best after a shower- towel dry legs to  Underarms:</li>
            <li> and I can easily say that the thing this machine does may be described by many things; but epilating is not one of them.</li>
            <li> If your legs get dry, vaseline might be the best restorer.</li>
            <li> Sometimes that works best for a dry quickie.</li>
            <li> and it foams super nice.   </li>
            <li> NOT Recomended BTW, as it&#x27;s prone to grab the loose skin so best way</li>
            <li> That being said, it does an excellent job when used wet.  </li>
            <li> WHICH WAS FREE :)</li>
            <li> Most importantly it can be carried in handbag on tours and outings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first attempt at epilators and I am very pleased with how it works so</li>
            <li> So far it works great.</li>
            <li> My legs have never been more smooth.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this machine; it does not give any pain, since it does not pull any hair!</li>
            <li> I have a very low pain threshold, and I loved this from Day 1!   </li>
            <li> and it was so quick and easy and PAINLESS!  </li>
            <li> There was some great bit of pain at first but the more I used it the less pain I experienced and</li>
            <li> The opening of the pores allows for easy and painless extraction of the hair from her legs.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grab hair as easily as I would like, therefore it would take me a good hour to 45 minutes of using the epilator to achieve decent results.  </li>
            <li> I get a couple of ingrown hairs from using this, but they&#x27;re easy to take care of.</li>
            <li> This epilator is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> It was the best in its category and is useful addition to ur personal accessory kit.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...</li>
            <li> In the begining it worked somehow, but it wasn&#x27;t as good as my old epilator even after I used it for so many years.</li>
            <li> I bought this three years ago and I can say it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it in the shower or tub is a real plus too since epilating is best done with open pores.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I think on the legs and armpits it works best in the shower when you are nice and lathered up with soap - the lather helps get rid of the friction as the head moves over the skin and it&#x27;s a much smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> I charged this Panasonic Wet/Dry Two Speed Epliator for more than 20 hours, which is what they recommend charging it before the first use, 20 hours, but I wanted to make sure it was fully charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you find that it&#x27;s pulling hairs and breaking them above the skin&#x27;s surface, instead of pulling them out like it&#x27;s supposed to (this is especially true for women whose body hair is very fine like mine</li>
            <li> On a positive note, the cordless function is nice, as is the wet/dry option.</li>
            <li> got this new one and its perfect, even better than the last one.</li>
            <li> An AWESOME feature because you just wash all the hairs down the drain and you can rinse the epilator clean</li>
            <li> I am a huge baby when it comes to pain</li>
            <li> but I use it in the shower (a huge plus with this one, and also the cordless option) and use shower gel.  </li>
            <li> but I swear it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy not have to shave my underarms or legs for weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> provided making it sound as though you could use it while plugged in.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my chin, really soapy with warm water</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;ll use it primarily for your legs then go for it</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone whether advanced or just beginning.</li>
            <li> I should have purchased the Braun to begin with, especially since one of my friends told me the Braun works great.</li>
            <li> Somewhat cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It works great and it is the only reason this epilator is not going to trash can.</li>
            <li> It leaves your legs smooth for days at a time.</li>
            <li> I got it primarily for the bikini area --</li>
            <li> works well and the shaver is nice and fast</li>
            <li> , convenient  Cons: does not remove a lot of the hair, takes a lot longer than more powerful epilators and even then does not remove a lot of the hair  </li>
            <li> so it works great on the upper lip and chin, and underarms.</li>
            <li> They say by plucking the hairs you are hair free for 4-6 weeks without having the hassle of shaving them every day.</li>
            <li> I then didn&#x27;t even get the &#x27;smooth&#x27; stage before I had stubble.  </li>
            <li> This one does not do as good of job as my old one.</li>
            <li> The model I had before this one had a light attachment which was very useful</li>
            <li> and makes cleaning the product quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> bought it to shave my legs, it seems to work just fine, and it true to the advertisment that I read when I bought it</li>
            <li> Also I found out in the instructions that there are certain areas you&#x27;re not supposed to use the epilator (I&#x27;ve used it on my arms, legs, and for the very fine hair on my stomach).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time epilator, and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Completely worth it!</li>
            <li> but I would suggest spending a bit more money and get a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> I always through about buying an epilator but still remembered the reviews on the original ones from years ago.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Ladies, and/or Gents, get yourself Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two Speed Epilator, with three heads, in a beautiful Pink.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet, but using it dry works great.    </li>
            <li> Ofcourse it does a clean job that stayed for 2 weeks unlike the razors which needs ur attention every 3 days.</li>
            <li> each time I stop it to clean the tip.</li>
            <li> My 25 year old epilady was ready for retirement, and this is a great upgrade.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> The battery life is only good for like 15 minutes or two body parts.</li>
            <li> really just OK.</li>
            <li> I am ready to move on and find a better epilator.     </li>
            <li> ITs cool.</li>
            <li> No ugly bumps or razor burn.</li>
            <li> And believe it is not painful.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be cool to not have to deal with stubble anymore, but it just does not work with my hair type.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never owned such a good epilator.</li>
            <li> My legs and shins were not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not so bad.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not bad after that...   </li>
            <li> and not a bad item..</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several years now, and the hair on my legs has gotten thinner and more sparse from using it, and it is very quick and easy to remove the hair now with the epilator.</li>
            <li> I am sure the second time will be a lot better.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t completely pain free, but it was much better.  </li>
            <li> I tried using this product many ways under many different conditions, and it never, ever gave me the \\&quot;4-week sleek!\\&quot; of its advertising.  </li>
            <li> It took 40 minutes to do most of one leg, but left many hairs in even so.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use it in the shower (though it is kind of slippery when wet ...</li>
            <li> I can take it wherever and shave quickly.</li>
            <li> Then its very gliding &amp; very cool.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this Epilator and would recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> The epilator worked as advertised and as long as I did everything recommended it worked good.  </li>
            <li> it also has a small head, so even if it did work perfectly, you dont remove much hair at once.</li>
            <li> Although, useful and relatively quick.</li>
            <li> When I used it in the shower it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as just dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> My first epilator was the original Epilady.  </li>
            <li> my legs have straight hairs that are fine - didn&#x27;t remove.  </li>
            <li> This little thing is so great and so well priced.</li>
            <li> The tweezing method of the ceramic disks in this product is definitely the best design I&#x27;ve seen in action so far.</li>
            <li> The panasonic was a great waste of money.</li>
            <li> I do think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about the Panasonic Epilator is that it does not hurt as much as others..</li>
            <li> simply did not remove all the hair effectively.  </li>
            <li> BUT ITS SO WORTH</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not good on my legs, either, even wet in the shower.  </li>
            <li> As with all epilation, it is time consuming to do your legs, but the soap suds make it easier, and it&#x27;s worth it because you dont have to do it that often.   </li>
            <li> Most of all, the tweezing mechanism does not grab hairs of any length or thickness as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> But the thing is, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> But I tell you the pain is WORTH it.</li>
            <li> (just make sure to use a lot of soap lather when epilating wet, I think soap lather works better than shaving cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still the same and still effective</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator on a killer sale at a local store because it was a cordless model and seemed like it would be nice.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going to get an epilator, this Panasonic Wet/Dry is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> highly recommend this epilator, it&#x27;s a quality product that works well and has fantastic features that make it super useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful, works really well.</li>
            <li> The shaver attachment all right</li>
            <li> so right now I don&#x27;t feel any pain at all.</li>
            <li> Right now it holds a charge for two epilating sessions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been able to stand using it on my underarms and more intimate areas with minimum pain - and believe me, I&#x27;ve used an epilator dry in those areas before and it hurt like a son of a gun!    </li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t used it wet, but I love how easy it is and</li>
            <li> Have to continuously go over the same area and does not grab very fine hair.</li>
            <li> This one works great, no pain and very few ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish the battery charge would last longer than 30 min, but that is enough time to do a great job on your legs and armpits.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a quality build, but the motor is not as strong as a model that works directly as a corded model.</li>
            <li> Does not remove all of the hair, few than more, waxing is much better and quicker comparing to this product.</li>
            <li> The best way was in the shower with a thick moisturizing body wash squeezed directly onto the epilator.  </li>
            <li> even 6 weeks later it is still very light.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress and the Braun Silk Epil, and I have to say this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> The shaving head works fairly well, but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how quickly your hair grows back, it can last a good 2-3 weeks without having to re-epilate.   </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and gave it the full benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li> This one is so much better once in a while you feel a little pinch but being able to use it in the shower really helps.  </li>
            <li> It says not to use within 2-3 days before going into a pool or hot tub, not to use before or during menstrating.</li>
            <li> I use a pool and hot tub often.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> This was also my first epilator.  </li>
            <li> I bought another Epilator from Braun and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I remembered it hurt when I first used it</li>
            <li> I would love to get my underarms waxed on a regular basis, but there is no way I could afford that.  </li>
            <li> What I wish I had known before I bought it:    That it takes 20 hours to charge the first time you use it, or after having not used it for a while.</li>
            <li> However, it takes multiple passes in all directions and circular movements to get most of the hair.</li>
            <li> I was reading that is better to use it without the skin protector thing, next time I´ll</li>
            <li> It works very well and no problem yet!</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that I ever owned.</li>
            <li> so think about trimming those first (</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator.  </li>
            <li> but overall, i wasnt too pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using one</li>
            <li> If Panasonic could work on that they would have a stellar product on their hands.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that once you are in \\&quot;maintenance mode\\&quot; the process is not uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li> It helps too, to understand that epilating is a process and you cannot get it all done the first time you use the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Wet/Dry epilator after my Emjoi Optima was either dropped or knocked of the vanity many times and one of the tweezing sides finally broke.  </li>
            <li> is to make sure you focus on specific spots on the leg, stretch the surface area out</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator about 6 months ago and it is my first one I&#x27;ve ever bought or used.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time</li>
            <li> At first I was using it on untrimmed hair and the epilator was getting clogged a lot.  </li>
            <li> Yes it hurt the first time</li>
            <li> This my second one and the first was so much better.</li>
            <li> The first one was a Philips Norelco Satinelle Ice, I didnt find this anymore.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to work for the most part but left some areas with hair.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this to me, it turns out very efficient!</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no way to pull your hair out completely pain free, so if this is the reason why you don&#x27;t wanna buy it, don&#x27;t buy an epilator, buy a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I used to have an epilady and after 7 years it died on me I wish I still had the old one it worked better than this new one.</li>
            <li> Every time you use it after the first is a whole lot better, especially if you&#x27;re keeping up.    </li>
            <li> The shipment was fast, the price is low and the quality the top.</li>
            <li> I got a small panasonic epilator that works pretty good</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it quite as much as I did when I first got it.</li>
            <li> My old one, which was Bruan, would do this fast and effectively, and actually remove the hair!</li>
            <li> One swipe over your leg and the hair is pretty much all gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric shaver for a long time, and thought this might be a better alternitive.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never done electrolysis before, you&#x27;re going to be in for a real shock the first time you use this....</li>
            <li> I loved it until the battery wore out and I am not sure what to do about that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair in the first sweep, but it gets a fair amount of it and prevents it from growing back for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why, I&#x27;ve cleaned it out and have taken good care of it.</li>
            <li> I though this would be really effective because it has so many tweezers and a larger surface area to cover, but I found i had to use it on the same spot several times to get the hair out.</li>
            <li> Finding it works much better dry.  </li>
            <li> So yes, it is worth the pain and epilators are expensive but it does pay to be beautiful.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have a hair trimmer made by Panasonic that has been going strong for over ten years</li>
            <li> I guess the people who make epilady don&#x27;t want to fix that problem, so I researched all the epilators I could find, and settled on this model because of the reasonable cost and the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty cool and the shaver works pretty well actually.</li>
            <li> I got in the shower, lathered up, did my face, my bikini line, my underarms AND my calves and thighs with nothing more then an occasional \\&quot;funny face\\&quot; in really sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet as it works great dry.  </li>
            <li> I cannot comment on using it wet, but it does work great dry.</li>
            <li> It does not capture every hair, especially the fine ones.</li>
            <li> While never as fast or as efficient as the plug-in for power epilators, it stopped pulling hair out, leaving the victim (me) with more like shaved legs.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this item.</li>
            <li> I read these reviews, and was fascinated with the whole wet/dry/cordless thing.  </li>
            <li> It takes so much time to epilate and even after finishing it, let&#x27;s a lot of hairs.</li>
            <li> i gave it two stars because the trimmer worked very well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten thinner and don&#x27;t grow as much.</li>
            <li> I should have spent more for an Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Waxing does the whole area in one fell swoop</li>
            <li> as I mentioned before, I have used both the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress and Braun before this and never had this problem with the ingrowns.</li>
            <li> I really bought it for my underarms since shaving</li>
            <li> but I have to say that it really doesn&#x27;t work for my underarms.</li>
            <li> I also found that it didn&#x27;t grab the hair very well at all</li>
            <li> You have to follow directions and lather up a lot before the epilator starts to work really well.</li>
            <li> the only way i can get my legs smooth for longer than a day is to epilate, then shave.</li>
            <li> and I expected alot more pain.  </li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s really all I have to say.</li>
            <li> This product just really does not do the job.</li>
            <li> I was very please with this company that sold me the item.</li>
            <li> She cannot epilate one of her legs with the whole charge and then she has to wait 12 hours for this to charge and be ready again.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t catch and pull the hairs out very well.</li>
            <li> When I am in too much of a rush to finish epilating, I switch the head and shave the rest</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> She keeps asking me how much I paid for it.</li>
            <li> &quot; so much as maybe discomfort and just until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> But the pain I should say was very negligible.</li>
            <li> Some features were promising:</li>
            <li> and it really does help.    </li>
            <li> real well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li> The end result was a fairly smooth back that has remained so for about 4 weeks and</li>
            <li> The shaver works very well for under arms.</li>
            <li> Made very well but after 1.5 years it started to rattle.</li>
            <li> The problem I have with the razor is that it doesn&#x27;t give me a really close shave and doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> This thing made shaving much easier for her.</li>
            <li> my wife uses it all the time, thanks rvv.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and it has always worked really well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really a pain,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works very well and gets even the shortest hairs.  </li>
            <li> This makes the epilation much longer and not efficient at all.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It was my second choise, after I have had a Brown model for so many years, and it become old.</li>
            <li> The process is not painful at all, but this is because it barely removes any hairs from her legs.</li>
            <li> I would honestly avoid this product at all costs just because 30 minutes of charge is simply not enough for your legs but might be enough for underarms.</li>
            <li> Not only do I have the choice of using it while my skin is dry (great for a quick touch up) or wet (very helpful for epilation), but I can also shave, trim my bikini line or pluck out unwanted hairs.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I am pleased with this epilator.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate these seemingly small things because it helps keep the machine clean and is easily maintainable.     </li>
            <li> When I finally decided to buy this product I was excited to get it and start using it.</li>
            <li> It does hurt like hell the first few times, but I got through that ok,</li>
            <li> It really works though I haven&#x27;t had time to see how long I was hair free.  </li>
            <li> Because you use it in the shower, you can easily rinse and dry it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you are looking for a reasonably price product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> a huge fan of waxing, but not a huge fan of spending anywhere from 50 to hundreds of dollars every time I want to be smooth; and also not a huge fan of home waxing kits, which have pulled off more of my skin than they&#x27;ve pulled out my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With every kind and model there were positive and negative feedbacks.</li>
            <li> Its also pretty loud, even on the lower of the two speeds.</li>
            <li> i was surprised when i first used it.</li>
            <li> did my bikini area - again definately works better and hurts less when your skin is lathered up.  </li>
            <li> The more often you do, the less the pain gets.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using my epilator in the shower instead of using it dry.</li>
            <li> I choose this one mainly because of the price</li>
            <li> I have a beard trimmer I use for my bikini line which was only ten bucks which works better.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend to replace an older Remington epilator which had stopped working after 5 years.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it wet, which makes all the difference in the world as far as pain goes.</li>
            <li> Make sure to pull the under arm skin as tight as you can.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But maybe I&#x27;m spoiled and my expectations are too high.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely better than shaving, and less costly than waxing, but this model kind of sucks.</li>
            <li> The posibility to be used in the shower makes the process less messy and more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I will give it a little more time and see if it clears up.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought it because I have trouble with my bikini line and underarms--</li>
            <li> and I still am missing spots, this product was $30 more at Target</li>
            <li> I think this is normal with epilators.</li>
            <li> After many times of pulling out hair at the root, you are sort of destroying the root</li>
            <li> It cleans very very well, a little hurts tho... but worth it!</li>
            <li> I do like the wet option, but for a quick touch up the dry is just as fine.</li>
            <li> but when you are done it has to go right on the charger again for the next day.  </li>
            <li> She heard stores about how painful epliators could be but did not experience the pain and is now is enjoying the benefit of smoother leggs - less frequent shavers - 5 Stars for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I just spent about 30, and still have a significant amount of hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the other trimmer attachment as well.  </li>
            <li> Epilating was all new to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to buy a new epilator.</li>
            <li> besides I think I may just buy a new one since this one does not work for me.</li>
            <li> At the time, I couldn&#x27;t afford a new machine.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to buy a new one instead of buying a voltage adaptor.</li>
            <li> I had to rub it several times on my skin to pull out the hair, there were certain hairs that it just did not pull out at all!</li>
            <li> For those people who are complaining that the charge didn&#x27;t last very long, keep this in mind: when used the first time, it needs to be charged a full 20 hours before use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave head and bikini trimmer also work really well, although I only really use the trimmer b/c</li>
            <li> The shave head and bikini trimmer also work really well, although I only really use the trimmer b/c</li>
            <li> She loves it and was very surprised and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> received on time, need to be careful while usinging in the more delicate part of the body, works fine and</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> This seems totally excessive and disproportionate by most battery standards.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not supposed to go over the same area multiple times, but that was the only way to get even most of the hair.    </li>
            <li> I have used this model on my legs for 2 years now and after probably the first 3-4 times I used it, I felt only discomfort on my legs.</li>
            <li> First, batteries last nothing.</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this especially for my arm pits.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased goods through Amazon and it gives me confidence for future purchases</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time, and also It is my first time using an epilator.</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator, my first an Emoji.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to worry if it gets wet or you drop it in the sink full of water.</li>
            <li> I have more than average facial hair and it does say in the instructions not to use on face (didn&#x27;t know this until I got it)</li>
            <li> i have pretty sensitive legs and hair that grows back with the slightest chill in the air.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is you cannot use it while it is charging and then with a full recharge you can only use it for the hands.</li>
            <li> but i was looking more for an epilator, the rest was a plus, and the epilator function is not very good.</li>
            <li> comparison, my first epilator can do a decent 85-90% hair removal with a single run.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use it wet or dry even.</li>
            <li> It is just tweezing really fast when you get right down to it.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have fine invisible hair, my hairs are thick and grow fast.</li>
            <li> and hurts much less than my original epilady.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic works ok, but not sure epilating in general is for me.</li>
            <li> After a while of using this, you do get used to the hair being pulled, but it has yet to stop being painful for me (more than a year of use), but it&#x27;s over within 2 minutes and is more efficient than tweezing.</li>
            <li> I used it so much that it finally just gave out on me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months so far and even let the hair grow out 1/4 inch and</li>
            <li> So for the price of one professional waxing session I bought this epilator.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts much longer than the manual says it will, I&#x27;ve used mine multiple times longer than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I ran over my chin a only a couple times and it got even the smallest thinest hairs you couldn&#x27;t really see.</li>
            <li> Idk... the frozen action did NOT help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a 4 years old epilator of another brand</li>
            <li> so far I like it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even get all the hair either, it leaves the short hairs that you can&#x27;t really see</li>
            <li> It breaks it off near the skin.</li>
            <li> : I suspect that because it is cordless, it has nowhere near the power that the epilady models I&#x27;m used to have.</li>
            <li> exactly how long</li>
            <li> She was using old fashioned razor blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough even for the armpit area and it pulls even the smallest hairs that you can&#x27;t even see.  </li>
            <li> I use in the tub with a lot of shower gel that I pour directly on the epilator&#x27;s head</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT hurt any more than the faster one - a common reason for avoiding it.</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT hurt any more than the faster one - a common reason for avoiding it.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money and the results, for me at least , have been well worth it.</li>
            <li> The interchangeable shaver and trimer work well and are useful for getting longer hair short enough to epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love epilating but this one missed a lot of hair and was slow not like others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I find that it works better if you use soap or bath gel instead of shaving cream, and also go SLOWLY.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s sick and tired of hairs allover their floors and wants nice smooth hairless skin in the comfort of their own tub.</li>
            <li> so I dont have to clean up the mess afterwards.....</li>
            <li> This epilator is I think just as fast in speed as other epilators, but it is much, much quieter.</li>
            <li> Even though all the bad stuff I&#x27;ve mentioned I&#x27;m still pretty happy with my purchase because I only have to do it</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s try it for a little longer to see more long term results.ant to just shave instead</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s try it for a little longer to see more long term results.</li>
            <li> The reason why I like two heads is because I think it pulls out more hair in less amount of time than a single headed one.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only tried it in the shower once, so maybe it works better wet than dry.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my arms (which is more painful than the legs!), but I love the results!</li>
            <li> Definitely shower first or if possible stay in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Now I see why it may be beneficial to spend the extra money on a high end model.</li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth surface and can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> You get the same smooth results as waxing, but none of the mess; you won&#x27;t run out of wax strips or constantly throw money away buying new supplies or paying to have it done professionally since this has a rechargeable battery.     </li>
            <li> I recently got back to being able to afford a few luxuries.  </li>
            <li> I read the directions carefully, tried to get the soap exactly the consistency they recommend...  </li>
            <li> Given the way the old epilator felt, I&#x27;m very happy with this new one because I feel that the hair removal is much less painful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d buy this particular item again, but it worth the money I did spend on it.</li>
            <li> Initially there is a little pinching but after that, it is smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> I found that without lather the movement was somewhat jerky, the head didn&#x27;t slide over the skin and smoothly and it was more painful.</li>
            <li> I have an old braun epilator that I like--my only issue is that it is old and corded.  </li>
            <li> The price is better and the machine is way more gentle and less painful</li>
            <li> it is so fine you hardly notice.  </li>
            <li> Also, when it&#x27;s nearing empty battery, it slows down and becomes as good as dead.</li>
            <li> Wasted quite a pretty penny to buy this over fifty something bucks!</li>
            <li> I am a man and bought it to clean up my back hair, which while it isn&#x27;t heavy, I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> I find my legs are softer in general then</li>
            <li> Cordless - Battery doesn&#x27;t last too long, and if I forget to recharge it, it won&#x27;t be ready for me to use whenever I want to</li>
            <li> I had the old blue epilator and it stopped working (was y fault)</li>
            <li> I chose the Panasonic Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epliator with Three Heads (actually just two, but an attachment gives one of the heads dual functionality) because of the multi-functionality it offers.  </li>
            <li> no i&#x27;m trying to return it and go back to my old one \\&quot;braun\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it wet and had to spend too much time getting the water out of it.</li>
            <li> I have shaved, waxed, professional laser hair removal, personal home laser hair removal, hair removal creams and</li>
            <li> It barely grabs hairs and it ruined my bikini line, I now have scars because of it.</li>
            <li> Apparently that product is now discontinued.</li>
            <li> I tried it both ways and it barely removed any hairs from my legs.  </li>
            <li> I also find that after I use it I have red spots everywhere that a hair was pulled out and that my skin is sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have heavy hair growth, either - I&#x27;ve waxed or epilated enough in the past that there&#x27;s just not that much hair there any more.    </li>
            <li> I cannot use regular razors because my skin is sensitive and will itch incessantly after shaving.</li>
            <li> I usually keep a disposable razor in the shower for times I need a quick touch up</li>
            <li> I just make sure the hairs are very short and go very slow</li>
            <li> and therefore you are only in pain for a moment as opposed to several minutes with the epilator; because your bikini line is so sensitive, this makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li> I must say though, in the first few days I&#x27;ve owned this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure once I&#x27;m using this on a regular basis that I won&#x27;t have so much trouble missing hairs.    </li>
            <li> The wet option was the main selling point for me, and I did read the reviews, but I guess everyone is different, pain tolerance</li>
            <li> Folks who have never used an epilator before will likely be thrilled with this product but those who have used epilators for years will likely be left uninspired.  </li>
            <li> The hair is literally yanked from your body (more painful than tweezing!), but done so very quickly.</li>
            <li> Unlike a previous epilator I&#x27;d had, this one can&#x27;t be used while it is recharging, so that&#x27;s a real nuisance.</li>
            <li> However, the instructions clearly state how long the hair should be and that it may need to be used twice to get all of the hair since it grows at different paces.</li>
            <li> could barely use it, and it left my skin really red.  </li>
            <li> Mine holds a full charge for a LONG time, I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Eventually in time the hairs grow back less but softer, thinner, and lighter in color until one day you really wouldn&#x27;t be epilating very often, and the hairs will be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> So the first time is definitely the most painful, and it gets easier after that.</li>
            <li> I say this because I am not sure if the pain would be different on someone with more fatty tissue.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily because I don&#x27;t have time to shave everyday, and I don&#x27;t like the mess of at-home waxing.</li>
            <li> Just as with tweezing, sometimes if you pull too hard, the hair breaks instead of popping out, so you pull a little slower and more focused.</li>
            <li> Just as with tweezing, sometimes if you pull too hard, the hair breaks instead of popping out, so you pull a little slower and more focused.</li>
            <li> You get used to the slipperiness after a while, and it&#x27;s not so much of a problem, but it takes a little practice.    </li>
            <li> It comes with a little cap, which I really appreciate (Braun does not).   </li>
            <li> It is gentle, but may take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> It works really well for the legs and arms too, but since the head is much smaller than other epilators it does take a long time to get done.</li>
            <li> It took at least twice as much time to epilate than the old epilator I had and missed hair.</li>
            <li> But, this was a new kind of pain and, even though I have been told the first time is the worst</li>
            <li> It seems to only work half as well and as fast used as dry as it does when used with soap and water.      </li>
            <li> With the guard piece off, it would still pull very poorly and was causing many cuts on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a dry epilator for years, and thought I would try this new wet product.</li>
            <li> Then each subsequent charge takes 12 hours to complete, and still you only get about a half hour of actual usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about tiny stubble, but hairs that are several millimeters long.  </li>
            <li> - The wet feature is very helpful as it keeps pain level down.</li>
            <li> My routine is to epilate about once every other week, but do a 2nd round just 2 days after just to get the baby hair that didn&#x27;t quite grow out the first time.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone could make a long lasting hair remover that isn&#x27;t like a torture device.  </li>
            <li> I use this one regularly and find it holds a charge a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t expect it to last this long.</li>
            <li> I think your armpits must be less sensitive.</li>
            <li> Previous people have posted about exfoliating to avoid ingrown hairs -- I&#x27;ve been doing that frequently</li>
            <li> I only used it in the dry.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve noticed hairs growing in lighter, sparser, and less frequently.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it even grabbed the little hairs that had grown in since I&#x27;d shaved the previous day.</li>
            <li> Have to go over &amp; over a spot to get it to actually epilate a single hair.  </li>
            <li> I find that the Epilator is very slippery and hard to hold on to while using.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press toO hard or go over a spot too much as this hurts like hell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to disagree with one of the earlier reviewers who said that the armpits are less sensitive than other areas of the body.  </li>
            <li> Even on the lower speed, which is what I used, the head moves so fast, which at least to me seems to be part of the problem.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> But after just a couple of months of, honestly, not even that much use, the battery stopped recharging fully.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not too long ago.</li>
            <li> but i found that the hair doesnt stay gone for long.</li>
            <li> it tends to take a long long time to get every area.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator long ago and never wrote a review until I ran into it again while looking for an epilator.</li>
            <li> and I had to break it up across a few days to complete the job.  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time and money on trying different epilators, read hundreds of reviews.</li>
            <li> I have really dark, thick, Italian leg hair, so I was concerned at first about the pain and effectiveness of using this type of product.  </li>
            <li> It has some pros (battery, can use under shower, less pain), but where it fails pretty much, is the epilation.</li>
            <li> I received this less than a year ago and loved it after some painful conditioning of my legs to withstand the use of an epilator.  </li>
            <li> A couple of days later I can go back and epilate the hairs that I previously shaved.</li>
            <li> This is my third epilator, and it does only a half job.</li>
            <li> I am confused about why this is happening and am starting to think it is only this particular epilator...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the charge only last 30 minutes, which was enough time for me to \\&quot;take care\\&quot; of all my grooming(epilating, shaving and trimming)</li>
            <li> I am not expecting perfection, but I expected some improvement after ten years, and it was far worse than my (sniff) old epilator.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t even last long enough to get half of one leg done!    </li>
            <li> , the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long anymore</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take very long.</li>
            <li> It is much faster, more thorough, and less painful than my previous epilator.  </li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t like about epilating was that you had to do it dry, and I missed taking baths and shaving (although I don&#x27;t like the results of shaving), so I decided to give this product a try.     </li>
            <li> I tried the epilator head in shower, out of shower, after shower, with soap, dry...</li>
            <li> when I used to just use a dry epilator.</li>
            <li> to dry comparisons</li>
            <li> armpit I did it dry.</li>
            <li> since it doesn&#x27;t work well dry.</li>
            <li> Obviously, one would prefer to make as few passes over the area as possible, but this epilator could never seem to grab all the hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to have to go back to epilady and get one of those powerful things that sadly cannot accompany me to the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a little while, you get used to the sensation and it barely bothers me anymore.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t remove every single hair...</li>
            <li> It works for quite some time on a single charge.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I did both of them quickly, completely and with very little pain -</li>
            <li> I have tried several epilators on the market -- and hands down -</li>
            <li> It seemed about half and half, good and bad.  </li>
            <li> For me, some areas were easier to epilate wet, and others dry.</li>
            <li> Works just as well wet, as it does dry.  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE YOUR HAIR WILL GROW BACK THINNER AND LESS.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Philips Satinelle Ice which worked quite well overall.</li>
            <li> am half Middle Eastern, half Asian.</li>
            <li> less hair grew back.</li>
            <li> When I saw this Panasonic one could work wet or dry</li>
            <li> I tried to use the Emoji on my legs and underarms and I was NEVER able to work through the pain of it, so I only used it on my face and that was only because I had to.  </li>
            <li> After about your 3rd or 4th time doing it you have less pain.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to remove the small fine hairs around the chin and neck area and takes a number of tries before total removal.</li>
            <li> have purchased other more expensive epliators in the past, but they hurt like the dickens.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I got a bunch of little bumps on my legs and it can take two to three times to use the product to get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> It may not get every hair every time but with the trimmer option, it gets the little ones left over.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it comes with a shaver head so you can decide if you want to shave those little missed ones off or wait a couple of days and let them grow a bit longer and epilate them later.</li>
            <li> Also, you can not use it while it is charging which is kind of stupid.</li>
            <li> I can say that getting a peircing done is more painful than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll feel frustrated if you choose this.</li>
            <li> Even though that&#x27;s possible, the very last thing this product does is remove hair -- at least with the epilator head.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that since this product could also be used wet, that you add body wash to it, so that it foams</li>
            <li> Definitely this one is a waste of money and something I do not recommend to have.</li>
            <li> but that was expected.</li>
            <li> The real reason I&#x27;ve given this epilator 2 stars though is that it leaves a LOT of hair behind.</li>
            <li> , however, I have only few hairs here and there from years of laser hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Starting to get in grown hair from this after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> No matter how much time I spent or the quality of the lighting or how I prepared my skin, I always find patches of uncleared hair mere hours later.  </li>
            <li> This is not working as expected.  </li>
            <li> and she regrets the moment we decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> There is a lack of wet</li>
            <li> I had a few stray hairs left over that I had to tweeze after.</li>
            <li> Never really tried using the bikini trimmer because that&#x27;s not my thing but the shaver and epilator and</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it is not as efficient as I expected.</li>
            <li> I used mine wet in the shower</li>
            <li> I never got it wet.</li>
            <li> Only a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> You have to go over the same area a few times.</li>
            <li> it is jammed or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it wet, but have used both the shave head and the epilator head.  </li>
            <li> I use roughly once per week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*You can use it wet.</li>
            <li> but I know I only charge mine, overnight, every few</li>
            <li> Overall the length of the head is too narrow, not efficient.</li>
            <li> but thats to be expected</li>
            <li> usually takes less than 5 minutes with my old epilator)</li>
            <li> With the other 2 you can only use them dry, so I would usually take a shower, exfoliate, and then use it after my shower.</li>
            <li> The half hour time-limit can make doing multiple large areas in one sitting difficult.</li>
            <li> On my legs, it didn&#x27;t give me a very close shave at all, and my hair is not even very thick or dark.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the results but will probably go back to body sugaring as this was the least painful of all hair removals.</li>
            <li> After looking through all other epilators, none of them offered the wet/dry feature.  </li>
            <li> The other brand I returned because it didn&#x27;t work as they stated.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> But other than that - ouch.  </li>
            <li> My skin would usually be sore and red for a while afterward</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re planning on using it on other parts of your body, you might want to rethink this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to try next.</li>
            <li> I used to shave my legs daily, but no more.</li>
            <li> It is really difficult to accumulate 20 unique words to review a small product which is used once in a month...</li>
            <li> I have previously used a dry epilator and thought of buying a wet one thinking it&#x27;ll be less painfull.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any other that does that.</li>
            <li> What a drag!     </li>
            <li> I am inundated with all types of hair removal stuff, some from Spain and from other areas.</li>
            <li> The epilator part I have tried only once and in a small area, because the directions state that it shouldn&#x27;t be used during pregnancy (probably due to increased sensitivity).</li>
            <li> As other people said, the battery life span is about two or three months</li>
            <li> Well, it may hurt less when wet (which wasn&#x27;t the problem as I am used to and expected the pain), but I won&#x27;t bother as it doesn&#x27;t pull out the hair!  </li>
            <li> happend to have a few mutant hairs on my chin that I have to pluck every now and again; just for giggles I tried it on my face (dry).  </li>
            <li> Epilating only hurts for a few seconds, but when you have a peircing it can hurt for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It took the hair off easily and less painfully than the other epilators.</li>
            <li> It works well wet or dry, and so far it hasn&#x27;t failed me.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re removing all hair it would be difficult to do just a certain area.  </li>
            <li> I went out on a limb and thought I&#x27;d try using one of these instead of my conventional shaving.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to leave my underarms and legs even smoother than with other epilators and with much less redness or irritation.   </li>
            <li> Slightly quieter than other epilators I&#x27;ve tried, but still could be quieter.    </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes FOREVER (maybe an hour?)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the battery life, because I was never able to endure the pain that long....</li>
            <li> and it takes a helluva long time to finish since its so small.</li>
            <li> Throw away all those hot or cold waxes, cloth strips, popsicle sticks,and or those creamy smelly hair removers you smear on and find that they really do not work well.  </li>
            <li> process is uncomfortable, yes, but lets get real, this is an epilator</li>
            <li> , I am just real careful.  </li>
            <li> The cordless ability: less time to use than the other epilators, and the power is also less.  </li>
            <li> Having used this epilator in and out of the shower now, I have to say that I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with it&#x27;s performance outside of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product in the hopes of having to shave less often and for the dual epilator/shaver feature.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the hair removal area is too narrow.</li>
            <li> Some feel less.</li>
            <li> Epilating takes longer (also NOT the epilator&#x27;s fault) but you do it much less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must say that I previously had a Braun, a Philips and a Rowenta</li>
            <li> I even attempted putting a bag of frozen peas on my armpit first to numb it</li>
            <li> I have very thick, deep, dark hair.</li>
            <li> It seems the machine might grap a little skin as well as hair.</li>
            <li> and I could feel the little metal things grinding against my face like I was plowing a field.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little time consuming.</li>
            <li> This product works well, and with relatively little pain.</li>
            <li> it hurt a little because i wasn&#x27;t prepared for the pain but</li>
            <li> After a little over a month of use, I can definitively say that this is</li>
            <li> Even with using conditioner, you can feel every little hair being pulled out.</li>
            <li> I feel this get&#x27;s ALL the hair, including the little tiny thin ones.  </li>
            <li> bar\\&quot; in the center of the epilator head made it really hard to use.</li>
            <li> The head is small enough to reach into small, hard to reach areas, and the rotating discs are well-placed to get even the shortest hairs.</li>
            <li> I AM CLEANING HOUSE, and do not feel sorry or worry about all the money I have spent, to no avail, beause I have finally found something that works.  </li>
            <li> Money wasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to be heavily sedated to not feel the pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikini option I would never attempt, so</li>
            <li> This epilator paid for itself after just a few uses - works just as well as getting waxed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> Below are a few pros and cons    </li>
            <li> But if the battery goes completely dead, it will need to be charged another 20 hours again.</li>
            <li> But after using it  on my legs a few times I started getting SEVERE ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> a few times before you get all hair removed</li>
            <li> Still, I found that with heavy use and at a price of approx $55</li>
            <li> This item had trouble charging from the moment we recieved it.  </li>
            <li> but after epilating for a few weeks, you get used to the pain</li>
            <li> every couple of weeks, and my hair is already starting to thin out.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used one for quite a few years, just getting used to it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t buy this item every day, and you don&#x27;t have to bother with shaving everyday either.</li>
            <li> - is that it doesn&#x27;t work with the cord on, which means that, if you are using it and the battery goes dead, you have to wait 12 hours until it charges so you can use it again.</li>
            <li> It hurt worse than the braun and the charge only got me through part of one leg.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this model.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about buying this epilator as I received so many feedback about others like this one saying that it was very painful.</li>
            <li> cause it usually means that one of your legs gets half</li>
            <li> The hairiest people of the world on one end, and the least hairiest people on the other end.</li>
            <li> I am SO serious when I say that it didn&#x27;t hurt that much wet</li>
            <li> Pros: a lot less painful than dry epilation, can be used as either wet or dry</li>
            <li> but it is not worthy of 45 dollars and its unable to remove properly.</li>
            <li> With my Braun epilator, it gets dirty easily and the hairs are difficult to get out.   </li>
            <li> Actually, I was skeptical about buying this product as I did read review on slight pain.  </li>
            <li> Because you need to use a lot of soap to keep the friction down, it gets everywhere and makes it hard to hold correctly.  </li>
            <li> -this hurts pretty badly (or maybe I&#x27;m just a weeny) but its does the job.</li>
            <li> Could it have had anything to do with another problem I&#x27;ve noticed over the past few months?</li>
            <li> Medium skin tones, thick dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Note, that I do have thick, dark hair</li>
            <li> This is not true in the beginning-at least not for me.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Epilator before that had finally broken down.</li>
            <li> If you are serious about your epilator and want to get down to business</li>
            <li> It is very efficient and does not hurt too bad.</li>
            <li> This product works really well but is quite painful.</li>
            <li> When it finally died a sad (but well deserved) death, I went looking for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I had tried epilators in the past and man did it hurt.  </li>
            <li> The pain was minimal on my arms however, the pain on my thighs was worse.  </li>
            <li> Price was unbelievably inexpensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Even then, small hairs seem to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; up.</li>
            <li> but since its really small</li>
            <li> only makes hairs coarser and hand plucking is so tedious</li>
            <li> The head is too small and it doesn&#x27;t have settings hair thickness.    </li>
            <li> the growing back is what was uncomfortable and HURT even.</li>
            <li> I have tried epilators in the past, and they were torture devices, but this Panasonic changed my mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I have a lot of hair, or just need to get used to how to reach every part.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why others are suggesting to Panasonic to come up with a model that lets you epilate while the product is plugged in.</li>
            <li> No more cuts or nicks.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount of shampoo w/ water rubbed together with my hands &amp; spread over my legs or underarms &amp; it glides over them like silk.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Epilator, I bought a Epilady 20 years ago, hardly used it due to the  pain and felt it was dangerous.</li>
            <li> This one took me AGES, and has a very narrow head...making it even slower.</li>
            <li> This one is compact &amp; ahndy unlike the waxing system which I feel is very messy.</li>
            <li> Epilating in general is painful, I mean you&#x27;re plucking like 5 pcs of hair from your leg in a single swoop!  </li>
            <li> because pulling your hair out by the root is always going to hurt a little - but the heat, water and steam open up your pores and allow for a much less painful experience.</li>
            <li> It was bulky and very difficult to maneuver around small &amp; sensitive areas like ankles and bikini.</li>
            <li> Despite the previous claims that there was some pain involved, I thought I could tough it out and bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> I also tried to use it on my bikini area and it was pointless, the shave was so NOT close that I would have rather just used a dull razor, it would have at least got closer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for years but am tired of the effort &amp; mess of at home waxing, and the expense of salon waxing.  </li>
            <li> The worst part about this is that the battery dries up quickly, and you cannot use the epilator while it is plugged in, and charging!  </li>
            <li> Why should I have to try so hard?  </li>
            <li> With the guard piece on, the Panasonic epilator would hardly get any hair and was breaking a lot of hairs instead of plucking them.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT good for grabbing small hairs, either.  </li>
            <li> it is not effective, it miss a lot of hair  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my arms and got through it, but found it was far too painful for legs.</li>
            <li> I am a hair removing fanatic.</li>
            <li> Just a slow process.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviews that felt it was a bit slow</li>
            <li> my underarms have thick curly hair - did not remove.  </li>
            <li> It works on fine-to-very thick hair.    </li>
            <li> If you read the directions, it tells you to go slowly, and keep it at 90 degrees.  </li>
            <li> Go slow and let the tool do its job.  </li>
            <li> --I don&#x27;t know why anyone would need to used the slow speed.</li>
            <li> The only thing i agree with is that is very painful, especially underarms.</li>
            <li> I just wish there would be some way to anesthetize the pain, like other models that have a little massaging tool, or ice cold block.</li>
            <li> It is so much less painful than a dry one.  </li>
            <li> Besides, it seems like the shaver part is on the wrong side, and there is a trimmer on the other side of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is painful the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that the first time was very painful.</li>
            <li> With a little patience, I don&#x27;t think anyone should be sorry for purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I don&#x27;t think I am going to be able to use this on my legs again, because the ingrown hairs are a regular occurance and are very bad.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to go through such a painful process of plucking out hairs</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to go through such a painful process of plucking out hairs</li>
            <li> Finally today I felt so frustrated in the shower after spending 30 minutes for underarms(it</li>
            <li> this one not good.</li>
            <li> Battery life sucks and gets worse with age.  </li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer thing is worthless, I gave up trying to use it and just used my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Wish I could return because it sucks!</li>
            <li> with shaving it wasn&#x27;t painful, maybe minor bumps and razor burns.</li>
            <li> with shaving it wasn&#x27;t painful, maybe minor bumps and razor burns.</li>
            <li> If I am trying very hard, it does a 70% job.</li>
            <li> With dry epilation, I found it painful</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed at how little hair it grabs when going over the area, I have had to go over my legs and armpits several times</li>
            <li> They would be so bad that the whole area would become swollen and painful like nothing I&#x27;d ever had before.</li>
            <li> The shaving proces is even worse, it couse bleeding and it doesn&#x27;t shaved well.</li>
            <li> After some month of use, it became even worse.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine a worse epilator than this one.     </li>
            <li> If you are tired of shaving all the time I would suggest giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I wanted to leave my razor behind</li>
            <li> It works for thicker hair, but if you have really thin hair</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of forking over $$$ for waxing and don&#x27;t like to shave all the time.  </li>
            <li> She uses the epilator in her underarm and it is not as bad as with her legs, perhaps because hair is thicker and there is less to remove.</li>
            <li> would make it less painful</li>
            <li> it was just not good at all!</li>
            <li> was never happy with the results from shaving or using lotions, and waxing just seemed too bothersome and expensive.</li>
            <li> the legs and especially the shins, it&#x27;s still painful although not as painful as another epilator I had tried.  </li>
            <li> I have one bad epilator from Braun, but this is not much better when it comes to hair removal.</li>
            <li> I usually get waxed which is painful as well.  </li>
            <li> I COULD NEVER GO BACK TO SHAVING AND NASTY CREAMS.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not work as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> and it runs on battery, I often find myself looking for batteries at the wrong time of the day.....</li>
            <li> The worst ingrown hairs, ever, came back.  </li>
            <li> When you turn it on it sounds really scary</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the epilator does remove hair...</li>
            <li> because my hair is thick, the hair growth was painful.</li>
            <li> I gotta say it&#x27;s NOT perfect</li>
            <li> and then it is useless afterwards.</li>
            <li> You cannot use it when it is plugged in and this makes it a useless product.</li>
            <li> I have a long experience in epilators, and this one (as fancy as it looks) is the worst I ever had.</li>
            <li> Yes a little painful but what do you expect you are ripping your hair out!  </li>
            <li> However, I found that the underwater epilating was worst than the dry epilating.</li>
            <li> Awkward when using under the arms.  </li>
            <li> I have waxed my legs but was too afraid of the looming pain threshold for my armpit hairs.</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it !</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to epilate a \\&quot;shape\\&quot; to your grooming because of the bulkiness of the head.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant because of the bad but went ahead anyway.</li>
            <li> It took all day to epilate, and the performance was really bad</li>
            <li> I use this for my legs-doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad here and underarms- hurts soo bad here</li>
            <li> Bad points:  1.</li>
            <li> But after that, it hasn&#x27;t been that bad.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a really bad thing</li>
            <li> it was working well, but then batery went bad after about 1 yr.</li>
            <li> Shaving isn&#x27;t that bad, I guess.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that this was a definately painful process.  </li>
            <li> Using the epilator even with lather was insanely painful and caused blood blisters from pulling out the hair.  </li>
            <li> (painful) and then regrowth of hair (painful).</li>
            <li> (painful) and then regrowth of hair (painful).</li>
            <li> both of which I was disappointed in.</li>
            <li> My wife is absolutely disappointed with this epilator</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product&#x27;s ability to remove leg hairs.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work while being plugged in, which is utterly stupid.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;ve got guts and are sick of shaving, go for it!  </li>
            <li> I used to use the Emjoi OptiMini, and hated it - I found that the \\&quot;safety</li>
            <li> I also would recommend trying to hold skin taught (which is quite difficult) but the pinching part HURTS!!!  </li>
            <li> the epilating part was terrible.</li>
            <li> It was actually my worst area.  </li>
            <li> It does a terrible job and you have to go over and over the hair before it pulls it out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a piece of crap!!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> But this is the worst epilator she ever had.    </li>
            <li> It is the worst product ever!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell anyone how it works because I never used it after reading the instructions for this shaver/epilator, it scared me off from even trying it. It says not to use within 2-3 days before going into a pool or hot tub, not to use before or during menstrating. I realize they have to protect themselves from liabilities but I returned it. I use a pool and hot tub often.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this item. Epilating was all new to me. No pain in doing so. Just a slow process. Finding it works much better dry.  The trimmer works good.Sorry I bought it !</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations, and I will likely not use it again.  Money wasted.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not too long ago. I loved it until the battery wore out and I am not sure what to do about that. I don&#x27;t want to have to buy a new epilator. Other than that I am pleased with this epilator. If anyone has any suggestions of what to do about my battery let me know! besides I think I may just buy a new one since this one does not work for me. I do not recomment this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I charged this Panasonic Wet/Dry Two Speed Epliator for more than 20 hours, which is what they recommend charging it before the first use, 20 hours, but I wanted to make sure it was fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased other more expensive epliators in the past, but they hurt like the dickens.  I admit that I have a low pain threshhold.  I was hoping that since this product could also be used wet, that you add body wash to it, so that it foams would make it less painful but it wasn&#x27;t.  The wet option was the main selling point for me, and I did read the reviews, but I guess everyone is different, pain tolerance wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could barely use it, and it left my skin really red.  Even on the lower speed, which is what I used, the head moves so fast, which at least to me seems to be part of the problem.  I did use it at night, in case there was bleeding, which is what they recommend doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a shaver option, but I didn&#x27;t buy this for that.  Besides, it seems like the shaver part is on the wrong side, and there is a trimmer on the other side of the shaver.  The looks of this product is nice, but I doubt I will use it again.  I&#x27;d have to be heavily sedated to not feel the pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikini option I would never attempt, so I can&#x27;t speak to that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read all of the directions before using this, so I could make sure I was using it the way they say to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone could make a long lasting hair remover that isn&#x27;t like a torture device.  Creams etc either don&#x27;t work for me, or also make my face beet red.  I have tried basically everything, from razors on up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to those buyers who can use this, or are successful with this.  I wasn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for about 10 years, and was using a Remington Ice epilator.  When it finally died a sad (but well deserved) death, I went looking for a replacement.  I read these reviews, and was fascinated with the whole wet/dry/cordless thing.  Well, it may hurt less when wet (which wasn&#x27;t the problem as I am used to and expected the pain), but I won&#x27;t bother as it doesn&#x27;t pull out the hair!  I had to go over the same area over and over for it to catch the hairs.  I am not expecting perfection, but I expected some improvement after ten years, and it was far worse than my (sniff) old epilator.  I used to be able to do both legs in about 20 minutes.  I just spent about 30, and still have a significant amount of hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> I think this works great.  I had tried epilators in the past and man did it hurt.  I felt no pain with this using it with shower gel in the shower.  I lost the head for it though and had to buy a cheaper shaver at the drug store and I can tell the difference.  I will buy this again eventually and try not to lose any of the parts.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  Panasonic i a good brand, it is working very well, and I am happy to have had the oportunity to buy this product.  I&#x27;d recomend you.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for over 6 years now (on my legs) and thought I&#x27;d give my Braun Silk epil a break.  Invested on the Panasonic and it does not work at all.  Had to pass it over the same area about 5 times to get the hair, and it didn&#x27;t even get it all.  Ended up returning the product - go with a Braun if you want results.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator for my Wife&#x27;s birthday.  She absolutely loves it!  She&#x27;s not one to write reviews so here I am reviewing it for her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The feature my wife loves the most is that she can use this in the shower or bath tub.  This is what sold me on the item for my wife.  After looking through all other epilators, none of them offered the wet/dry feature.  The opening of the pores allows for easy and painless extraction of the hair from her legs.  Use of soap or bath gel helps with the removal of hair.  I&#x27;ve never felt her legs softer for a longer period of time!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver head and bikini comb are also great offerings provided by Panasonic as well.  All 3 attachments for one unit is a great value from Panasonic.  Thanks Panasonic!!!!</li>
            <li> Having used this epilator in and out of the shower now, I have to say that I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with it&#x27;s performance outside of the shower.  It seems to only work half as well and as fast used as dry as it does when used with soap and water.      That being said, it does an excellent job when used wet.  I&#x27;ve even been able to stand using it on my underarms and more intimate areas with minimum pain - and believe me, I&#x27;ve used an epilator dry in those areas before and it hurt like a son of a gun!    I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d buy this particular item again, but it worth the money I did spend on it.</li>
            <li> I received this less than a year ago and loved it after some painful conditioning of my legs to withstand the use of an epilator.  It doesn&#x27;t grab hair as easily as I would like, therefore it would take me a good hour to 45 minutes of using the epilator to achieve decent results.  Even then, there were many leftover hairs.  This is NOT good for grabbing small hairs, either.  The worst part about this is that the battery dries up quickly, and you cannot use the epilator while it is plugged in, and charging!  This was also my first epilator.  Now I see why it may be beneficial to spend the extra money on a high end model.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on this epilator and others.  It seemed about half and half, good and bad.  I was hesitant because of the bad but went ahead anyway. I have never used an epilator before. I agree with the reviews that felt it was a bit slow (you have to go over and over) but it does work.  I am a huge baby when it comes to pain and it does sting but I use it in the shower (a huge plus with this one, and also the cordless option) and use shower gel.  It does help a bit.  I actually purchased this for my face.  I have more than average facial hair and it does say in the instructions not to use on face (didn&#x27;t know this until I got it) I use it anyway, I am just real careful.  I do not suffer any rash or redness.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> It was my second choise, after I have had a Brown model for so many years, and it become old. In the begining it worked somehow, but it wasn&#x27;t as good as my old epilator even after I used it for so many years. It takes so much time to epilate and even after finishing it, let&#x27;s a lot of hairs. The shaving proces is even worse, it couse bleeding and it doesn&#x27;t shaved well. After some month of use, it became even worse. It took all day to epilate, and the performance was really bad and I couldn&#x27;t do at all the shaving. I returned on Brown models and they are really a good investment.  Definitely this one is a waste of money and something I do not recommend to have.</li>
            <li> It works OK &amp; from what I can tell it works best with soap lather rather than dry.  I do think my Emjoi does a better job, but it&#x27;s great to have one for in the shower.  I haven&#x27;t tried the regular razor yet.  I do think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely overpriced.  Awkward when using under the arms.  Have to continuously go over the same area and does not grab very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I had the old blue epilator and it stopped working (was y fault) got this new one and its perfect, even better than the last one. Doesnt hurt that much, so smooth, I love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned my Panasonic ES2045P Epilator.. it was just not good at all! I had to rub it several times on my skin to pull out the hair, there were certain hairs that it just did not pull out at all! I do not reccomend it to anyone! I bought another Epilator from Braun and I really like it! So if you are going to spend your money, spend it well!! The only good thing about the Panasonic Epilator is that it does not hurt as much as others.. but maybe this is only because it does not pull out the hair that way it was supposed to..oh well!</li>
            <li> My first epilator was the original Epilady.  I loved it to death, literally.  I used it so much that it finally just gave out on me.  At the time, I couldn&#x27;t afford a new machine.  I recently got back to being able to afford a few luxuries.  So, I started researching the latest in epilators.  Wow!  I had no idea this type of product had gotten so diverse.  I chose the Panasonic Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epliator with Three Heads (actually just two, but an attachment gives one of the heads dual functionality) because of the multi-functionality it offers.  Boy does it deliver!  Not only do I have the choice of using it while my skin is dry (great for a quick touch up) or wet (very helpful for epilation), but I can also shave, trim my bikini line or pluck out unwanted hairs.  Given the way the old epilator felt, I&#x27;m very happy with this new one because I feel that the hair removal is much less painful.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This epilator is amazing. The reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish the battery charge would last longer than 30 min, but that is enough time to do a great job on your legs and armpits.  Let´s face it, I don&#x27;t have fine invisible hair, my hairs are thick and grow fast. However, since I started using the panasonic epilator I&#x27;ve noticed my hairs have changed, they seem softer to the touch and finer :) I AM SO HAPPY!   If you use it as directed,  you won&#x27;t feel too much pain while epilating, it&#x27;s just wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> it is not effective, it miss a lot of hair  no i&#x27;m trying to return it and go back to my old one \\&quot;braun\\&quot;</li>
            <li> simply did not remove all the hair effectively.  i read those instructions and tried multiple tactics and this simply did not work for me.  my legs have straight hairs that are fine - didn&#x27;t remove.  my underarms have thick curly hair - did not remove.  i gave it two stars because the trimmer worked very well but i bought it to save $$ on waxing.  the epilating part was terrible.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic works ok, but not sure epilating in general is for me. It does hurt like hell the first few times, but I got through that ok, its the damn bumps or most people say ingrown hairs that are my biggest problem. It seems the machine might grap a little skin as well as hair. I will give it a little more time and see if it clears up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to disagree with one of the earlier reviewers who said that the armpits are less sensitive than other areas of the body.  It was actually my worst area.  My legs and shins were not bad at all.  But the results are outstanding.     Two negatives I have found:    1.  I find that the Epilator is very slippery and hard to hold on to while using.  Because you need to use a lot of soap to keep the friction down, it gets everywhere and makes it hard to hold correctly.  I think they could improve the design to be more textured for a better grip.  You get used to the slipperiness after a while, and it&#x27;s not so much of a problem, but it takes a little practice.    2.  The pop up trimmer, while nice in theory, isn&#x27;t as good as my husband&#x27;s beard trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t trim as close or as well.  I&#x27;m going to just keep using his for the trimming, but use the shaver and the epilator portion of this tool.    Overall, even though I thought I would cry while doing my armpits, I have to say that the ends justify the means.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well. I don&#x27;t have 30 minutes to shave my legs. It does a terrible job and you have to go over and over the hair before it pulls it out. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months so far and even let the hair grow out 1/4 inch and still no luck. I&#x27;ve also used it wet and had to spend too much time getting the water out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year now. I don&#x27;t use it quite as much as I did when I first got it. I remembered it hurt when I first used it but that was expected. It has instructions on what to do if you notice stuff like red spotting from when you pull your hair out. My hair has gotten thinner and don&#x27;t grow as much. I get a couple of ingrown hairs from using this, but they&#x27;re easy to take care of. It works well wet or dry, and so far it hasn&#x27;t failed me. My only complaint is that it takes FOREVER (maybe an hour?) to get rid of my hair, and even then, there&#x27;s still a couple stray hairs lurking around. I just take a tweezer to them. Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time epilator, and I love this product. I mostly bought it because I have trouble with my bikini line and underarms--I have very thick, deep, dark hair. I tried it on my arms and got through it, but found it was far too painful for legs. I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do bikini line/underarms if I couldn&#x27;t do my legs, so I ordered some Gigi numbing spray, and that did the trick--made the pain 100% manageable. The instruction manual says not to use on underarms or bikini line, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem. Definitely worth the money, and one of my best beauty purchases yet. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this over two years ago and it still works wonderfully.  I would love to get my underarms waxed on a regular basis, but there is no way I could afford that.  This epilator paid for itself after just a few uses - works just as well as getting waxed.  Of course it hurts, it&#x27;s an epilator - you should know that going in.  Results are wonderful - my hair comes back slower and thinner than shaving.  Having the razor attachment is just an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily because I don&#x27;t have time to shave everyday, and I don&#x27;t like the mess of at-home waxing. So for the price of one professional waxing session I bought this epilator. Completely worth it! I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet, but using it dry works great.    Pros:     You get the same smooth results as waxing, but none of the mess; you won&#x27;t run out of wax strips or constantly throw money away buying new supplies or paying to have it done professionally since this has a rechargeable battery.     It comes with multiple heads. I like this feature because at the time of purchase I didn&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;d like the product, but I could still use the razor function regardless of the epilator. Also I found out in the instructions that there are certain areas you&#x27;re not supposed to use the epilator (I&#x27;ve used it on my arms, legs, and for the very fine hair on my stomach). This product saves me from having to clutter up my space with more stuff.    It doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore than waxing (though obviously everyone has a different pain tolerance).    It comes with a cap, cleaning brush and a storage bag. I really appreciate these seemingly small things because it helps keep the machine clean and is easily maintainable.     It has two speeds.     It works on fine-to-very thick hair.    What I wish I had known before I bought it:    That it takes 20 hours to charge the first time you use it, or after having not used it for a while. Then each subsequent charge takes 12 hours to complete, and still you only get about a half hour of actual usage. This seems totally excessive and disproportionate by most battery standards. The box doesn&#x27;t mention the battery&#x27;s limitations and makes it seem as though you can use the product either plugged-in or cordless. You can&#x27;t, it only operates when it is cordless. The half hour time-limit can make doing multiple large areas in one sitting difficult. For this reason, I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars.     All things considered, this epilator gives great results.</li>
            <li> I love epilating but this one missed a lot of hair and was slow not like others that I&#x27;ve tried. I will be buying a dif one.</li>
            <li> After using this epilator for a couple months, I decided epilating wasn&#x27;t for me. Some people can take the pain, and some can&#x27;t--I can&#x27;t. The real reason I&#x27;ve given this epilator 2 stars though is that it leaves a LOT of hair behind. Obviously, one would prefer to make as few passes over the area as possible, but this epilator could never seem to grab all the hairs. You&#x27;re not supposed to go over the same area multiple times, but that was the only way to get even most of the hair.    On a positive note, the cordless function is nice, as is the wet/dry option. For me, some areas were easier to epilate wet, and others dry. I can&#x27;t comment on the battery life, because I was never able to endure the pain that long....</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Epilator, I bought a Epilady 20 years ago, hardly used it due to the  pain and felt it was dangerous. The Panasonic ES2045P is wonderful, pretty much pain free, great features, and well designed. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a reasonably price product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> excelente vendedor, cumplio con los tiempos establecidos y el porducto se llego a su destino en perfectas condiciones, recomendado 100%</li>
            <li> Works just as well wet, as it does dry.  It is much faster, more thorough, and less painful than my previous epilator.  The shaving head also works quite nicely, but it&#x27;s an electric razor, so don&#x27;t expect it to be as smooth as shaving with a bladed razor.  The battery lasts much longer than the manual says it will, I&#x27;ve used mine multiple times longer than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> This is the best of all that I have tried and the best price also.   The other brand I returned because it didn&#x27;t work as they stated.  This one works great, no pain and very few ingrown hairs.  I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet as it works great dry.  Love it- Love it- Love it. I give it \\&quot;5 stars\\&quot;</li>
            <li> i used epilator but it is not worthy of 45 dollars and its unable to remove properly.</li>
            <li> I use to epilate my legs all the time. My old one, which was Bruan, would do this fast and effectively, and actually remove the hair! This one took me AGES, and has a very narrow head...making it even slower. My leg hairs have also become ingrown. If you are looking for a bikini trimmer/razor than this product is good, but I wanted it to work as an epilator first and foremost...THEN as a bonus, be a trimmer/razor.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed at how little hair it grabs when going over the area, I have had to go over my legs and armpits several times and I still am missing spots, this product was $30 more at Target so I decided to order it from here.  Wish I could return because it sucks! I wish I would have invested in the Braun one or an epilady.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED THIS BRAND FOR ABOUT 4 YEARS NOW AND GOING THROUGH AMAZON WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER. IT WAS THE BEST BARGAIN EVER AND I GOT IT IN 2 DAYS THOUGH I REQUESTED FOR THE REGULAR SHIPPING AND HANDLING WHICH WAS FREE :) I LOVE AMAZON!!! BTW EPILATOR MIGHT HURT IN THE BEGINNING IF YOU ARE NOT USED TO IT BUT ITS SO WORTH IT BECAUSE YOUR HAIR WILL GROW BACK THINNER AND LESS. I COULD NEVER GO BACK TO SHAVING AND NASTY CREAMS.</li>
            <li> When I finally decided to buy this product I was excited to get it and start using it. Unfortunately it does not work as well as I hoped. I choose this one mainly because of the price but I would suggest spending a bit more money and get a higher quality product. The shaver attachment works great but the tweezer attachment does not. The results are some hair left over and short lived results. Overall I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It is definitely better than shaving, and less costly than waxing, but this model kind of sucks. I have to go over the same spot five times to ensure all the hair is gone. Also, you can not use it while it is charging which is kind of stupid. The model I had before this one had a light attachment which was very useful</li>
            <li> I always through about buying an epilator but still remembered the reviews on the original ones from years ago.  My friend bought one and loved it so I thought I would give it a try.  I am a hair removing fanatic. Medium skin tones, thick dark hair.  I have shaved, waxed, professional laser hair removal, personal home laser hair removal, hair removal creams and the list goes on...  I have had cuts, ingrowns, burns, redness etc.  I can honestly say this epilator was a great surprise.  It really works though I haven&#x27;t had time to see how long I was hair free.  The pain was minimal on my arms however, the pain on my thighs was worse.  I am scared to try my underarms.  Note, that I do have thick, dark hair, however, I have only few hairs here and there from years of laser hair removal.  That being said, the pain was still great on the legs so beware.  I am sure the second time will be a lot better.  I am going to try it after showering as suggested in the manual...that might lessen the pain.  Price was unbelievably inexpensive on Amazon.  Equals the cost of 4-5 packs of disposable razors!! I recommend this product if you can take some pain. What women go through....</li>
            <li> This epilator is easy to hold and use. I don&#x27;t find it to be as effective as I had hoped, however. It is difficult to remove the small fine hairs around the chin and neck area and takes a number of tries before total removal. Even then, small hairs seem to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; up. If I were buying again, I would probably try another brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and she says it is awesome. The shipment was fast, the price is low and the quality the top. Definitively recommended.</li>
            <li> arrived on time, fast and perfect condition. I have never had a problem buy from amazon, i have to say i am truly satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s a Panasonic and the price was good. However, it takes multiple passes in all directions and circular movements to get most of the hair. And it still misses. The battery life is only good for like 15 minutes or two body parts. It won&#x27;t work while being plugged in, which is utterly stupid. I would guesstimate about 83% of the hair is being pulled from the roots. The rest are being torn off just above the surface. I should have spent more for an Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I just got this epilator after my braun silkepil broke and I have to say this one is way better. The price is better and the machine is way more gentle and less painful that the braun one. The posibility to be used in the shower makes the process less messy and more enjoyable.  I´ve just noticed that you have to insist more if you want to get rid of absolutly all the hairs, but it compensates for the painless performance. I was reading that is better to use it without the skin protector thing, next time I´ll do it like that.  I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the depilatory aspect, OUCH-this hurts pretty badly (or maybe I&#x27;m just a weeny) but its does the job. I use this for my legs-doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad here and underarms- hurts soo bad here but I am happy with my results. I have not gotten used to the pain but I enjoy not have to shave my underarms or legs for weeks at a time. Takes a while to do my legs cause of the ratio between number of tweezing heads to the amount of leg hair on my legs and it doesn&#x27;t get every hair but its very nice and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Its also pretty loud, even on the lower of the two speeds. I didn&#x27;t use it for two months after I bought it cause the noise alone scared the beeswax out of me  Legs: Works best after a shower- towel dry legs to  Underarms: Works best 24 hours after a shower to reduce pinching- I also would recommend trying to hold skin taught (which is quite difficult) but the pinching part HURTS!!!  Again it works but buyer beware</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money... it&#x27;s a piece of crap!! I&#x27;ve used epilators before plenty of times and I have never had any problems like I have had with this one. It barely grabs hairs and it ruined my bikini line, I now have scars because of it.</li>
            <li> I bought it on Amazon and have been using it since then. It works very well and no problem yet!</li>
            <li> very best Epilator. I used many types of epilator but i found this is the best</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that I ever owned. It does an ok job of removing hair but really just OK. It does not capture every hair, especially the fine ones. Starting to get in grown hair from this after a few months of use. I am ready to move on and find a better epilator.     Below are a few pros and cons    Pros:  1) Wet/Dry - The wet feature is very helpful as it keeps pain level down. and makes cleaning the product quick and easy.  2)Cordless - Don&#x27;t need to sit next to an outlet, a big plus (but could also be a con, see below)    Cons:  1) Does not capture all hair, I need to go over the same area several times to remove all hair.  2) Cordless - Battery doesn&#x27;t last too long, and if I forget to recharge it, it won&#x27;t be ready for me to use whenever I want to</li>
            <li> Horrible product. To remove hair takes ages! Simply does not remove hair efficiently. I do not recommend. And I m purchasing another.</li>
            <li> I got a small panasonic epilator that works pretty good but since its really small and it runs on battery, I often find myself looking for batteries at the wrong time of the day.....and it takes a helluva long time to finish since its so small. I decided to buy this because I needed something rechargeable, big enough to do the job faster, and works in the shower so I dont have to clean up the mess afterwards.....I tried it today and the bikini trimmer worked perfect....the epilator? Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 2 years now. It was the best in its category and is useful addition to ur personal accessory kit. The battery lasts for ample amount of time allowing repeated usage 4-5 times (of course depending upon frequency of use and skin area you use for)   Its handy, best for last moment use if you are rushing for any party and want to get avoid salon appointments. Most importantly it can be carried in handbag on tours and outings. This is wht i like about this product.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver except that in the advertisement for it, it says you can use it with the cord provided making it sound as though you could use it while plugged in.  Well, you can&#x27;t - the cord is only for recharging.  I can only get about 3 to 3 1/2 shavings from it before it \\&quot;dies\\&quot;.  If you could plug it in and recharge it while you are using it, you wouldn&#x27;t have to wait the 12 hours for recharge.      Other than that, it works great and is convenient because its cordless and therefore travel ready.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the hopes of having to shave less often and for the dual epilator/shaver feature. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over all I am very pleased.  Like other reviewers I think on the legs and armpits it works best in the shower when you are nice and lathered up with soap - the lather helps get rid of the friction as the head moves over the skin and it&#x27;s a much smoother shave.  I found that without lather the movement was somewhat jerky, the head didn&#x27;t slide over the skin and smoothly and it was more painful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the legs and especially the shins, it&#x27;s still painful although not as painful as another epilator I had tried.  It works absolutely great (when lathered up) on the armpits.  I did both of them quickly, completely and with very little pain - I think your armpits must be less sensitive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did my bikini area - again definately works better and hurts less when your skin is lathered up.  I do have to say that this was a definately painful process.  While it still works great on this area, I think waxing may stil be best for a couple reasons.  1) Waxing does the whole area in one fell swoop and therefore you are only in pain for a moment as opposed to several minutes with the epilator; because your bikini line is so sensitive, this makes a big difference.  2) It is nearly impossible to epilate a \\&quot;shape\\&quot; to your grooming because of the bulkiness of the head.  Unless you&#x27;re removing all hair it would be difficult to do just a certain area.  (For this reason I gave four stars not five) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I happend to have a few mutant hairs on my chin that I have to pluck every now and again; just for giggles I tried it on my face (dry).  It worked AWESOME.  I ran over my chin a only a couple times and it got even the smallest thinest hairs you couldn&#x27;t really see. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall great product but not the best for bikini area.</li>
            <li> I though this would be really effective because it has so many tweezers and a larger surface area to cover, but I found i had to use it on the same spot several times to get the hair out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who came up with epi-anything, maybe it&#x27;s because my hairs are so deeply rooted in my skin that it&#x27;s medieval torture to pull them out.  I tried it on my chin, really soapy with warm water and I could feel the little metal things grinding against my face like I was plowing a field.  The worst ingrown hairs, ever, came back.  Nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good on my legs, either, even wet in the shower.  The shaver attachment all right, it holds a charge nicely, nice that you can use it in the shower, so for that I give it 2 stars.  But other than that - ouch.  OUUUCCHHH.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to try out the epilator yet but the shipping was speedy and the product in good order.</li>
            <li> I have previously used the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress and the Braun Silk Epil, and I have to say this is definitely the best. With the other 2 you can only use them dry, so I would usually take a shower, exfoliate, and then use it after my shower. My skin would usually be sore and red for a while afterward and it did hurt somewhat. One thing I didn&#x27;t like about epilating was that you had to do it dry, and I missed taking baths and shaving (although I don&#x27;t like the results of shaving), so I decided to give this product a try.     I did as the instructions said and put body wash onto the tweezers and the area that I was epilating. As I epilated, it created suds which helped it glide along. Here are the good points of the product:  1. It took the hair off easily and less painfully than the other epilators. It wasn&#x27;t completely pain free, but it was much better.  2. Because you use it in the shower, you can easily rinse and dry it and you&#x27;re done. With my Braun epilator, it gets dirty easily and the hairs are difficult to get out.   3. It comes with a little cap, which I really appreciate (Braun does not).   4. You can use it without the cord  5. It seemed to leave my underarms and legs even smoother than with other epilators and with much less redness or irritation.   6. Slightly quieter than other epilators I&#x27;ve tried, but still could be quieter.    Bad points:  1. It didn&#x27;t remove every single hair...but I have never seen an epilator that could.  2. As with all epilation, it is time consuming to do your legs, but the soap suds make it easier, and it&#x27;s worth it because you dont have to do it that often.   3. You can&#x27;t use it with the cord plugged in.    I haven&#x27;t tried the shaver or trimmer yet. For those people who are complaining that the charge didn&#x27;t last very long, keep this in mind: when used the first time, it needs to be charged a full 20 hours before use. After that, 12 hours should be sufficient. But if the battery goes completely dead, it will need to be charged another 20 hours again. Also, you have to use body wash or something sudsy, otherwise it won&#x27;t work, it even says that in the directions. I love this epilator and am so happy that I made the purchase.    **Update**: After using this for about a year now, I can give a more thorough review. It still works great in the shower on my underarms. But after using it  on my legs a few times I started getting SEVERE ingrown hairs. They would be so bad that the whole area would become swollen and painful like nothing I&#x27;d ever had before. I am very disappointed because I don&#x27;t think I am going to be able to use this on my legs again, because the ingrown hairs are a regular occurance and are very bad. I am confused about why this is happening and am starting to think it is only this particular epilator...as I mentioned before, I have used both the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress and Braun before this and never had this problem with the ingrowns. If anyone else out there has had this same problem and can give me some info, please comment.    I have also used the shaver and the \\&quot;bikini comb\\&quot; thing, both of which I was disappointed in. On my legs, it didn&#x27;t give me a very close shave at all, and my hair is not even very thick or dark. I also tried to use it on my bikini area and it was pointless, the shave was so NOT close that I would have rather just used a dull razor, it would have at least got closer. The bikini trimmer thing is worthless, I gave up trying to use it and just used my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now and it works reasonably well. For me, it works great on my legs. When you turn it on it sounds really scary but once you suck it up and put it to use it&#x27;s really not so bad. It hurts more for longer hairs (like arm hairs) so think about trimming those first (but it&#x27;s more work). I really bought it for my underarms since shaving only makes hairs coarser and hand plucking is so tedious but I have to say that it really doesn&#x27;t work for my underarms. I tried it in the shower with lather, too, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to grab anything. I even tried to pull my skin taut but still no luck. So if you&#x27;ll use it primarily for your legs then go for it but if you&#x27;re planning on using it on other parts of your body, you might want to rethink this product.</li>
            <li> I returned this epilator.  I&#x27;ve been waxing for years but am tired of the effort &amp; mess of at home waxing, and the expense of salon waxing.  But maybe I&#x27;m spoiled and my expectations are too high.  This was my first epilator.  I chose this one for the wet/dry.  I tried the epilator head in shower, out of shower, after shower, with soap, dry... just never got results I would expect for a device that is supposed to make my life easier.  Why should I have to try so hard?  I read the directions carefully, tried to get the soap exactly the consistency they recommend...  and I didn&#x27;t think the trimmer or shaver were that great.  I have a beard trimmer I use for my bikini line which was only ten bucks which works better.  I have very fine hair, so maybe epilators can&#x27;t grab it.  I don&#x27;t know... back to waxing.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and have very sensitive skin.  Using the epilator even with lather was insanely painful and caused blood blisters from pulling out the hair.  What&#x27;s the point in removing the hair if you are breaking out in rashes and blood blisters??  I also found that it didn&#x27;t grab the hair very well at all, so it&#x27;s a lot of pain and frustration for almost no hair removal.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it. It makes things easier for her, when she needs to shave legs etc.. She loves it and was very surprised and the ease of use. Thanx for great buy</li>
            <li> I bought this product thrilled with the thought that I could use an epilator in the shower.  Even though that&#x27;s possible, the very last thing this product does is remove hair -- at least with the epilator head.  The shaving head works fairly well, but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better.  I can&#x27;t believe Panasonic thinks they&#x27;ll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective.</li>
            <li> I have been using a dry epilator for years, and thought I would try this new wet product. I love it now, but it took some getting used to. You have to follow directions and lather up a lot before the epilator starts to work really well. I find that it works better if you use soap or bath gel instead of shaving cream, and also go SLOWLY. I love it though. I find my legs are softer in general then when I used to just use a dry epilator. &lt;br /&gt;The shaving head works fairly well too.</li>
            <li> I tried using this product many ways under many different conditions, and it never, ever gave me the \\&quot;4-week sleek!\\&quot; of its advertising.  No matter how much time I spent or the quality of the lighting or how I prepared my skin, I always find patches of uncleared hair mere hours later.  I&#x27;m not talking about tiny stubble, but hairs that are several millimeters long.  If I can grab said hair with my fingernails and pull them, there&#x27;s no reason this device should have missed them.    The only reason I gave this thing two stars is that it is eminently portable and de-links shaving from a water source.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend to replace an older Remington epilator which had stopped working after 5 years. Everything looked great until she tried to use it.  With the guard piece on, the Panasonic epilator would hardly get any hair and was breaking a lot of hairs instead of plucking them.  With the guard piece off, it would still pull very poorly and was causing many cuts on the skin.  Product just didn&#x27;t work properly. Returning this dysfunctional product and buying an Remington instead.</li>
            <li> So the first time is definitely the most painful, and it gets easier after that. but i found that the hair doesnt stay gone for long. my legs seemed to be in a constant state of \\&quot;spikey\\&quot; even though i tried to use it at any sign of hair. it also has a small head, so even if it did work perfectly, you dont remove much hair at once. it tends to take a long long time to get every area. i&#x27;ve only tried it in the shower once, so maybe it works better wet than dry. but overall, i wasnt too pleased with this product. i might try to return/exchange it for a different epilator. the only way i can get my legs smooth for longer than a day is to epilate, then shave. but i think that defeats the purpose...  but i suppose everyone has different hair textures and growth patterns, so what didnt work for me might just work for you. i have pretty sensitive legs and hair that grows back with the slightest chill in the air. so that could be it too.   hope this helped!</li>
            <li> This epilator works well, but you&#x27;ll need to pass the same area a few times before you get all hair removed so it&#x27;s a little time consuming. I used to have an epilady and after 7 years it died on me I wish I still had the old one it worked better than this new one. Oh well, this one works well but improvements could be made to the design.</li>
            <li> Because this works great.  If you read the directions, it tells you to go slowly, and keep it at 90 degrees.  Also if you use it in the tub you are supposed to put gel or lather on it to help the blades move.    I personally love this epilator.  This was my first time using one and I expected alot more pain.  I did my legs, underarms, and bikini zone all in 30 mins.  It works great!!  Yes a little painful but what do you expect you are ripping your hair out!  It keeps a charge wonderfully and is easy to hold.  I would recommend this product for anyone whether advanced or just beginning.</li>
            <li> This product is okay if you have the time (and the patience) to sit there and shave your legs for quite a while...Being a full-time student and a full-time employee, I don&#x27;t have either.   Okay so I liked how you can take the product into the shower. That&#x27;s pretty cool and the shaver works pretty well actually. But I have issues with the epilator. This is where you need the patience. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the epilator does remove hair...but you have to go over the same spot several times in order to catch all the hair and even then, when you think you&#x27;re done, you will find several patches of hair that you missed. I have to add, for all of those people that think that maybe I was using the epilator incorrectly, that I read the directions thoroughly and more than once, just to make sure that I was using the epilator/shaver correctly. I was.   So that&#x27;s really all I have to say. It doesn&#x27;t work THAT well but it does work eventually. I would have given this product 3 stars instead of 2 but unfortunately for panasonic, I wrote this review after I went out and purchased the Braun Silk Epil and that works SO MUCH BETTER. One swipe over your leg and the hair is pretty much all gone. The Braun is better at picking up the shorter and low-lying hairs. I should have purchased the Braun to begin with, especially since one of my friends told me the Braun works great. One more lesson learnt - always listen to your girlfriends when it comes to shaving products.</li>
            <li> This product just really does not do the job. It is painless because it doesn&#x27;t actually pull any hairs. It seems to be a quality build, but the motor is not as strong as a model that works directly as a corded model. Most of all, the tweezing mechanism does not grab hairs of any length or thickness as far as I can tell. I had to return it.    I had previously owned a Philips Satinelle Ice which worked quite well overall. However, I will say it was not durable. Somewhat cheaply made. Still, I found that with heavy use and at a price of approx $55 it was still a good deal if I had to replace it every 6 or 9 months. Apparently that product is now discontinued. Not sure what to try next. The tweezing method of the ceramic disks in this product is definitely the best design I&#x27;ve seen in action so far.</li>
            <li> You are ripping hair out by the root, so you should expect some pain. I have used this model on my legs for 2 years now and after probably the first 3-4 times I used it, I felt only discomfort on my legs. Your body definitely gets used to the pain, but expect varying levels of discomfort.    I love that I can use it in the shower. I find that if I use it a few times a week in the shower, it keeps my legs smooth and it takes just a few seconds. If you wait several weeks, it takes much longer to go over your legs and it is obviously more painful. I also use it on my arms (which is more painful than the legs!), but I love the results!</li>
            <li> This is not working as expected.  We used once and stopped using this.  Our need is not survived.    I will not recommend this model to any one.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in perfect condition and the delivery was on time. I was very please with this company that sold me the item. However, I decided to rate this item 4 because it can irritate your skin. Personally, I got a bunch of little bumps on my legs and it can take two to three times to use the product to get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> My wife is absolutely disappointed with this epilator and she regrets the moment we decided to buy it. Although she doesn&#x27;t like cordless devices, this one has good reviews and also included something really useful: a trimmer for the bikini area. But this is the worst epilator she ever had.    First, batteries last nothing. She cannot epilate one of her legs with the whole charge and then she has to wait 12 hours for this to charge and be ready again. The process is not painful at all, but this is because it barely removes any hairs from her legs. The head is too small and it doesn&#x27;t have settings hair thickness.    She uses the epilator in her underarm and it is not as bad as with her legs, perhaps because hair is thicker and there is less to remove. But there it hurts, a lot.    The one star is because she does like the trimmer. It works great and it is the only reason this epilator is not going to trash can.</li>
            <li> There is a lack of wet to dry comparisons/reviews for this epilator so I went ahead and attempted both and especially came on here to report my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am half Middle Eastern, half Asian. The hairiest people of the world on one end, and the least hairiest people on the other end. So what does that make me? Kinda hairy, but not disgustingly hairy. haha. So then epilator? YES PLEASE! Because this hair is taking over my body! jk ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this especially for my arm pits. I have waxed my legs but was too afraid of the looming pain threshold for my armpit hairs. So I never waxed my armpits. Instead I am trying to epilate them. (yes I just made up that word)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRY EPILATOR-&lt;br /&gt;Left armpit I did it dry. Results? DANG THAT HURT!! But I just gritted my teeth and just finished it! I had a few stray hairs left over that I had to tweeze after. I even attempted putting a bag of frozen peas on my armpit first to numb it but it HURT MORE!! Idk... the frozen action did NOT help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WET EPILATOR-&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!!! I am SO serious when I say that it didn&#x27;t hurt that much wet (and I have a LOW threshold for pain!)! I tried this with conditioner and I didn&#x27;t like how it made my armpit too slippery. It didn&#x27;t catch and pull the hairs out very well. Then I attempted it with just liquid body soap-- LOVED!!! The epilator glided over my armpit very smoothly which facilitated on the epilation of my armpit hairs! And stray hairs to tweeze later? NONE! yahoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first attempt at epilators and I am very pleased with how it works so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also LOVE the trimmer/shaver head! It works so well! I use it on my bikini area and it&#x27;s my favorite way to trim so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE REVIEW: 3/3/2011**&lt;br /&gt;When I epilated all my armpit hair, my armpits were sore for 2.5 days. Of course when you pluck all that hair out! Especially mine, which is thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the growing back is what was uncomfortable and HURT even. because my hair is thick, the hair growth was painful. In some ways, I want to just shave instead so I don&#x27;t have to go through such a painful process of plucking out hairs (painful) and then regrowth of hair (painful). with shaving it wasn&#x27;t painful, maybe minor bumps and razor burns. This HURT. Let&#x27;s try it for a little longer to see more long term results.ant to just shave instead so I don&#x27;t have to go through such a painful process of plucking out hairs (painful) and then regrowth of hair (painful). with shaving it wasn&#x27;t painful, maybe minor bumps and razor burns. This HURT. Let&#x27;s try it for a little longer to see more long term results.</li>
            <li> This item had trouble charging from the moment we recieved it.  We opened it up to find a fried circuitboard between the connection to the cable and the battery.</li>
            <li> One of the smartest purchases I&#x27;ve made. This little thing is so great and so well priced. When I am in too much of a rush to finish epilating, I switch the head and shave the rest and I&#x27;m ready to go. A couple of days later I can go back and epilate the hairs that I previously shaved. Never really tried using the bikini trimmer because that&#x27;s not my thing but the shaver and epilator and just great. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it takes forever to charge and cannot be used while charging. If Panasonic could work on that they would have a stellar product on their hands.</li>
            <li> I had a 4 years old epilator of another brand and it was still perfect. Than I came to USA and I encountered with a plug problem so I decided to buy a new one instead of buying a voltage adaptor. I read all the reviews about all the epilators within this price range and I decided to buy this one.     I am using this machine for more than 6 months now and I can easily say that the thing this machine does may be described by many things; but epilating is not one of them. you have to go over, over, over, over and over on the same area to get rid off hair (I don&#x27;t know if i put enough &#x27;over&#x27;s!!!).     Finally today I felt so frustrated in the shower after spending 30 minutes for underarms(it usually takes less than 5 minutes with my old epilator) and I used a razor.     I can&#x27;t imagine a worse epilator than this one.     The only good thing about this machine; it does not give any pain, since it does not pull any hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried epilators in the past, and they were torture devices, but this Panasonic changed my mind. It is gentle, but may take a little getting used to. I have a very low pain threshold, and I loved this from Day 1!   It leaves your legs smooth for days at a time. I used to shave my legs daily, but no more. This epilator is a joy to use, easy to clean, and the instructions are easy.  Overall I am very pleased with this Epilator and would recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product works well, and with relatively little pain. If you haven&#x27;t tried this before, do expect some discomfort.  It is just tweezing really fast when you get right down to it. Being able to use the product in the shower is really great. If you haven&#x27;t used similar products before, expect to have to use this thing a couple of times a week before hair growth slows. My only complaint is that the hair removal area is too narrow. With a little patience, I don&#x27;t think anyone should be sorry for purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Very good product, easy to use, and even when wet, and the price is just reasonable, love it so much, great!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m happy with my purchase. i use it to pluck my under arm hair and it does the job well. i was surprised when i first used it. it hurt a little because i wasn&#x27;t prepared for the pain but its not any different than plucking - it just does it faster. The only thing i didn&#x27;t like about it was that it didn&#x27;t pull out the short hairs. i have to go back in with my tweezers. but i give it four stars because i get most of my hair plucked in under 5 mins. and it takes me another 5 to go in with my tweezers. such a time saver. and added bonus is i get a trimmer too! i have yet to play with that</li>
            <li> I love using this on my legs. It is very efficient and does not hurt too bad. Initially there is a little pinching but after that, it is smooth sailing. I love that I can use it wet or dry even.</li>
            <li> I got this 3 in 1 hair removal machine for my wife, she loves it. She keeps asking me how much I paid for it. I told her it&#x27;s a gift but she  can&#x27;t resist. She thinks I paid 75 dollars for it. I will nevet tell her the truth. Great thanks to panasonic, amazon, and the company that shipped this item to me. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the experience. This is the first time I have purchased goods through Amazon and it gives me confidence for future purchases</li>
            <li> It is the worst product ever! The only thing that I can say is DO NOT BUY IT!!! It does not hold charge and it does not work when it is charging!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product&#x27;s ability to remove leg hairs. It took 40 minutes to do most of one leg, but left many hairs in even so. The assumption is it doesn&#x27;t handle finer hair.</li>
            <li> I can remember trying another epilator about 20 yrs ago and YIKES!!!!  Have had this product for about 3 weeks now, have used three times and I love the results. I think I have shaved twice in three weeks. So far very happy. It may not get every hair every time but with the trimmer option, it gets the little ones left over. I don&#x27;t necessarily think there is \\&quot;pain\\&quot; so much as maybe discomfort and just until you get used to it. It is well worth the money and the results, for me at least , have been well worth it. If you are tired of shaving all the time I would suggest giving this a try. I do like the wet option, but for a quick touch up the dry is just as fine.</li>
            <li> Actually, I was skeptical about buying this product as I did read review on slight pain.  But the pain I should say was very negligible.It hurts a bit when we use in the 1st time. The 1st strech hurts. Then its very gliding &amp; very cool. Ofcourse it does a clean job that stayed for 2 weeks unlike the razors which needs ur attention every 3 days. This one is compact &amp; ahndy unlike the waxing system which I feel is very messy. The best parts about the product is that its wireless, no batteries &amp; it also has a razor &amp; can be used as a wet/dry stuff.  ITs cool. Anyone who wants to try buyin epilator for the 1st time, this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> I like the waterproof feature and the good battery life. but i was looking more for an epilator, the rest was a plus, and the epilator function is not very good. It breaks the hair and does not pull all af them.</li>
            <li> I have a long experience in epilators, and this one (as fancy as it looks) is the worst I ever had. I returned it. It took at least twice as much time to epilate than the old epilator I had and missed hair. I had to go over the same area sevreal times. Some features were promising: cordless and under water epilating. However, I found that the underwater epilating was worst than the dry epilating. The cordless ability: less time to use than the other epilators, and the power is also less.  I am deperately trying to find the one I had for years: the Norelco Satinelle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used an epilator before but thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I got it primarily for the bikini area -- was never happy with the results from shaving or using lotions, and waxing just seemed too bothersome and expensive. I have to say it hurt like hell the first time (I had not ever waxed before), but the results have been great. No ugly bumps or razor burn. I love that I can use it in the shower (though it is kind of slippery when wet ... a rubberized handle would be a nice design improvement) and it is very easy to clean. I&#x27;ve been using it for touch ups every three to four days and I&#x27;ve found that once you are in \\&quot;maintenance mode\\&quot; the process is not uncomfortable at all. I am now using it for legs, bikini and underarms. Previous people have posted about exfoliating to avoid ingrown hairs -- I&#x27;ve been doing that frequently and it really does help.    Let&#x27;s face it...all this grooming is a pain. But short of going \\&quot;au naturel\\&quot; this is the best solution I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have had this epilator for about a month and so far I like it real well.&lt;br /&gt;It works well and the shaver is nice and fast&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell</li>
            <li> I think this is a great epilator. I love that you can use it wet, which makes all the difference in the world as far as pain goes. It helps too, to understand that epilating is a process and you cannot get it all done the first time you use the Panasonic. I soak for about 10 minutes in very warm water with baking soda before I use the product and exfoliate before I get going. Follow the directions to a T and you should be pleased with the results. If your legs get dry, vaseline might be the best restorer.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it is not as efficient as I expected. Although, useful and relatively quick. Maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time, and also It is my first time using an epilator. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because it was priced attractively &amp; was hoping it would be a good epilator for the money.  Very dissapointed.  It does not remove hair from the legs at all.  Have to go over &amp; over a spot to get it to actually epilate a single hair.  Time consuming &amp; inefficient.  Maybe a Braun for the extra money is the way to go?</li>
            <li> Easy to use... Gud functions...handy product.... It is really difficult to accumulate 20 unique words to review a small product which is used once in a month...</li>
            <li> I have been using my Panasonic Epilator for about a year now and I still love it. There was some great bit of pain at first but the more I used it the less pain I experienced and less hair grew back. The hairs that did grow back were thinner and lighter in texture. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it now so for me it was a great buy and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb and thought I&#x27;d try using one of these instead of my conventional shaving.  I have been using an electric shaver for a long time, and thought this might be a better alternitive.    I have really dark, thick, Italian leg hair, so I was concerned at first about the pain and effectiveness of using this type of product.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is painful the first time you use it.  But the thing is, it is well worth it.  Every time you use it after the first is a whole lot better, especially if you&#x27;re keeping up.    I must say though, in the first few days I&#x27;ve owned this, I&#x27;ve had to go over my legs multiple times.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I have a lot of hair, or just need to get used to how to reach every part.  I&#x27;m sure once I&#x27;m using this on a regular basis that I won&#x27;t have so much trouble missing hairs.    I don&#x27;t chalk up either criticism of the product itself. I can&#x27;t imagine any epilator that wouldn&#x27;t hurt, or wouldn&#x27;t miss hairs.    So if you&#x27;ve got guts and are sick of shaving, go for it!  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I have previously used a dry epilator and thought of buying a wet one thinking it&#x27;ll be less painfull. I was not at all happy with thte performance as it doesn&#x27;t pull much hair. I used soap/ shampoo as suggested but to no avail. I do like the trimmer and uses it to trim my husband hair on back of his neck.     Overall if you are looking for an epilator- this one not good.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Wet/Dry epilator after my Emjoi Optima was either dropped or knocked of the vanity many times and one of the tweezing sides finally broke.  When I saw this Panasonic one could work wet or dry I thought it would be great.  I tried it both ways and it barely removed any hairs from my legs.  I tried all their suggestions and it would not work.  I started using my Optima with just one side working and it still worked great.  It just finally died after 4 years of use.  The panasonic was a great waste of money.</li>
            <li> bought it to shave my legs, it seems to work just fine, and it true to the advertisment that I read when I bought it</li>
            <li> I have tried several epilators on the market -- and hands down - this is the best ever!  I used mine wet in the shower and it was so quick and easy and PAINLESS!  I am now buying one for my sister and mother to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for over a year now... I gotta say it&#x27;s NOT perfect but it gets the job done.  Epilating in general is painful, I mean you&#x27;re plucking like 5 pcs of hair from your leg in a single swoop!  It&#x27;s gonna cause some pain... but after epilating for a few weeks, you get used to the pain and it&#x27;s not bad after that...   I actually use this epilator the non-conventional way, by removing ALL heads - I feel this get&#x27;s ALL the hair, including the little tiny thin ones.  NOT Recomended BTW, as it&#x27;s prone to grab the loose skin so best way is to make sure you focus on specific spots on the leg, stretch the surface area out so the blades rest nicely perpendicular to your leg.    My routine is to epilate about once every other week, but do a 2nd round just 2 days after just to get the baby hair that didn&#x27;t quite grow out the first time.  Depending on how quickly your hair grows back, it can last a good 2-3 weeks without having to re-epilate.   CON:  Does not work while charging - after a year, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long anymore so I have to keep it plugged in while I&#x27;m epilating.  I connect it back to the charger each time I stop it to clean the tip.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and gave it the full benefit of the doubt. Folks who have never used an epilator before will likely be thrilled with this product but those who have used epilators for years will likely be left uninspired.  Pros: a lot less painful than dry epilation, can be used as either wet or dry, convenient  Cons: does not remove a lot of the hair, takes a lot longer than more powerful epilators and even then does not remove a lot of the hair  Not sure why others are suggesting to Panasonic to come up with a model that lets you epilate while the product is plugged in. This is a wet/dry epilator that can be taken in the shower, this is a safety issue and it will never happen.</li>
            <li> Very good product, very quick shipment. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for four months.  It works great, doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> My wife was reluctant to use the Epi-Glide but after using it in the shower with shaving cream, she absolutley LOVES it... She heard stores about how painful epliators could be but did not experience the pain and is now is enjoying the benefit of smoother leggs - less frequent shavers - 5 Stars for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator about 6 months ago and it is my first one I&#x27;ve ever bought or used. I like the fact that I can use it in the bath, esp. since it doesn&#x27;t work well dry. I think it hurts a lot too, I think my hair has deep roots though so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help. I also find that after I use it I have red spots everywhere that a hair was pulled out and that my skin is sensitive to the touch. It doesn&#x27;t even get all the hair either, it leaves the short hairs that you can&#x27;t really see but you can feel, like if you had shaved the day before and that was the resulting stuble. Even though all the bad stuff I&#x27;ve mentioned I&#x27;m still pretty happy with my purchase because I only have to do it every couple of weeks, and my hair is already starting to thin out.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Haven&#x27;t used one for quite a few years, just getting used to it. So far it works great. Doesn&#x27;t hurt either. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Can I just say this epilator is AWESOME!!!!  I just used it for the first time and I can&#x27;t say enough about it!!!  This is my second epilator, my first an Emoji.  I tried to use the Emoji on my legs and underarms and I was NEVER able to work through the pain of it, so I only used it on my face and that was only because I had to.  The Panasonic wet/dry..WhooHoo!! I got in the shower, lathered up, did my face, my bikini line, my underarms AND my calves and thighs with nothing more then an occasional \\&quot;funny face\\&quot; in really sensitive areas.  I just couldn&#x27;t believe it!!!  I had just shaved the 2 days before so there wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;alot\\&quot; of hair, but it was enough that I would have had to shave it again.  I&#x27;m so glad I got this multi-purpose tool!  My only complaint is that the charge only last 30 minutes, which was enough time for me to \\&quot;take care\\&quot; of all my grooming(epilating, shaving and trimming) but when you are done it has to go right on the charger again for the next day.  I also don&#x27;t like the fact that I can&#x27;t use it plugged in.  Sometimes that works best for a dry quickie. So that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> The epilator worked as advertised and as long as I did everything recommended it worked good.  I am a man and bought it to clean up my back hair, which while it isn&#x27;t heavy, I don&#x27;t like it.  I have an athletic build (ie.10% body fat).  I say this because I am not sure if the pain would be different on someone with more fatty tissue.  I usually get waxed which is painful as well.  But, this was a new kind of pain and, even though I have been told the first time is the worst, I am reluctant to use it again.  At first I was using it on untrimmed hair and the epilator was getting clogged a lot.  So, I, by myself, trimmed it all with an electric clipper.  Then the next day, a friend did the epilating for me.    Recommendations: Definitely shower first or if possible stay in the shower.  The heat and moisture help immensely.  The use of shaving cream helps a lot getting the hairs to stand up.  Don&#x27;t press toO hard or go over a spot too much as this hurts like hell.  Go slow and let the tool do its job.  The end result was a fairly smooth back that has remained so for about 4 weeks and even 6 weeks later it is still very light.  Pleased with the results but will probably go back to body sugaring as this was the least painful of all hair removals.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about buying this epilator as I received so many feedback about others like this one saying that it was very painful. Even with those comments I decided to purchase it and I have to say that I am completely satisfied and happy with the results, 3 weeks without shaving... and counting, Oh God, this is  good! And believe it is not painful.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric shaver or epilator before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I relied on reviews from others to make my choice. This product has been a great. I wanted to leave my razor behind and now I can. I have used it both as an epilator and as a shaver. My legs have never been more smooth. It works for quite some time on a single charge. I cannot comment on using it wet, but it does work great dry. I really can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about this product. This product has been a great introduction to the world of electric shavers/epilators.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator long ago and never wrote a review until I ran into it again while looking for an epilator. I bought this back in 2008 and it only lasted me a year; it died suddenly. Stopped charging and that was it. I would honestly avoid this product at all costs just because 30 minutes of charge is simply not enough for your legs but might be enough for underarms. Also, when it&#x27;s nearing empty battery, it slows down and becomes as good as dead. If you are serious about your epilator and want to get down to business I would definitely advice against this one. No offense Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Great product while it lasted. I never got it wet. The shaver works very well for under arms. The epilator worked wonders on my legs. Made very well but after 1.5 years it started to rattle. The epilator head quit working but the shaver head still works. Was going to buy another one but opted for a different brand this time. We&#x27;ll see how it goes...</li>
            <li> Great quality and excellent product. The battery holds still after an year of use.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best epilators on the market. I purchased this epilator not only because it is immersible in water but also because it has a double head. Most epilators have a singe head, except for another epilator that I own-the emjoi emagin rechargeable. The reason why I like two heads is because I think it pulls out more hair in less amount of time than a single headed one. This helps me because of the way I use the epilator. I don&#x27;t go by the instructions of moving it strait. I go in circles which I noticed gets the job done faster and easier. Also I can flip the epilator to the backside facing me and use from that side. That also help because I think the two heads rotate in two opposite directions.     This epilator is the only one I know of where as the head moves from side to side. I have not seen any other that does that. This also makes epilating easier and faster for me when I move it in circles. This epilator has a smaller head, or the rollers and tweezers are smaller so it works great on the upper lip and chin, and underarms. Doesn&#x27;t take very long. Only a few minutes.  Also the bikini area also works well. I noticed it really pulls out the shortest of hairs beautifully. My emjoi emagin sometimes does not. It works really well for the legs and arms too, but since the head is much smaller than other epilators it does take a long time to get done.It seems like forever. That is why I purchased my Emjoi Emagin. That one is better or \\&quot;faster\\&quot; for legs and arms.     This epilator is I think just as fast in speed as other epilators, but it is much, much quieter. I&#x27;m amazed at how well job it does- and how quiet it is. It is also very nice feature that you can recharge it and take it in the bath or shower with you. Don&#x27;t need to worry if it gets wet or you drop it in the sink full of water. It&#x27;s made for this. Just DON&#x27;T REACH INTO THE WATER FOR IT IF IT IS STILL PLUGGED INTO AN OUTLET! A definate NO NO!. One thing is, this model can only be used recharged without the cord attached. It will not work with the cord plugged into the appliance. IT IS A CORDLESS EPILATOR ONLY. It comes with an additional shaving head attachment and a bikini trimmer of which I have not used yet which is also very good. Also comes with a cleaning brush and travel pouch.     Sometimes as I feel with all epilators it misses some hairs. I think this is normal with epilators. You have to go over the same area a few times. Sometimes you may even feel some stubble. Maybe the epilator simply \\&quot;cut off\\&quot; some hairs like a shaver instead of pulling them. That&#x27;s why it comes with a shaver head so you can decide if you want to shave those little missed ones off or wait a couple of days and let them grow a bit longer and epilate them later. They say by plucking the hairs you are hair free for 4-6 weeks without having the hassle of shaving them every day. This is not true in the beginning-at least not for me. Hair grows at different rates. In the beginning you need to do touch-ups every 3 or 4 days at a time. Eventually in time the hairs grow back less but softer, thinner, and lighter in color until one day you really wouldn&#x27;t be epilating very often, and the hairs will be less noticeable. So that&#x27;s probably why they say 4-6 weeks. After many times of pulling out hair at the root, you are sort of destroying the root so one day it can&#x27;t grow back at all.     Everyone is different-painwise. Some people feel more pain than others. Some feel less. I have been epilating for years so right now I don&#x27;t feel any pain at all. Only the hair being pulled out but no pain. In the beginning to be honest, it was excruciating (forgive my spelling). I was in TEARS. But I tell you the pain is WORTH it. After about your 3rd or 4th time doing it you have less pain. The more often you do, the less the pain gets. I can say that getting a peircing done is more painful than this. Epilating only hurts for a few seconds, but when you have a peircing it can hurt for a few weeks. I have no tatoos but some people say that even tatoos hurt more than this. I have 3 peircings in my ears. 3 on each ear. That hurts more than this, but even with a peicing I don&#x27;t care about the pain because it is not going to hurt forever. One day the pain will be gone, and I will look beautiful. That is what matters. So yes, it is worth the pain and epilators are expensive but it does pay to be beautiful. It is an investment. You don&#x27;t buy this item every day, and you don&#x27;t have to bother with shaving everyday either. What a drag!     I hope my review helps you in finding the best epilator that works the best for you.     Thank you!</li>
            <li> Before buying it i read reviews. The only thing i agree with is that is very painful, especially underarms. Does not remove all of the hair, few than more, waxing is much better and quicker comparing to this product. Does not grab hair even the longest ones.</li>
            <li> No matter how closely you follow the directions, it just doesn&#x27;t work for all hair types. I bought this thinking it would be cool to not have to deal with stubble anymore, but it just does not work with my hair type. Not only does it hurt.. A LOT! It doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair. It breaks it off near the skin. I then didn&#x27;t even get the &#x27;smooth&#x27; stage before I had stubble.  It works for thicker hair, but if you have really thin hair like I do.. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I purchased it for under arm use and tried it multiple ways per the review suggestions of others.  The best way was in the shower with a thick moisturizing body wash squeezed directly onto the epilator.  Yes it hurt the first time and I had to break it up across a few days to complete the job.  Make sure to pull the under arm skin as tight as you can. It lasts for weeks and when it does begin to grow back it is so fine you hardly notice.  I also enjoy the other trimmer attachment as well.  Oh, and another trick to using it to not stare while you are epilating!  I don&#x27;t know why but I swear it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This was my very first epilator - I&#x27;ve tried shaving, waxing and depilatory creams before, but I wanted to give this method a try because it was recommended by good friends.  I&#x27;ve used this product only wet so far, and I have to admit that the first time was very painful. But after that, it hasn&#x27;t been that bad.  It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair in the first sweep, but it gets a fair amount of it and prevents it from growing back for a long time.</li>
            <li> Please try to find another better option before you decide to buy this epilator. This my second one and the first was so much better. The first one was a Philips Norelco Satinelle Ice, I didnt find this anymore.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll feel frustrated if you choose this.</li>
            <li> It worked great on the legs - while it worked. But after just a couple of months of, honestly, not even that much use, the battery stopped recharging fully. Unlike a previous epilator I&#x27;d had, this one can&#x27;t be used while it is recharging, so that&#x27;s a real nuisance. It won&#x27;t even last long enough to get half of one leg done!    I never tried using it in the water, so I can&#x27;t say how it would have worked there. I cleaned it out quite thoroughly, so there&#x27;s no way it is jammed or anything like that. I don&#x27;t have heavy hair growth, either - I&#x27;ve waxed or epilated enough in the past that there&#x27;s just not that much hair there any more.    I will NOT be trying another Panasonic in the future, and I would recommend that others stay away from this brand, as well. Obviously, this is a case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Epilator before that had finally broken down. This one does not do as good of job as my old one. Thought about getting one for my daughter but decided no to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful, works really well. I just wish there would be some way to anesthetize the pain, like other models that have a little massaging tool, or ice cold block.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time and money on trying different epilators, read hundreds of reviews. With every kind and model there were positive and negative feedbacks. Then I got this epilator as a present. It worked the best for me. And finally I stopped looking. but please note, what best for me not always will work for you - this thing is an example of such rule.</li>
            <li> I have tried epilator&#x27;s before and they hurt!  This one is so much better once in a while you feel a little pinch but being able to use it in the shower really helps.  I  make sure my skin and my hairs are really wet with very warm water and then soap up good and I also take some liquid soap and lather up the head on the epilator.  It is so much less painful than a dry one.  I had one and just couldn&#x27;t use it.  I use this one regularly and find it holds a charge a long time.  I keep it in the shower and because I use it as an epilator and not a razor i don&#x27;t use it as often and I only have to charge it every couple months.  I have not used the razor head at all.  I usually keep a disposable razor in the shower for times I need a quick touch up so this I just use as a epilator.  I got this as a gold box deal and am very happy with the bargain I got on this great item!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of forking over $$$ for waxing and don&#x27;t like to shave all the time.  I haven&#x27;t tried it wet, but have used both the shave head and the epilator head.  I didn&#x27;t like the shaver, but the epilator is ok.  It does require several passes over an area to get all the hair, but if you are patient it does work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/22/2011&lt;br /&gt;I just bumped this up to 4 stars as it is still working great.  I have been using it for several years now, and the hair on my legs has gotten thinner and more sparse from using it, and it is very quick and easy to remove the hair now with the epilator. I still haven&#x27;t used it wet, but I love how easy it is and the fact that usage over time makes the hair thinner and more sparse (so you can get away with not \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; as often).</li>
            <li> i bought it about a year ago and still working great its battery time is good and prolong i love it</li>
            <li> Throw away all those hot or cold waxes, cloth strips, popsicle sticks,and or those creamy smelly hair removers you smear on and find that they really do not work well.  If you have  ever purchased an epilator before - as I did, you can throw it out as well.  I am inundated with all types of hair removal stuff, some from Spain and from other areas. I AM CLEANING HOUSE, and do not feel sorry or worry about all the money I have spent, to no avail, beause I have finally found something that works.  It is also sooo inexpensive.  Be sure to shop around for the lowest price.    Ladies, and/or Gents, get yourself Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two Speed Epilator, with three heads, in a beautiful Pink.  It beats anything you may be using, believe me.  I am well on in years, and have tried everything that ever came out on the market.  This is the item for you.  I am pleased that I was asked to review this item, because I now can tell you all how happy I am with it.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is you cannot use it while it is charging and then with a full recharge you can only use it for the hands.Then you have to recharge to get your legs done!</li>
            <li> My 25 year old epilady was ready for retirement, and this is a great upgrade.  I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower, but it works great \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and hurts much less than my original epilady.  It&#x27;s great to be cordless too!</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for something that would help me with convenient shaving. I cannot use regular razors because my skin is sensitive and will itch incessantly after shaving. The problem I have with the razor is that it doesn&#x27;t give me a really close shave and doesn&#x27;t work well will my under arms either. However, I do like that I can take it wherever and shave quickly. When I used it in the shower it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as just dry shaving.  The epilator part I have tried only once and in a small area, because the directions state that it shouldn&#x27;t be used during pregnancy (probably due to increased sensitivity). It seemed to work for the most part but left some areas with hair. However, the instructions clearly state how long the hair should be and that it may need to be used twice to get all of the hair since it grows at different paces. I look forward to trying it again after my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 2/23/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing all of a sudden stopped holding a charge. Could it have had anything to do with another problem I&#x27;ve noticed over the past few months? While never as fast or as efficient as the plug-in for power epilators, it stopped pulling hair out, leaving the victim (me) with more like shaved legs. Shaving my legs has never been so painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to have to go back to epilady and get one of those powerful things that sadly cannot accompany me to the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product a couple months ago when my second epilady started shorting out. I guess the people who make epilady don&#x27;t want to fix that problem, so I researched all the epilators I could find, and settled on this model because of the reasonable cost and the positive reviews. Additionally, I have a hair trimmer made by Panasonic that has been going strong for over ten years so I am hoping that the same quality is present in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I love being able to take it in the shower or bath. In fact, it works better with soap and water. Right now it holds a charge for two epilating sessions. I use roughly once per week. I have used the epilator head all over, including my face one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I suspect that because it is cordless, it has nowhere near the power that the epilady models I&#x27;m used to have. I find myself having to go over areas more, and it does take longer. Also, I don&#x27;t think it pulls out all the hairs by the roots. It seems like sometimes it simply breaks the hair off, resulting in hair growing back faster as if I&#x27;d shaved. I&#x27;d say it happens to about ten percent of the hair it grabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver function, admittedly, I have not even used. I purchased an electric shaver as well, and will post a separate review.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this epilator. I&#x27;ve had this for about two years and have been meaning to write a review because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used an epilator before, it is probably going to hurt more than you expect. This is NOT the epilator&#x27;s fault; you are pulling many hairs out by the root, this is going to hurt. Epilating takes longer then shaving, you will not be able to jump in and out of the shower like shaving. Epilating takes longer (also NOT the epilator&#x27;s fault) but you do it much less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular epilator is great because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*You can use it wet. An AWESOME feature because you just wash all the hairs down the drain and you can rinse the epilator clean (just make sure to use a lot of soap lather when epilating wet, I think soap lather works better than shaving cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Cordless. Mine holds a full charge for a LONG time, I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long but I know I only charge mine, overnight, every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It gets the smallest hairs. It works great for me under the arms and the bikini area, but be warned, the instructions say it&#x27;s not for use in those areas. I just make sure the hairs are very short and go very slow (the bikini area hurts A LOT).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Nice extras. The interchangeable shaver and trimer work well and are useful for getting longer hair short enough to epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this epilator, it&#x27;s a quality product that works well and has fantastic features that make it super useful.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this to me, it turns out very efficient! It cleans very very well, a little hurts tho... but worth it! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my wife as a gift. She was using old fashioned razor blades. This thing made shaving much easier for her. She loves it. No more cuts or nicks. Very good product.</li>
            <li> my wife uses it all the time, thanks rvv.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I own it for more than 2 years now and it has always worked really well. I use both the epilator and the trimming features. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it - and I think it&#x27;s a really bad thing - is that it doesn&#x27;t work with the cord on, which means that, if you are using it and the battery goes dead, you have to wait 12 hours until it charges so you can use it again. That&#x27;s really a pain, cause it usually means that one of your legs gets half shaved.&lt;br /&gt;The process is uncomfortable, yes, but lets get real, this is an epilator there&#x27;s no way to pull your hair out completely pain free, so if this is the reason why you don&#x27;t wanna buy it, don&#x27;t buy an epilator, buy a trimmer.</li>
            <li> received on time, need to be careful while usinging in the more delicate part of the body, works fine and the battery last</li>
            <li> Does not grip hair well, ended up buying the silk epil again. I only used it in the dry. Overall the length of the head is too narrow, not efficient.</li>
            <li> it was working well, but then batery went bad after about 1 yr.</li>
            <li> Great Product still works after more than 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using it since 2.5 years. Still the same and still effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for over 20 years and have found the Panasonic ES2045P to be the best at not only epilating but also for use shaving underarms and bikini line. In fact I have purchased a second one for our vacation holme. &lt;br /&gt;It takes overnight to fully charge the battery and, as most of these rechargable devices, it works best when fully charged. Being able to use it in the shower or tub is a real plus too since epilating is best done with open pores. &lt;br /&gt;I use the highest of the 2 speeds almost exclusively--I don&#x27;t know why anyone would need to used the slow speed. &lt;br /&gt;A great addition to feminine grooming.</li>
            <li> I have an old braun epilator that I like--my only issue is that it is old and corded.  I bought this epilator on a killer sale at a local store because it was a cordless model and seemed like it would be nice.  It wasn&#x27;t.  It hurt worse than the braun and the charge only got me through part of one leg.  There is no option to use it as a corded model so I was out of luck.  The part of my leg that got done did not have all the hair removed.      Don&#x27;t waste your money on this model.</li>
            <li> The epilator does not work for underarm; if this is your intent, I would recommend you not buy any epilator.  My only purpose was to use it for my underarm so I won&#x27;t need to shave for couple weeks.  However, it does not work.  I have used it, and have gone through more than 4 times, and it did not get all the hair.  Moreover, it hurts!!!</li>
            <li> I have this item.  I like that it comes with a bag to put it all in.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes my hairs break when it&#x27;s trying to pluck them&lt;br /&gt;It hurts.. but thats to be expected I suppose when pulling hair out of your skin.. hah&lt;br /&gt;regardless it&#x27;s alright and not a bad item.. but i do think there may be better and am still searching for better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ES2045P for about 3 months and I&#x27;ve never owned such a good epilator. I must say that I previously had a Braun, a Philips and a Rowenta but none of them can even get close to the job that this one does. It&#x27;s gentle enough even for the armpit area and it pulls even the smallest hairs that you can&#x27;t even see.  I use in the tub with a lot of shower gel that I pour directly on the epilator&#x27;s head and it foams super nice.   I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s sick and tired of hairs allover their floors and wants nice smooth hairless skin in the comfort of their own tub.</li>
            <li> Really, the best one on the market. I used to use the Emjoi OptiMini, and hated it - I found that the \\&quot;safety bar\\&quot; in the center of the epilator head made it really hard to use. It was bulky and very difficult to maneuver around small &amp; sensitive areas like ankles and bikini. And the cord was confining and too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to get an epilator, this Panasonic Wet/Dry is definitely worth the price. The head is small enough to reach into small, hard to reach areas, and the rotating discs are well-placed to get even the shortest hairs. The first time I used it, it even grabbed the little hairs that had grown in since I&#x27;d shaved the previous day. Now, I don&#x27;t shave at all! And I&#x27;ve noticed hairs growing in lighter, sparser, and less frequently. After a little over a month of use, I can definitively say that this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of waxing, but not a huge fan of spending anywhere from 50 to hundreds of dollars every time I want to be smooth; and also not a huge fan of home waxing kits, which have pulled off more of my skin than they&#x27;ve pulled out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is cordless and I love that it can be used in the shower! With dry epilation, I found it painful and my skin would often become irritated. Epilating in the shower - I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s pain-free, because pulling your hair out by the root is always going to hurt a little - but the heat, water and steam open up your pores and allow for a much less painful experience. After a little while, you get used to the sensation and it barely bothers me anymore. As my waxist used to say, \\&quot;Beauty is pain.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips for use:&lt;br /&gt;1. Use shower gel instead of shaving cream. It&#x27;s a slicker lather that slides better along your skin, and also lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you find that it&#x27;s pulling hairs and breaking them above the skin&#x27;s surface, instead of pulling them out like it&#x27;s supposed to (this is especially true for women whose body hair is very fine like mine is), try using the slower speed instead. It DOES NOT hurt any more than the faster one - a common reason for avoiding it. Just as with tweezing, sometimes if you pull too hard, the hair breaks instead of popping out, so you pull a little slower and more focused. Also, using the slower speed will help the battery last longer.&lt;br /&gt;3. Try going both ways. Sometimes hairs that are missed going in the opposite direction of growth can get picked up by going in the same direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave head and bikini trimmer also work really well, although I only really use the trimmer b/c like I said, I don&#x27;t need to shave any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I highly recommend it!

            <li> Works very well and gets even the shortest hairs.  Has a shaving and epilator head and can be used in the tub or shower.  Battery life sucks and gets worse with age.  At the end of a year, it would only run a couple of minutes on a charge, and will not operate while plugged in as some epilators do.</li>
            <li> It has some pros (battery, can use under shower, less pain), but where it fails pretty much, is the epilation. This is my third epilator, and it does only a half job. If I am trying very hard, it does a 70% job. One third of the hair is just left there, no matter what. I have one bad epilator from Braun, but this is not much better when it comes to hair removal. Even if go through the same area 5 or 10 times, one third of the hair will remain. This makes the epilation much longer and not efficient at all.&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, my first epilator can do a decent 85-90% hair removal with a single run.</li>
            <li> As other people said, the battery life span is about two or three months and then it is useless afterwards. You cannot use it when it is plugged in and this makes it a useless product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using my epilator in the shower instead of using it dry. Just a small amount of shampoo w/ water rubbed together with my hands &amp; spread over my legs or underarms &amp; it glides over them like silk.</li>
            <li> This product works really well but is quite painful. If you&#x27;ve never done electrolysis before, you&#x27;re going to be in for a real shock the first time you use this....The hair is literally yanked from your body (more painful than tweezing!), but done so very quickly. It leaves a smooth surface and can be used wet or dry. After a while of using this, you do get used to the hair being pulled, but it has yet to stop being painful for me (more than a year of use), but it&#x27;s over within 2 minutes and is more efficient than tweezing.</li>
            <li> Wasted quite a pretty penny to buy this over fifty something bucks! I kick myself because I sooooo regret it!</li>
            <li> Despite the previous claims that there was some pain involved, I thought I could tough it out and bought it anyway. It hurts. Even with using conditioner, you can feel every little hair being pulled out. If you can get through that, it does last for about four weeks. As for me, I can&#x27;t put myself through that every month or so. Shaving isn&#x27;t that bad, I guess.</li>
            <li> I bought this three years ago and I can say it&#x27;s still going strong. I admit, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it did when I initially bought it. It doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair like it use to. I&#x27;m not really sure why, I&#x27;ve cleaned it out and have taken good care of it. For the price it&#x27;s worth it and I didn&#x27;t expect it to last this long.</li>
