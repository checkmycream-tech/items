            <li>The wand is perfect!</li>
            <li>Over all the mascara is amazing!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and crimps beautifully without clumping.  </li>
            <li>This is a great mascara.  </li>
            <li>It has been great.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the package, excited to try it out, I kept applying it because you couldn&#x27;t even tell I was putting it on!!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smudge, and I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a keeper for sure!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I find that coverage is not as good</li>
            <li>I have been using the Physicians Formula mascara for a number of years now and have enjoyed the quality and performance of the products.  </li>
            <li>my favorite mascara out of any I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE that I don&#x27;t have to use an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Love the texture and length provided by this mascara.  </li>
            <li>also liked the cool packaging.  </li>
            <li>Great if you want a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I do use something flashier if I&#x27;m going out, this is hands down the best &#x27;day time&#x27; mascara I have found.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get as pretty of a curl out of my lashes as I can with this wand with this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been hesitant about using natural mascara, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I guess I was tempted to try it because it&#x27;s &#x27;organic&#x27;, but I will be staying with my Loreal Voluminous Mascara (original).  </li>
            <li>Super upset with this product.</li>
            <li>Apparently the ingredients are mostly chemical free though.</li>
            <li>Cool that the packaging looks awesome and it has minimal ingredients, however they actually forgot to put any product in the bottle!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give the oomph that other synthetic and toxic mascaras do, but it more importantly doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or break my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I bought the Curl &amp; Condition mascara.  </li>
            <li>Boosting Mascara which is what I will go back to as I love how it looks and application is even on every eyelash every time I use.</li>
            <li>Great for short, straight, Asian eyelashes!!</li>
            <li>First off- this brush does not curl the eyelashes at all.</li>
            <li>I really liked the shape of the applicator and the mascara doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes like all the other</li>
            <li>It last just fine for an 8 hour work day.</li>
            <li>I would like there to be more product on the brush when it comes out of the bottle instead of continuously trying to get more and apply to get the desired amount but love that it does not contain any bad stuff in it.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer now</li>
            <li>So here I am with straight out lashes and I cant even curl them.  </li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for my lashes, it didn&#x27;t even look like I had any mascara on at all.</li>
            <li>Works fine as long as you don&#x27;t need waterproof.</li>
            <li>I have decent lashes, but they go straight out</li>
            <li>Seriously, dark smudges under my eyes, despite it looking fine when I first applied it.</li>
            <li>They remain kind of moist and un-crimpable no matter how long you let your lashes dry.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would put a little more product in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Normally I get the Physicians Formula Lash</li>
            <li>It looks really natural on my lashes, they look long thick and beautiful without it looking like I have anything on them AT ALL.</li>
            <li>Its super dry...</li>
            <li>I really was hoping I could find an organic mascara or natural mascara that actually works</li>
            <li>Complete TRASH.</li>
            <li>The mascara actually seems dry even first time out using.  </li>

            <li> I was excited because it was natural, but this is not the solution sadly.</li>
            <li> Barely connects to your eyelashes and very dry.</li>
            <li> product is dried out... possibly too old.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s harder to apply a solid coat.  </li>
            <li> Expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li> That is an issue I&#x27;ve dealt with despite washing my face nightly as long as I&#x27;ve been wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> Too dry, not sure if it is old or just the way it is made...will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> After an hour, it will still be wet and smear all over your eye.</li>
            <li> It does not work as expected.</li>
            <li> I fully expected to still use it, despite the claims that I&#x27;d not need one if I used this product.  </li>
            <li> As though I don&#x27;t already have dark circles under my eyes, now I have mascara making a dark mess under my eyes too?</li>
            <li> What a HUGE disappointment!</li>
            <li> Dried up in less than a week</li>
            <li> Within a few hours of application, It flaked off and powdered BLACK under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It smells like coconut and is probably a little less harsh on the eyes if you&#x27;ve got allergies.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; complaint of previous customers are probably due to that.</li>
            <li> seriously you pay a lot of money for something that is practically empty.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to steer clear of chemicals and companies that test on animals and the reviews for this mascara seemed convincing, as it is even promoted by the infamous &amp;#34;Food Babe&amp;#34;, but SO very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> She has had none of the usual irritation with this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Just not good at all.</li>
            <li> I can say that it is the worst case of false advertising I&#x27;ve seen in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Sad day.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> This mascara was really dry and the curve of the brush is awful.</li>
            <li> This was a very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> This product makes them impossible to crimp!.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Over all the mascara is amazing!! I&#x27;m so used to waterproof mascara and I find that this mascara tends to smudge easier.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Barely connects to your eyelashes and very dry. Just not good at all.</li>
            <li> This mascara was really dry and the curve of the brush is awful. I haven&#x27;t used it. This was a very disappointing purchase. I&#x27;d recommend trying a different PF mascara without the curl brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara.  Works fine as long as you don&#x27;t need waterproof. It last just fine for an 8 hour work day.</li>
            <li> This mascara never dries. After an hour, it will still be wet and smear all over your eye. I was excited because it was natural, but this is not the solution sadly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Physicians Formula mascara for a number of years now and have enjoyed the quality and performance of the products.  This was the first time I bought the Curl &amp; Condition mascara.  It&#x27;s ok, but I find that coverage is not as good and it&#x27;s harder to apply a solid coat.

Normally I get the Physicians Formula Lash Boosting Mascara which is what I will go back to as I love how it looks and application is even on every eyelash every time I use.</li>
            <li> It seems there is nothing you can get out of the tube. I bought it for a gift for my teenage niece... how embarrasing! It does not work as expected.</li>
            <li> Too dry, not sure if it is old or just the way it is made...will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smudge, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Great for short, straight, Asian eyelashes!! Great if you want a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This my favorite mascara out of any I&#x27;ve ever used. It looks really natural on my lashes, they look long thick and beautiful without it looking like I have anything on them AT ALL. The wand is perfect! My lashes are much longer now and I LOVE that I don&#x27;t have to use an eyelash curler. I have never been able to get as pretty of a curl out of my lashes as I can with this wand with this mascara. While I do use something flashier if I&#x27;m going out, this is hands down the best &#x27;day time&#x27; mascara I have found.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my wife who has severe allergies and eye sensitivity.  It has been great.  She has had none of the usual irritation with this product.</li>
            <li> Dried up in less than a week</li>
            <li> Love the texture and length provided by this mascara.  This is now my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
            <li> Super upset with this product. Cool that the packaging looks awesome and it has minimal ingredients, however they actually forgot to put any product in the bottle! seriously you pay a lot of money for something that is practically empty.  Sad day.</li>
            <li> I would like there to be more product on the brush when it comes out of the bottle instead of continuously trying to get more and apply to get the desired amount but love that it does not contain any bad stuff in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this mascara again. It doesn&#x27;t stay on well at all.</li>
            <li> Expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li> Could be a bit darker/fuller than it is, but i will continue to wear it</li>
            <li> Hate it. Seriously, dark smudges under my eyes, despite it looking fine when I first applied it. Within a few hours of application, It flaked off and powdered BLACK under my eyes. As though I don&#x27;t already have dark circles under my eyes, now I have mascara making a dark mess under my eyes too? Complete TRASH.</li>
            <li> I really liked the shape of the applicator and the mascara doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes like all the other products.&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the cool packaging.  It&#x27;s a keeper for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been hesitant about using natural mascara, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It doesn&#x27;t give the oomph that other synthetic and toxic mascaras do, but it more importantly doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or break my eyelashes. That is an issue I&#x27;ve dealt with despite washing my face nightly as long as I&#x27;ve been wearing mascara. My eyelashes are longer and healthier than ever and this mascara does the job of darkening and lengthening my lashes to accentuate that fact. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the allergy claims of those that rated this 5 stars.  That may be the only thing this product has going for it.  I can say that it is the worst case of false advertising I&#x27;ve seen in a very long time.  I have decent lashes, but they go straight out so I use an eyelash curler.  I fully expected to still use it, despite the claims that I&#x27;d not need one if I used this product.  To the point that they have a picture of an eyelash curler with a circle and a line through it and the words &amp;#34;Say goodbye to your eyelash curler.&amp;#34; circling the picture.  Well, if you use this product, that may be the case but not because it curls your lashes.  This product makes them impossible to crimp!.  They remain kind of moist and un-crimpable no matter how long you let your lashes dry.  So here I am with straight out lashes and I cant even curl them.  Not impressed.  I guess I was tempted to try it because it&#x27;s &#x27;organic&#x27;, but I will be staying with my Loreal Voluminous Mascara (original).  It&#x27;s cheaper and crimps beautifully without clumping.  And I&#x27;ve never had any problems with allergic reactions as I have with some mascaras, makeup and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> product is dried out... possibly too old. don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!!! What a HUGE disappointment! I am trying to steer clear of chemicals and companies that test on animals and the reviews for this mascara seemed convincing, as it is even promoted by the infamous &amp;#34;Food Babe&amp;#34;, but SO very disappointed in this product. First off- this brush does not curl the eyelashes at all. When I opened the package, excited to try it out, I kept applying it because you couldn&#x27;t even tell I was putting it on!!! The only way to tell it was on was to smudge my finger on my eye to see that there was actual mascara coming off. This did absolutely nothing for my lashes, it didn&#x27;t even look like I had any mascara on at all. What a misleading product. I really was hoping I could find an organic mascara or natural mascara that actually works, looks like I will need to keep searching. Boo.</li>
            <li> It seems like it expired...Its super dry...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a standard drug store product. It smells like coconut and is probably a little less harsh on the eyes if you&#x27;ve got allergies. It tends to get clumpy though and if you&#x27;ve got droopy eyelids like me (I&#x27;m only 30) then you will find you can see the clumps out of the corner of your eye. Apparently the ingredients are mostly chemical free though. I wish they would put a little more product in the bottle. The &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; complaint of previous customers are probably due to that. It&#x27;s just meh to me.</li>
