            <li>I was so happy that it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and it gave a really nice finish.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was the brush, so I used my own name brand brush and it did not help with the application or irritation.</li>
            <li>This powder foundation is really nice for the drugstore price.</li>
            <li>So nice to have my color....</li>
            <li>NICE COLOR ON ME.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best powder on the market!&lt;br /&gt;So natural and lasts!  </li>
            <li>After trying a number of drug store foundations and also bare minerals... this is the best face powder/foundation out there!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I was glad I was able to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Evened out my skin tone and even in the evening it still felt comfortable on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this will layer nicely on top to hold the fountation in place.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a nice texture and color is accurate.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is okay...  </li>
            <li>I love this powder.</li>
            <li>Love this product but it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Guess I will have to stock up :)</li>
            <li>I WAS PLEASED WITH THE POWDER AND BRUSH.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>be continuing to use this for sure.</li>
            <li>Perfect for hot weather as it really stays on your skin and helps with oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>use either a big powder brush to set my makeup with a little more coverage, or a kabuki to buff it in on its own for a nice flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this product just to have a powder to lightly set my makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light but helps get rid of the shine on my face but still leaves a bit of sheen</li>
            <li>but even a light coating felt like I had caked it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t cake up on my face.</li>
            <li>Brush is small, but is perfect for use!</li>
            <li>and I got to say it works better than I thought it would even considering I dnt use much of the product whenever I apply it.</li>
            <li>It covers well, however; it leaves streaks on your face pretty easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft on my skin and lasts through most of the day.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this at major drug stores but they no longer carry this type of Maybelline makeup.</li>
            <li>I got this product very fast</li>
            <li>I love this product because it actually works , and helping with coverage of my freckles and improving my skin as well.</li>
            <li>large color selection</li>
            <li>However, for some reason, it is no longer readily available in any of the places, such as CVS, where I used to buy it.</li>
            <li>This is something I will buy forever thanks.</li>
            <li>Get your colors straight.</li>
            <li>I feel that the consistency is very buttery for a powder and very blendable (though I don&#x27;t use the brush</li>
            <li>THE POWDER DOES NOT COVER THE BRUSH AS FAST AS I WOULD LIKE IT</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s too young for liquid foundation, but likes better coverage for occasional break-outs.  </li>
            <li>Well the title says classic ivory, but I received nude - 2 shades darker.  </li>
            <li>The other 2 I received were  Light 4 and Pure Beige.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and all I see at the end of the day is a little healthy shine, no separation or \\&quot;melting.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>its the same exact foundation you would buy at the drug store for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I purchased a light and a dark</li>
            <li>coverage is light to medium and can be built up a little without it settling into find lines of \\&quot;caking\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and it looks natural and effortless.</li>
            <li>This color goes on nude and blends very well with my complexion and does not leave my face oily by mid day.</li>
            <li>If you have very oily skin you may want to touch up throughout the day, but that&#x27;s personal preference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now when I look at my email receipt, it says nude, but when I click on the link in the email, it brings me back to classic ivory.  </li>
            <li>I have tried bare minerals</li>
            <li>I decided to go back to my mineral powder foundation in the summer, as in the winter I use the liquid mineral foundation , but with the New York humid nothing last longer beside this one what is sweat proof and stay all day long if needed without issues , you can sweat like a pig and nothing will damage it as long you do not touch and let it dry naturally ..</li>

            <li> I expected it to rub off in the first few hours</li>
            <li> , must lay flat or it&#x27;ll all pour out</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and helps with oil control at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was a loose powder product as at the time, the despription was lacking.</li>
            <li> It holds well throughout the day even if I sweat a little from working outside!</li>
            <li> This was hard to find in the stores including a major cosmetic store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little messy, but that is what you get with loose powders</li>
            <li> so I can blend them and use them year round.</li>
            <li> :( They do have a similar product that is new that I like also</li>
            <li> I have had a difficult time finding this color in the local stores.</li>
            <li> The other day I was too tired to fuss with makeup</li>
            <li> I did not put it on thick-</li>
            <li> And much less expensive than the store.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying other Maybelline products expecting the same bang for my buck; however, this product is horrible!</li>
            <li> $$ Wasted :(</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> It made my skin break out terribly</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product. However, for some reason, it is no longer readily available in any of the places, such as CVS, where I used to buy it. I hope Maybelline isn&#x27;t planning on discontinuing it. I was glad I was able to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Goes on very nicely and matches my skin tone perfectly.  It holds well throughout the day even if I sweat a little from working outside!</li>
            <li> I got this product just to have a powder to lightly set my makeup and I got to say it works better than I thought it would even considering I dnt use much of the product whenever I apply it. It&#x27;s so light but helps get rid of the shine on my face but still leaves a bit of sheen so you know ur skin can breathe with this on and it looks natural and effortless. The other day I was too tired to fuss with makeup so I jus applied concealer under my eyes and buffed this product onto myface and it gave a really nice finish. Evened out my skin tone and even in the evening it still felt comfortable on it&#x27;s own. Love this foundation!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was a loose powder product as at the time, the despription was lacking. I&#x27;ll use it no doubt in the winter months when I wear cream foundation for the moisture and I&#x27;m sure this will layer nicely on top to hold the fountation in place. It seems to have a nice texture and color is accurate.</li>
            <li> Love the matte coverage and colors!</li>
            <li> I use this as my backup.</li>
            <li> Just started trying mineral makeup - this is working well</li>
            <li> Best Mineral Powder Makeup! I used to be able to buy this at major drug stores but they no longer carry this type of Maybelline makeup. I was so happy that it was available on Amazon. I used to wear Bare-minerals but noticed the powder made my face oily and greasy and they didn&#x27;t seem to have a shade to match my complexion. This color goes on nude and blends very well with my complexion and does not leave my face oily by mid day. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great price, love the product. It&#x27;s soft on my skin and lasts through most of the day. Brush is small, but is perfect for use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best powder on the market!&lt;br /&gt;So natural and lasts!  Have had great comments and have recommended to everyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 in the Nude (920) shade and I received 2. The other 2 I received were  Light 4 and Pure Beige.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it actually works , and helping with coverage of my freckles and improving my skin as well. This is something I will buy forever thanks.</li>
            <li> Well the title says classic ivory, but I received nude - 2 shades darker.  Now when I look at my email receipt, it says nude, but when I click on the link in the email, it brings me back to classic ivory.  Get your colors straight.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued. I will buy every one I can find to stock up knowing one day I&#x27;ll never find it again. I have several shades, I mix them when summer comes and I have a tan. I just love this product. Hopefully it will make a comeback in some form</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY mineral powder make-up that truly provides coverage of my sometimes splotchy, sensitive skin and gives a smooth finish while still feeling &amp;#34;light.&amp;#34; Unfortunately, I can no longer find it in stores and the others I have tried don&#x27;t even come close to this one. I hope to be able to continue buying it online!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I bought it for my teenage daughter who asked me to pick up some powder for her.  She&#x27;s too young for liquid foundation, but likes better coverage for occasional break-outs.  This totally does the trick and absorbs oil.</li>
            <li> This product is okay...  It covers well, however; it leaves streaks on your face pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I love this powder. It gives me the coverage I want but it can be messy to use since so much comes out at once and this is definitely not meant to be put in your purse, must lay flat or it&#x27;ll all pour out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this make up for years... They stopped selling where I go to buy. I got this product very fast &amp; it&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This was hard to find in the stores including a major cosmetic store.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this makeup regularly. We knew what we wanted, were shipped what was advertised and we are very happy!</li>
            <li> Love this product but it&#x27;s discontinued.:( They do have a similar product that is new that I like also so do t worry that this is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to my mineral powder foundation in the summer, as in the winter I use the liquid mineral foundation , but with the New York humid nothing last longer beside this one what is sweat proof and stay all day long if needed without issues , you can sweat like a pig and nothing will damage it as long you do not touch and let it dry naturally .. good stuff for the minder good days , it cover also nice and I don;t use anything else beside this mineral powder and trust me I do have raccoon eyes too sometimes</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying other Maybelline products expecting the same bang for my buck; however, this product is horrible! It made my skin break out terribly and you can feel it sinking into your skin. I thought maybe it was the brush, so I used my own name brand brush and it did not help with the application or irritation. I did not put it on thick- but even a light coating felt like I had caked it on. It looks and feels like you&#x27;re rubbing colored chalk all over your face. I will NEVER buy this or any of Maybelline&#x27;s &#x27;mineral&#x27; products again. $$ Wasted :(</li>
            <li> This powder foundation is really nice for the drugstore price. I feel that the consistency is very buttery for a powder and very blendable (though I don&#x27;t use the brush included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use either a big powder brush to set my makeup with a little more coverage, or a kabuki to buff it in on its own for a nice flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This contains no shimmer and lasts a good while. I have combination skin and all I see at the end of the day is a little healthy shine, no separation or \\&quot;melting.\\&quot; If you have very oily skin you may want to touch up throughout the day, but that&#x27;s personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is light to medium and can be built up a little without it settling into find lines of \\&quot;caking\\&quot; up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Nice coverage&lt;br /&gt;-Great lasting power&lt;br /&gt;-Great consistency/blendable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Not large color selection&lt;br /&gt;-A little messy, but that is what you get with loose powders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck deciding, hope I helped!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have been using it for years! Such a shame it was discontinued. Guess I will have to stock up :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FACE POWDER!!! No need to use liquid foundation! I have tried bare minerals and I have to say that this is better! I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this! After trying a number of drug store foundations and also bare minerals... this is the best face powder/foundation out there! It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and helps with oil control at the end of the day. Absolutely fantastic and flawless coverage!!!</li>
            <li> its the same exact foundation you would buy at the drug store for a cheaper price. its the only one i use for my oily skin that&#x27;ll last me  longer than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Awsome cant wait to order from you again!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  I have had a difficult time finding this color in the local stores. So nice to have my color....And much less expensive than the store.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for a mineral foundation. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t cake up on my face. I feel as if I&#x27;m wearing no makeup at all. And it stays on all day. I expected it to rub off in the first few hours but I was wrong! I purchased a light and a dark so I can blend them and use them year round.</li>
            <li> NICE COLOR ON ME. I WAS PLEASED WITH THE POWDER AND BRUSH. THE POWDER DOES NOT COVER THE BRUSH AS FAST AS I WOULD LIKE IT TO BUT IF I WORK ON IT THEN I GET ENOUGH AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Been using it for years. Perfect for hot weather as it really stays on your skin and helps with oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be continuing to use this for sure.</li>
            <li> HAVEN&#x27;T USED THE BRUSH.  I USE A LARGER ONE.  BUT THE MINERAL POWDER GOES ON FLAWLESS AND COVERS WELL. NO COMPLAINTS.</li>
