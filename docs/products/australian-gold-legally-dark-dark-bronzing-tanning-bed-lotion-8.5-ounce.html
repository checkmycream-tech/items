            <li>and you will love it too!</li>
            <li>It arrived the day after I ordered it, and smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell was amazing and it did not stain.</li>
            <li>this product smells nice</li>
            <li>So now I have my own bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it smells so good too.</li>
            <li>I am getting nice color.  </li>
            <li>goes on nice, dont leave you with an after tan smell.</li>
            <li>Smell is nice.</li>
            <li>I have my own bed and use this lotion every two times.....</li>
            <li>This lotion is cheap, but very effective.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a wonderful smell and absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin that doesn&#x27;t tan easily</li>
            <li>Lotion smells good and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>This product shows great results as immediately as after your very first tanning experience..</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotio yet.</li>
            <li>I chose this bc some reviewers that bought Almost Famous liked this lotion.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>But for sure it offers a great tan!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today and got a great bronze.</li>
            <li>This is a good inexpensive lotion that provides adequate color and moisture.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that you come out of the tanning bed with a beautiful golden tan.</li>
            <li>Used it as a moisturizer more than a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells ok.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>So much more affordable than what the tanning salons try to sell you - those people told me NOT to buy anything off of here because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to be sure of the contents...</li>
            <li>Will def keep using this lotion and suggest it to others!&lt;br /&gt;Amanda :)</li>
            <li>I used this product both in indoor tanning beds and outside in the sunshine and it worked excellent!</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and the feel of the cream.  </li>
            <li>and I got a lovely tan.</li>
            <li>duped.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smelled ok.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth coloring as well.</li>
            <li>Love how they smell</li>
            <li>but I do love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>use all the time, love it</li>
            <li>Almost Famous...</li>
            <li>I am for sure</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this lotion was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>The color you get is just beautiful and looks so natural like I was on vacation</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Worth buying!!</li>
            <li>Very goog bronzer and smells good</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t burn easy but it takes me FOREVER to get tan.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I will for sure stick with this lotion and purchase this full size bottle here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for the price- don&#x27;t waste your money on overpriced lotions! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brand and definitely works</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling, which I was grateful for.</li>
            <li>The color is light beige.</li>
            <li>Great job Australian Gold...</li>
            <li>Overall a good lotion, wish it had a bit more bronzers in it.</li>
            <li>Australian Gold has always been my favorite brand of tanning lotions, this is probably my favorite lotion from them!</li>
            <li>Yes I have used products that have more of a moisturizing effect but to get the color, this is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Works well, smells amazing, my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>works good but fades in within 2 days but does work well for tanning if you go on a regular basis</li>
            <li>and it gives me noticeable results after using and builds a nice natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice as much of a tan from this as I do with Almost Famous.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells really good, it&#x27;s different.</li>
            <li>And no bad smell after tanning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought more expensive lotions like Kardations&#x27; (SP) and honestly wasn&#x27;t any better than this one, love this one and the smell!  </li>
            <li>Smells great, but does not get as dark as I hoped.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, I am getting the dark tan results I wanted, just as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li>noticed i was getting a tan on the first use!</li>
            <li>Received many compliments on not only the color it gave me, but the sweet smell!</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time today!</li>
            <li>also you dont feel sticky later love it!</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions for indoor tanning and haven&#x27;t come across one that tans as well as my old &amp;#34;Australian Gold Sun Dreamz&amp;#34; since it was basically discontinued.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price (especially when compared to tanning salon prices) either, so would recommend this for anyone who needs to stay within a reasonable budget and still obtain good results.  </li>
            <li>I would give it a five star rating except that the size is smaller than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this again as it&#x27;s a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>The price is definitely right....</li>
            <li>Works great for getting you dark but you really still need a moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>; and I never knew I could get such a dark, beautiful tan!</li>
            <li>This lotion leaves your skin very smooth and will give you the instant color you are looking for!</li>
            <li>I was worried the bronzers would make me look orange, but they did nothing but leave me a gorgeous dark brown!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands and lotions but eventually returned to Australian Gold looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li>But overall I really love this product</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I used this lotion for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time to the salon for the summer</li>
            <li>and this was my first lotion I bought.</li>
            <li>I will say that in the sun I definitely see more color but the tanning does produce results as well.  </li>
            <li>and it was my first time ever</li>
            <li>I guess the hemp and caffeine really do make a difference!</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how quickly I ran out of the lotion because I used it all up quickly</li>
            <li>First time using this particular tanning lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is a decent lotion for the price however!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not ridiculously priced either!</li>
            <li>It works  fast.</li>
            <li>Works very well, the smell of it is pleasing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is overpowering and very perfume -ish....will not repurchase this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Appears to be working very well....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The 2 of us use and it really does excel your tan.</li>
            <li>Just 3 uses you could really see the difference</li>
            <li>Does not work very well seems like</li>
            <li>but I have had other lotions that have accelerated my color more than this one.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes your skin soft but doesn&#x27;t get you as dark as alot of others</li>
            <li>I used it at our indoor tanning salon and got more color in one visit than I had previously gotten in three.</li>
            <li>Decent for price.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping without paying extra is always a bonus!!!</li>
            <li>I have used other Australian gold products but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>My second favorite lotion of all time is Australian Gold</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone that has never tried this brand before.</li>
            <li>I wish the smell was closer to the Australian Gold HOT!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan very well naturally</li>
            <li>This is my new go to lotion.</li>
            <li>I got dark so quick using this!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I used this product for the first time today and although I have always preferred Australian Gold products it seems like the more expensive ones get more attention...more expensive, better quality, right?  </li>
            <li>I got dark super fast</li>
            <li>Works really well and get dark quick..</li>
            <li>I spent minimal time in the sun and still was able to get some decent color that lasted.</li>
            <li>I am fully satisfied with Legally Dark Natural Bronzer Color Lover by Australian Gold.</li>
            <li>I know not everyone holds the color the same, but for someone who does you would definitely cut down on quantity of sessions to maintain a nice tan for a quality of tan.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am so glad the misleading salon girl had me purchase this little packet of Australian Gold.</li>
            <li>an Australian Gold girl,,,Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this is top quality in getting dark tanning!</li>
            <li>I have placed 3 orders so far for this.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and supple while darkening.</li>
            <li>Was looking to replace my Australian Gold Bearly Legal lotion....</li>
            <li>--It&#x27;s a natural bronzer.</li>
            <li>One of my favorites so far.  </li>
            <li>This lotion gets you dark the first time you use it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and will definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li>She handed me this one to try, not sure why I would think it was free, but with a line of people behind me I said sure.</li>
            <li>Just one use, it left my skin soft and glowing!</li>
            <li>smells very good, but the cap to it is broken, its very hard to squeeze the lotion out but besides that i like it</li>
            <li>Does not dry you out.  </li>
            <li>I was very dark and the color lasted 6 days, almost a whole week!</li>
            <li>This lotion with bronzer gets you tan and dark fast.</li>
            <li>just slight, not too much at one time.</li>
            <li>If you want something that&#x27;s gonna add a little color but not too much, this is the lotion for you.</li>
            <li>I was so bummed I had to pay so much for so little.</li>

            <li> The smell was amazing and it did not stain.</li>
            <li> this product smells nice</li>
            <li> So now I have my own bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love it and it smells so good too.</li>
            <li> I am getting nice color.  </li>
            <li> goes on nice, dont leave you with an after tan smell.</li>
            <li> Smell is nice.</li>
            <li> I have my own bed and use this lotion every two times.....</li>
            <li> This lotion is cheap, but very effective.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a wonderful smell and absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin that doesn&#x27;t tan easily</li>
            <li> Lotion smells good and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> This product shows great results as immediately as after your very first tanning experience..</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotio yet.</li>
            <li> I chose this bc some reviewers that bought Almost Famous liked this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> But for sure it offers a great tan!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today and got a great bronze.</li>
            <li> This is a good inexpensive lotion that provides adequate color and moisture.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is that you come out of the tanning bed with a beautiful golden tan.</li>
            <li> Used it as a moisturizer more than a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells ok.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> So much more affordable than what the tanning salons try to sell you - those people told me NOT to buy anything off of here because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to be sure of the contents...</li>
            <li> Will def keep using this lotion and suggest it to others!&lt;br /&gt;Amanda :)</li>
            <li> I used this product both in indoor tanning beds and outside in the sunshine and it worked excellent!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the feel of the cream.  </li>
            <li> and I got a lovely tan.</li>
            <li> duped.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smelled ok.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth coloring as well.</li>
            <li> Love how they smell</li>
            <li> but I do love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> use all the time, love it</li>
            <li> Almost Famous...</li>
            <li> I am for sure</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this lotion was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> The color you get is just beautiful and looks so natural like I was on vacation</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Worth buying!!</li>
            <li> Very goog bronzer and smells good</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn easy but it takes me FOREVER to get tan.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I will for sure stick with this lotion and purchase this full size bottle here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for the price- don&#x27;t waste your money on overpriced lotions! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brand and definitely works</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling, which I was grateful for.</li>
            <li> The color is light beige.</li>
            <li> Great job Australian Gold...</li>
            <li> Overall a good lotion, wish it had a bit more bronzers in it.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold has always been my favorite brand of tanning lotions, this is probably my favorite lotion from them!</li>
            <li> Yes I have used products that have more of a moisturizing effect but to get the color, this is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Works well, smells amazing, my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> works good but fades in within 2 days but does work well for tanning if you go on a regular basis</li>
            <li> and it gives me noticeable results after using and builds a nice natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice as much of a tan from this as I do with Almost Famous.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells really good, it&#x27;s different.</li>
            <li> And no bad smell after tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more expensive lotions like Kardations&#x27; (SP) and honestly wasn&#x27;t any better than this one, love this one and the smell!  </li>
            <li> Smells great, but does not get as dark as I hoped.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, I am getting the dark tan results I wanted, just as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li> noticed i was getting a tan on the first use!</li>
            <li> Received many compliments on not only the color it gave me, but the sweet smell!</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today!</li>
            <li> also you dont feel sticky later love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions for indoor tanning and haven&#x27;t come across one that tans as well as my old &amp;#34;Australian Gold Sun Dreamz&amp;#34; since it was basically discontinued.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price (especially when compared to tanning salon prices) either, so would recommend this for anyone who needs to stay within a reasonable budget and still obtain good results.  </li>
            <li> I would give it a five star rating except that the size is smaller than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this again as it&#x27;s a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> The price is definitely right....</li>
            <li> Works great for getting you dark but you really still need a moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> ; and I never knew I could get such a dark, beautiful tan!</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves your skin very smooth and will give you the instant color you are looking for!</li>
            <li> I was worried the bronzers would make me look orange, but they did nothing but leave me a gorgeous dark brown!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and lotions but eventually returned to Australian Gold looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> But overall I really love this product</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> It was my first time to the salon for the summer</li>
            <li> and this was my first lotion I bought.</li>
            <li> I will say that in the sun I definitely see more color but the tanning does produce results as well.  </li>
            <li> and it was my first time ever</li>
            <li> I guess the hemp and caffeine really do make a difference!</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how quickly I ran out of the lotion because I used it all up quickly</li>
            <li> First time using this particular tanning lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a decent lotion for the price however!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not ridiculously priced either!</li>
            <li> It works  fast.</li>
            <li> Works very well, the smell of it is pleasing.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is overpowering and very perfume -ish....will not repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Appears to be working very well....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The 2 of us use and it really does excel your tan.</li>
            <li> Just 3 uses you could really see the difference</li>
            <li> Does not work very well seems like</li>
            <li> but I have had other lotions that have accelerated my color more than this one.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes your skin soft but doesn&#x27;t get you as dark as alot of others</li>
            <li> I used it at our indoor tanning salon and got more color in one visit than I had previously gotten in three.</li>
            <li> Decent for price.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping without paying extra is always a bonus!!!</li>
            <li> I have used other Australian gold products but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> My second favorite lotion of all time is Australian Gold</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone that has never tried this brand before.</li>
            <li> I wish the smell was closer to the Australian Gold HOT!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan very well naturally</li>
            <li> This is my new go to lotion.</li>
            <li> I got dark so quick using this!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I used this product for the first time today and although I have always preferred Australian Gold products it seems like the more expensive ones get more attention...more expensive, better quality, right?  </li>
            <li> I got dark super fast</li>
            <li> Works really well and get dark quick..</li>
            <li> I spent minimal time in the sun and still was able to get some decent color that lasted.</li>
            <li> I am fully satisfied with Legally Dark Natural Bronzer Color Lover by Australian Gold.</li>
            <li> I know not everyone holds the color the same, but for someone who does you would definitely cut down on quantity of sessions to maintain a nice tan for a quality of tan.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am so glad the misleading salon girl had me purchase this little packet of Australian Gold.</li>
            <li> an Australian Gold girl,,,Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this is top quality in getting dark tanning!</li>
            <li> I have placed 3 orders so far for this.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft and supple while darkening.</li>
            <li> Was looking to replace my Australian Gold Bearly Legal lotion....</li>
            <li> --It&#x27;s a natural bronzer.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites so far.  </li>
            <li> This lotion gets you dark the first time you use it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and will definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> She handed me this one to try, not sure why I would think it was free, but with a line of people behind me I said sure.</li>
            <li> Just one use, it left my skin soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> smells very good, but the cap to it is broken, its very hard to squeeze the lotion out but besides that i like it</li>
            <li> Does not dry you out.  </li>
            <li> I was very dark and the color lasted 6 days, almost a whole week!</li>
            <li> This lotion with bronzer gets you tan and dark fast.</li>
            <li> just slight, not too much at one time.</li>
            <li> If you want something that&#x27;s gonna add a little color but not too much, this is the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> I was so bummed I had to pay so much for so little.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some other lotions.</li>
            <li> A middle aged blonde that tans only for vacation.</li>
            <li> This lotion is to watery ( if that&#x27;s even a word) and it builds up little white balls like if the lotion is old.</li>
            <li> I was not aware the lotion I purchased from my salon last summer, the Going Gaga one, would go \\&quot;bad\\&quot; as she called it.</li>
            <li> When I tan I don&#x27;t ever burn not unless I have not gone for a very long time.</li>
            <li> After only a few uses I was dark like I had just gotten back from the Bahamas!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is after several( by several I mean about 10 visits)  </li>
            <li> Of course  just like any other lotionit turns  your  hands  </li>
            <li> A little amount goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I also noticed a slight shimmer from the lotion on my skin after I tanned.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an overbearing glitter, just a slight shimmer to give you a glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a lotion that&#x27;ll help tan my skin without the strange smell and sparkles</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they think they have to make these so sweet that it makes me sick to my stomach.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little fruity, makes me think of oranges.&lt;br /&gt;Results</li>
            <li> I prefer something a little darker for myself.</li>
            <li> is getting a little orangy.</li>
            <li> but I see very little color after tanning,not dark bronzing like advertised.</li>
            <li> The caffeine made my skin slightly tighter even after one use!</li>
            <li> She then charged me $6.50 for this little sample!</li>
            <li> Why buy the expensive ones when these do the same thing....</li>
            <li> this was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I am at least 3 shades darker.</li>
            <li> but I already have a base tan, and I was hoping this lotion would give me a darker, deep brown color</li>
            <li> weird  burned  smelling  skin like  some  of the others.</li>
            <li> Very thin non greasy lotion.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> No orange,no streaks,no bad smell after tanning.</li>
            <li> Smells bad on skin, but works.</li>
            <li> I would defiantly recommend this for people who are looking to boost their base tan!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Tan lotion stay bed instead soaking skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been  tanning  for years. This is by far the best lotio yet. I have  fair skin. This  lotion  doesn&#x27;t  give  you that Orange  or streaky look. It works  fast. Of course  just like any other lotionit turns  your  hands  color if you don&#x27;t  wipe  it off quickly  enough. Another  pro with this lotion  is it smells  good and stays  smelling  good. It doesn&#x27;t  give that  weird  burned  smelling  skin like  some  of the others. This is my new go to lotion.</li>
            <li> Love it and the price!!! I got dark super fast and I love my color!!</li>
            <li> I have placed 3 orders so far for this. Me and my daughter love it!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions for indoor tanning and haven&#x27;t come across one that tans as well as my old &amp;#34;Australian Gold Sun Dreamz&amp;#34; since it was basically discontinued. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and lotions but eventually returned to Australian Gold looking for a replacement. This lotion is it! This lotion with bronzer gets you tan and dark fast. It is a thicker lotion than some which I personally like, I think it helps my skin from drying out. After only a few uses I was dark like I had just gotten back from the Bahamas! Would gladly recommend this to anyone looking for a bronzed glow for a great price</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product from this seller. It arrived the day after I ordered it, and smelled amazing. I used it at our indoor tanning salon and got more color in one visit than I had previously gotten in three.</li>
            <li> Works great for me. A middle aged blonde that tans only for vacation.</li>
            <li> This came unsealed, with no hints of bronzer at all. Used it as a moisturizer more than a tanning lotion. Definitely a knock off</li>
            <li> Smells ok. Decent for price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The smell is really good and the price is amazing. I buy all of my lotions on amazon. I am very happy with this product and amazing I have been getting amazing results</li>
            <li> I am fully satisfied with Legally Dark Natural Bronzer Color Lover by Australian Gold. This inexpensive tanning lotion is great indoors and outdoors. I have built up great color with this product. A little amount goes a long way too! A great alternative to Designer Skin lotions which cost a fortune!</li>
            <li> this product smells nice but I see very little color after tanning,not dark bronzing like advertised.</li>
            <li> Great smell and gives good color!  A good buy!!</li>
            <li> works good but fades in within 2 days but does work well for tanning if you go on a regular basis</li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft and supple while darkening.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes your skin soft but doesn&#x27;t get you as dark as alot of others</li>
            <li> like a change in tanning lotions and do like this one</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling very soft. Definitely helped to increase tan.</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all! It smells good but does not do its job! When I tan I don&#x27;t ever burn not unless I have not gone for a very long time. But I used this lotion for a week and I burned every time I got out from the tanning bed. This lotion is to watery ( if that&#x27;s even a word) and it builds up little white balls like if the lotion is old. I have used this brand before and I love it.  So I decided to try to buy it from the internet because it was cheaper. But it is not the same I recommend not to buy this. It seems to me that it is just a water downed lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells good too !</li>
            <li> My friend and I bought this lotion and we are in love! To start with it smells amazing,the secent is fruity,tropical.The most important thing is that you come out of the tanning bed with a beautiful golden tan.No orange,no streaks,no bad smell after tanning. I would recommend it to a friend!</li>
            <li> Works very well, the smell of it is pleasing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great great bronze affect</li>
            <li> noticed i was getting a tan on the first use! just slight, not too much at one time. just perfect!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is the best! I have fair skin that doesn&#x27;t tan easily and it gives me noticeable results after using and builds a nice natural looking tan. Never looks streaky or orange or anything. The only flaw is there&#x27;s no scent so it leaves me with that tanning bed funk! But overall I really love this product</li>
            <li> i love it , protects and it gives you a nice tan , i recommend using it together with a sunscreen protector !  I&#x60;m really white and I&#x27;ve never been so tan in all my life!</li>
            <li> Lotion smells great and goes on smooth! Another plus is that bronzer doesn&#x27;t streak on your skin. Awesome product for the price- don&#x27;t waste your money on overpriced lotions! :)</li>
            <li> Great for stand up units.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold has always been my favorite brand of tanning lotions, this is probably my favorite lotion from them! I had a tan line after 2 uses. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I&#x27;m very pleased with my results. I defiantly recommend this, and all of the Australian gold products.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells amazing, my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> Was looking to replace my Australian Gold Bearly Legal lotion....this was a big disappointment.  The fragrance is overpowering and very perfume -ish....will not repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> I always buy Australian Gold tanning products....Why buy the expensive ones when these do the same thing....What a great product....</li>
            <li> Great stuff! We use this annually before we go to Florida! We have not burned on vaca since we started using this in the tanning booth before our trip. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So much more affordable than what the tanning salons try to sell you - those people told me NOT to buy anything off of here because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to be sure of the contents... baloney!  Works wonderful for me - smells good too!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give good tanning results.</li>
            <li> First time using this particular tanning lotion and I love it!!! Great product for the price &amp; it has Wonderful fruity smell and leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky not greasy or oily after tanning! Will def keep using this lotion and suggest it to others!&lt;br /&gt;Amanda :)</li>
            <li> I chose this bc some reviewers that bought Almost Famous liked this lotion. I don&#x27;t notice as much of a tan from this as I do with Almost Famous. It&#x27;s is a decent lotion for the price however! Also I had the lotion within days!!! Quick shipping without paying extra is always a bonus!!!</li>
            <li> Smells bad on skin, but works.</li>
            <li> I used this product both in indoor tanning beds and outside in the sunshine and it worked excellent! People noticed the color, I got comments like &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve never seen you so tan!&amp;#34; and I never knew I could get such a dark, beautiful tan! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how quickly I ran out of the lotion because I used it all up quickly but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more. Also smells great! Received many compliments on not only the color it gave me, but the sweet smell!</li>
            <li> Great product, will buy again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help tan, no color at all</li>
            <li> Scent--This lotion smells really good, it&#x27;s different. The scent is a little fruity, makes me think of oranges.&lt;br /&gt;Results--It&#x27;s a natural bronzer. If you want something that&#x27;s gonna add a little color but not too much, this is the lotion for you. I prefer something a little darker for myself.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but does not get as dark as I hoped. Would work best on someone fair skinned, which I am not.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some other lotions. I used it for the first time today and got a great bronze.</li>
            <li> smells very good, but the cap to it is broken, its very hard to squeeze the lotion out but besides that i like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more expensive lotions like Kardations&#x27; (SP) and honestly wasn&#x27;t any better than this one, love this one and the smell!  I don&#x27;t understand why they think they have to make these so sweet that it makes me sick to my stomach.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I would order this again.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells really good. It&#x27;s a great brand and definitely works but I have had other lotions that have accelerated my color more than this one. Still a really good product and a good price</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Lotion goes on nicely &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. The smell is good, not tropical coconuts. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the feel of the cream.  I felt it worked well with the sun as we were on vacation and I got a lovely tan.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time-tanner and have tried my fair share of lotions, from intensifiers, maximizer to quadruple bronzers so I have a good idea how a lotion should work and what should or should not do on the skin. I recently discovered this cream through a samplen my tanning salon gave me to try and boy I was amazed when I finished tanning. I was very dark and the color lasted 6 days, almost a whole week! So now I have my own bottle.  I know not everyone holds the color the same, but for someone who does you would definitely cut down on quantity of sessions to maintain a nice tan for a quality of tan. Worth buying!!</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for the first time yesterday.  I was not aware the lotion I purchased from my salon last summer, the Going Gaga one, would go \\&quot;bad\\&quot; as she called it. She wouldn&#x27;t allow me to use my lotion in their beds, so she offered me a sample. She handed me this one to try, not sure why I would think it was free, but with a line of people behind me I said sure. She then charged me $6.50 for this little sample! I was so bummed I had to pay so much for so little. It was my first time to the salon for the summer and I didn&#x27;t want to just leave, so I bought it &amp; headed back to my room feeling like I was duped.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smelled ok. It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling, which I was grateful for. My legs and arms felt hydrated without feeling like I had anything on. I tanned my 5 minutes &amp; headed home to wait for my results. I left it on all day and today I am at least 3 shades darker. I have to say I am so glad the misleading salon girl had me purchase this little packet of Australian Gold. I can&#x27;t wait to go back tomorrow and use it again. I will for sure stick with this lotion and purchase this full size bottle here on Amazon. It&#x27;s highway robbery what the salon charges. I definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, I am getting the dark tan results I wanted, just as it was advertised.  It does not feel sticky nor does it leaves any residue on the tanning bed. (EXCELLENT PRODUCT).</li>
            <li> This lotion has a wonderful smell and absorbs quickly and easily.  I have been using it for about a week and have been very happy with my indoor tanning results.  You can&#x27;t beat the price (especially when compared to tanning salon prices) either, so would recommend this for anyone who needs to stay within a reasonable budget and still obtain good results.  I would give it a five star rating except that the size is smaller than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I just started tanning and this was my first lotion I bought. I don&#x27;t burn easy but it takes me FOREVER to get tan. This lotion works amazing!! I love it and it smells so good too. I&#x27;ve bought three bottles and I recommend this to anyone. I have super sensitive skin and this lotion was perfect for me. I will definitely be buying again! The color you get is just beautiful and looks so natural like I was on vacation (:</li>
            <li> Appears to be working very well....I am getting nice color.  Lotion smells good and goes on easily.  The price is definitely right....I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very goog bronzer and smells good</li>
            <li> Works really well and get dark quick..</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s hard to find a lotion that&#x27;ll help tan my skin without the strange smell and sparkles but this one has it all.. And it&#x27;s not ridiculously priced either!</li>
            <li> The 2 of us use and it really does excel your tan. Just 3 uses you could really see the difference</li>
            <li> Overall a good lotion, wish it had a bit more bronzers in it. The smell was amazing and it did not stain.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today! First of all, it smells AMAZING. It doesn&#x27;t give you a gross burnt smell after tanning also. Just one use, it left my skin soft and glowing! The only thing is, I didn&#x27;t see any results as in making my skin darker, I think it&#x27;s a great lotion to build a base tan if you&#x27;re a beginner but I already have a base tan, and I was hoping this lotion would give me a darker, deep brown color but it doesn&#x27;t. But I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> smells like orange mixed with hemp. goes on nice, dont leave you with an after tan smell. also you dont feel sticky later love it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price! Nice clean smell and not greasy at all. Nice smooth coloring as well. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion! I got it today and went tanning to try it out and it is amazing! It smells like guava and papaya which I like, it didn&#x27;t leave me smelling like the tanning bed afterwards which is great. I was worried the bronzers would make me look orange, but they did nothing but leave me a gorgeous dark brown! It didn&#x27;t streak either which is a plus! The caffeine made my skin slightly tighter even after one use! I also noticed a slight shimmer from the lotion on my skin after I tanned. It isn&#x27;t an overbearing glitter, just a slight shimmer to give you a glow. I highly recommend this product, and will definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Works great for getting you dark but you really still need a moisturizer as well. But for sure it offers a great tan!</li>
            <li> Very thin non greasy lotion. Smell is nice. And no bad smell after tanning. Does not dry you out.  My only complaint is after several( by several I mean about 10 visits)  uses my color is getting a little orangy. Good price.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion and  very good results. I highly recommend it to anyone that has never tried this brand before.</li>
            <li> Loved this  product. I spent minimal time in the sun and still was able to get some decent color that lasted.</li>
            <li> The salons way overcharge for the same product, I saved 75%! Love how they smell and they produce a killer tan!</li>
            <li> AG is always a good bet.  This lotion I have used inside the tanning bed and out in the sun.  I will say that in the sun I definitely see more color but the tanning does produce results as well.  This has no tingle.  The color is light beige. I would definitely purchase this again as it&#x27;s a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Wonderful tanning bronzer and you will love it too!</li>
            <li> This lotion is cheap, but very effective. Great product! I have my own bed and use this lotion every two times..... it works great.</li>
            <li> I just started tanning and it was my first time ever and this stuff was awesome, I love how it works and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product shows great results as immediately as after your very first tanning experience..I definitely recommend this product for your tanning experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan very well naturally but I do love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good inexpensive lotion that provides adequate color and moisture. The smell is pretty good too. I would buy again</li>
            <li> Works well for tanning</li>
            <li> I got dark so quick using this! I have used other Australian gold products but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> use all the time, love it</li>
            <li> Smells great! Great product for price.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites so far.  I have tried many kinds of tanning lotions and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well seems like im getting lighter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I used this product for the first time today and although I have always preferred Australian Gold products it seems like the more expensive ones get more attention...more expensive, better quality, right?  WRONG! This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used. The results are amazing!!! Yes I have used products that have more of a moisturizing effect but to get the color, this is the real deal! And so what, don&#x27;t all tanners use a moisturizer after the shower anyway? And the price on this lotion...Freaking amazing! I guess the hemp and caffeine really do make a difference! My second favorite lotion of all time is Australian Gold Almost Famous...I am for sure an Australian Gold girl,,,Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this is top quality in getting dark tanning! I would recommend to anyone and everyone and I will! Great job Australian Gold...Gotta stock up on this one!</li>
            <li> This lotion gets you dark the first time you use it! I wish the smell was closer to the Australian Gold HOT! but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers. This lotion leaves your skin very smooth and will give you the instant color you are looking for! I would defiantly recommend this for people who are looking to boost their base tan!</li>
