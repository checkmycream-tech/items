            <li>Good seal.</li>
            <li>Best fit for me.</li>
            <li>good quality</li>

            <li>amazing product .  </li>
            <li>Good mask like it much better than others ive tride</li>
            <li>nice mask, works well.</li>
            <li>Nice To Have a Spare one on hand</li>
            <li>Replaced my original mask with this one works great.</li>
            <li>This product is of high quality and comes with excellent headgear.</li>
            <li>As good as any, better than most.</li>
            <li>It hurts the bridge of my nose, and it leaks very easy.</li>
            <li>think this is a good mask if it fits your face, but since it doesn&#x27;t fit mine, I&#x27;m giving it three stars.</li>
            <li>Perfect and so nice to have an extra one.</li>
            <li>Slept great, the first night I used this.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>it is very comfortable</li>
            <li>Quick delivery at a good price.</li>
            <li>After trying so many have finally happily settled for the Mirage Quattro Full Face CPAP Mask and can rest comfortably.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more</li>
            <li>Got what I expected, I already own one and it is an awesome mask!!!!!</li>
            <li>The seller was great and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I have been using a nasal mask and moved to this to see if it was better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I sleep so much better.</li>
            <li>Be sure to order the head strap that is sold separately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better because the seal holds up better.  </li>
            <li>fits perfect got it faster than the local store</li>
            <li>Seems to be very well made, with great seal.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>The ability to disassemble the mask also makes cleaning it easier and more</li>
            <li>resmed is the best and it will not be a open package i have seen these sold for 3 times the money on ebay</li>
            <li>ResMed is my favorite product for my CPAP.</li>
            <li>Works great fitts like a glove pretty easy to put together too</li>
            <li>Very well made and works effectively!</li>
            <li>but I find the Mirage Quattro to be the best fit for me personally.</li>
            <li>It fits me well and has greatly improved the seal and reduced the large leak percentage significantly.</li>
            <li>It I so much more comfortable</li>
            <li>I am sleeping better and that is what is important.</li>
            <li>Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>one very helpful thing price wise is to buy the mask and headgear</li>
            <li>Ideally you don&#x27;t wake up at night due to the mask, so I&#x27;m obviously not dialed in to the best mask.  </li>
            <li>Fits better than by original which was purchased through my Dr,</li>
            <li>Very comfortable full face mask.</li>
            <li>Replacement parts are easy to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No dry mouth, no snoring, happy wife.....</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>This mask was comfortable, and it was easy to put the headgear on it.  </li>
            <li>I wondered because it was so cheap and different from what I was using but after using it for some time it has been great.  </li>
            <li>FITS WELL AND COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li>I still plan to use in the future, but am now experimenting with the n10, which doesn&#x27;t leak, great for side sleeping , but has the air noise problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a matter of life or death, and a mask needs to be comfortable, efficient, durable, etc.  </li>
            <li>The system is easy to clean and dissasemble.</li>
            <li>fit</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was just the mask frame or a complete mask and was happy to see that it is a complete mask!</li>
            <li>Was received in a clean sealed bag no issues.</li>
            <li>mask is the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever worn, and the adjustable thingie between the forehead and bridge of the nose works very well for me</li>
            <li>Third type of resmed mask I have tried and by far the best.</li>
            <li>great to be able to get it without getting new prescription, same mask.</li>
            <li>exact same product I originally had, great price and performs well.</li>
            <li>If you need a full face mask</li>
            <li>so I need the full face mask, and I&#x27;m used to it now.</li>
            <li>I have used the full ultra for two years, and wanted to try something else.</li>
            <li>This is the full mask.</li>
            <li>No, it was a full mask.</li>
            <li>I have a deviated septum and allergies which means a nasal pillow mask is usually not going to work for me most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisified with it!!</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;4\\&quot; and have the large and my mouth and nose barely fit into it,  </li>
            <li>Far better than Respironics.</li>
            <li>Even so the improved sleep is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Item was just as described fits nice and is quiet.</li>
            <li>my first experience with a full face mask..</li>
            <li>The seal works better than my old style.  </li>
            <li>Full Face Mask is great for several months until bands stretch out and mask gets loose.  </li>
            <li>Quick, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Full face mask worked wonderfully,would highly recommend purchasing one through Amazon,</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will defiantly be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>Exactly like the one I have at home but can&#x27;t seem to find anymore.  </li>
            <li>good product seals nicely comfortable fit but takes about two to three weeks of wearing tto get used to...far better than tha nasal only mask which is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband needed.  </li>
            <li>Amazon price - much better than medical supply facilities.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t be sure if you&#x27;re getting the pressure setting from your CPAP required to keep your airways open.</li>
            <li>After using an Ultra Mirage (UM) mask for 6 years, I decided to try this Quattro mask of the same size based on a reviewer&#x27;s statement that is was more current and better than the Ultra Mirage mask.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit i expected but will be ordering again once i get use it will be fine</li>
            <li>Delivered new and quickly.  </li>
            <li>The price was VERY reasonable on here for the whole mask, and delivery was as promised.</li>
            <li>Way better that the previous full face masks I received from my sleep clinic.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the comfort gel blue mask but went back to the Quattro for better fit and comfort for me.</li>
            <li>It appears to be made much cheaper than the UM mask, as the connector between the lower part and the top is very thin plastic that will probably break easily, and it uses loops to connect the headgear at the top instead of clips used on the UM.</li>
            <li>I ordered a medium and it fits large</li>
            <li>Having used at least 5 different masks over the years, I have found this particular one to be the most durable and easiest to get a good seal (without adjusting it to deform my face).  </li>
            <li>This mask is easy to seal for me, but it really makes the bridge of my nose sore if I sleep on my back, on my side I have no problem with that.</li>
            <li>Fits my large nose very well.</li>
            <li>I went away form it for awhile and used my eson, and then went back to it, and had more success with the leak pig problem the second time</li>
            <li>It is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>separately MUCH CHEAPER</li>
            <li>It does not seal very well.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much I saved by purchasing through amazon.  </li>
            <li>The fit is definitely &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; face, yet</li>
            <li>just what i needed, fast shipping,thanks so much</li>
            <li>have been using these (style of Resmed) masks for 8 years, have been very reliable.</li>
            <li>This one is forgiving and fits me better than any other.</li>
            <li>I am into my third month using CPAP, and this is the mask I was given when I asked for a \\&quot;full face\\&quot; mask rather than a nasal pillow.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really need the plastic outer shell, just the rubber pieces and a new strap which it came with.</li>
            <li>Like most CPAP users I have found it necessary to have several masks.</li>
            <li>I am on a somewhat high pressure of 16</li>
            <li>so it is still a bit high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mask for anyone who has high pressure..</li>
            <li>It has performed very well thus far (3 months).</li>
            <li>I normally buy my masks from the CPAP website but when I saw this price under $100 I could not resist.  </li>
            <li>I also use the Quattro FX and the new Quattro Air.</li>
            <li>Cant Live With Out it.</li>
            <li>It did rub the bridge of my nose raw like many others did.</li>
            <li>replacement fits exactly the same way.</li>
            <li>Not super comfortable but what mask is.  </li>
            <li>The gasket does break down  over time, but this is no different than many of the others.  </li>
            <li>This not only fits my kind of chubby round face but make a pretty fair seal over a pretty thick beard without having to cinch it down tight.</li>
            <li>I saved nearly 50%, and since I would have pad to pay out of pocked anyway for my insurance deductible, why not save some money?</li>
            <li>I just love the mask so much and my old one was broken and the temporary was just murder on my nose.  </li>
            <li>I found a full face mask helps me keep my mouth closed, so my mouth and throat do not dry out at night.  </li>
            <li>I have such a high pressure setting, the durn thing squeels like a pig, but</li>
            <li>After using it for 3 nights, I switched back to my old UM, and ordered a new cushion for it.</li>
            <li>I bought this mask to eliminate the problem of mouth breathing/snoring with the normal nasal only mask.</li>
            <li>Works great for me especially when I have a head cold and a lot of nasal congestion which forces me to be a mouth breather.</li>
            <li>There is most likely no ideal mask with my high pressure.</li>
            <li>Even though it was expensive, it was still much more reasonable than the actual Cpap site itself.  </li>
            <li>I wear my hair short and the head gear leaves a ridge in my hair and scalp nearly all day that nothing seems to take away.</li>
            <li>I have always bought my CPAP supplies directly from medical supply companies.  </li>
            <li>Same quality as my local medical supply store, only much cheaper.</li>
            <li>When we got it, it was the exact same thing and brand, but much less.</li>
            <li>This is an exact replacement and works the same as any inflated priced $150 one bought from a local supplier at a much less cost.</li>
            <li>the forehead adjustment will only let the mask rest down to a certain point, and you just can&#x27;t make it sit any lower.  </li>
            <li>My unsatisfying work-around is to tighten the lower straps much tighter and to push the mask further down on my face.  </li>
            <li>other trick I use to keep my mouth closed at night is to put a strip of paper tape (like Nexcare 1&amp;#34; Paper First Aid tape) over my lips.  </li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I sleep so much better.</li>
            <li> Be sure to order the head strap that is sold separately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better because the seal holds up better.  </li>
            <li> fits perfect got it faster than the local store</li>
            <li> Seems to be very well made, with great seal.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> The ability to disassemble the mask also makes cleaning it easier and more</li>
            <li> resmed is the best and it will not be a open package i have seen these sold for 3 times the money on ebay</li>
            <li> ResMed is my favorite product for my CPAP.</li>
            <li> Works great fitts like a glove pretty easy to put together too</li>
            <li> Very well made and works effectively!</li>
            <li> but I find the Mirage Quattro to be the best fit for me personally.</li>
            <li> It fits me well and has greatly improved the seal and reduced the large leak percentage significantly.</li>
            <li> It I so much more comfortable</li>
            <li> I am sleeping better and that is what is important.</li>
            <li> Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> one very helpful thing price wise is to buy the mask and headgear</li>
            <li> Ideally you don&#x27;t wake up at night due to the mask, so I&#x27;m obviously not dialed in to the best mask.  </li>
            <li> Fits better than by original which was purchased through my Dr,</li>
            <li> Very comfortable full face mask.</li>
            <li> Replacement parts are easy to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No dry mouth, no snoring, happy wife.....</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> This mask was comfortable, and it was easy to put the headgear on it.  </li>
            <li> I wondered because it was so cheap and different from what I was using but after using it for some time it has been great.  </li>
            <li> FITS WELL AND COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> I still plan to use in the future, but am now experimenting with the n10, which doesn&#x27;t leak, great for side sleeping , but has the air noise problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a matter of life or death, and a mask needs to be comfortable, efficient, durable, etc.  </li>
            <li> The system is easy to clean and dissasemble.</li>
            <li> fit</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was just the mask frame or a complete mask and was happy to see that it is a complete mask!</li>
            <li> Was received in a clean sealed bag no issues.</li>
            <li> mask is the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever worn, and the adjustable thingie between the forehead and bridge of the nose works very well for me</li>
            <li> Third type of resmed mask I have tried and by far the best.</li>
            <li> great to be able to get it without getting new prescription, same mask.</li>
            <li> exact same product I originally had, great price and performs well.</li>
            <li> If you need a full face mask</li>
            <li> so I need the full face mask, and I&#x27;m used to it now.</li>
            <li> I have used the full ultra for two years, and wanted to try something else.</li>
            <li> This is the full mask.</li>
            <li> No, it was a full mask.</li>
            <li> I have a deviated septum and allergies which means a nasal pillow mask is usually not going to work for me most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisified with it!!</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;4\\&quot; and have the large and my mouth and nose barely fit into it,  </li>
            <li> Far better than Respironics.</li>
            <li> Even so the improved sleep is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described fits nice and is quiet.</li>
            <li> my first experience with a full face mask..</li>
            <li> The seal works better than my old style.  </li>
            <li> Full Face Mask is great for several months until bands stretch out and mask gets loose.  </li>
            <li> Quick, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Full face mask worked wonderfully,would highly recommend purchasing one through Amazon,</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will defiantly be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one I have at home but can&#x27;t seem to find anymore.  </li>
            <li> good product seals nicely comfortable fit but takes about two to three weeks of wearing tto get used to...far better than tha nasal only mask which is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed.  </li>
            <li> Amazon price - much better than medical supply facilities.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t be sure if you&#x27;re getting the pressure setting from your CPAP required to keep your airways open.</li>
            <li> After using an Ultra Mirage (UM) mask for 6 years, I decided to try this Quattro mask of the same size based on a reviewer&#x27;s statement that is was more current and better than the Ultra Mirage mask.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit i expected but will be ordering again once i get use it will be fine</li>
            <li> Delivered new and quickly.  </li>
            <li> The price was VERY reasonable on here for the whole mask, and delivery was as promised.</li>
            <li> Way better that the previous full face masks I received from my sleep clinic.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the comfort gel blue mask but went back to the Quattro for better fit and comfort for me.</li>
            <li> It appears to be made much cheaper than the UM mask, as the connector between the lower part and the top is very thin plastic that will probably break easily, and it uses loops to connect the headgear at the top instead of clips used on the UM.</li>
            <li> I ordered a medium and it fits large</li>
            <li> Having used at least 5 different masks over the years, I have found this particular one to be the most durable and easiest to get a good seal (without adjusting it to deform my face).  </li>
            <li> This mask is easy to seal for me, but it really makes the bridge of my nose sore if I sleep on my back, on my side I have no problem with that.</li>
            <li> Fits my large nose very well.</li>
            <li> I went away form it for awhile and used my eson, and then went back to it, and had more success with the leak pig problem the second time</li>
            <li> It is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> separately MUCH CHEAPER</li>
            <li> It does not seal very well.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much I saved by purchasing through amazon.  </li>
            <li> The fit is definitely &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; face, yet</li>
            <li> just what i needed, fast shipping,thanks so much</li>
            <li> have been using these (style of Resmed) masks for 8 years, have been very reliable.</li>
            <li> This one is forgiving and fits me better than any other.</li>
            <li> I am into my third month using CPAP, and this is the mask I was given when I asked for a \\&quot;full face\\&quot; mask rather than a nasal pillow.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really need the plastic outer shell, just the rubber pieces and a new strap which it came with.</li>
            <li> Like most CPAP users I have found it necessary to have several masks.</li>
            <li> I am on a somewhat high pressure of 16</li>
            <li> so it is still a bit high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mask for anyone who has high pressure..</li>
            <li> It has performed very well thus far (3 months).</li>
            <li> I normally buy my masks from the CPAP website but when I saw this price under $100 I could not resist.  </li>
            <li> I also use the Quattro FX and the new Quattro Air.</li>
            <li> Cant Live With Out it.</li>
            <li> It did rub the bridge of my nose raw like many others did.</li>
            <li> replacement fits exactly the same way.</li>
            <li> Not super comfortable but what mask is.  </li>
            <li> The gasket does break down  over time, but this is no different than many of the others.  </li>
            <li> This not only fits my kind of chubby round face but make a pretty fair seal over a pretty thick beard without having to cinch it down tight.</li>
            <li> I saved nearly 50%, and since I would have pad to pay out of pocked anyway for my insurance deductible, why not save some money?</li>
            <li> I just love the mask so much and my old one was broken and the temporary was just murder on my nose.  </li>
            <li> I found a full face mask helps me keep my mouth closed, so my mouth and throat do not dry out at night.  </li>
            <li> I have such a high pressure setting, the durn thing squeels like a pig, but</li>
            <li> After using it for 3 nights, I switched back to my old UM, and ordered a new cushion for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask to eliminate the problem of mouth breathing/snoring with the normal nasal only mask.</li>
            <li> Works great for me especially when I have a head cold and a lot of nasal congestion which forces me to be a mouth breather.</li>
            <li> There is most likely no ideal mask with my high pressure.</li>
            <li> Even though it was expensive, it was still much more reasonable than the actual Cpap site itself.  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair short and the head gear leaves a ridge in my hair and scalp nearly all day that nothing seems to take away.</li>
            <li> I have always bought my CPAP supplies directly from medical supply companies.  </li>
            <li> Same quality as my local medical supply store, only much cheaper.</li>
            <li> When we got it, it was the exact same thing and brand, but much less.</li>
            <li> This is an exact replacement and works the same as any inflated priced $150 one bought from a local supplier at a much less cost.</li>
            <li> the forehead adjustment will only let the mask rest down to a certain point, and you just can&#x27;t make it sit any lower.  </li>
            <li> My unsatisfying work-around is to tighten the lower straps much tighter and to push the mask further down on my face.  </li>
            <li> other trick I use to keep my mouth closed at night is to put a strip of paper tape (like Nexcare 1&amp;#34; Paper First Aid tape) over my lips.  </li>
            <li> The original that came with the machine got broken inside my luggage</li>
            <li> Did not work well at all and apparently NOT Returnable which is BS.</li>
            <li> I had a few incidents where the strap will come off on one side, or the hose will come out of the headgear, or the clips come loose, but those incidents are not common.</li>
            <li> I thought the design of this mask a little &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34; with all those parts, but upon using it I realize why - the ResMed mask is designed so that the components snap apart instead of breaking under the physical stresses of sleep, such as rolling over on it or pulling the hose when turning or moving.  </li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I believe this, but my healthcare provider of durable medical equipment says they sell it for $300.</li>
            <li> extremely reasonably&lt;br /&gt;priced.</li>
            <li> You do not need to purchase the other items like the straps and the cushion for the frame.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple other designs</li>
            <li> The tape keeps my lips closed and the mask pushes down on my cheeks, keeping air from going in my mouth and throat.  </li>
            <li> Of course, because insurance companies basically dole out one horrendously overpriced mask every 3 or 6 months it&#x27;s hard to switch back and forth due to the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side effect of having the lower straps so tight</li>
            <li> Average price.</li>
            <li> I hate my cpap, but it helps me sleep better, so I use it.  </li>
            <li> works like my old one, except it isn&#x27;t broken</li>
            <li> On the down side, the Mirage cuts and bruises my nose bridge.</li>
            <li> Performs as well as my previous masks.</li>
            <li> The mask is a little pricey</li>
            <li> The adjustable forehead piece adds a little comfort too.</li>
            <li> This was far less expensive.</li>
            <li> It is a fairly heavy mask too</li>
            <li> Narrow at the bridge and caused a sore on the side of my nose.</li>
            <li> very disappointed in mask--leaks very easily, my setting is 12, would not recommend at all.&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> The Mirage seals pretty well and does not creep up into my eyes as bad as the FX.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is about half the pharmacy price in my area, at least.</li>
            <li> so I had to buy another in small.</li>
            <li> I sleep we&#x27;ll with this, and have very few &amp;#34;incidents&amp;#34; like hose or mask coming off or leaking.</li>
            <li> Both did not work well - I&#x27;d wake up making weird sounds from my mouth (scary really).</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find a mask that seals well.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the mask vents out the front and blows cold air at me whenever he is facing me.</li>
            <li> I used to get my masks from our local medical supply store because my insurance covered almost all of the cost, however with the horrible changes to our health care system I have to pay out of pocket for them now.</li>
            <li> It cuts into the bridge of my nose, very uncomfortable, and stiff.  </li>
            <li> The nasal pillows are useless at that point</li>
            <li> I have never in my life seen a product that is so bad,  it coudn&#x27;t be worse if it were designed by someone who doesn&#x27;t care,  never tested,  and made by chineese using leftover plastics and chemicals they are trying to get rid</li>
            <li> Boy, was I disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The ResMed Mirage Quattro Full Face Mask is great for several months until bands stretch out and mask gets loose.  But fits great and does the job ...... zzzzzzzzzzz !</li>
            <li> Multiple problems.  The plastic smell gives me a headache,  the face seal digs into my nose,  I am 5&#x27;4\\&quot; and have the large and my mouth and nose barely fit into it,  there are 2 pieces pressing against my forehead.  I have never in my life seen a product that is so bad,  it coudn&#x27;t be worse if it were designed by someone who doesn&#x27;t care,  never tested,  and made by chineese using leftover plastics and chemicals they are trying to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design team, manufacturer, and CEO of this companied should be canned.  Obvious chineese product.</li>
            <li> FITS WELL AND COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> Perfect! Great shipping and excellent product! So thankful for it!</li>
            <li> Best mask I have used to date, super quit and works well</li>
            <li> The mask works quite well, but do NOT over-tighten!. Also, there are a LOT of sellers, so look for a good price!</li>
            <li> Awesome just what I wanted now I can sleep</li>
            <li> my husband says it works great</li>
            <li> amazing product .  great quality.&lt;br /&gt; packaged and delivering was perfect.</li>
            <li> I have such a high pressure setting, the durn thing squeels like a pig, but at 20 setting what do I expect. I went away form it for awhile and used my eson, and then went back to it, and had more success with the leak pig problem the second time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for a lower pressure person, it would work great.  I still plan to use in the future, but am now experimenting with the n10, which doesn&#x27;t leak, great for side sleeping , but has the air noise problem. There is most likely no ideal mask with my high pressure.</li>
            <li> Just as described! Great product works great</li>
            <li> Performs as well as my previous masks.</li>
            <li> Perfect night sleeping of now</li>
            <li> I bought this mask to eliminate the problem of mouth breathing/snoring with the normal nasal only mask. No dry mouth, no snoring, happy wife.....&lt;br /&gt;All is good!!</li>
            <li> I am into my third month using CPAP, and this is the mask I was given when I asked for a \\&quot;full face\\&quot; mask rather than a nasal pillow.  I have a deviated septum and allergies which means a nasal pillow mask is usually not going to work for me most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this mask is well designed and may work for a lot of people, but I&#x27;m going to try to get a hold of a Quattro FX mask- which is similar but without the adjustable forehead pad.  I&#x27;ve tried adjusting the mask according to the videos on YouTube, but even with the forehead adjustment set to minimum height I get leakage around the bridge of my nose into my eyes- which tends to wake me up.  It doesn&#x27;t help to tighten the upper straps- the forehead adjustment will only let the mask rest down to a certain point, and you just can&#x27;t make it sit any lower.  My unsatisfying work-around is to tighten the lower straps much tighter and to push the mask further down on my face.  Eventually the mask creeps back up and... air leaks!  Ideally you don&#x27;t wake up at night due to the mask, so I&#x27;m obviously not dialed in to the best mask.  Of course, because insurance companies basically dole out one horrendously overpriced mask every 3 or 6 months it&#x27;s hard to switch back and forth due to the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side effect of having the lower straps so tight is that in the morning my bottom teeth feel like they have newly-tightened braces on them, and that feeling takes a while to wear off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a good mask if it fits your face, but since it doesn&#x27;t fit mine, I&#x27;m giving it three stars.</li>
            <li> Good price and it worked great</li>
            <li> It is better than I expected.Very pleased with it.I will purchase more</li>
            <li> When my husbands mask was wearing out looked on the actual Cpap site.  Even though it was expensive, it was still much more reasonable than the actual Cpap site itself.  When we got it, it was the exact same thing and brand, but much less.</li>
            <li> I hate my cpap, but it helps me sleep better, so I use it.  I found a full face mask helps me keep my mouth closed, so my mouth and throat do not dry out at night.  Of all the full face masks I&#x27;ve tried (4), this one fits me the best.  Replacement parts are easy to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other trick I use to keep my mouth closed at night is to put a strip of paper tape (like Nexcare 1&amp;#34; Paper First Aid tape) over my lips.  The tape keeps my lips closed and the mask pushes down on my cheeks, keeping air from going in my mouth and throat.  The doctor suggested it to me, and I&#x27;ve found that it works.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected, I already own one and it is an awesome mask!!!!! If you need a full face mask this is the one yous should buy.</li>
            <li> This mask is easy to seal for me, but it really makes the bridge of my nose sore if I sleep on my back, on my side I have no problem with that. It is a fairly heavy mask too I am on a somewhat high pressure of 16 so it&#x27;s hard to find a mask that seals well. I also use the Quattro FX and the new Quattro Air. I have found that using the Remzzzs liners help too. Like most CPAP users I have found it necessary to have several masks. My insurance only paid for one, so I had to buy the others as I could afford them, one very helpful thing price wise is to buy the mask and headgear separately MUCH CHEAPER and you don&#x27;t need to bother your sleep doctor for prescriptions either.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to replace the same mask he already had. It works fine. The only problem is that the mask vents out the front and blows cold air at me whenever he is facing me.</li>
            <li> I normally buy my masks from the CPAP website but when I saw this price under $100 I could not resist.  The mask works just as good too!  I cannot tell the difference.</li>
            <li> great products and service</li>
            <li> This is an exact replacement and works the same as any inflated priced $150 one bought from a local supplier at a much less cost. Didn&#x27;t really need the plastic outer shell, just the rubber pieces and a new strap which it came with.</li>
            <li> I thought it would never arrive (but that is nothing against the shipping which was great) - I just love the mask so much and my old one was broken and the temporary was just murder on my nose.  This mask fits well and is just miles above others that may look similar.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Decided to try the Quatro Mirage after using the Quatro FX for 6 months. The Mirage seals pretty well and does not creep up into my eyes as bad as the FX. On the down side, the Mirage cuts and bruises my nose bridge. Back using the FX and trying to keep it out of my eyes! The seller was great and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product was exactly what I was looking for. Condition was excellent Would order again in the future if needed</li>
            <li> Far better than Respironics.</li>
            <li> I have been using a nasal mask and moved to this to see if it was better. I love it. It I so much more comfortable and I sleep so much better.</li>
            <li> This works great and fits well. I will continue to use this repeatedly. I would also reccomend it to anyone looking to use it.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here I purchased this mask. It fits me well and has greatly improved the seal and reduced the large leak percentage significantly. I tend to toss and turn so it is still a bit high but the mask works as well as anything could. I wear my hair short and the head gear leaves a ridge in my hair and scalp nearly all day that nothing seems to take away. I wish it had an elastic headgear instead of the non stretch material it is made of. The lines in my face last for a couple hours as well. Even so the improved sleep is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I used to get my masks from our local medical supply store because my insurance covered almost all of the cost, however with the horrible changes to our health care system I have to pay out of pocket for them now. I am so happy that I could find this on Amazon. It was a great price and excellent quality. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was just the mask frame or a complete mask and was happy to see that it is a complete mask! I will defiantly be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> Replaced my original mask with this one works great. No problem setting it up to wear.  Will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one I have at home but can&#x27;t seem to find anymore.  The mask is a little pricey but it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> Not sure I believe this, but my healthcare provider of durable medical equipment says they sell it for $300. This was far less expensive. Be sure to order the head strap that is sold separately. Giving it a try tonight and expect it to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. It is everything it promised to be. I ordered a medium and it fits large so I had to buy another in small. Not super comfortable but what mask is.  I am sleeping better and that is what is important.</li>
            <li> Way better that the previous full face masks I received from my sleep clinic.  It&#x27;s better because the seal holds up better.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I woke up because of a leak.  Even with facial hair, the seal holds.  The swivel for the hose moves fluently so that you don&#x27;t get tangled during your sleep.  Cleaning consists of wiping daily with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li> Was received in a clean sealed bag no issues. No extra charges. Item was just as described fits nice and is quiet.</li>
            <li> Nice product! Wonderfully packaged</li>
            <li> this is about as good as a cpap gets</li>
            <li> Mask fits very comfortable! After trying so many have finally happily settled for the Mirage Quattro Full Face CPAP Mask and can rest comfortably. Delivered new and quickly.  I will purchase from here again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is of high quality and comes with excellent headgear. It has performed very well thus far (3 months).</li>
            <li> fits perfect got it faster than the local store</li>
            <li> Full face mask worked wonderfully,would highly recommend purchasing one through Amazon,extremely reasonably&lt;br /&gt;priced.Very satisified with it!! Fits better than by original which was purchased through my Dr,</li>
            <li> As good as any, better than most. I am a mouth breather so I need the full face mask, and I&#x27;m used to it now. I sleep we&#x27;ll with this, and have very few &amp;#34;incidents&amp;#34; like hose or mask coming off or leaking. The price was VERY reasonable on here for the whole mask, and delivery was as promised. For this reason I buy all my CPAP stuff on Amazon.</li>
            <li> works like my old one, except it isn&#x27;t broken</li>
            <li> Masks are as different as every face. This one is forgiving and fits me better than any other.</li>
            <li> I like the product but I cannot get it to stop leaking.  It does well until about 2-3 o&#x27;clock in the morning when it starts leaking and I cannot stop it. I think I would have to get up, take it off and put it back on to stop the leaks.</li>
            <li> It does not seal very well. After a couple of hours trying . I gave it up.</li>
            <li> Fits like a glove and works just great.</li>
            <li> The product was just what I thought what I was getting.  Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Works great for this price</li>
            <li> One of the best cpap masks you can use. I have tried the comfort gel blue mask but went back to the Quattro for better fit and comfort for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a matter of life or death, and a mask needs to be comfortable, efficient, durable, etc.  This is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Slept great, the first night I used this. I have used the full ultra for two years, and wanted to try something else. Seems to be very well made, with great seal.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my  husband and he says it is the best one he has ever had.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mask at a very attractive price. My local supplier of CPAP supplies will charge my double the price and that is after the insurance payment.</li>
            <li> good product seals nicely comfortable fit but takes about two to three weeks of wearing tto get used to...far better than tha nasal only mask which is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> We got this for my husband because the local medical supply was WAY overcharging us! My husband reports it fits perfect!</li>
            <li> Good mask like it much better than others ive tride</li>
            <li> Same quality as my local medical supply store, only much cheaper.</li>
            <li> the price was great and i got it on time</li>
            <li> This is the full mask. You do not need to purchase the other items like the straps and the cushion for the frame.</li>
            <li> Awesome mask, I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this. Now I can sleep good at night!</li>
            <li> Perfect and so nice to have an extra one.</li>
            <li> Great mask at good price.</li>
            <li> Did not work well at all and apparently NOT Returnable which is BS. It is giving me great pause regarding my purchasing from this vendor and from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed.  Same brand as the one from the medical supply store only cheaper.  Will definitely buy this again.  Great bargain!  Big plus...no prescription required, so no doctor visit to pay for.  Happy, happy!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Very well made and works effectively!</li>
            <li> works as it should, and at a fair price</li>
            <li> Works great for me especially when I have a head cold and a lot of nasal congestion which forces me to be a mouth breather. The nasal pillows are useless at that point</li>
            <li> The original that came with the machine got broken inside my luggage so I learned my lesson.&lt;br /&gt;This replacement fits exactly the same way.</li>
            <li> very disappointed in mask--leaks very easily, my setting is 12, would not recommend at all.&lt;br /&gt;was my first experience with a full face mask..</li>
            <li> I have always bought my CPAP supplies directly from medical supply companies.  I cannot believe how much I saved by purchasing through amazon.  I saved nearly 50%, and since I would have pad to pay out of pocked anyway for my insurance deductible, why not save some money?</li>
            <li> exact same product I originally had, great price and performs well. I would recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> I am on a Bypap  with oxygen fed in.  My pressure is 24.  This is the only mask that works for  me.  All others either blow off or caves in.  I highly recommend this mask for anyone who has high pressure..</li>
            <li> nice mask, works well.</li>
            <li> Having used at least 5 different masks over the years, I have found this particular one to be the most durable and easiest to get a good seal (without adjusting it to deform my face).  The gasket does break down  over time, but this is no different than many of the others.  The system is easy to clean and dissasemble.</li>
            <li> Works great fitts like a glove pretty easy to put together too Cant Live With Out it.Nice To Have a Spare one on hand never know when you will need it</li>
            <li> It cuts into the bridge of my nose, very uncomfortable, and stiff.  I measured according to the directions, no air escapes, but it hurts.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. Good seal. Fits my large nose very well.</li>
            <li> Amazon price - much better than medical supply facilities.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever used. The fit is definitely &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; face, yet it works well despite my chipmunk cheeks.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this.  The head gear is not positioned properly.  It leaft two big knots on my hear.  I worked with it for 3 days and nights.  Now it is back in box.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go for this item, the hose connection elbow leaks like collender. You can&#x27;t be sure if you&#x27;re getting the pressure setting from your CPAP required to keep your airways open. I ditched it.</li>
            <li> Best fit for me. I tried the nose pillows and a mask that only covered the nose. Both did not work well - I&#x27;d wake up making weird sounds from my mouth (scary really). This not only fits my kind of chubby round face but make a pretty fair seal over a pretty thick beard without having to cinch it down tight. The adjustable forehead piece adds a little comfort too.</li>
            <li> Amazing mask fits great</li>
            <li> I thought the design of this mask a little &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34; with all those parts, but upon using it I realize why - the ResMed mask is designed so that the components snap apart instead of breaking under the physical stresses of sleep, such as rolling over on it or pulling the hose when turning or moving.  The ability to disassemble the mask also makes cleaning it easier and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever worn, and the adjustable thingie between the forehead and bridge of the nose works very well for me -- I set the adjustment at the loosest before putting the mask on, and then turn the setting until air leaks stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is about half the pharmacy price in my area, at least.</li>
            <li> This mask was comfortable, and it was easy to put the headgear on it.  I had a few incidents where the strap will come off on one side, or the hose will come out of the headgear, or the clips come loose, but those incidents are not common.</li>
            <li> resmed is the best and it will not be a open package i have seen these sold for 3 times the money on ebay</li>
            <li> just what i needed, fast shipping,thanks so much</li>
            <li> Very comfortable full face mask. It did rub the bridge of my nose raw like many others did.</li>
            <li> Patient reports that the mask fits well and that it seems sturdy. It works with additional products in the sleep system.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit i expected but will be ordering again once i get use it will be fine</li>
            <li> No, it was a full mask.The product was not what I wanted,but I have to use it.</li>
            <li> The ease of ordering this product was very crucial to me.  It is a well-designed mask.  Quick delivery at a good price.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered</li>
            <li> great to be able to get it without getting new prescription, same mask. fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these (style of Resmed) masks for 8 years, have been very reliable.</li>
            <li> Third type of resmed mask I have tried and by far the best.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Narrow at the bridge and caused a sore on the side of my nose.</li>
            <li> After using an Ultra Mirage (UM) mask for 6 years, I decided to try this Quattro mask of the same size based on a reviewer&#x27;s statement that is was more current and better than the Ultra Mirage mask. Boy, was I disappointed! It appears to be made much cheaper than the UM mask, as the connector between the lower part and the top is very thin plastic that will probably break easily, and it uses loops to connect the headgear at the top instead of clips used on the UM. It hurts the bridge of my nose, and it leaks very easy. After using it for 3 nights, I switched back to my old UM, and ordered a new cushion for it. I now see why the Quattro is $30 cheaper than the Ultra Mirage!!!</li>
            <li> As expected.  Average price.</li>
            <li> Very happy with price &amp; shipping. Product as described.</li>
            <li> Quick, reasonably priced. good quality</li>
            <li> I wondered because it was so cheap and different from what I was using but after using it for some time it has been great.  The seal works better than my old style.  I did have to heat and close the gap on the face strap but no problem since.</li>
            <li> I am using this product every night for my  good night sleep. it is very comfortable and I don&#x27;t feel there is a mask.</li>
            <li> ResMed is my favorite product for my CPAP. I have tried a couple other designs but I find the Mirage Quattro to be the best fit for me personally.</li>
