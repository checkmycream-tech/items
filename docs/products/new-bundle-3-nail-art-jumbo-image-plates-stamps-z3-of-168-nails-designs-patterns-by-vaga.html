            <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Cleans up very nicely with pure acetone.</li>
            <li>two of which are entirely full nail designs which are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice images crisp, just as seller described, was delivered on time.</li>

            <li>Great value for the price, I cannot wait for the next jumbo plates!</li>

            <li>Be sure to use an old gift card instead of a metal scraper to keep the plates nice and scratch-free.</li>
            <li>love most of the images, some dont work nearly as well as others</li>
            <li>I love the large plates.</li>
            <li>I have tried all of them and really can&#x27;t pick out my favorite one.</li>
            <li>I give 3 stars only because I do love cheekys other stamping plates like the Happy Nails plate and the princess collection plates!</li>
            <li>The designs are really pretty and easy to transfer to the stamper.</li>
            <li>The images come out so crisp and sharp, and the details on these images are incredible.</li>
            <li>The full nail plates are nice because they have a curved edge on the bottom which allows them to be used as either a full nail plate or a french tip plate.  </li>
            <li>The designs are fun, super detailed and I love that they include French tip on the bottom and full nail design on the rest.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use enough words to say how amazing these plates are.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re nails are not wide/long - I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find these useful.</li>
            <li>but worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I think this would be especially useful for the big toes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these nail art images because they are not childish.</li>
            <li>Oh and the seller shipped the plates super fast too!</li>
            <li>these were the price of only 2 plates, because they probabley couldnt give away plate A for free!</li>
            <li>Words aren&#x27;t enough to describe my love for them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>, I am thinking about buying more of them when I get paid next month.</li>
            <li>I am able to get crisp images transferred (but it does take a lot of practice to learn proper stamping technique - and a lot of online tutorial videos).</li>
            <li>There is  no way you will get the whole design on your nail.</li>
            <li>The plates all appear to stamp really well.  </li>
            <li>How much I have played with these plates??</li>
            <li>The Cheeky plates will cover most nails, although if your nails are really long, you have to get a little creative about covering the whole nail.</li>
            <li>The images are very big, much bigger than the full nail images on a Konad plate which allows them to be used for both the full and tip.  </li>
            <li>you can live with!</li>
            <li>Creates clear and sharp images on most of the designs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The full nail images are huge, they may be big enough for my big toe.</li>
            <li>Has both left and right designs.</li>
            <li>so the images on the right hand will mirror the images on the left, or however you want to do it.</li>
            <li>I really like the large format and wish they could be just a tad larger..</li>
            <li>this new price 24.99, I&#x27;d think twice about buying, but I think I would still buy if I had the money to</li>
            <li>the images all come out crisp and clear and clean and they are all big enough to cover my entire nail including my thumbs : ) hard to do with most other plates.</li>
            <li>Plates each come with an amazing hard back cover.</li>
            <li>Otherwise all the images came out clear and solid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend using an old ID or credit card instead of a metal scraper, though, to avoid scratching the plates.</li>
            <li>The designs actually cover my whole nail - unlike Konad or Bundle Monster plates.</li>
            <li>Although, some designs are so big that detail gets lost on the nail if you don&#x27;t have super long or wide nails, but I&#x27;d rather full coverage than having to double stamp.</li>
            <li>The images are all very pretty, I would recommend this set over any other set of image plates so far (I only have RA, cheeky and konad plates so far).</li>
            <li>the non-full nail images I like how there are a large and a small image (I used the small one on  my pinky, ring and pointer finger, and the large one for my thumb and middle finger) on top of that they have mirror images</li>
            <li>The image area is large enough for my big toes.</li>

            <li> Also, I bought it for the other two plates anyway, but it seemed kind of weird that one of the plates is all the same pattern in different sizes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The images are big enough for even long nails/nail beds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have long nails</li>
            <li> I would definitely consider buying this set or any of the other jumbo plates they sell.  </li>
            <li> all in all tho, not too too bad, like i said :)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you should watch the price on these, they were discounted another 10 bucks the day after I purchased these and they will not refund any of the difference even though it had only been six hours, so just wait until the price is somewhere</li>
            <li> I used Sally Hansen quick dry Black Star with a graphic print and there was a bit of gap in the middle of the thick lines on one nail, but I probably put the scraper at the wrong angle on that one.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase something other than konad</li>
            <li> only complaint about these is when I&#x27;m removing the polish, I usually end up getting little bits of the cotton ball stuck.</li>
            <li> There was a little learning curve for me..</li>
            <li> A little practice</li>
            <li> I like the less detailed because it lets the base color of your nail color show through and see the design from a distance.</li>
            <li> If you have small nails I would not recommend these plates.</li>
            <li> Not that big a deal, but a little annoying.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of products from cheeky and I have yet to be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Plate A has the worst designs on it, I think there is possibly maybe 2 that i would even use :(</li>
            <li> not too too bad.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> Plate A has the worst designs on it, I think there is possibly maybe 2 that i would even use :( practically every design on plate A is the same!!! No wonder these were the price of only 2 plates, because they probabley couldnt give away plate A for free! I give 3 stars only because I do love cheekys other stamping plates like the Happy Nails plate and the princess collection plates!</li>
            <li> So many designs.  So many patterns.  I have tried all of them and really can&#x27;t pick out my favorite one.</li>
            <li> I am super pleased, good price, prompt shipping and it arrived early! Good images, I&#x27;m using them again and again. Cheeky are my favourite nail stamping brand!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for my next set!! There was a little learning curve for me.. A little practice and I got the hang of it in no time.. I really like the large format and wish they could be just a tad larger..</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase something other than konad but when I read the reviews I thought I would take a chance. I love the large plates. I have purchased several of them. I like the less detailed because it lets the base color of your nail color show through and see the design from a distance.</li>
            <li> Creates clear and sharp images on most of the designs. Has both left and right designs. I really enjoy doing my nails now.</li>
            <li> not too too bad. love most of the images, some dont work nearly as well as others tho. and i honeslty dont even use one of the image plates. all in all tho, not too too bad, like i said :)</li>
            <li> FYI - the cheeky jumbo plates are just that. JUMBO! If you have small nails I would not recommend these plates. There are ways, if you are an experienced stamper, to shrink the image. If you&#x27;re nails are not wide/long - I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find these useful. There is  no way you will get the whole design on your nail. If you don&#x27;t care about that, then by all means. The designs are fun, super detailed and I love that they include French tip on the bottom and full nail design on the rest.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use enough words to say how amazing these plates are. Words aren&#x27;t enough to describe my love for them.&lt;br /&gt;I got mine for the \\&quot;real\\&quot; intro price ($19.99)! The best plates I think I&#x27;ve invested in, and I have konad, BM, RA and some fauxnads! The images are big enough for even long nails/nail beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included some pictures on the product image. I compared these designs (size) with BM, RA and Konad.&lt;br /&gt;At this new price 24.99, I&#x27;d think twice about buying, but I think I would still buy if I had the money to spend.&lt;br /&gt;SO if you have the money, I say BUY IT.. you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Images transfer well, and once again, they are huge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plates each come with an amazing hard back cover. Prevents from cuts, and supports the plates well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have an in depth review of these plates on my blog. doityourselflady dot blogspot dot com&lt;br /&gt;Search for Cheeky XL plate.</li>
            <li> i love this set! it has three plates full of great designs! two of which are entirely full nail designs which are my favorite. the images all come out crisp and clear and clean and they are all big enough to cover my entire nail including my thumbs : ) hard to do with most other plates. some work better with a metal scraper and some better with a plastic so its a trial and error thing but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of products from cheeky and I have yet to be disappointed! The XL image plates have exceeded my expectations. The images come out so crisp and sharp, and the details on these images are incredible. I used both Konad and non-konad polishes and the images turned out great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the non-full nail images I like how there are a large and a small image (I used the small one on  my pinky, ring and pointer finger, and the large one for my thumb and middle finger) on top of that they have mirror images so the images on the right hand will mirror the images on the left, or however you want to do it. I think this would be especially useful for the big toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full nail images are huge, they may be big enough for my big toe. The images are all very pretty, I would recommend this set over any other set of image plates so far (I only have RA, cheeky and konad plates so far). Oh and the seller shipped the plates super fast too!</li>
            <li> I love the xl plates, these have fantastic designs, and best of all, they cover my thumbs! ;) Although, some designs are so big that detail gets lost on the nail if you don&#x27;t have super long or wide nails, but I&#x27;d rather full coverage than having to double stamp. Great value for the price, I cannot wait for the next jumbo plates!</li>
            <li> I love this set of three plates.  The full nail plates are nice because they have a curved edge on the bottom which allows them to be used as either a full nail plate or a french tip plate.  The images are very big, much bigger than the full nail images on a Konad plate which allows them to be used for both the full and tip.  They are backed with a blue plastic.  I thought they would be sturdier, but with care there should be no problems.  The plates all appear to stamp really well.  I haven&#x27;t tested a lot of them, but from what I can tell they&#x27;re perfect.  I would definitely consider buying this set or any of the other jumbo plates they sell.  My only complaint is that you should watch the price on these, they were discounted another 10 bucks the day after I purchased these and they will not refund any of the difference even though it had only been six hours, so just wait until the price is somewhere you can live with!</li>
            <li> I love these nail art images because they are not childish.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about stamping your nails, these are for you. I recommend using an old ID or credit card instead of a metal scraper, though, to avoid scratching the plates. The Cheeky plates will cover most nails, although if your nails are really long, you have to get a little creative about covering the whole nail.</li>
            <li> How much I have played with these plates?? Let me count the ways. I love them. The designs are really pretty and easy to transfer to the stamper. I have ordered more plates, can&#x27;t wait to get those!</li>
            <li> Bought the plates, used them day one and haven&#x27;t stopped using them. The image area is large enough for my big toes. I LOVE them, I am thinking about buying more of them when I get paid next month. Wishing they would make different plates.......</li>
            <li> These plates are full of great designs, looking forward to ordering more. Be sure to use an old gift card instead of a metal scraper to keep the plates nice and scratch-free. Cleans up very nicely with pure acetone.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the reviews that influenced me to buy these. The designs actually cover my whole nail - unlike Konad or Bundle Monster plates. I am able to get crisp images transferred (but it does take a lot of practice to learn proper stamping technique - and a lot of online tutorial videos). I used Sally Hansen quick dry Black Star with a graphic print and there was a bit of gap in the middle of the thick lines on one nail, but I probably put the scraper at the wrong angle on that one.

            <li> Cheeky Plates are awesome!! I recommend them to anyone who is looking for nice looking nails. Have not had time to play with all my plates because of work, but will try them as soon as I have some time!! Thank You Cheeky! Your plates are awesome!! :D</li>
            <li> Nice images crisp, just as seller described, was delivered on time. So many images on plate and they fit my nails, I have long nails and I am satisfied.</li>
