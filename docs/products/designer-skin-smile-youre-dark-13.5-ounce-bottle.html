            <li>I have never used this lotion, I used it yesterday and liked the results.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a nice, even tan and there is never a hint of orange or off coloring after usage.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent</li>
            <li>and I have been really nice color since I started using it.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells nice and seems to do an alright job.  </li>
            <li>if you want a nice brown color and not orange</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who is new to tanning, who is on a budget, fair skinned or for someone who is just looking for a good lotion that will give you great results.</li>
            <li>I tan very easily and never burn.</li>

            <li>You&#x27;re, very satisfied thanks for the great deal and getting it to us on time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, fresh smelling lotion as well.</li>
            <li>It smells great, makes my skin soft, and gives your skin an amazing glow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions, and as far as the inexpensive ones go, this is the one I think works the best.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, though my boyfriend mentioned it smelled like I bathed in cheap perfume, it wasn&#x27;t runny and you sure can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li>Smells great and really does intensify my tan!</li>
            <li>it was very cheap.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent, not too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a cocoa butter scent fan and with this one, it&#x27;s more flowery and floral.</li>
            <li>Be sure to cover yourself well unless you want streaks.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly better than using nothing at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>this my favorite tanning lotion ever .</li>
            <li>The smell is better when you get OUT of the bed than while youre putting it on.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love the moisture you get from this lotion.</li>
            <li>It gave ok light color and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I also love that this lotion doesn&#x27;t give you that orange look that</li>
            <li>I know most people think it has filers</li>
            <li>I love the sun.  </li>
            <li>Need to order more now.</li>
            <li>and I was expecting much more out of this lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell was also ok, but i prefer a more coconut / fruity smell.</li>
            <li>Such an awesome product for the price.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok and it does the job.</li>
            <li>Works okay, but my bottle I ordered in May 2015 had expired in Feb 2015, so maybe that has something to do with it.</li>
            <li>Also, the beds at my gym suck and that is where I used it the most.</li>
            <li>I saw the most improvement in my color while using this product in a level 1 bed at Darque Tan.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before, years ago, and it&#x27;s my favorite tanning lotion because you can use it in a tanning bed and at the beach --</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell of coconut and burnt flesh as most others do.</li>
            <li>But, the top has visibly been removed (up on one side) than placed on again.</li>
            <li>LOVE This</li>
            <li>love that this lotion doesn&#x27;t have a color</li>
            <li>But overall, this really is a great product with an even better price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try Smile Your Darker!!</li>
            <li>Came very quick and I will order more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Provides super intense hydration (love hoe great</li>
            <li>Works very good, on my second bottle.</li>
            <li>Amazing how they mark this product up to about quadruple its worth at the salons.</li>
            <li>excellent item as expected</li>
            <li>Smells great and adds a natural looking amount of color</li>
            <li>Spend more money and get something worth your while. :)</li>
            <li>I do tan easily</li>
            <li>however I think the smell is too strong</li>
            <li>I used this stuff last summer and it worked GREAT.</li>
            <li>Also it is a fabulous moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have been a fan of australian gold for quite some time, but am happily switching to this from now</li>
            <li>but I was glad to find this one just like the one I purchased for a much higher price at the tanning salon</li>
            <li>/&gt;Designer Skin Smile!</li>
            <li>I hope I will love it as much with continued use!</li>
            <li>This stuff is better than all the expensive stuff, I love the smell and the color it gives me is great!!</li>
            <li>and I had to try it with one of the most reasonably priced lotions on amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many tanning lotions and really like this one.</li>
            <li>The smell is really quite lovely on this lotion...</li>
            <li>Intensifiers are the best type of lotion as far as what is going to help you tan, and give you the longest lasting streak-free tan that is actually your own</li>
            <li>Brand new!!!!</li>
            <li>I am smiling and I am dark, so in that respect, this is a win.</li>
            <li>Got me very tan!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already pretty tan, so I can&#x27;t really tell how effective this lotion is, but I can tell you it is very moisturizing (which helps tanning,) without being overly greasy like Tao (also by Designer Skin.)  </li>
            <li>I feel this is a great lotion and tans very dark..............  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m buying Smile</li>
            <li>you dont  swet that much its thick and smells great !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Smile</li>
            <li>, this is BY FAR MY FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>I saw Smile</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the smile</li>
            <li>it gives you a nice tan rather than being too orange or red after using a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I discovered Smile</li>
            <li>If you are new to buying tanning lotion, this is a great indoor/ outdoor lotion that will not instantly burn you the first time you tan.</li>
            <li>so I appreciate the slight amount of bronzer, but this lotion is super effective and its good if you have to go out after tanning since it smells perfumey and doesn&#x27;t feel gross.</li>
            <li>Still a huge fan and you can&#x27;t beat the price considering a decent bottle of lotion will run you about $60.</li>
            <li>Either way, you can get this for about the same price as Millenium Tanning&#x27;s Black Storm, and Designer Skin is supposed to be the best, so I suppose I&#x27;d rather put the money on this, but I want to get darker, and I just don&#x27;t think this is the way.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have not used it enough to truly determine how well it works, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Smile your dark works great and gives a nice dark and natural tan.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today and I can see a noticeable difference already.</li>
            <li>Gave me color fast!</li>
            <li>I have bought this product several times &amp; absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Why should you pay more at the salon when you can get it cheaper at Amazon &amp; achieve the same results!</li>
            <li>But really, I think its personal preference, I have smelled better lotions</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and actually covered up the tanned skin smell that I&#x27;m usually forced to deal with.  </li>
            <li>This is an accelerator, which is better in the long run.</li>
            <li>It would probably be ok for someone just starting to tan but not a serious tanner.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong compared to other products I have used, but for the price how can I complain?</li>
            <li>I sweat it off in certain places that get hotter.</li>
            <li>Get deep tanning results quickly!</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really expect that to happen.</li>
            <li>You can go straight to dinner after tanning with this product because it has a perfume fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I actually really like it</li>
            <li>Fast delivery as always with this seller.  </li>
            <li>I guess if I really want to break through my tanning plateau</li>
            <li>really wanted to use it and after one use i broke out in hives</li>
            <li>and I wouldnt recommend it for someone who wants to have the darkest tan.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product for beginners!</li>
            <li>Thanks for wasting my money bargain tan.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is not too thick.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it felt great on, not super thick like previous lotions I have used.</li>
            <li>Since I do not burn easily, basically I don&#x27;t burn at all, I can put this on and be out in the sun for as long as I want if need be.</li>
            <li>but I have used many other products and they didn&#x27;t even work this well.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference within the first couple uses, and, so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any sort of plateau.  </li>
            <li>I already have a decent tan from another lotion, but it seemed to have stopped working (in regard to getting any darker).  </li>
            <li>This is the way to go if you want to avoid the high cost of tanning lotion in the salon.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly and will probably re-up when I run out.</li>
            <li>I can see why people dont like the smell, I like it because I think it smells fresh and clean with a little fruity in it.</li>
            <li>My sister on the other hand doesn&#x27;t tan as easily and will burn.</li>
            <li>I used to work for a tanning salon, and this is what I recommended for anybody who was just starting out, or wasn&#x27;t willing to spend a whole lot on lotion (understandable).</li>
            <li>So, I have literally tried over a 100 different lotions of various brands, types, and included ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bronzers easily streak, and the ones that don&#x27;t make you look orangish, come off as soon as you take a shower.</li>
            <li>This is what I used when I first got back into tanning.</li>
            <li>This time however the lotion did not seem to have the same effect as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super white if I don&#x27;t tan but using this stuff last summer</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance that I think smells a little floral, but the website says honey.</li>
            <li>The bottle is super cute and suckers you in, but you don&#x27;t really get the results you do with other lotions from the same company.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy, stay clear as it smells quite feminine.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear and isn&#x27;t too oily.....</li>
            <li>So this is one of my least favorite designer skin lotions I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>The natural bronzers in this lotion allow you to go shades darker, beyond what the UV rays will do alone.</li>
            <li>I can tell you I see really fast results when using Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell, but it makes me peel and leaves a blotchy appearance on my shoulders and back.  </li>
            <li>That could be from me being sensitive to tingle lotions</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allergic to the product, but I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I used to work at a tanning salon that carried all the top brand names: Australian Gold, Swedish Beauty, Designer Skin, California Tan, just to name a few.</li>
            <li>After going to the tanning bed 3 times, I already have an excellent base tan.</li>
            <li>(it is definitely a UNISEX fragrance), helps you build and maintain that deep dark glow everyone is going for, and the BEST PART is that it is extremely inexpensive when compared to other lotions I have tried that do actually work as well; but cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $120 for 9.5 oz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to shell out a little extra cash for better beds when I tan, or shell out extra cash for the trifecta;</li>
            <li>I could see a difference in my skin tone within 3-4 times of using it and left me with a very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>:) I had my doubts because of a few other reviews I had read, but I decided to try it anyway</li>
            <li>I got pretty dark.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I was shopping around before I spent that much once again.</li>
            <li>FOR SURE smelled worse lotions.</li>
            <li>The only unfortunate part about this lotion is that it comes off pretty easily inside the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>The salon I tan at stopped carrying this because they got tons of new and more expensive stuff in</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth, but it took a few minutes to get to being soft, it was a little tacky for a little bit after I got out of the tanning salon, which is kinda normal</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have never used this lotion, I used it yesterday and liked the results.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a nice, even tan and there is never a hint of orange or off coloring after usage.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent</li>
            <li> and I have been really nice color since I started using it.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells nice and seems to do an alright job.  </li>

            <li> I recommend this to anyone who is new to tanning, who is on a budget, fair skinned or for someone who is just looking for a good lotion that will give you great results.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;re, very satisfied thanks for the great deal and getting it to us on time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, fresh smelling lotion as well.</li>
            <li> It smells great, makes my skin soft, and gives your skin an amazing glow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions, and as far as the inexpensive ones go, this is the one I think works the best.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, though my boyfriend mentioned it smelled like I bathed in cheap perfume, it wasn&#x27;t runny and you sure can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and really does intensify my tan!</li>
            <li> it was very cheap.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent, not too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a cocoa butter scent fan and with this one, it&#x27;s more flowery and floral.</li>
            <li> Be sure to cover yourself well unless you want streaks.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly better than using nothing at all.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> this my favorite tanning lotion ever .</li>
            <li> The smell is better when you get OUT of the bed than while youre putting it on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love the moisture you get from this lotion.</li>
            <li> It gave ok light color and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I also love that this lotion doesn&#x27;t give you that orange look that</li>
            <li> I know most people think it has filers</li>
            <li> I love the sun.  </li>
            <li> Need to order more now.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting much more out of this lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell was also ok, but i prefer a more coconut / fruity smell.</li>
            <li> Such an awesome product for the price.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but my bottle I ordered in May 2015 had expired in Feb 2015, so maybe that has something to do with it.</li>
            <li> Also, the beds at my gym suck and that is where I used it the most.</li>
            <li> I saw the most improvement in my color while using this product in a level 1 bed at Darque Tan.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before, years ago, and it&#x27;s my favorite tanning lotion because you can use it in a tanning bed and at the beach --</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell of coconut and burnt flesh as most others do.</li>
            <li> But, the top has visibly been removed (up on one side) than placed on again.</li>
            <li> LOVE This</li>
            <li> love that this lotion doesn&#x27;t have a color</li>
            <li> But overall, this really is a great product with an even better price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try Smile Your Darker!!</li>
            <li> Came very quick and I will order more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Provides super intense hydration (love hoe great</li>
            <li> Works very good, on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Amazing how they mark this product up to about quadruple its worth at the salons.</li>
            <li> excellent item as expected</li>
            <li> Smells great and adds a natural looking amount of color</li>
            <li> Spend more money and get something worth your while. :)</li>
            <li> I do tan easily</li>
            <li> however I think the smell is too strong</li>
            <li> I used this stuff last summer and it worked GREAT.</li>
            <li> Also it is a fabulous moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have been a fan of australian gold for quite some time, but am happily switching to this from now</li>
            <li> but I was glad to find this one just like the one I purchased for a much higher price at the tanning salon</li>
            <li> /&gt;Designer Skin Smile!</li>
            <li> I hope I will love it as much with continued use!</li>
            <li> This stuff is better than all the expensive stuff, I love the smell and the color it gives me is great!!</li>
            <li> and I had to try it with one of the most reasonably priced lotions on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many tanning lotions and really like this one.</li>
            <li> The smell is really quite lovely on this lotion...</li>
            <li> Intensifiers are the best type of lotion as far as what is going to help you tan, and give you the longest lasting streak-free tan that is actually your own</li>
            <li> Brand new!!!!</li>
            <li> I am smiling and I am dark, so in that respect, this is a win.</li>
            <li> Got me very tan!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already pretty tan, so I can&#x27;t really tell how effective this lotion is, but I can tell you it is very moisturizing (which helps tanning,) without being overly greasy like Tao (also by Designer Skin.)  </li>
            <li> I feel this is a great lotion and tans very dark..............  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m buying Smile</li>
            <li> you dont  swet that much its thick and smells great !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Smile</li>
            <li> , this is BY FAR MY FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> I saw Smile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the smile</li>
            <li> it gives you a nice tan rather than being too orange or red after using a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I discovered Smile</li>
            <li> If you are new to buying tanning lotion, this is a great indoor/ outdoor lotion that will not instantly burn you the first time you tan.</li>
            <li> so I appreciate the slight amount of bronzer, but this lotion is super effective and its good if you have to go out after tanning since it smells perfumey and doesn&#x27;t feel gross.</li>
            <li> Still a huge fan and you can&#x27;t beat the price considering a decent bottle of lotion will run you about $60.</li>
            <li> Either way, you can get this for about the same price as Millenium Tanning&#x27;s Black Storm, and Designer Skin is supposed to be the best, so I suppose I&#x27;d rather put the money on this, but I want to get darker, and I just don&#x27;t think this is the way.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have not used it enough to truly determine how well it works, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Smile your dark works great and gives a nice dark and natural tan.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today and I can see a noticeable difference already.</li>
            <li> Gave me color fast!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times &amp; absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Why should you pay more at the salon when you can get it cheaper at Amazon &amp; achieve the same results!</li>
            <li> But really, I think its personal preference, I have smelled better lotions</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and actually covered up the tanned skin smell that I&#x27;m usually forced to deal with.  </li>
            <li> This is an accelerator, which is better in the long run.</li>
            <li> It would probably be ok for someone just starting to tan but not a serious tanner.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong compared to other products I have used, but for the price how can I complain?</li>
            <li> I sweat it off in certain places that get hotter.</li>
            <li> Get deep tanning results quickly!</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really expect that to happen.</li>
            <li> You can go straight to dinner after tanning with this product because it has a perfume fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I actually really like it</li>
            <li> Fast delivery as always with this seller.  </li>
            <li> I guess if I really want to break through my tanning plateau</li>
            <li> really wanted to use it and after one use i broke out in hives</li>
            <li> and I wouldnt recommend it for someone who wants to have the darkest tan.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product for beginners!</li>
            <li> Thanks for wasting my money bargain tan.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is not too thick.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it felt great on, not super thick like previous lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> Since I do not burn easily, basically I don&#x27;t burn at all, I can put this on and be out in the sun for as long as I want if need be.</li>
            <li> but I have used many other products and they didn&#x27;t even work this well.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference within the first couple uses, and, so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any sort of plateau.  </li>
            <li> I already have a decent tan from another lotion, but it seemed to have stopped working (in regard to getting any darker).  </li>
            <li> This is the way to go if you want to avoid the high cost of tanning lotion in the salon.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly and will probably re-up when I run out.</li>
            <li> I can see why people dont like the smell, I like it because I think it smells fresh and clean with a little fruity in it.</li>
            <li> My sister on the other hand doesn&#x27;t tan as easily and will burn.</li>
            <li> I used to work for a tanning salon, and this is what I recommended for anybody who was just starting out, or wasn&#x27;t willing to spend a whole lot on lotion (understandable).</li>
            <li> So, I have literally tried over a 100 different lotions of various brands, types, and included ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bronzers easily streak, and the ones that don&#x27;t make you look orangish, come off as soon as you take a shower.</li>
            <li> This is what I used when I first got back into tanning.</li>
            <li> This time however the lotion did not seem to have the same effect as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super white if I don&#x27;t tan but using this stuff last summer</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance that I think smells a little floral, but the website says honey.</li>
            <li> The bottle is super cute and suckers you in, but you don&#x27;t really get the results you do with other lotions from the same company.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy, stay clear as it smells quite feminine.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear and isn&#x27;t too oily.....</li>
            <li> So this is one of my least favorite designer skin lotions I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The natural bronzers in this lotion allow you to go shades darker, beyond what the UV rays will do alone.</li>
            <li> I can tell you I see really fast results when using Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell, but it makes me peel and leaves a blotchy appearance on my shoulders and back.  </li>
            <li> That could be from me being sensitive to tingle lotions</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allergic to the product, but I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I used to work at a tanning salon that carried all the top brand names: Australian Gold, Swedish Beauty, Designer Skin, California Tan, just to name a few.</li>
            <li> After going to the tanning bed 3 times, I already have an excellent base tan.</li>
            <li> (it is definitely a UNISEX fragrance), helps you build and maintain that deep dark glow everyone is going for, and the BEST PART is that it is extremely inexpensive when compared to other lotions I have tried that do actually work as well; but cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $120 for 9.5 oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to shell out a little extra cash for better beds when I tan, or shell out extra cash for the trifecta;</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in my skin tone within 3-4 times of using it and left me with a very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> :) I had my doubts because of a few other reviews I had read, but I decided to try it anyway</li>
            <li> I got pretty dark.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was shopping around before I spent that much once again.</li>
            <li> FOR SURE smelled worse lotions.</li>
            <li> The only unfortunate part about this lotion is that it comes off pretty easily inside the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> The salon I tan at stopped carrying this because they got tons of new and more expensive stuff in</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth, but it took a few minutes to get to being soft, it was a little tacky for a little bit after I got out of the tanning salon, which is kinda normal</li>
            <li> They have mixed a little tanning lotion with a lot of normal store-bought lotion.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I tried this lotion with the pink lettering saying &amp;#34;smile, you&#x27;re darker.&amp;#34; I decided to try this one due to my high success with their other bottle</li>
            <li> It came before the expected date, and is just as good as the expensive indoor tanning lotions at half the price.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used this in the past and this was not the real thing.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only tried Pink Diamond by Swedish Beauty and Bombshell,)</li>
            <li> Not greasy and definitely doesn&#x27;t stain like other lotions.  </li>
            <li> and I cautioned her to only lay out in the sun for 15 minutes or so on each side due to the fact that this lotion will cause you to tan a lot faster</li>
            <li> 60X Extreme Silicone Bronzer I was using and wanted to try something similar in style and price point.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was just a defect but hope it gets fixed.</li>
            <li> Half the price for the same thing as the tan salon&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the bottle has lasted me a long time.  </li>
            <li> The bottle with pink lettering smelt like vacation in a bottle.</li>
            <li> It took 5 days (partially during the weekend) to get from California to Maine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and have no noticeable change in color yet.</li>
            <li> so be careful before buying this product.</li>
            <li> Good if your starting to tan to get a base tan!</li>
            <li> If I had to complain at all, it would be minimal due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be smiling once I&#x27;m dark!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I actually like it for tanning or not...</li>
            <li> and I am pasty white skin color that usually burns then peels</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel as greasy afterwards like other lotions.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re Dark online because nothing else that I have used has worked this well.</li>
            <li> Not as dark of a bronzer as others I&#x27;ve tried, but it works about average.</li>
            <li> It gives you lots of color &amp; bronzes your skin to give you a dark, even tan.</li>
            <li> It gives me a dark tan while protecting my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super dark yet</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed with the packaging quality, when I received it the box was open at both ends and was all kinds of damaged.</li>
            <li> Black, Luminary, or Obsidian by Designer Skin, or maybe even both.  </li>
            <li> it was not was it said a self tanner that i had purchased previously from a tanning salon, where it worked well...</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion because I ran out of the Black Storm</li>
            <li> You’re Dark!</li>
            <li> Less than half the price of a salon cost!</li>
            <li> other than that small issue</li>
            <li> Also every time I used it I would get little bumps on my arms, stomach and legs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan too often, but I bought this a few years ago in a tanning salon and it was a little over $40.</li>
            <li> Hope It Works For Other People Like For Me!!</li>
            <li> All in all, I like this lotion and depending on how my skin looks after a few days of tanning</li>
            <li> I hate the smell, but makes skin smooth.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I got tired of the smell after awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this happens with all lotions or not, but I usually have to wipe the residue off the glass after each tanning session.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that effected the way the product worked.</li>
            <li> If I had to guess, plain body lotion was used in this bottle!  </li>
            <li> I have been tanning for at least 10 years</li>
            <li> I purchased multiple bottles of tanning lotion, and this is by far the worst yet!  </li>
            <li> MEAN COME ON...</li>
            <li> Previously, I was using a different tanning lotion which I purchased at the salon for an outrageous price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d sooner get secret rapture</li>
            <li> IS IT EVEN A DIFFICULT DECISION?</li>
            <li> This is definitely a fake!  </li>
            <li> This clogged my pores causing painful cystic acne in places where my clothing applied pressure.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I already had my base tan and had got to the point where I wasnt getting any darker.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell</li>
            <li> Horrible that these people get away with this!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I am very satisfied with my product. I even received it earlier than suspected.</li>
            <li> Great price and good quality.  The tanning store told me about products that had been mixed with things - probably just hype but I was glad to find this one just like the one I purchased for a much higher price at the tanning salon</li>
            <li> I have never used this lotion, I used it yesterday and liked the results.  I did not have to use a ton to cover my body, it flowed on with a pleasant  smell and great coverage..  I feel this is a great lotion and tans very dark..............  Dale</li>
            <li> A few years ago I tried this lotion with the pink lettering saying &amp;#34;smile, you&#x27;re darker.&amp;#34; I decided to try this one due to my high success with their other bottle and I can honestly say I&#x27;m still very pleased and happy with the results. If I had to complain at all, it would be minimal due to the smell. I&#x27;m more of a cocoa butter scent fan and with this one, it&#x27;s more flowery and floral. The bottle with pink lettering smelt like vacation in a bottle. Still a huge fan and you can&#x27;t beat the price considering a decent bottle of lotion will run you about $60. I recommend this to anyone who is new to tanning, who is on a budget, fair skinned or for someone who is just looking for a good lotion that will give you great results. Try this one out, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> Great for tanning. Be sure to cover yourself well unless you want streaks.</li>
            <li> So this is one of my least favorite designer skin lotions I&#x27;ve purchased. I would give it a 2.5 out of 5.  The bottle is super cute and suckers you in, but you don&#x27;t really get the results you do with other lotions from the same company.  I&#x27;d sooner get secret rapture</li>
            <li> I used this stuff last summer and it worked GREAT. I&#x27;m super white if I don&#x27;t tan but using this stuff last summer I got pretty dark. The salon I tan at stopped carrying this because they got tons of new and more expensive stuff in so I&#x27;m buying Smile You&#x27;re Dark online because nothing else that I have used has worked this well.</li>
            <li> The lotion made me tan however I think the smell is too strong and sometimes I would feel as though I was allergic to it because it would make me itch and left a rash on my arm. It could just be me though.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Works great and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today and I can see a noticeable difference already. It&#x27;s certainly better than using nothing at all. I&#x27;m not super dark yet but I can&#x27;t really expect that to happen. It makes my skin feel really smooth and nice. I don&#x27;t think that the scent is over powering- it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> this my favorite tanning lotion ever . you dont  swet that much its thick and smells great ! best lotion ever</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong compared to other products I have used, but for the price how can I complain? Cheaper than at the salon and did its job.</li>
            <li> Best smelling tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy, stay clear as it smells quite feminine. Not as dark of a bronzer as others I&#x27;ve tried, but it works about average.</li>
            <li> Very good all around indoor tanning lotion. Nice scent, not too strong. Good for men! Get deep tanning results quickly!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion has the best smell out of any of the products I have tried.  You can go straight to dinner after tanning with this product because it has a perfume fragrance.  Also it is a fabulous moisturizer.  I can&#x27;t wait to try Smile Your Darker!!</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle and noticed the experation date on the bottom.02-2015. Todays date...05-13-2015. Don&#x27;t know if that makes any differance in the performance of the lotion, but I&#x27;m not too happy.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion today and I tried it. I actually really like it :) I had my doubts because of a few other reviews I had read, but I decided to try it anyway just incase I may like it. I am for sure alot darker! My skin is very smooth, but it took a few minutes to get to being soft, it was a little tacky for a little bit after I got out of the tanning salon, which is kinda normal so thats no problem with me. The smell is better when you get OUT of the bed than while youre putting it on. I can see why people dont like the smell, I like it because I think it smells fresh and clean with a little fruity in it. But really, I think its personal preference, I have smelled better lotions and I have FOR SURE smelled worse lotions. The seller was AWESOME! It took 5 days (partially during the weekend) to get from California to Maine. :D I got it before the estimated time of arrival. :D All in all, I like this lotion and depending on how my skin looks after a few days of tanning I might buy it again.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell, but makes skin smooth. Not sure if I actually like it for tanning or not...I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and have no noticeable change in color yet.</li>
            <li> Fantastic beginner lotion at a great price.</li>
            <li> Half the price for the same thing as the tan salon&lt;br /&gt;Designer Skin Smile! You&#x27;re, very satisfied thanks for the great deal and getting it to us on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Smile You&#x27;re Dark!\\&quot; tanning lotion for years! I absolutely love love love the moisture you get from this lotion. It&#x27;s a great, fresh smelling lotion as well. The natural bronzers in this lotion allow you to go shades darker, beyond what the UV rays will do alone. The only unfortunate part about this lotion is that it comes off pretty easily inside the tanning bed. I sweat it off in certain places that get hotter. I&#x27;m not sure if this happens with all lotions or not, but I usually have to wipe the residue off the glass after each tanning session. But overall, this really is a great product with an even better price!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion ever! It smells great, makes my skin soft, and gives your skin an amazing glow! If you are new to buying tanning lotion, this is a great indoor/ outdoor lotion that will not instantly burn you the first time you tan. I recommend this product to all of my friends when they ask me what to use!</li>
            <li> Smells great and really does intensify my tan!</li>
            <li> This clogged my pores causing painful cystic acne in places where my clothing applied pressure.  I never get body acne. It gave ok light color and smells nice. Once I stopped using it the body acne cleared. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I used to work at a tanning salon that carried all the top brand names: Australian Gold, Swedish Beauty, Designer Skin, California Tan, just to name a few. So, I have literally tried over a 100 different lotions of various brands, types, and included ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bronzers easily streak, and the ones that don&#x27;t make you look orangish, come off as soon as you take a shower. Intensifiers are the best type of lotion as far as what is going to help you tan, and give you the longest lasting streak-free tan that is actually your own (so it doesn&#x27;t matter when you decide to shower or how often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OF EVERY LOTION I HAVE EVER TRIED, this is BY FAR MY FAVORITE. It SMELLS amazing (it is definitely a UNISEX fragrance), helps you build and maintain that deep dark glow everyone is going for, and the BEST PART is that it is extremely inexpensive when compared to other lotions I have tried that do actually work as well; but cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $120 for 9.5 oz. Comparatively, this lotion is $15 for 13.5 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I MEAN COME ON... IS IT EVEN A DIFFICULT DECISION?</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this stuff.  In my opinion it works great.  The smell is very pleasant.  I was tired of lotions that made me feel like a cheap stripper by the smell.  A little goes a long way and the bottle has lasted me a long time.  Not greasy and definitely doesn&#x27;t stain like other lotions.  Goes on clear and isn&#x27;t too oily..... Good stuff</li>
            <li> Fast delivery as always with this seller.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only once as a sample and I love it!  I&#x27;m already darker.  I LOVE the smell!  It smells wonderful and actually covered up the tanned skin smell that I&#x27;m usually forced to deal with.  I hope I will love it as much with continued use!</li>
            <li> I only tan in the winter and spring and I just so happened to buy this at the end of tanning season last year. Thank Goodness. It looks like soap, it smells like soap, and instead of bronzing with it I turned red as a beet. I have been tanning for at least 10 years so I am not a beginner. This was liquid soap.</li>
            <li> I already have a decent tan from another lotion, but it seemed to have stopped working (in regard to getting any darker).  I wanted to change it up, so I purchased this lotion.  I could see a difference within the first couple uses, and, so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any sort of plateau.  I also love that this lotion doesn&#x27;t give you that orange look that so many lotion do!  Great product.</li>
            <li> Previously, I was using a different tanning lotion which I purchased at the salon for an outrageous price. I was shopping around before I spent that much once again. I saw Smile You’re Dark! and I had to try it with one of the most reasonably priced lotions on amazon. It smells great and it felt great on, not super thick like previous lotions I have used. I could see a difference in my skin tone within 3-4 times of using it and left me with a very natural looking tan. Did NOT have that orange tint at all!! Definitely a lotion I will be continuing to use.</li>
            <li> Feels silky on the skin and smells great! Less than half the price of a salon cost!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the smile you&#x27;re darker/dark lotions. They smell really nice and are a great price compared to the rest of the lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like dove body wash, not tanning lotion....Makes me feel greasy and hasn&#x27;t even given me a tan!&lt;br /&gt;What a rip off. I will be returning this product for a refund. Pretty disappointed with the packaging quality, when I received it the box was open at both ends and was all kinds of damaged. Do not buy this, save your money for a legit tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan too often, but I bought this a few years ago in a tanning salon and it was a little over $40. Great price here, and it gives you a nice tan rather than being too orange or red after using a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product several times.  Great for the money</li>
            <li> This is my go to tanning lotion that I have been using for close to 4 years now. It works great, smells great, and overall is a great product. I tan very easily and never burn. My sister on the other hand doesn&#x27;t tan as easily and will burn. While in Mexico she started using this and I cautioned her to only lay out in the sun for 15 minutes or so on each side due to the fact that this lotion will cause you to tan a lot faster and if you are prone to burning, limit your tanning time. Within 15 minutes, my sister already had noticeable color. Since I do not burn easily, basically I don&#x27;t burn at all, I can put this on and be out in the sun for as long as I want if need be. It leaves a nice, even tan and there is never a hint of orange or off coloring after usage.</li>
            <li> The cost is substantially lower than buying in the tanning salon</li>
            <li> Very Good Lotion &amp; Fast Shipping-THANKS!!</li>
            <li> This has been the best that I have found. The ones that cost more does not work as good as this!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was the actual product! I know most people think it has filers but it didn&#x27;t! Got me very tan!!</li>
            <li> I am an American with an ethnic background of Albanian and Irish.  I love the sun.  I discovered Smile You&#x27;re Dark&lt;br /&gt;several years ago at a tanning salon (to prepare for a vacation in the Caribbean).  My skin color is exceptional.  I love&lt;br /&gt;the stuff.  Smells a bit girly but makes exceptional gifts at Amazon prices.  goforit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already pretty tan, so I can&#x27;t really tell how effective this lotion is, but I can tell you it is very moisturizing (which helps tanning,) without being overly greasy like Tao (also by Designer Skin.)  I guess if I really want to break through my tanning plateau I&#x27;m going to have to shell out a little extra cash for better beds when I tan, or shell out extra cash for the trifecta; Black, Luminary, or Obsidian by Designer Skin, or maybe even both.  I can tell you I see really fast results when using Designer Skin&#x27;s Bombshell, but it makes me peel and leaves a blotchy appearance on my shoulders and back.  That could be from me being sensitive to tingle lotions (I&#x27;ve only tried Pink Diamond by Swedish Beauty and Bombshell,) so I think from now on I&#x27;m going to stick to bronzers.  Either way, you can get this for about the same price as Millenium Tanning&#x27;s Black Storm, and Designer Skin is supposed to be the best, so I suppose I&#x27;d rather put the money on this, but I want to get darker, and I just don&#x27;t think this is the way.  Great smell, though lol.</li>
            <li> I used to work for a tanning salon, and this is what I recommended for anybody who was just starting out, or wasn&#x27;t willing to spend a whole lot on lotion (understandable). This is what I used when I first got back into tanning. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions, and as far as the inexpensive ones go, this is the one I think works the best. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I got tired of the smell after awhile.</li>
            <li> Tanning lotion is already gone, put it in great use. Works amazing. Got tanner faster. Need to order more now.</li>
            <li> really wanted to use it and after one use i broke out in hives so something in it doesnt like me too good.  other than that small issue i&lt;br /&gt;have no issues with the product</li>
            <li> I bought a sample of this lotion from my local salon and I was expecting much more out of this lotion. I already had my base tan and had got to the point where I wasnt getting any darker. So i tried this lotion and I wouldnt recommend it for someone who wants to have the darkest tan. It would probably be ok for someone just starting to tan but not a serious tanner. The smell was also ok, but i prefer a more coconut / fruity smell. Spend more money and get something worth your while. :)</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. Horrible smell, I&#x27;ve used this in the past and this was not the real thing. Gross. . .Had to return.</li>
            <li> Thank you... excellent item as expected</li>
            <li> Gave me color fast! It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> This is the way to go if you want to avoid the high cost of tanning lotion in the salon. Works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and worked out great. So I decided on purchasing another bottle. This time however the lotion did not seem to have the same effect as the first time I used it. Its texture Also seemed a bit off . Not sure if it was just a defect but hope it gets fixed.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My absolutely my favorite tanning lotion! Gives you an amazing golden tan and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This product was 5 months expired!</li>
            <li> This stuff is better than all the expensive stuff, I love the smell and the color it gives me is great!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times &amp; absolutely love it. It gives you lots of color &amp; bronzes your skin to give you a dark, even tan. Why should you pay more at the salon when you can get it cheaper at Amazon &amp; achieve the same results!</li>
            <li> This is the quickest tanning lotion I have ever used. Such an awesome product for the price. I will recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li> it was not was it said a self tanner that i had purchased previously from a tanning salon, where it worked well...this did not at all. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a fake!  No doubt about it!  NO BRONZERS what so ever!  I purchased multiple bottles of tanning lotion, and this is by far the worst yet!  No color!  If I had to guess, plain body lotion was used in this bottle!  Do not buy!  Pay the extra money and buy from a salon!  Horrible that these people get away with this!!!!</li>
            <li> this is a really good lotion. The smell is ok and it does the job. I tan all the time so I know what I am talking about.</li>
            <li> Works very good, on my second bottle.Came very quick and I will order more.</li>
            <li> Is everything they say it is.  It came before the expected date, and is just as good as the expensive indoor tanning lotions at half the price.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Bronzed me just like it said it would and I am pasty white skin color that usually burns then peels</li>
            <li> Good if your starting to tan to get a base tan! Has a good smell. I highly recomend this product for beginners!</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion because I ran out of the Black Storm 60X Extreme Silicone Bronzer I was using and wanted to try something similar in style and price point. This lotion is a great value, if you&#x27;re looking for an effective indoor tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot but still gets the job done. It has a nice scent and I have been really nice color since I started using it. I recommend it highly and will probably re-up when I run out.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells nice and seems to do an alright job.  I have not used it enough to truly determine how well it works, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and leaves my skin moisturized and feeling great.</li>
            <li> Smells great and adds a natural looking amount of color</li>
            <li> Works okay, but my bottle I ordered in May 2015 had expired in Feb 2015, so maybe that has something to do with it. Also, the beds at my gym suck and that is where I used it the most. I saw the most improvement in my color while using this product in a level 1 bed at Darque Tan.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite tanning lotion.  It gives me a dark tan while protecting my skin.  it was very cheap.  i have no complains about it at all.</li>
            <li> My bottle said it was expired when I received it. I&#x27;m not sure if that effected the way the product worked. Also every time I used it I would get little bumps on my arms, stomach and legs. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allergic to the product, but I do have sensitive skin so be careful before buying this product.</li>
            <li> Tans nicely and smells great!</li>
            <li> It works well, I was not over-wowed by it, but definately a good product. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, years ago, and it&#x27;s my favorite tanning lotion because you can use it in a tanning bed and at the beach -- #1 reason I prefer it. It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; your clothes if you go the the gym after the tanning salon. Great product and GREAT COLOR result.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than getting it at a salon! It was still in the wrapper and unopened.. Very pleased with this product. I will always go to them to get it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many tanning lotions and really like this one. It smells good and is not too thick. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing how they mark this product up to about quadruple its worth at the salons. It is a great product and it gets the job done. But don&#x27;t make the mistake of paying $60 for it when you can get it here.</li>
            <li> Smile your dark works great and gives a nice dark and natural tan. Not to mention it smells great! I will with no doubt buy again.</li>
            <li> I am smiling and I am dark, so in that respect, this is a win. :) The smell is really quite lovely on this lotion...it doesn&#x27;t smell of coconut and burnt flesh as most others do. It has a light fragrance that I think smells a little floral, but the website says honey. Either way, it&#x27;s not overpowering. Men and women could use this and be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provides super intense hydration (love hoe great my skin feels after using) and also provides a good foundation for tanning. I have been a fan of australian gold for quite some time, but am happily switching to this from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not provide a bronzer for those of you who are looking for an instant bronzer + maximizer. This is an accelerator, which is better in the long run.</li>
            <li> They sent me the bottle, with lotion. But, the top has visibly been removed (up on one side) than placed on again. They have mixed a little tanning lotion with a lot of normal store-bought lotion. Thanks for wasting my money bargain tan.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion! I&#x27;m a repeat buyer</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!!!! Brand new!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE This So Works Good My Tan Looks Good ♡ It (-:  Hope It Works For Other People Like For Me!!</li>
            <li> love that this lotion doesn&#x27;t have a color so it won&#x27;t leave my hands orange and it smells delicious!! I&#x27;ll definitely be smiling once I&#x27;m dark!!</li>
            <li> Best self tanner out there if you want a nice brown color and not orange</li>
            <li> perfect lotion for getting a gradual tan.</li>
            <li> After going to the tanning bed 3 times, I already have an excellent base tan. Granted I do tan easily but I have used many other products and they didn&#x27;t even work this well. The scent is light, though my boyfriend mentioned it smelled like I bathed in cheap perfume, it wasn&#x27;t runny and you sure can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> Love this product because the lack of bronzer and the great smell!  It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel as greasy afterwards like other lotions.  I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned so I appreciate the slight amount of bronzer, but this lotion is super effective and its good if you have to go out after tanning since it smells perfumey and doesn&#x27;t feel gross.</li>
