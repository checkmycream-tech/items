            <li>The scalp foam treatment is nice, and it makes the scalp feel good, not greasy at all (which I was worried about, because my hair looks greasy</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>so am very excited about that!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good on colored hair and leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>,m I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Every gal likes that.  :)</li>
            <li>I love the size this package came in.</li>
            <li>I LIKE THE PRODUCT AND WILL ORDER MORE.</li>
            <li>Affordable and my hair appears to be thicker and seems to be growing faster also a nice clean fresh scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fit into my travel bag.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how nicely the shampoo lathers.  </li>
            <li>I started with the starter kit and ended up buying the full size after it was gone.  </li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>The tingling is mild and doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>it really does work!!</li>
            <li>With the already fine hair which seems to be thinning out even more, I knew I had to do something before my part got any bigger.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product but was disasppointed that the mousse had some product left in the can that would not dispense</li>
            <li>dont feel like i bought the right one for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy again.</li>
            <li>I have been using for less than a month but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Still the shampoo and conditioner are very nice and make my bits of fluff look Fuller but not thicker and no new hair.</li>
            <li>THIS WORKED VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li>My hair use to fall out, but this has stopped my hair from falling as much.</li>
            <li>The shampoo goes in well, so you don&#x27;t need that much.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>First try didn&#x27;t produce any new hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is staying in and almost back to full body.</li>
            <li>The conditioner can stay on up to 5 minutes, I suggest you wait the 5 minutes, because it is the last 1-2 minutes to where you can really feel the tingling sensation, like mint.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much with the first half the bottle, but like everything else, it takes time to take effect.</li>
            <li>I would suggest you at least give it a try, it is worth it!!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Bosley starter pack because it said it was for color treated hair, when I used it the first time I had just colored my hair and it stripped the color right down to the grey.  </li>
            <li>I am a 33 year old woman who was never blessed with the full, thick hair that I dream of.  </li>

            <li> I did not use it long enough to make any other judgements.  </li>
            <li> but I found my hair to be dry after I used it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll try again, Been trying for over two month now still no new hair</li>
            <li> Be careful when you put the treatment on because if it drips on your forehead</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have had thinning hair due to stress - according to the doctor.  </li>

            <li> Makes my hair fluffy and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time on this product.</li>
            <li> know this will never make my hair grow in thick or anything else, but I do believe that it will maintain the hair I have</li>
            <li> Age and stress can thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I happened to be in Cabo San Lucas for my granddaughter&#x27;s wedding and was very unhappy when my hair looked horrible~~I am very unhappy with this product and certainly would not recommend it.  </li>

            <li> Too expensive for no results.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not bad but I found my hair to be dry after I used it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Bosley starter pack because it said it was for color treated hair, when I used it the first time I had just colored my hair and it stripped the color right down to the grey.  I happened to be in Cabo San Lucas for my granddaughter&#x27;s wedding and was very unhappy when my hair looked horrible~~I am very unhappy with this product and certainly would not recommend it.  I did not use it long enough to make any other judgements.  Now I have to get my hair colored again and I spent my money for a worthless product.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but was disasppointed that the mousse had some product left in the can that would not dispense so I had to throw it away.  Other than that,m I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have had thinning hair due to stress - according to the doctor.  This combo helped to thicken it up and regrown hair.</li>
            <li> So grateful this product worked.  My hair is staying in and almost back to full body. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I sent back. It was not sealed and there was no way I could tell if it had a substitute product in it.</li>
            <li> Great product still using it.  Makes my hair fluffy and manageable.  I even got compliments.  Every gal likes that.  :)</li>
            <li> Received in good condition.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me at all</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference from daily use of my regular color-treated shampoo.  I would not buy it again.  Too expensive for no results.</li>
            <li> I love the size this package came in. It&#x27;s easy to fit into my travel bag. You still have to check it in but it&#x27;s not cumbersome.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKED VERY WELL.  I LIKE THE PRODUCT AND WILL ORDER MORE.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product and did not see ANY regrowth of my hair. The product did not make my hair appear thicker. The product cleansed and conditioned my hair, I guess. The area where I had hair loss I still do. Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time on this product.</li>
            <li> Affordable and my hair appears to be thicker and seems to be growing faster also a nice clean fresh scent</li>
            <li> First try didn&#x27;t produce any new hair. So I&#x27;ll try again, Been trying for over two month now still no new hair this is it I&#x27; done trying. Still the shampoo and conditioner are very nice and make my bits of fluff look Fuller but not thicker and no new hair.</li>
            <li> Age and stress can thin hair.  These products help with this issue. I am happy I found out about them.</li>
            <li> dont feel like i bought the right one for my type of hair. may try a different type of product</li>
            <li> This all I use to wash my hair. My hair use to fall out, but this has stopped my hair from falling as much.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how nicely the shampoo lathers.  I have been using for less than a month but so far so good. I will most likely buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this specific kit from a hair salon about a month ago.  I am a 33 year old woman who was never blessed with the full, thick hair that I dream of.  However, that being said.... With the already fine hair which seems to be thinning out even more, I knew I had to do something before my part got any bigger.  I have been using this for around a month, and here is what I have found.  The shampoo goes in well, so you don&#x27;t need that much.  The shampoo does not cause any tingling, and you leave it on for about a minute.  Also, remember you are trying to apply it to your scalp and then push it out towards the rest of the hair.  The conditioner can stay on up to 5 minutes, I suggest you wait the 5 minutes, because it is the last 1-2 minutes to where you can really feel the tingling sensation, like mint.  The scalp foam treatment is nice, and it makes the scalp feel good, not greasy at all (which I was worried about, because my hair looks greasy easy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this will never make my hair grow in thick or anything else, but I do believe that it will maintain the hair I have and I can see less coming out in the brushes, etc.  I would suggest you at least give it a try, it is worth it!!</li>
            <li> I started with the starter kit and ended up buying the full size after it was gone.  The tingling is mild and doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference in my hair loss...will keep using.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of my hairdresser. It really works. Be careful when you put the treatment on because if it drips on your forehead and you don&#x27;t wash it off, hair will grow! I repeat...it really does work!!</li>
            <li> I bought this when I noticed my hair thinning after having WLS. It works wonderfully! I didn&#x27;t notice much with the first half the bottle, but like everything else, it takes time to take effect. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments and questions on what I&#x27;m using on my hair. I haven&#x27;t used it for about 6 months and can tell again that I need to order it again. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone wanting fuller, thicker hair! My hair color wasn&#x27;t effected by this product at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good on colored hair and leaves my hair soft.  Each time I use it I lose less and less hair so am very excited about that!</li>
