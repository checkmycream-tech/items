    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It will add some moisture but not like a product meant to moisturize, so it is perfect for oily skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting when it goes on, and it absorbs flawlessly.</li>
            <li>My order came with a very good cleanser as a bonus.</li>
            <li>this product is great</li>
            <li>Great products.</li>
            <li>The sample cleanser I got with this item smells great</li>
            <li>I think this product is intended for men (I didn&#x27;t know they were even prone to hyperpigmentation), but it works great for me.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>In order to be fair, I will continue to use this for another two months since you shouldn&#x27;t write off a product until you allow it ample time to perform.</li>
            <li>It was not oily and was perfect as the first product on the face.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when this became available again.  </li>
            <li>I know this product is for guys...but m a girl, and I&#x27;ve used it for my acne scars...and this product is amazing...</li>
            <li>and I liked those too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lessened acne scarring but rose hip oil and cocoa butter do a better job.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Most of my coworkers say that they cant tell the difference anymore.</li>
            <li>I am so happy i was very depressed after the accident.</li>
            <li>I feel much more confident now.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite think about this serum was the consistency and</li>
            <li>But most of all, it lightens the skin.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product coz it helps diminished my bumpy skin on my face.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love the packaging.</li>
            <li>Great product would definitly buy this again fast shipping.reasonable price for an awesome product got here right on time thanks</li>
            <li>I put it on after washing my face before bed and it goes on like aloe vera and dries without becoming oily or too</li>
            <li>I liked the packaging too, easy to get just the right amount out.</li>
            <li>The consistency is like aloe vera gel, and it absorbs into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, they sent a free gift of scrub pads</li>
            <li>Welcome to middle age, I guess!</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this and received an extra gift in the bag (totally unexpected, which was great), and am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I think you have to continue using this product for awhile before you see any significant changes.  </li>
            <li>It was a gel-like consistency that would turn watery when it hit the skin and was absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>Good if you wanted to layer other products like sunscreen or moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>I used one full bottle of this stuff.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly (about 3 days after I ordered it).</li>
            <li>I noticed that this serum makes my face look brighter, it KILLS acne overnight, and it helps my scars fade quickly.</li>
            <li>so i quickly stopped using it.</li>
            <li>This is so far my favorite arbutin serum.  </li>
            <li>I tried for over 20 days without success.  </li>
            <li>I am attributing this serum to what made a difference because truthfully i didn&#x27;t try anything else, besides this one cream early on, but it made me break out</li>
            <li>I rarely get pimples anymore and never any cystic ones.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>I like this serum very much because it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed fast &amp; does not leave sticky feelings afterward.  </li>
            <li>Though I like the consistency of the product(like an aloe-vera gel consistency); and it does sink in your skin pretty effortlessly and dries w/out being greasy</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent.  </li>
            <li>arbrutin serum works very well at lightening dark pigments.i recieved the product promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not uncomfortable using it</li>
            <li>At first I used this twice a day</li>
            <li>I wasted a good deal of money having it lasered by a plastic surgeon, to no avail.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, its easy to apply and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think there is anything</li>
            <li>It really helped my skin clarity and smoothed it out.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really consider this as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It may take time to see the result but since I used it I never broke out as much as before..</li>
            <li>... be careful with how many times you use it a day.</li>
            <li>Lasts for about 2 to 3 months depending on how much you use it.</li>
            <li>My forehead is no longer much darker than the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered chronic dark circles from hyperpigmentation for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a dark spot treatment, mostly acne scars, and it works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum</li>
            <li>I had a fresh mark on my back, I started using this item each day at night and it does work.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found with such a strong concentration of the active ingredient (at such an amazing price), which, by the way, I heard about by looking up studies in dermatologist journals.</li>
            <li>even my fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Its oil free and mixes with my other facial creams very well.</li>
            <li>I had burned my face at work (freak accident) and was horrified when i realized that the skin on the side of my cheek was completely gone.</li>
            <li>Helped with old scars.</li>
            <li>I used it 6 months after the accident after the doctor told me that my face would never look the same, and that i would have to live with the scar since the healing was complete.</li>
            <li>: Too much use will dry out skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure how strong the Alpha Arbutim is as they have a LOT of other stuff besides Alpha Arbutrim such as ulva ursa leaf extract,kojic acid, glycerin, seaweed, sea buckthorn, black tea and more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey on a student budget, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>In my late thirties I developed an obvious and large patch of hyperpigmentation right in the middle of my forehead (hormones, sun damage).</li>
            <li>It took a few months to heal but the new skin was much lighter than the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>It is no where near as effective as hydroquinone however it is less irritating.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I won&#x27;t say this isn&#x27;t working, but I still can&#x27;t say 100% that it&#x27;s doing what I expected it to do based on prior reviews.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t takes so long to have the zit on it.</li>
            <li> What I like about this is that I use a q-tip and apply it to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and it started to dry out my skin which in turn made my skin darker.</li>
            <li> and I saw very little change as far as skin lightening goes.</li>
            <li> but boy did it dry my face out!</li>
            <li> it only takes a little bit</li>
            <li> It definitely lightens my skin as well - but you&#x27;ll have to use this faithfully everyday in order to see the difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a month, and my hyperpigmentation has not faded to the degree in which I expected at this point.</li>
            <li> Not worth the bottle its in.</li>
            <li> My complexion was slightly clearer.  </li>
            <li> I need to purchase this again but none available :(</li>
            <li> tight--</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had cystic acne, blackheads, uneven tone and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I had a baby at 39 and assumed the uneven pigment would dissipate once my pregnancy hormones declined.</li>
            <li> I know this is supposed to be for men, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that we, women, cannot use it.</li>
            <li> My skin was heartbreakingly horrible and painful but now I feel comfortable going outside makeup</li>
            <li> When this was not available on Amazon for a while, I bought some other arbutin products, and I hated it.  </li>
            <li> I had some sun damage from a crazy summer, but that&#x27;s gone now, or at least masked.</li>
            <li> Not a great chemical mix, not the worst either, and glycerin may clog pores when in fact, we want this to go deeply into the epidermal</li>
            <li> Crap, don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I used to have cystic acne all over my face, along with some terrible scarring.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I know this is supposed to be for men, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that we, women, cannot use it. :)  This is so far my favorite arbutin serum.  It gets absorbed fast &amp; does not leave sticky feelings afterward.  It definitely lightens my skin as well - but you&#x27;ll have to use this faithfully everyday in order to see the difference.  I use this every day morning/evening.  The dark spots don&#x27;t completely disappear, but they get lightened.  When this was not available on Amazon for a while, I bought some other arbutin products, and I hated it.  I was so happy when this became available again.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly (about 3 days after I ordered it). I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and I can see the difference! I used to have cystic acne all over my face, along with some terrible scarring. I noticed that this serum makes my face look brighter, it KILLS acne overnight, and it helps my scars fade quickly. The consistency is like aloe vera gel, and it absorbs into the skin very quickly. It has no scent. I love this product. Will definitely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I think you have to continue using this product for awhile before you see any significant changes.  I used one full bottle of this stuff. It lasted just over a month and I saw very little change as far as skin lightening goes. My complexion was slightly clearer.  Not sure how strong the Alpha Arbutim is as they have a LOT of other stuff besides Alpha Arbutrim such as ulva ursa leaf extract,kojic acid, glycerin, seaweed, sea buckthorn, black tea and more.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say this isn&#x27;t working, but I still can&#x27;t say 100% that it&#x27;s doing what I expected it to do based on prior reviews. I&#x27;ve been using for about a month, and my hyperpigmentation has not faded to the degree in which I expected at this point. Though I like the consistency of the product(like an aloe-vera gel consistency); and it does sink in your skin pretty effortlessly and dries w/out being greasy, I will continue to use until it&#x27;s gone, but I don&#x27;t believe I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it faithfully over months, the dime size discoloration on my face is still there.  I also noticed this product makes my discoloration more vulnerable to sun; then I have to apply diligently sunscreen to &amp;#34;shield&amp;#34; that brown spot.  I really don&#x27;t think there is anything could help my age spot; I need to accept and get over it.</li>
            <li> I had a fresh mark on my back, I started using this item each day at night and it does work.  You have to be consistent.  What I like about this is that I use a q-tip and apply it to dry skin.  I am on my second bottle and I do believe that this works but you have to continue to use it, nothing works overnight so you have to tackle the mark immedialty.</li>
            <li> I need to purchase this again but none available :(</li>
            <li> Product did not work for me at all.  I tried for over 20 days without success.  After thus I decided to trash it.</li>
            <li> arbrutin serum works very well at lightening dark pigments.i recieved the product promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I had burned my face at work (freak accident) and was horrified when i realized that the skin on the side of my cheek was completely gone. It took a few months to heal but the new skin was much lighter than the rest of my face. I used this serum to help with the discoloration and to help even out the completion of my skin. I used it 6 months after the accident after the doctor told me that my face would never look the same, and that i would have to live with the scar since the healing was complete. With the help of this product the only way you can tell is if i told you. (I used it for about 6 months). Most of my coworkers say that they cant tell the difference anymore. I am so happy i was very depressed after the accident. I feel much more confident now. I am attributing this serum to what made a difference because truthfully i didn&#x27;t try anything else, besides this one cream early on, but it made me break out so i quickly stopped using it. This was it. I don&#x27;t know how i found it just cruising on amazon praying for a miracle and i found it!</li>
            <li> my order came on time ,neatly package and with a sample. this product is great i notice my skin reacting to this product with in 3days. i have sensative skin so i use it at night  along with a moisturizer. it only takes a little bit the bottle should last a month1/2 going to order again</li>
            <li> Great product would definitly buy this again fast shipping.reasonable price for an awesome product got here right on time thanks</li>
            <li> Crap, don&#x27;t work. Waste of money. Not worth the bottle its in. Might as well be water. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Thank you!!love it...</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product. It really helped my skin clarity and smoothed it out. Helped with old scars. My favorite think about this serum was the consistency and how it applied to the skin. It was a gel-like consistency that would turn watery when it hit the skin and was absorbed very quickly. It was not oily and was perfect as the first product on the face. Good if you wanted to layer other products like sunscreen or moisturizer on top. I wouldn&#x27;t really consider this as a moisturizer. It will add some moisture but not like a product meant to moisturize, so it is perfect for oily skin. I liked the packaging too, easy to get just the right amount out. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Not a great chemical mix, not the worst either, and glycerin may clog pores when in fact, we want this to go deeply into the epidermal layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Esthetician</li>
            <li> I like this serum very much because it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. Its oil free and mixes with my other facial creams very well. But most of all, it lightens the skin. My order came with a very good cleanser as a bonus. Great products. I highly recommend this serum and I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered chronic dark circles from hyperpigmentation for most of my life. I recently purchased this and received an extra gift in the bag (totally unexpected, which was great), and am very happy with the product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three or so weeks and I&#x27;m starting to see improvement. It doesn&#x27;t sting when it goes on, and it absorbs flawlessly. Additionally, it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found with such a strong concentration of the active ingredient (at such an amazing price), which, by the way, I heard about by looking up studies in dermatologist journals. It works.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month now and couldn&#x27;t see any results yet. It may take time to see the result but since I used it I never broke out as much as before..</li>
            <li> It even my skin tone well. I use it a lot and the drops are what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> So, I know this product was designed for men but I have to say it works wonders for women too. I had cystic acne, blackheads, uneven tone and hyperpigmentation. I rarely get pimples anymore and never any cystic ones. I look so much younger and even my fine lines are less noticeable. There&#x27;s no fragrance so I&#x27;m not uncomfortable using it (no one can tell it&#x27;s made for men). I will continue buying this forever! I love it. I put it on after washing my face before bed and it goes on like aloe vera and dries without becoming oily or too tight-- it&#x27;s just right. Also, they sent a free gift of scrub pads and I liked those too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been spending a fortune trying to find something like this in the women&#x27;s beauty aisle for years and never came close. My skin was heartbreakingly horrible and painful but now I feel comfortable going outside makeup free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> ... be careful with how many times you use it a day. At first I used this twice a day and it started to dry out my skin which in turn made my skin darker. When I switched it to once a day my skin didnt dry out that much, it went back to its normal color and slowly cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Clears up acne spots and helps balance oil on skin. Lasts for about 2 to 3 months depending on how much you use it. Its fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Too much use will dry out skin. I cant use my retinol cream and this at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product made me break out, it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough. I stopped using after just 2 weeks. The sample cleanser I got with this item smells great but boy did it dry my face out!</li>
            <li> It lessened acne scarring but rose hip oil and cocoa butter do a better job. It is no where near as effective as hydroquinone however it is less irritating. Otherwise, its easy to apply and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li> I love this product coz it helps diminished my bumpy skin on my face. Im on the second  bottle now. It won&#x27;t takes so long to have the zit on it. I used it with my nanocleanse cleanser.</li>
            <li> I know this product is for guys...but m a girl, and I&#x27;ve used it for my acne scars...and this product is amazing...it lightened my scars and brightened overall skin tone...I love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a dark spot treatment, mostly acne scars, and it works. I wouldnt say it kills acne overnight, but it definitely helps heal scabs and lighten scars. I have mocha skin and this product helps fade darker spots and evens my skin tone out.</li>
            <li> In my late thirties I developed an obvious and large patch of hyperpigmentation right in the middle of my forehead (hormones, sun damage). I had a baby at 39 and assumed the uneven pigment would dissipate once my pregnancy hormones declined. It didn&#x27;t. Welcome to middle age, I guess! Anyway, I don&#x27;t wear bangs, so I had to do something to lighten my patchy, browned forehead. I wasted a good deal of money having it lasered by a plastic surgeon, to no avail. I&#x27;ve also tried chemical peels, which work well in smoothing and beautifying my skin, but they did not lighten my forehead at all. So, after researching arbutin online, I came across this inexpensive product on Amazon. It worked for me. My forehead is no longer much darker than the rest of my face. Now, I try to stay out of the sun and wear a baseball cap when I go out for walks. The hyperpigmentation has been gone for quite a while now, but I use this a couple times per week - just in case! I think this product is intended for men (I didn&#x27;t know they were even prone to hyperpigmentation), but it works great for me. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> I suffer from hyperpigmentation on my face.  Lots of brown spots.  The only change in my skin is that it is drier.  I have yet to see any evening of my skin tone.  In order to be fair, I will continue to use this for another two months since you shouldn&#x27;t write off a product until you allow it ample time to perform.</li>
            <li> Great product. Definitely saw results when paired with niacinamide based lotions. My skin looked RADIANT. I had some sun damage from a crazy summer, but that&#x27;s gone now, or at least masked. The gel form is so convenient to use and store. Love the packaging. It&#x27;s a little pricey on a student budget, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
