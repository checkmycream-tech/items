            <li>It is a favorite classic that I love to use.  </li>
            <li>Scent was fresh!</li>
            <li>Never disappointed.</li>

            <li>knew before purchase that this is a good, light fragrance for me -&lt;br /&gt;fragrance is very personal choice - don&#x27;t rely on my review if you have never smelled the fragrance</li>
            <li>but a coworker immediately said that I smelled clean...</li>
            <li>I like that because the scent represents clean and sweet.</li>
            <li>Memories surface as I remembered this special scent.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>This was a Gift for a relative, she just loved it.</li>
            <li>It is a light, fresh scent and my husband loves it, too</li>
            <li>Glad I found it here for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>costs double in stores, good buy</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years; light, refreshing sent that isn&#x27;t over powering to others around you especially those who have allergies.</li>
            <li>The whole set is lovely.</li>
            <li>got a great deal compared with other companies.</li>
            <li>, It is one of my preferred lotions but when I&#x27;m going to buy a new one I&#x27;d like to be sure it is original</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of perfume, but this has a fresh clean smell to it.</li>
            <li>This is my &amp;#34;ALL TIME&amp;#34; favorite from high school</li>
            <li>This was a favorite of mine in high school and remains to this day.</li>
            <li>The Nina Ricci came in great condition with a few extra&#x27;s to try my mother loved it.  </li>
            <li>Super Price and Fast Shipping !!</li>
            <li>It DOESN&#x27;T have the strong cheap girly girly smell, and almost has a hint of a natural musk, yet doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real stuff and the price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and it well worth the Money.</li>
            <li>Its so fresh and flowery.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of my younger days when it was so popular.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is substantially less than retail (when you can find L&#x27;Air in a retail store; it is becoming a kind of an orphan brand).</li>
            <li>I got a good price through Amazon compared to other stores.</li>
            <li>It is very nice not strong smell</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering, but it is identifiable and I get many positive comments on it.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only perfume that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, besides finding the smell to be just right--not too sweet or strong.</li>
            <li>She likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>This cologne has such a light and clean scent.  </li>
            <li>The favorite perfume I&#x27;ve worn for more than twenty years is nothing wrong w/ me though I got a better price and shipping service from Amazon this time.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Glad it was personal and not for a gift.</li>
            <li>Was funny.</li>
            <li>I have used this product since I first discovered it in France in 1965.</li>
            <li>I always pay more in stores for a smaller bottle than this!</li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON!</li>
            <li>I love to wear it in the spring and summer, especially.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for all!</li>
            <li>Such a floral sweet &amp; light fragrance .</li>
            <li>my mom, We live in Venezuela, All right!</li>
            <li>The most romantic perfume on the face of the earth and the skin of my love (or at least I think so, and I&#x27;m pretty sure she does, too).</li>
            <li>I have paid a fortune for it in high end department stores and loved it when I found I could purchase it online for half the price.  </li>
            <li>This  has been a favorite of mine for a long time.</li>
            <li>Not only did it arrive in perfect shape with free shipping, but I was able to get a larger size than I previously bought for less money!  </li>
            <li>My wife has used this spray for many, many years and she as well as I - still find it very pleasing and an excellent value - far preferable to other products which give off less subtle scents.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>and I was concerned that it might not be \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My daughter buys it for me every Christmas and not only do I enjoy the scent all year, I think of her every time I use it.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, not a knock off fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It has been my experience that if I really like to use a product, it is immediately discontinued.  </li>
            <li>You really can wear it all year</li>
            <li>Wife likes it, which is the only important criterion.  </li>
            <li>and I received it so fast,  </li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>I have not used this perfume in many years - it brought back old memories...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find locally, so I am glad I can order it here, receive it right at my door on time as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a classic French perfume and timeles, light, floral and feminine.</li>
            <li>you want something different, unique, this is the one.</li>
            <li>significantly, it was an international shipping do not spill.</li>
            <li>I just hope that it is a genuine item and that it is not thrown back at me by the Better Half.</li>
            <li>Classic scent, one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  older now</li>
            <li>A classic from 1949.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Have used this perfume for years, but the fragrance in this bottle is not very good or true to the original scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff can be expensive in stores, great price here.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too heavy or spicy - just elegant and feminine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that I couldn&#x27;t smell it for too long</li>
            <li>Classic, very old school.</li>
            <li>I believe the main point of wearing perfume is so other people enjoy it.</li>
            <li>In Paris in 1962 I bought a newly released  perfume.</li>
            <li>When in Paris I decided to buy a silk scarf and a new fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I continue to get more compliments on this one than that other French classic, Chanel No. 5.</li>
            <li>Great if you get perfume bit toilet is weak.</li>
            <li>I have tried sooo many other fragrances and always go back to this.</li>
            <li>I have had problems before getting scents not being fresh and on shelf for long time.</li>
            <li>Maybe other reviewers are right and this isn&#x27;t the real thing</li>
            <li>To me, perfume samples in magazines often smell rather nice, but buy them in the store, and they all smell so similar, almost the same as each other to me and not quite like the sample.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and springy, but long lasting.</li>
            <li>Does not seem to have the same fragrance as my old bottle when I first opened it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd time I ordered L&#x27;Air Du Temps in this large size.  </li>
            <li>I wore this when I was young and when I was looking for perfumes I thought I would try it again.</li>
            <li>The old one is gone from time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent all of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and feminine but not too flowery.  </li>
            <li>May work for 80 yr old who can&#x27;t smell..</li>
            <li>The aroma remember me when my mother was young because she use it.</li>
            <li>The color of the cologne was darker than it should be and the smell was a bit off telling me that the product is old.</li>
            <li>I have always loved L&#x27;Air Du Temps but there is something wrong with the sprayer on this bottle.</li>
            <li>does not smell like the original I used so many years ago - way too sharp and not soft as it was in the past.</li>
            <li>This product only lasts a few hours and is not as strong.  </li>
            <li>got exactly what i ordered and arrived a week earlier than expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>First time bought on line; I guess not a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;Could the product have been exposed to too much heat?</li>
            <li>This was the real thing, not an imitation, and the price beat all others I had found.</li>

            <li> , It is one of my preferred lotions but when I&#x27;m going to buy a new one I&#x27;d like to be sure it is original</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of perfume, but this has a fresh clean smell to it.</li>

            <li> This was a favorite of mine in high school and remains to this day.</li>

            <li> Super Price and Fast Shipping !!</li>
            <li> It DOESN&#x27;T have the strong cheap girly girly smell, and almost has a hint of a natural musk, yet doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real stuff and the price is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and it well worth the Money.</li>
            <li> Its so fresh and flowery.  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of my younger days when it was so popular.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it is substantially less than retail (when you can find L&#x27;Air in a retail store; it is becoming a kind of an orphan brand).</li>
            <li> I got a good price through Amazon compared to other stores.</li>
            <li> It is very nice not strong smell</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering, but it is identifiable and I get many positive comments on it.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only perfume that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, besides finding the smell to be just right--not too sweet or strong.</li>
            <li> She likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> This cologne has such a light and clean scent.  </li>
            <li> The favorite perfume I&#x27;ve worn for more than twenty years is nothing wrong w/ me though I got a better price and shipping service from Amazon this time.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Glad it was personal and not for a gift.</li>
            <li> Was funny.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I first discovered it in France in 1965.</li>
            <li> I always pay more in stores for a smaller bottle than this!</li>
            <li> Thanks AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I love to wear it in the spring and summer, especially.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for all!</li>
            <li> Such a floral sweet &amp; light fragrance .</li>
            <li> my mom, We live in Venezuela, All right!</li>
            <li> The most romantic perfume on the face of the earth and the skin of my love (or at least I think so, and I&#x27;m pretty sure she does, too).</li>
            <li> I have paid a fortune for it in high end department stores and loved it when I found I could purchase it online for half the price.  </li>
            <li> This  has been a favorite of mine for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not only did it arrive in perfect shape with free shipping, but I was able to get a larger size than I previously bought for less money!  </li>
            <li> My wife has used this spray for many, many years and she as well as I - still find it very pleasing and an excellent value - far preferable to other products which give off less subtle scents.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> and I was concerned that it might not be \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My daughter buys it for me every Christmas and not only do I enjoy the scent all year, I think of her every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, not a knock off fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It has been my experience that if I really like to use a product, it is immediately discontinued.  </li>
            <li> You really can wear it all year</li>
            <li> Wife likes it, which is the only important criterion.  </li>
            <li> and I received it so fast,  </li>
            <li> Very upset.</li>
            <li> I have not used this perfume in many years - it brought back old memories...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find locally, so I am glad I can order it here, receive it right at my door on time as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a classic French perfume and timeles, light, floral and feminine.</li>
            <li> you want something different, unique, this is the one.</li>
            <li> significantly, it was an international shipping do not spill.</li>
            <li> I just hope that it is a genuine item and that it is not thrown back at me by the Better Half.</li>
            <li> Classic scent, one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  older now</li>
            <li> A classic from 1949.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this perfume for years, but the fragrance in this bottle is not very good or true to the original scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff can be expensive in stores, great price here.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too heavy or spicy - just elegant and feminine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that I couldn&#x27;t smell it for too long</li>
            <li> Classic, very old school.</li>
            <li> I believe the main point of wearing perfume is so other people enjoy it.</li>
            <li> In Paris in 1962 I bought a newly released  perfume.</li>
            <li> When in Paris I decided to buy a silk scarf and a new fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I continue to get more compliments on this one than that other French classic, Chanel No. 5.</li>
            <li> Great if you get perfume bit toilet is weak.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooo many other fragrances and always go back to this.</li>
            <li> I have had problems before getting scents not being fresh and on shelf for long time.</li>
            <li> Maybe other reviewers are right and this isn&#x27;t the real thing</li>
            <li> To me, perfume samples in magazines often smell rather nice, but buy them in the store, and they all smell so similar, almost the same as each other to me and not quite like the sample.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and springy, but long lasting.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to have the same fragrance as my old bottle when I first opened it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I ordered L&#x27;Air Du Temps in this large size.  </li>
            <li> I wore this when I was young and when I was looking for perfumes I thought I would try it again.</li>
            <li> The old one is gone from time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent all of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and feminine but not too flowery.  </li>
            <li> May work for 80 yr old who can&#x27;t smell..</li>
            <li> The aroma remember me when my mother was young because she use it.</li>
            <li> The color of the cologne was darker than it should be and the smell was a bit off telling me that the product is old.</li>
            <li> I have always loved L&#x27;Air Du Temps but there is something wrong with the sprayer on this bottle.</li>
            <li> does not smell like the original I used so many years ago - way too sharp and not soft as it was in the past.</li>
            <li> This product only lasts a few hours and is not as strong.  </li>
            <li> got exactly what i ordered and arrived a week earlier than expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> First time bought on line; I guess not a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;Could the product have been exposed to too much heat?</li>
            <li> This was the real thing, not an imitation, and the price beat all others I had found.</li>
            <li> The toilet spray does NOT last at all.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> When it recently became harder to find in the stores, my husband suggested that I check on-line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn L&#x27;air Du Temps for nearly 30 years and won&#x27;t waste my money on anything else.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I will use this product as long as I can get it.  </li>
            <li> have to wait and see if is the same in a few days of use</li>
            <li> Gave it one star because the review wouldn&#x27;t take a minus.</li>
            <li> However, this bottle design, larger size , is NOT easy to hold onto and spray .</li>
            <li> My grandmother has been wearing this fragrance for decades and says its harder and harder to come by!</li>
            <li> Many buyers write that they are disappointed that they can&#x27;t smell the scent.</li>
            <li> She will not use any other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry because I love it and will only use as an expensive air freshener.</li>
            <li> I no longer want to try other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Same as with Guy Laroche Fidji - hardly any scent p- seems watered down and replica of something.  </li>
            <li> I have shopped around and there is a real wide range of prices.  </li>
            <li> Water down perfume.</li>
            <li> this is the perfume I ordered, but it came in a short - fat, round- bottle..very hard to travel with..</li>
            <li> Always received compliments previously - now can&#x27;t even detect smell myself.</li>
            <li> (By the way, spray a little on your hair.)</li>
            <li> My wife felt nauseous after wearing it for a little while.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a hero for a little while and all is well.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Having trouble finding a splash.</li>
            <li> Pretty\\&quot; by Cartier (1995): my wife wore this for a few years and then she became allergic to it, in a manner of speaking.</li>
            <li> This product is not widely available in stores anymore</li>
            <li> round of course.  </li>
            <li> Sorry - You get one star and only because it was delivered in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find</li>
            <li> The scent is delicate and feminine.  </li>
            <li> am now in my late 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance has been around for 55-60 years at least.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is described as being floral, and people said in their reviews that it&#x27;s a subtle scent - both of which my wife loves.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this perfume but its so expensive at the chain stores.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I knew something was wrong.</li>
            <li> Purchased this perfume for a birthday gift, and if you are looking for this scent, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> She would be mad at me if I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> so was disappointed in the packaging</li>
            <li> To us, this smells like baby powder, which we both hate.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay the outrageous department-store prices; get it here and you can keep the romance going even longer.</li>

            <li> This was a Gift for a relative, she just loved it. Perfect Purchase :)</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent that I wear. My husband picked it out for me years ago, and I love it and always have it on hand. It&#x27;s a fresh, pleasant, and interesting scent without being &amp;#34;too much.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> In Paris in 1962 I bought a newly released  perfume. L&#x27;Air Du Temps was my summer scent for years.&lt;br /&gt;Wearing it again is a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I wore this when I was young and when I was looking for perfumes I thought I would try it again. Still nice and light and refreshing.</li>

            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite - so watch for good price - and your price along with shipping and handling was by far the best - the product arrived on time for me to give it to our daughter for her birthday -planning on ordering again from you  same product - by the way do you have YSL Pour Homme for men</li>
            <li> I buy this perfume for my wife for her birthday every year.  She would be mad at me if I didn&#x27;t.  It smells great on her.  It&#x27;s a great fragrance that I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> This has been my perfume choice for 57 years.  It is a light, fresh scent and my husband loves it, too</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;air Du Temps for 30+ years and I just love it.  When it recently became harder to find in the stores, my husband suggested that I check on-line.  Not only did it arrive in perfect shape with free shipping, but I was able to get a larger size than I previously bought for less money!  It was a win win solution and I will always check on-line in the future.</li>
            <li> I love to order from amazon,as everything is just as described and you are so efficient with getting the orders out for delivery. Thank you so much.</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance!  Glad I found it here for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> good product - I wish my wife would wear it more often</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite scent for some years now and I was very pleased to get it from Amazon.com at a savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I purchased it was in Paris and I was concerned that it might not be \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot; when I ordered it online but it was fine..........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your good service and reliability.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Recipient LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my wife for Christmas.  She likes it very much.  She has used this before and was pleased to get another one.  The old one is gone from time.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I ordered L&#x27;Air Du Temps in this large size.  It&#x27;s the real stuff and the price is fantastic.  I used to buy it at a department store for almost double the price.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Classic scent, one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day.  This is a classic fragrance which is still great.  It smells wonderful on my mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This  has been a favorite of mine for a long time. It has a nice, not overpowering smell and I think it smells nice on everyone.&lt;br /&gt;The price was good on Amazon.com,even better than the famous \\&quot;Club\\&quot; price!</li>
            <li> My daughter buys it for me every Christmas and not only do I enjoy the scent all year, I think of her every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Sorry - You get one star and only because it was delivered in a timely fashion.  I got a bottle of what is supposed to be L&#x27;Air du Temps which I have been wearing for forty years, but there isn&#x27;t even any fragrance in the bottle.  What a waste of money.  I should have gone to Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of my favorites.  This was a great price.  It is a nice light but lingering perfume.  It makes one feels like they are out for a stroll in a lovely fragrant garden...Seller shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> this is the perfume I ordered, but it came in a short - fat, round- bottle..very hard to travel with.. I ordered the tall&lt;br /&gt;bottle... so was disappointed in the packaging..will watch that next time I order and if I don&#x27;t get the bottle size&lt;br /&gt;and shape I want I will return it..</li>
            <li> got a great deal compared with other companies. got exactly what i ordered and arrived a week earlier than expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I love this, been using it for years.  Having trouble finding a splash.</li>
            <li> The toilet spray does NOT last at all.  Still love the fragrance.  I&#x27;ll have to spend much more for the perfume.</li>
            <li> Its defiantly the real thing folks, My mother had it before and loved the smell of this wonderful fragrance by Nina Ricci,. When she received the one from Amazon she was so delighted to have it again, and for the price you cant beat it! Its was a pleasure to see my mother open the box and smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;remember that diff people like diff fragrances, so I suggest you test your fav fragrance by going to a mall and find out whats good for you...\\&quot; Hope my suggestion Helps!</li>
            <li> does not smell like the original I used so many years ago - way too sharp and not soft as it was in the past.</li>
            <li> Been using this scent for years, as it it light and not overbearing. I have allergies and most perfumes are way too strong.</li>
            <li> My Wife has be using this for over 35 years, me the kids love the smell of it, so we keep buying it for her and it well worth the Money. Thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> Good price.  I have shopped around and there is a real wide range of prices.  However this one beats any one I have found.  Of course the fragerance is great and definitely not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I have used it forever!  And still love it! It&#x27;s great amazon brings it right to my door. I&#x27;m  older now and it&#x27;s so convenient!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Have used this perfume for years, but the fragrance in this bottle is not very good or true to the original scent. First time bought on line; I guess not a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;Could the product have been exposed to too much heat? Have no idea what happened. Sad.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very attentive seller</li>
            <li> Came in excellent time.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. costs double in stores, good buy</li>
            <li> A classic from 1949. My wife wears this regularly. It&#x27;s her signature fragrance and the one that our children identify her with. Personally, my favorite is \\&quot;So Pretty\\&quot; by Cartier (1995): my wife wore this for a few years and then she became allergic to it, in a manner of speaking. So we&#x27;re back to L&#x27;Air Du Temps.</li>
            <li> Still love this fragrance, always will!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume for many years.  The scent is delicate and feminine.  It is a beautiful fragrance.  I was very pleased to find the item at Amazon.  It is the lowest price I can find.</li>
            <li> The best smelling perfume!!!!! My wife loves it, as well do I !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Took more than a couple of weeks to receive. Would be helpful to know if an item is out of stock when ordering. Glad it was personal and not for a gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mother for her birthday. It is her favorite perfume. What I loved most was the price for such a nice size bottle! She is very pleased and so am I! The shipping was fast too!!! :)</li>
            <li> Have used L&#x27;air Du Temps for many years.  This item is not L&#x27;air Du Temps.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately all the paperwork and packaging was tossed.  I won&#x27;t order scents again.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this every day of my life.. I decided to order it on a whim. Maybe it&#x27;s me, or that he&#x27;s gone, that makes me feel it isn&#x27;t quite the same. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> To me, perfume samples in magazines often smell rather nice, but buy them in the store, and they all smell so similar, almost the same as each other to me and not quite like the sample. Even Poison doesn&#x27;t smell like it used to. L&#x27;air Du Temps is a fragrance all its own! The most unique. It DOESN&#x27;T have the strong cheap girly girly smell, and almost has a hint of a natural musk, yet doesn&#x27;t. (Perhaps that&#x27;s the sandalwood?) It takes on an even better aroma while wearing it.  It&#x27;s the ONLY perfume people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing, not for polite conversation.. but because they actually like it. I have tons of perfume received as gifts. They all smell the same.  I&#x27;ve worn L&#x27;air Du Temps for nearly 30 years and won&#x27;t waste my money on anything else.&lt;br /&gt;If you want something different, unique, this is the one. don&#x27;t wait for evening to wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent all of my adult life.  LOVE IT.  My grandchildren now want to &amp;#34;smell like grandma&amp;#34;  -  when I buy clothing for them, I hang it in the room where I dress and the clothing takes on a light scent of this L&#x27;Air Du Temps.  They extract the clothing from the gift bag and hold it to their noses and breath in and exclaim, &amp;#34;Ahhhh, smells just like Grandma&amp;#34; with great love!</li>
            <li> This product is not widely available in stores anymore but it has been around for ages and many women still love it.  My mother-in-law considers this a staple so I very pleased to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This brand has been around forever. If you know someone who loves wearing it, you can still get it anywhere. I always loved the bottle it comes in and the price is great too!</li>
            <li> I like the perfume, but it&#x27;s not my favorite scent.  I buy and wear it because my husband thinks it smells &amp;#34;special&amp;#34;.  I got a good price through Amazon compared to other stores.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  The parcel arrived in perfect condition, with the cellophane wrapper still on the box of perfume.  This is the real deal, not a knock off fragrance.  The bottle I received was not as pictured but not to worry.  Still has the &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34; topper, but my bottle is wider.  For 3.3 oz, this is a terrific bargain.  I love this scent because it is light and I wear it to work, never had any complaints about this fragrance bothering anyone.  Will order from this supplier again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this perfume - it&#x27;s not too heavy or spicy - just elegant and feminine. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> The item was purchased as a gift, however the box containing the spray says its a Demonstration Tester. I just hope that it is a genuine item and that it is not thrown back at me by the Better Half. Only time will tell. I will keep the box and packaging just in case it has to be returned.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  Its so fresh and flowery.  I get compliments when I walk by someone......so I know its nice.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of my younger days when it was so popular.  Soft, delightful flowery fragrance everybody loves.</li>
            <li> I have worn this light, airy fragrance for 45 years and adore it.  It is not overpowering, but it is identifiable and I get many positive comments on it.  I will wear until I die!</li>
            <li> Same as with Guy Laroche Fidji - hardly any scent p- seems watered down and replica of something.  Always received compliments previously - now can&#x27;t even detect smell myself.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;ALL TIME&amp;#34; favorite from high school (dare I say &#x27;68). I have tried sooo many other fragrances and always go back to this. I have exclusively bought this for many years now. It&#x27;s light and springy, but long lasting. Never overpowering or sickeningly strong. Granted the fragrance will differ on different people, but I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all that matters to me. :)</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance for more than 30 years.  It&#x27;s soft and feminine but not too flowery.  It&#x27;s hard to find and so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I order this for my 79-year-old friend who loves this stuff. Her only comment is that she wishes I could find a bigger bottle online so she wouldn&#x27;t have to order it so often.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years; light, refreshing sent that isn&#x27;t over powering to others around you especially those who have allergies.</li>
            <li> Super Price and Fast Shipping !!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely and light fragrance that I have been wearing for almost 30 years. Over the years, I have gotten a lot of compliments on the way it smells on me so it&#x27;s the perfume I choose to stick with!!  If that&#x27;s not a product endorsement, I don&#x27;t know what is!!</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume since the mid 1970&#x27;s. &amp;#34;My scent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Perfume was great for my mother, great price for the size can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to have the same fragrance as my old bottle when I first opened it.&lt;br /&gt;Will have to wait and see if is the same in a few days of use</li>
            <li> The most romantic perfume on the face of the earth and the skin of my love (or at least I think so, and I&#x27;m pretty sure she does, too). Don&#x27;t pay the outrageous department-store prices; get it here and you can keep the romance going even longer.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, been wearing it for years. Great price and express delivery!</li>
            <li> I have not used this perfume in many years - it brought back old memories...thank you for having it available.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for over 30 years. It is a classic French perfume and timeles, light, floral and feminine. I continue to get more compliments on this one than that other French classic, Chanel No. 5.</li>
            <li> May work for 80 yr old who can&#x27;t smell.. One spray sent my girlfriend running to shower. Was funny. Lol</li>
            <li> Memories surface as I remembered this special scent.&lt;br /&gt;Used for about 30 years and that was years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I am now in my late 70&#x27;s.  My daughters remark that&lt;br /&gt;whenever they smell it - they think of me.&lt;br /&gt;Think I will order&lt;br /&gt;for my memories...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 30 years.  I have paid a fortune for it in high end department stores and loved it when I found I could purchase it online for half the price.  I will use this product as long as I can get it.  It has been my experience that if I really like to use a product, it is immediately discontinued.  I hope this does not happen to L&#x27;Air Du Temps.</li>
            <li> knew before purchase that this is a good, light fragrance for me -&lt;br /&gt;fragrance is very personal choice - don&#x27;t rely on my review if you have never smelled the fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice. The perfume arrived in perfect condition. significantly, it was an international shipping do not spill. The aroma remember me when my mother was young because she use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I first discovered it in France in 1965. I&#x27;ve used nothing else since. My grandsons said, &amp;#34;This is what Nonnie smells like.&amp;#34; I even spray the cards I send them with it so they&#x27;ll think of me with the fragrance. It suits me perfectly and I hope to have many more years with it.</li>
            <li> Mom ran out of her favorite perfume. For the same price local stores  once give you 1.7 oz bottle. This was excellent buy.</li>
            <li> My favorite for years</li>
            <li> Smells like mom. Reminds me of mom. Purchased for mom. Great product, smells great. Do I have mommy issues? Nah - it&#x27;s a great gift, was on her gift list and I am scared of coat hangers.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. I always pay more in stores for a smaller bottle than this! outstanding purchase!!!  Amazon is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for 35 years and always get compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been out if it for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Love it  been using it for 60 years</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I use L&#x27;Air Du Temps. Many buyers write that they are disappointed that they can&#x27;t smell the scent. I believe the main point of wearing perfume is so other people enjoy it. It&#x27;s my experience that family and coworkers associate me with this perfume. I like that because the scent represents clean and sweet. I mostly wear the perfume but I thought I would try the eau de toilette again. It&#x27;s true that I couldn&#x27;t smell it for too long but a coworker immediately said that I smelled clean...that was my goal. (By the way, spray a little on your hair.) If you want a stronger/more lingering scent, buy the perfume.</li>
            <li> My grandmother has been wearing this fragrance for decades and says its harder and harder to come by! Dillards still carries it but for twice the cost! Thanks AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Scent was fresh! I have had problems before getting scents not being fresh and on shelf for long time. This one smell great. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great bargain, shipping and packaging.  Love this famous beloved fragrance!</li>
            <li> My wife says it is a duplicate...... I dont know.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife.  She has used it for years.  Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> This perfume is such a beautiful fragrance.  It is not a really strong fragrance which is perfect for me.  However, it is lovely and others can enjoy it as well when you wear it.  I have a very sensitive sense of smell and always appreciate a beautiful, non over-powering scent.  This perfume has been one of my favorites for years.  I love to wear it in the spring and summer, especially.  You really can wear it all year round of course.  If you want to feel like a feminine woman, this would be an excellent fragrance choice for you. I also love the beautiful bottle it comes in.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This fragrance has been around for 55-60 years at least.  It is a favorite classic that I love to use.  The price was very reasonable.  This seller has great deals and reasonable shipping too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic. She&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It came good terms, It is favorite perfume my mom, We live in Venezuela, All right! Thanks for all! Bye</li>
            <li> I like this product, a good gift for my mom, it&#x27;s portable, an confortable, just what I expected at a great price, she has really enjoyed this product, the product arrived in time, the box was well protected for shipment</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has used this product for over 40 years.  She will not use any other.</li>
            <li> Per my wife, she absolutely love this product...</li>
            <li> Been wearing this product since 1965 and still get many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this spray for many, many years and she as well as I - still find it very pleasing and an excellent value - far preferable to other products which give off less subtle scents.</li>
            <li> A great amount of product for a can&#x27;t beat it price.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a wonderful gift. Classic, very old school. Nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for years and people still compliment me on it.  It is pricey though so I use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in a department store for much more and a lessor quantity, however the scent lasts way longer.  This product only lasts a few hours and is not as strong.  I don&#x27;t understand that as it&#x27;s supposed to be the same product.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume....Gave myself this as a gift....  Love the fragrance....it&#x27;s light...not heavy...pleasant, not offensive....great scent.  Only scent I will use.</li>
            <li> Visited Europe in 1971 with a Eurail pass and on $5 a day.  LOL.  When in Paris I decided to buy a silk scarf and a new fragrance.  Still wearing L&#x27;air Du Temps!  It makes me happy every day. Never considered a change.  So many compliments over 44 years!</li>
            <li> Never disappointed. this is one of our favorites and so we are always happy with a fine product that holds its own..</li>
            <li> This product was bought as a gift for my wife, She has loved this product for more than our 30 years togather.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it. It&#x27;s her favotite.</li>
            <li> great find! Gift recipient was very pleased</li>
            <li> My mom loved it!!! She was trying to find this for years and she got happy when i gave it to her.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this perfume but its so expensive at the chain stores. Got it here at a good price and it came quickly! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> todo perfecto me encanto todo muy responsables producto de mucha calidad..&lt;br /&gt;contenta por todo el servicio prestado.&lt;br /&gt;Aakdfnasfnas askdasfkn aksdfn</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly! My wife loves it.....what else can I say?</li>
            <li> Perfect at a good price</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, it is very feminine and soft, use every day and people love my scent, and besides, the price is very good</li>
            <li> Good service, good price, Mama is very happy... five thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great!  Arrived in original packaging and smelled great!  Been using this for years.  It&#x27;s the only perfume that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, besides finding the smell to be just right--not too sweet or strong.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and good packaging. It is the original - so no comlplaints.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I have used this, and only this, for over 40 years and still do not plan to change.</li>
            <li> I love it!  My favorite summer perfume.  Do you ever have the L&#x27;Air du Temps bath powder as an item?</li>
            <li> My mother in law loved this.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter in law. She grew up smelling this clean scent on her mom growing up, so this smell triggers some good memories. My wife go this same thing from my daughter in law as a gift. I&#x27;m not a fan of perfume, but this has a fresh clean smell to it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is light and not overly strong fragrance. The shipping was super fast.  Excellent product. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for years.  It is very nice not strong smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this. My mom has been looking for it for several years. It was a great gift.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it, which is the only important criterion.  I like it because it is substantially less than retail (when you can find L&#x27;Air in a retail store; it is becoming a kind of an orphan brand).</li>
            <li> Water down perfume. Very low quality. I should have returned it. No smell of perfume. I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife, and now she&#x27;s looking to give it away.&lt;br /&gt;It is described as being floral, and people said in their reviews that it&#x27;s a subtle scent - both of which my wife loves.  To us, this smells like baby powder, which we both hate.  Maybe other reviewers are right and this isn&#x27;t the real thing, I don&#x27;t know, but this also was not &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34;.  My wife felt nauseous after wearing it for a little while.  Once she showered it off, she felt fine.</li>
            <li> This has been my wife&#x27;s favorite for 30 years. It&#x27;s not easy to find locally, so I am glad I can order it here, receive it right at my door on time as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m a hero for a little while and all is well.</li>
            <li> Very good price. It is what me wife uses all the time. Easy to please my wife oor any gift giving day.</li>
            <li> Your prices are always the best and I received it so fast,  I wouldn&#x27;t buy my Nina Ricci anywhere else, infact your prices are great on everything, thats why I shop with you.</li>
            <li> This was the real thing, not an imitation, and the price beat all others I had found. I will be a return customer.</li>
            <li> Nina Ricci is a 30 year favorite and still as timeless. This was a favorite of mine in high school and remains to this day. Finding it on Amazon made my day.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I knew something was wrong. The color of the cologne was darker than it should be and the smell was a bit off telling me that the product is old. I have been wearing the same fragrance for 40 years so I know what it should and shouldn&#x27;t smell like and this definitely was not it. Very upset. Gave it one star because the review wouldn&#x27;t take a minus.</li>
            <li> I have always loved L&#x27;Air Du Temps but there is something wrong with the sprayer on this bottle. It is not a spray, it comes out in a big stream, and soaks me. I&#x27;m so sorry because I love it and will only use as an expensive air freshener.</li>
            <li> this is a eau de toilette very nice, moder, delicate, good fragance, i recommended a lot, its soft, cute, nice to a date</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not as I remembered it after 20 years without it.  Have they changed the formula?  It had a distinctive floral fragrance that is not there now.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and have used this product for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> Smells great and good price</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price on this timeless, lovely fragrance.  I have used this fragrance in the arm months for years and never tire of it.  People will often remark that I smell like spring...that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I get this for my mother...she loves it!</li>
            <li> Great ;&lt;br /&gt;Wife loves it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This cologne has such a light and clean scent.  I never fear that I will overwhelm the people around me.  I always feel comfortable wearing it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet aroma, perfect for every workday use. I&#x27;ll buy it again as soon as my actual bottle is finished</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume!  However, this bottle design, larger size , is NOT easy to hold onto and spray .</li>
            <li> excellent product I love</li>
            <li> Great price!  Great scent (my husband&#x27;s all time favorite!).  Beautiful shiny bottle!  You can&#x27;t go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> The Nina Ricci came in great condition with a few extra&#x27;s to try my mother loved it.  She smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for more than two decades already and I really am loving its scent I no longer want to try other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Use it..have forever...I found this particular bottle less than...don&#x27;t know if the manufacture has changed &amp; weakened the sent?  I still use it, but would buy it in a store.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff can be expensive in stores, great price here. I bought this for my mom and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cologne.  I have been wearing it for over 40 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragance many years ago and I love it, It is one of my preferred lotions but when I&#x27;m going to buy a new one I&#x27;d like to be sure it is original and it is a very good surprise to get it as expected and by this time I got it .I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on this perfume when I wear it.  I feel this is the one for me.  I have received mine yet but will soon.  I&#x27;m looking forward to wearing it again.  The whole set is lovely.</li>
            <li> Great buy, Great Seller!!</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for years. I was glad to find it at this price. Thanks for the great value.</li>
            <li> Great if you get perfume bit toilet is weak.</li>
            <li> It has been years since I have used either the toillette Spray or the perfume.  However, the aroma is still as I remembered, &amp;#34;BEAUTIFUL.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Purchased this perfume for a birthday gift, and if you are looking for this scent, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase. This is the best deal for the size bottle you will get.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> Such a floral sweet &amp; light fragrance . Have used for years!</li>
