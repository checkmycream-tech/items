            <li>It is the &amp;#34; Best &amp;#34; Mascara that I have ever had in the 40 years of wearing make up !</li>
            <li>please reconsider, this product is the best.</li>
            <li>Great product, damaged packaging</li>
            <li>Great product and good price</li>
            <li>And, it is very easy to remove!</li>

            <li>Very pleased with item</li>
            <li>Was glad to have found it</li>
            <li>Love love love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the mascara can&#x27;t find in stores now</li>
            <li>pleased with my purchase..</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Quick and what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I was so Happy to finally find my discontinued mascara .</li>
            <li>Fabulous product that has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>Have some on right now.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>The primer makes it so much easier to take off the mascara, not to say that my lashes are thicker and look longer.</li>
            <li>she couldn&#x27;t get much out of it.</li>
            <li>My sister says that some of them seem to be old.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I had ordered another product but when I received and applied it on my lashes, I was pleasantly surprised to like the color and the affect it gave me.</li>
            <li>I bought a bunch of these because it is the only mascara that makes my lashes look long and full.</li>
            <li>With thin lashes its easy to smear onto eyelid on the first application, with this it doesn&#x27;t show if it happens.</li>
            <li>Gives enough body after clear application to prevent errors.</li>
            <li>My lashes look long and lush.</li>
