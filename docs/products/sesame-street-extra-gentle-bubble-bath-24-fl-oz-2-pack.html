            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>There are so many bubbles made from two capfuls that he “hides” his toys in the “bubble clouds”.  </li>

            <li>My son love these bubbles.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is sensitive on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a nice light scent to it that many sensitive bath products lack..</li>
            <li>hmm let me check amazon , and surely they had it on here , more bottles for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin, so I was happy to find a reasonably priced bubble bath that doesn&#x27;t cause my son to break out into rash.  </li>
            <li>This set didn&#x27;t produce as many bubbles as the first time I ordered this.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this at the Safeway (too high) and thought</li>
            <li>and this produces more than enough bubbles and fun.  </li>
            <li>We switched to a new brand that was a bit more expensive but had better quality ingredients and produced more bubbles</li>
            <li>my son and i love this bubble bath--the bubbles get huge, and it&#x27;s the only one we&#x27;ve found that the bubbles don&#x27;t taste soapy--which makes it more fun for him to eat, and makes me worry less about any bubble bath left on his skin.</li>
            <li>And you only need to use a little for a lot of bubbly fun, my kids love it to!</li>
            <li>Good product, poor packaging.</li>
            <li>Makes good bubbles and my children don&#x27;t have any issues with it irritating their skin at all.</li>
            <li>We have a 3 year-old who is very sensitive when it comes to anything getting in his eyes</li>
            <li>My two year old asks for an Elmo Bubble Bath every night.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s got sensitive skin and never an issue with rashes.  </li>
            <li>Also it is twice as much here as it is in your local discount store.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sesem to bother my 2 year old (he has sensitive skin and a bit of eczema).</li>
            <li>It really softens the water and the bubbles do last.</li>
            <li>The kids had fun, but both of them had a slight red rash from the product.</li>
            <li>The main problem we have now is getting him to want to stop playing in the bubbles and dry off!</li>

My son has very sensitive skin, so I was happy to find a reasonably priced bubble bath that doesn&#x27;t cause my son to break out into rash.  Also, it has a nice light scent to it that many sensitive bath products lack.. We will be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> For the price you just cannot beat these bath bubbles!  We have a 3 year-old who is very sensitive when it comes to anything getting in his eyes and these bubbles do not bother him at all.  The suggested amount is two capfuls and this produces more than enough bubbles and fun.  There are so many bubbles made from two capfuls that he “hides” his toys in the “bubble clouds”.  We still use tear-free shampoo and soap to wash his body but having a bubble bath makes bath time a little easier.  The main problem we have now is getting him to want to stop playing in the bubbles and dry off!</li>
            <li> TRUE BUBBLE BATH!!!  I had bought a couple other kinds before and either they made pathetic bubbles or my son&#x27;s skin reacted to it.  This stuff is excellent.  Good long-lasting bubbles, great price, Elmo on the front, and no reactions to my toddler&#x27;s skin!!  Win-win!</li>
            <li> Great bubbles and great fun.</li>
            <li> I think they changed their formula. This set didn&#x27;t produce as many bubbles as the first time I ordered this. We switched to a new brand that was a bit more expensive but had better quality ingredients and produced more bubbles</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff. Bubbles galore. My two year old asks for an Elmo Bubble Bath every night. He&#x27;s got sensitive skin and never an issue with rashes.  Lasts a long time...Great value.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this bubble bath. It smells great and is sensitive on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>

            <li> Good stuff, kids love</li>
            <li> Contains skin irritants/toxic ingredients (Sodium laureth sulfate, fragrances etc). Also it is twice as much here as it is in your local discount store.</li>
            <li> Great value and lots of bubbles for the bath. :)</li>
            <li> This seems to cause fewer tears than the Mr Bubble</li>
            <li> The kids had fun, but both of them had a slight red rash from the product. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> Best bubble bath I have ever used. We get bubbles a foot deep. I found it helps if you don&#x27;t get in the tub until the bubbles are already established.</li>
            <li> Good product, poor packaging. Shipped in a box within a bag, but the cap popped open and leaked about an ounce of liquid.</li>
            <li> Smells so good!  Makes good bubbles and my children don&#x27;t have any issues with it irritating their skin at all.</li>
            <li> My son love these bubbles. Great value as well.</li>
            <li> Good bubbles, good price, prime shipping, nuff said. As a bonus, my kid loves seeing Elmo on the bottle!</li>
            <li> Excellent delevery, excellent product. like my soon</li>
            <li> Creates good amount of bubbles.  Like the fact that it&#x27;s hypoallergenic.  Doesn&#x27;t sesem to bother my 2 year old (he has sensitive skin and a bit of eczema).</li>
            <li> Great bubble bath. My husband will not let me buy any other for our son. It really softens the water and the bubbles do last.</li>
