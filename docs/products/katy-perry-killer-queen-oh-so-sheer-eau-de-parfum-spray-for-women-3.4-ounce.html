            <li>She got it for Mother&#x27;s Day, and now I&#x27;m her favorite son!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>awsome perfume light scent and great value</li>
            <li>Scent does fade too quick but it still smells great.</li>
            <li>I really really love this perfume....</li>
            <li>Love this smell more than the original killer queen scent.</li>
            <li>It scenes isn&#x27;t to strong n</li>
            <li>but its nothing really unique.</li>
            <li>The bottle is really cool.</li>
            <li>Smells too sweet for me...</li>
            <li>So fresh and pretty!</li>

            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than the red Killer Queen.</li>
            <li>This perfume has less red berries and patchouli, and has more gourmand notes like praline and caramel (my faves).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of Katy Perry&#x27;s music, and I&#x27;m really far off from her target group, but I like what I like....</li>

            <li> , i wear it as a everyday and use the red killer queen at night if i go out.</li>
            <li> last on me at least half day</li>
            <li> The bottle is oddly shaped and does not come with a stand...</li>
