            <li> But true - I can&#x27;t wear secret, or practically any other antiperspirants out there, so I’ve been trying to just use natural deodorants - which we all know don&#x27;t work.  </li>

            <li> I recently thought I was buying what was pictured and received the &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; crystal breeze which smells terrible.</li>
            <li> deodorants just smell awful with their fake scents and linger on clothing even after washing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> ...the packaging for this product was terrible.</li>

            <li> This is a very excellent product, especially for those of us who are very allergic to most anti-perspirants. This does not irritate nor does it have any fragrance. And the size is perfect for traveling with carry-on luggage -- it weighs in under TSA guidelines. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I placed this order for my mother&#x27;s boyfriend, who cannot buy it locally.  It was received timely and correct.  No problems.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the old original!</li>
            <li> Great deodorant great price cannot be purchased anywhere retail.</li>
            <li> I used to get this at the dollar store .. They don&#x27;t carry it anymore . This product works&lt;br /&gt;Like no other !!!  Buy it once and you will be hooked !</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m not sure why Dial does not stick it on the shelves.</li>
            <li> Dial crystal breeze roll on was first provided to me at the hospital,  This product  provides outstanding protection.I am unable to purchase it  at local stores</li>
            <li> Not easy to find any longer, unfortunately. I bought several.&lt;br /&gt;Most deodorants just smell awful with their fake scents and linger on clothing even after washing.&lt;br /&gt;This product is so pleasant and light. Don&#x27;t need much and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Dial company has blown it discontinuing this....who made that decision? And why. I recently thought I was buying what was pictured and received the &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; crystal breeze which smells terrible. Hope I can send back. PU.</li>
            <li> ...the packaging for this product was terrible. The cap on one of the bottles was loose and it leaked. But not too much spilled, so I just cleaned it off. The product itself is excellent. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, but very effective. Works very well with my body&#x27;s chemistry to eliminate odor.  Wish I had discovered it many years ago.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommended. Clean scent, dries fast &amp; clear. Long lasting and strong. Awesome to have a reliable source.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive pits. Yes, that&#x27;s gross. But true - I can&#x27;t wear secret, or practically any other antiperspirants out there, so I’ve been trying to just use natural deodorants - which we all know don&#x27;t work.  My mom had me try this, which I then assumed was some old lady product - but it works great - no rashing or irritation.  Smells pleasant as well - not too strong, but enough so you know you&#x27;ve got some on.</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised. This is the only deodorant my nephew can use. I was surprised but pleased that I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne or perfume, rolls on and dries quick, no messy white residue to get on clothes or stain undershirts, small bottle is easy to travel with and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in the bathroom. Very effective, and not overpriced. I have had some luck finding it in local dollar stores very cheap but it&#x27;s hit and miss. And it&#x27;s made in the USA!</li>
            <li> Item arrived very quickly and order was accurate.</li>
            <li> I love this hard to find product because it works very well for me.  I would definitely recommend it to others especially now that I know where to find it.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great!!  I have been using it for about 2 years, maybe longer!  Stays on all day!</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores only deo that works for me!</li>
