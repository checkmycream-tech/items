            <li>Perfect for dry winter skin!</li>

            <li>Hard to determine the best lotion when there are so many out there</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a week now and can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Worth what I paid for it and more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>

            <li>It has a really nice thick texture and is nicely fragrant.</li>
            <li>so I liked the fact that this one only had</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>

            <li>I love the smell and the container is a larger container as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, fresh scent, and very soothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually very picky when it comes to moisturizers.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of the perfume &amp;#34;light blue&amp;#34; by Dolce &amp; Gabana but obviously much lighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of anything organic and was excited to try this lotion.</li>
            <li>Good for daily use and will keep my dry skin feeling baby soft all winter.</li>
            <li>, I was hesitant to put this on my face because my face is really sensitive and gets red and irritated easy</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It absorbed instantly and didn&#x27;t feel like I had even put anything on.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to have overly oily skin or super dry skin.</li>

            <li>keeps my face soft.</li>
            <li>My old lotion was organic but it had a ton of ingredients</li>
            <li>This one surprised me and does not leave the greasy feeling after you rub it in.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling, just soft, moisturized skin.  </li>
            <li>The jojoba oil really helps with dry skin!</li>
            <li>that had me itching all over, I took Benedryl, of course, but had my husband rub this all over my back and arms and it truly helped calm the itching down until the medicine kicked in.  </li>
            <li>I live in AZ and suffer from dry cracking skin around my nails.</li>

            <li> Great Product!!! Natural ingredients to moisturize your Face &amp; Body, Great for winter season to soften and repair damaged skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very picky when it comes to moisturizers. Most claim to hydrate but they don&#x27;t. I can honestly say this Perennial Essentials Face and Body moisturizer hydrates. My husband has really dry skin, especially around his elbows. Since he started using this moisturizer his skin looks so much better. His elbows are no longer cracked and dry. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> My wife just love this stuff.  Great value! Worth what I paid for it and more.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a light pleasant smell that I can’t quite identify but it isn’t an overpowering fragrance but I think smells nice.  This is a white creamy lotion with a soft smooth texture that actually makes my skin feel cooler and refreshed when I apply.  The cream is not greasy and absorbs into my skin quickly and made my skin feel softer.  This also didn’t bother or irritate my skin at all.  It appears to have natural ingredients which I prefer.  The container and label has an almost homemade look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 and a half stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hard to determine the best lotion when there are so many out there but this is definitely what I have settled on! If you&#x27;re looking for a great new one to try and stick with, this is it!</li>
            <li> Great product my wife absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Makes my skin so soft and smells wonderful. Good for daily use and will keep my dry skin feeling baby soft all winter.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The moisturizer smells great and does not leave an oily residue. My husband bought it a couple of weeks ago and I&#x27;ve used it every day. I couldn&#x27;t believe it when he said he bought it for a penny, so I ordered my own!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my face all winter and my skin has never felt so soft or hydrated. I will never use any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This organic moisturizer is light, non-greasy and leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated.  Has a fresh scent too!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion!  I was looking for something that would work well on my hands after washing dishes.  This helps my hands from being dry, smells great, and it fits nicely on my window sill right next to my sink.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic. just got order today.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice thick texture and is nicely fragrant.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b3d3bc6e68c60dac3341beb91f90b507]] I&#x27;m doing this review with a bad cold, so excuse me for my nasal voice :)&lt;br /&gt;All together it is a really nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the video and decide for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please click the button to let me know if this review was helpful in making your decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This perennial essentials face moisturizer smells good keeps my face soft. It keeps it moisterized but not oily which I hate so you don&#x27;t have to have overly oily skin or super dry skin. I love the smell and the container is a larger container as well.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure because the packaging isn&#x27;t impressive and the natural aloe fragrance seemed strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product is impressive! I put some only on my hands at first and an entire day later my cuticles were still smooth and moist. I live in AZ and suffer from dry cracking skin around my nails. Now I apply this once a day and my fingers feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started using this on the bags under my eyes and have noticed a difference in my appearance. No bullsh*t and I am a MAN btw.</li>
            <li> A MUST get! After trying many, many products and them collecting dust in my bathroom, I&#x27;m happy to have found THE product that works :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of anything organic and was excited to try this lotion. I didn&#x27;t expect it to smell so good. The smell reminds me of the perfume &amp;#34;light blue&amp;#34; by Dolce &amp; Gabana but obviously much lighter. You would only smell it if someone hugged you. I actually put it on more than once a day because the smell is so pleasant and it didn&#x27;t get oily or flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry spots on my body while other parts like my chest can get oily so I wanted something that helped to balance my skins PH and this seemed to do the trick. It absorbed instantly and didn&#x27;t feel like I had even put anything on. My old lotion was organic but it had a ton of ingredients so I liked the fact that this one only had 17.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was hesitant to put this on my face because my face is really sensitive and gets red and irritated easy but it felt amazing and I didn&#x27;t break out. Will be buying this as a gift for my sister!</li>
            <li> I work at a local gas station so I am always washing my hands multiple times a day which cause my hands to be so dry. I have been using this product for about a week now and can tell a huge difference. I am not really one to like lotions and moisturizers because I do not like the greasy feeling they leave behind. This one surprised me and does not leave the greasy feeling after you rub it in. Does not have a strong smell to it either which I like considering I use it a few times a day. The only thing that I did not like was that the package did not come sealed and the outside of the bottle looked a little dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item at a discounted rate for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Great product for ageless beauty!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and have ended up using it myself! This is a great product. The jojoba oil really helps with dry skin!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I would use this moisturizer every single day. I love that it&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I have super dry skin on my face and this is not heavy or greasy but it makes my skin feel hydrated and refreshed!</li>
            <li> This is some awesome stuff!  I love the natural ingredients...and the scent is perfect, light and fresh!!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling, just soft, moisturized skin.  Even my daughter loved it.  If it comes up missing I know she took it!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review...and honestly, I love it!!   Edit: 3 weeks of using this product every day and I love it more each time I think!  It seems like it&#x27;s going to last a while.  My skin feels awesome and never oily, but well moisturized.  I had an allergic reaction the other night to something (not this moisturizer!!) that had me itching all over, I took Benedryl, of course, but had my husband rub this all over my back and arms and it truly helped calm the itching down until the medicine kicked in.  For real...best stuff ever.</li>
            <li> My hands are extremely dry this winter and this product has been wonderful.  No more cracking, chapping, and redness.  Non-greasy, fresh scent, and very soothing.</li>
            <li> This lotion is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold! This lotion  so hydrating without leaving you feeling greasy! Perfect for dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> Excellent on my skin.</li>
