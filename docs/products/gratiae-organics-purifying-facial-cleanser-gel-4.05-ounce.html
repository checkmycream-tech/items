            <li>This cleanser scrubs away oils and dirt and leaves your face feeling clean and fresh.</li>

            <li>this is the second time I order it because it works amazingly</li>
            <li>in action that they make sure the customer is taken care of.  </li>
            <li>The product is okay, but I have used other purifying cleansers that work as well, for a much better price.</li>
            <li>And in combination with the other products I think I have made a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the Gratiae products in general and buy them all from Amazon now.</li>
            <li>It has an exfoliant scrub in it and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I purchased this product from Amazon, and not from the Gratiae website.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it in the shopping centre.</li>
            <li>I use this one or two times a week for a bit more deep cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I love these products, especially the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love this facial wash.</li>
            <li>Found same product on Amazon at a more affordable price.  </li>
            <li>I am 54 years old, had rosacea when I was in my 20s, and am still very  sensitive to so many products.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, my face feels smooth and not dry.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>I found it much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Really work well, my serum really soaks in after using this product</li>
            <li>I really like this product and even at the price recommend it.</li>
            <li>This cleanser cleans my face very well and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.  </li>
            <li>I went home and it was very expenisve.  </li>
            <li>It really has helped my oily skin.</li>
            <li>That being said, I think the product is fantastic and it regularly helps with my acne problems.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of other brands of skin care you find at high-end department stores and have not been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is great for sloughing off dead skin that dulls the complexion.</li>
            <li>I informed the packing department that my purchase arrived cut at the top of the tube and half of the contents spilled out in the packaging.</li>
            <li>It is gentle - not harsh.</li>
            <li>If I use it more then a few times a week it is to abrasive on my skin.</li>
            <li>However, I did become concerned because of other reviews of Gratiae products and also there is a HUGE price difference with Gratiae website and Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I requested that I either be sent a new tube or a refund of my money.</li>
            <li>The first bottle of this stuff I actually purchased at a kiosk at the mall</li>
            <li>I had used this facial cleanser/scrub when first introduced to Gratiae one year ago.  </li>
            <li>It has beads in it to help exfoliate, but is calm enough that it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin, it is hard to find a good exfoliating cleanser that doesn&#x27;t completely dry my skin out</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m beyond excited that Amazon sells it for less even with the cost of shipping.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, and I am a red head with very ruddy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I need something to clear up my acne and blemishes</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t found anything so far.</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really like it and have started using it daily.  </li>
            <li>It sloughs off the dead skin cells and built-up cells on your skin helps to keep your skin looking glowing and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Small gentle circular motions is all the pressure you need to use, splash clean and your skin will not feel tight but it will glow and your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li>No dry feelings after wash.</li>
            <li>I tried a few of the Gratiae products at a kiosk in the mall and was pretty blown away.</li>

            <li> I tried a few of the Gratiae products at a kiosk in the mall and was pretty blown away.</li>
            <li> I have moderate skin, that is very sensitive to harsh products such as proactive.</li>
            <li> it would just take too long to return and then re-order.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using it either.</li>
            <li> A year ago, I spent almost $300 for these same products and now I can get the same products for less!</li>
            <li> , skin appears to be lightened (like the cleanser removed all traces of gunk leftover from what normal face wash leaves behind) and my face is left matte and not greasy or dry.</li>
            <li> I gave this only 3 stars because when I received this product it was half gone.</li>
            <li> I had written a previous review about this product about how it didn&#x27;t come in time, but I understand that it was only the fault of the United States Postal Service and not the sellers.</li>
            <li> I only bought the body scrub though because the products are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I did not want to send it back because of to much trouble and was not going to pay to have it returned.</li>
            <li> is NOT like the cheapy apricot scrub from St. Ives.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very tiny granules and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin raw or over scrubbed.</li>
            <li> A little of it goes a long way so a tube lasts months.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find the other product that I tried and thought this might be it</li>
            <li> I cant wait to try other products from this brand</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over a year I&#x27;ve always suffered from acne due to sensitive skin and this cleanser is the only thing that has improved my complexion tried it out once in Vegas was angry to find out I over paid for it there...</li>
            <li> Again, you don&#x27;t need to scrub hard its not necessary</li>
            <li> Does feel a little greasy after but my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not ok for everyday use, because there is scrubbing ingredient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly thick formula so it doens&#x27;t run thru your fingers or down your face.</li>
            <li> This product also helps with small cuts and wounds...</li>
            <li> at least - I like lavender / citrus fragrances...</li>
            <li> Used everyday and lasted 11 months!!!</li>
            <li> not happy with this product</li>
            <li> I am unsure if this product is real or a fake.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this cleanser. I have &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; skin (prone to clogged pores) and this works great to exfoliate gently. My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using it either.</li>
            <li> The first bottle of this stuff I actually purchased at a kiosk at the mall and I was suckered into paying almost $60 for this product!! The only reason why I purchased it at the time was because I loved how after washing my face it leaves my faced looking like it has a glow, skin appears to be lightened (like the cleanser removed all traces of gunk leftover from what normal face wash leaves behind) and my face is left matte and not greasy or dry. Definitely a product that I will use for life so I&#x27;m beyond excited that Amazon sells it for less even with the cost of shipping.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, that is why I ordered but the expiry date is too soon.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that is why they put it on special</li>

            <li> A year ago, I spent almost $300 for these same products and now I can get the same products for less!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product and the order process.</li>
            <li> I informed the packing department that my purchase arrived cut at the top of the tube and half of the contents spilled out in the packaging. I requested that I either be sent a new tube or a refund of my money. I haven&#x27;t heard from anyone there. This was the first time I purchased this product from Amazon, and not from the Gratiae website. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with packaging before.  Jim Antenucci</li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s exfoliating properties. Does feel a little greasy after but my skin is glowing. Would recommend to my best girl friends.</li>
            <li> Paying premium for organic label I guess - smells wierd - not my taste at least - I like lavender / citrus fragrances...</li>
            <li> This product also helps with small cuts and wounds...</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought it. The first time I bought it in the shopping centre. No doubt it is much more expensive. The one I bought here definitely is the same as the one in the shop. I love it!</li>
            <li> Never get a chance to use the product as it exploded in the packaging. I gave it a 1 because I did not get the option to re-order instead of returned. it would just take too long to return and then re-order. packaging could have been better than an envelope and ziplock bag</li>
            <li> I bought two by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT like the cheapy apricot scrub from St. Ives.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very tiny granules and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin raw or over scrubbed. I use it twice a day, and I am a red head with very ruddy sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a seller that truly cares for the customer!  It&#x27;s not just in word, but in action that they make sure the customer is taken care of.  Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried a few of the Gratiae products at a kiosk in the mall and was pretty blown away. I only bought the body scrub though because the products are a little pricey. I wanted to find the other product that I tried and thought this might be it but I don&#x27;t think so. I need something to clear up my acne and blemishes but I haven&#x27;t found anything so far. This smells good and its ok but I thought it would be better.</li>
            <li> great and cleared up skin.  However, I did become concerned because of other reviews of Gratiae products and also there is a HUGE price difference with Gratiae website and Amazon.  This made me a bit suspicious.  I am unsure if this product is real or a fake.</li>
            <li> Bought it in Vegas last year for a lot of money. I found it much cheaper. I love the product..</li>
            <li> not happy with this product</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful line of skin care products.  The cleanser is great for sloughing off dead skin that dulls the complexion.</li>
            <li> I returned this because it is listed and described as a cleanser when in actual fact it is a scrub, like St Ives Apricot Facial Scrub. I wanted a cleanser. If I had wanted a scrub I would have looked for that. I thought it was quite nice though.</li>
            <li> Really work well, my serum really soaks in after using this product</li>
            <li> This cleanser scrubs away oils and dirt and leaves your face feeling clean and fresh. A little of it goes a long way so a tube lasts months. I really like this product and even at the price recommend it.</li>
            <li> The cleanser has microbeads in it that exfoliates the skin. I have oily skin and large pores. I only use this two to three times a week. It does make the skin feel nice and smooth and brighter. If I use it more then a few times a week it is to abrasive on my skin. I tend to have sensitive skin. I do recommend it, it has a very nice smell to it. I do feel like my skin is cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li> The product is okay, but I have used other purifying cleansers that work as well, for a much better price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleanser!  I have used Mary Kay, Avon, Olay &amp; Proactive.  It has beads in it to help exfoliate, but is calm enough that it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It has an exfoliant scrub in it and it&#x27;s very gentle. i have super sensitive skin and this one makes my skin feel wonderful. It&#x27;s a fairly thick formula so it doens&#x27;t run thru your fingers or down your face.</li>
            <li> I gave this only 3 stars because when I received this product it was half gone. It leaked in shipping. The bottom of the cleanser had split open. I did not want to send it back because of to much trouble and was not going to pay to have it returned. They need to pack their products better when they are shipped. Even if I like this product I will not order from this company ever again. I find it from another shipper.</li>
            <li> GRATiAE is a wonderful product line. I love using the products every day knowing it is organic and makes me feel great. I have used their products for a year now and highly recommend their line to anyone who likes to pamper your skin and feel good about how you look. When you use the cleanser, it feels like it will be greasy but after rinsing, it leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky. I have tried lots of other brands of skin care you find at high-end department stores and have not been pleased with the results. GRATiAE is my go to from now on. I am very happy with the fact I found it here on Amazon! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> THis product is great for my skin it leaves it soft and clean. this is the second time I order it because it works amazingly</li>
            <li> I use this one or two times a week for a bit more deep cleansing.  Is a mild exfoliant product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!  Having sensitive skin, it is hard to find a good exfoliating cleanser that doesn&#x27;t completely dry my skin out but this cleanser gets the job done and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth.  For anyone with rosacea or problem skin, try this cleanser.  It does so much more than just clean your skin...it&#x27;s as if it helps repair it!  Try it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love these products, especially the cleanser. My skin is so smooth and soft and it seems to even make my skin tone more even. A must have.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gratiae facial cleaner for a week now and have been very pleased.  I am 54 years old, had rosacea when I was in my 20s, and am still very  sensitive to so many products.  This cleanser cleans my face very well and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.  Afterwards, my face feels smooth and not dry.  I have purchased the moisturizer as well and love them both!  Amazon&#x27;s prices are amazing for all the Gratiae products.</li>
            <li> I love this facial wash. I use it once every two days. It exfoliates and brightens my skin. It smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling smooth and also gives it a clean glow. I have moderate skin, that is very sensitive to harsh products such as proactive. I cant wait to try other products from this brand</li>
            <li> It works for me. I tried it in the mall but bought it on amazon. And in combination with the other products I think I have made a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Purchased 1st tube 9 months ago in Las Vegas, just ran out.  Found same product on Amazon at a more affordable price.  Good for dry skin and feels good after washing.</li>
            <li> Does the job...  I am over 50 and find this is a spectacular product.  I wish I would have discovered this line twenty years ago.</li>
            <li> I had used this facial cleanser/scrub when first introduced to Gratiae one year ago.  I tried to order it through Amazon but they were always was out.  Well, they finally had it and I got it!  This is a great facial cleanser/scrub to use 2 or 3 times a week!  It sloughs off the dead skin cells and built-up cells on your skin helps to keep your skin looking glowing and fresh.  This is the product to use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for anyone ages 30 and on up.  It is gentle - not harsh.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice smelling product that works well.  Has tiny micro-type beads to help exfoliate.  I really like it and have started using it daily.  I love the Gratiae products in general and buy them all from Amazon now.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser and exfoliater.</li>
            <li> Feel clean after use. No dry feelings after wash. but it&#x27;s not ok for everyday use, because there is scrubbing ingredient.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely incredible. A pea size amount is all you need! The smell alone is so wonderful. I have tried EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN and this is my HOLY GRAIL of face wash. It makes my skin feel soft, smooth, supple and healthy. Small gentle circular motions is all the pressure you need to use, splash clean and your skin will not feel tight but it will glow and your skin will thank you. Again, you don&#x27;t need to scrub hard its not necessary the beads do not dissolve so just relax and give your skin a nice gentle experience with this AMAZING product. THANK YOU GRATIAE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in Las Vegas and loved it ended up buying it there&lt;br /&gt;before I went home and it was very expenisve.  I was so happy to see it on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;at a much better price.  It really has helped my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Ok, but like Aha cleansing &amp; peeiling foam better</li>
            <li> I had written a previous review about this product about how it didn&#x27;t come in time, but I understand that it was only the fault of the United States Postal Service and not the sellers. That being said, I think the product is fantastic and it regularly helps with my acne problems. It smells wonderful, and it gives me a good feeling knowing that I am using a product free of harsh chemicals.</li>
