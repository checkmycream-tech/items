            <li>The size is too large!</li>

            <li>Product was reasonable priced.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles here, but this was really unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this product, it worked very well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>they really do.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for an older parents needs</li>
            <li>Very suitable for Chinese mothers because they must stay in bed for a month after the production, it is a traditional Chinese</li>
            <li>Can be warmed slightly in a microwave, which is good for those who are fragile.</li>
            <li>and I love the &amp;#34;no mess, waterless&amp;#34; feature.</li>

            <li>It was as if I took a normal shower and didn&#x27;t rinse out the conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot imagine using this on a normal day like some of the posters are saying.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I really tested that, though, because I could only stand the smell for about an hour.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my mom who was unable to get up and was able to at least keep her hair fairly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in much too fragile of a state to really buff or towel dry my hair, so maybe that was part of the problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was worth it to use this once to get out the grime from an accident/illness/etc, but not worth the price after that.  </li>
            <li>I just had major spinal surgery and bought this to get me through while I was in the hospital.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I struggled with getting all parts of my hair wet, due to needing to \\&quot;fold\\&quot; my hair to fit it all in the cap.</li>

            <li> I purchased this product for myself. I had a serious illness in 2008, leaving me unable to do minor things for myself. My husband went in the hospital, so I decided to try these caps to gain some of my independence back and I loved them. Thank you</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;no water\\&quot; hair washing product works great. A microwave is helpful to warm the package up, but could be used for camping I suppose.</li>
            <li> As with most no-rinse shampoos, this tends to leave a bit of a residue. It is wonderful for those people who are completely bedfast. Bought it for my mom who was unable to get up and was able to at least keep her hair fairly. Can be warmed slightly in a microwave, which is good for those who are fragile.</li>
            <li> Product was reasonable priced.  Arrived when expected.  Ordered it to help with post surgical recovery.  It allows you to wash your hair and feel better after surgery without leaving the hospital bed.</li>
            <li> My family loves it! It is easy to use and the quality is good considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and would like to recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I just had major spinal surgery and bought this to get me through while I was in the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got one star because it did work to get out the blood, iodine, etc that I was dealing with post-op.  It did, technically, clean my hair.  And the smell was MUCH better than the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the residue it left was horrible.  There is NO way this product left my hair in any condition to &#x27;style&#x27;. It was as if I took a normal shower and didn&#x27;t rinse out the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in much too fragile of a state to really buff or towel dry my hair, so maybe that was part of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was worth it to use this once to get out the grime from an accident/illness/etc, but not worth the price after that.  For more than $5.50 PER USE, it should&#x27;ve worked better.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles here, but this was really unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot imagine using this on a normal day like some of the posters are saying.  The residue is insane, especially for $5.50 a pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, my adult handicap daughter just won&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> These shampoo caps are great. I use them for hiking and ski camping when I cant wash my hair. They are like heavy plastic on the outside with a fleecy type lining on the inside impregnated with the shampoo. You just put them on and massage your scalp (feels great!) and then pull the cap off, comb your hair and wow! Clean soft and sweet smelling hair.</li>
            <li> My Daughter had Surgery. She was un able to wash her&lt;br /&gt;hair for several months. I recommend this product, it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;  Nancy Sifford</li>
            <li> Very suitable for Chinese mothers because they must stay in bed for a month after the production, it is a traditional Chinese</li>
            <li> The size is too large! My hairs kept escaping from the cap.&lt;br /&gt;Washing result is not good at all. Feel like using condition without using shampoo.</li>
            <li> wish the price would of been better. It is A bit high for one shampoo cap. Was easy to use and worked great love it.!</li>
            <li> Last November 2011 i was very sick, and No Rinse Shampoo was used twice on me, once coming from the microwave very hot.  About three months later, my hair started falling out and hasn&#x27;t stopped  yet (now end of April 2012).  I do not recommend this product as i have had to buy a wig to cover the loss of hair. After researching this end result, i am not the only one experiencing this result.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend - no mess but does a excellent job of shampooing hair.  Hair comes out clean, oil free and soft.</li>
            <li> bought these for my grandmother when we were having problems moving her around. i bought them, based on reviews, truly hoping they worked. they really do. fast &amp; easy!</li>
            <li> I know it says do not reuse, but I&#x27;ve used it twice and works AWESOME! warm in microwave 15 seconds, scrub your scalp really well and comb through hair.</li>
            <li> The product performs well. It is convenient to use easy to store and is cost effective.It has a nice smell&lt;br /&gt;MJL</li>
            <li> Easy to use: Put on cap. Massage hair through cap. Remove and thoroughly towel dry. Longer inconvenient to shampoo the day gives me a surprise.</li>
            <li> Perfect for elder care</li>
            <li> thank you  just right</li>
            <li> Easy to use and leaves you feeling as clean and fresh as if you had taken an actual water-rinse shower.</li>
            <li> perfect for my grandma</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I was having a back surgery that would make me unable to take a shower for two weeks.

It left residue in my hair and I never felt that my hair was very clean. I struggled with getting all parts of my hair wet, due to needing to \\&quot;fold\\&quot; my hair to fit it all in the cap. However, I do think this product would work well for shorter hair, and the ability to warm it up is very nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband to try, between showers.  He has ms and a spinal cord injury and it&#x27;s very difficult for him to wash his hair, even when using a shower chair and a water-spray hose.  He has not tried this product yet, but after reading the reviews, it sounds like it will be a perfect alternative for him.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, convenient and I love the &amp;#34;no mess, waterless&amp;#34; feature. Very helpful for an older parents needs</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it got my hair very clean. I can&#x27;t say I really tested that, though, because I could only stand the smell for about an hour. Then, in spite of having had surgery two days before, I got myself to a sink and washed my hair.</li>
