            <li>Great set.</li>

            <li>And the best part is I was able to purchase this item for an outstanding price (sale + coupon).</li>
            <li>I absolutely am in love with the Gillette Fusion Proglide razors!</li>
            <li>I thought it was great, cheap all around with an amazing cut.</li>
            <li>because I always shave with a fair amount of nice shaving gel (Schick Hydro gel for Sensitive Skin is superb!).</li>
            <li>Special edition and great price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the best razor so far to be the Schick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth, efficient razor and the husband is pleased! :)</li>
            <li>And the packaging is a lot better this time.</li>
            <li>Love this razor, just wished the blade replacements could be cheaper</li>
            <li>Simply put one of the best razors on the market.</li>
            <li>As a men I&#x27;ve used so many others and nothing else compares to it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to others :)</li>
            <li>i love this razor..</li>
            <li>Well, turns out I like this much better than my Fusion Power</li>
            <li>Always on the lookout for a better razor.</li>
            <li>This Gillette Fusion Proglide seems to &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; more than the Hydro 5, IMO.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the Schick Hydro 5 (unless) until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>For the price, I have paid and also getting 2 free cartridges, can&#x27;t beat this deal!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love this gem.</li>
            <li>surely will feel difference from Mach3 , way better than Mach3.</li>
            <li>But pricy for sure.</li>
            <li>Now, I looked at the reviews for this saying Hydro 5 is better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best shave I ever had in my life, and I don&#x27;t mind paying $10 extra every 6-9 months for a better experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- Your experience may be different, but this is the best shave of my life</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes out of box with a razor holder which most gillette razors have, but others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I never had it so easy.</li>
            <li>Also, I strongly recommend buying the Proglide shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Also, I strongly recommend buying the Proglide shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Good product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Hands down, Gillette Proglide is the best razor in the market.</li>
            <li>and it came quickly (even though it was on backorder!)</li>
            <li>Smooth shaves, and well built</li>
            <li>shave was smooth and close&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>and you will have yourself a buttery smooth face</li>
            <li>And the price is quite excellent, would recommend for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li>Not everyone cares to pay for it, but it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
            <li>Smooth clean shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li>i switched my original order from a fusion power to this thinking</li>
            <li>If you need new right away, it&#x27;s a good deal.  </li>
            <li>I actually got a Fusion Proglide for free on a bottle of Head and Shoulders, loved it, and then saw this gold one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female, but in terms of how good a razor is</li>
            <li>I wish this came with a full sized holster like the others.</li>
            <li>The soothing pad burns off quickly, maybe just my iron beard.  </li>
            <li>The Razor is very nice and sharp, also comes with one additional blade.</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice close shave, love the touch up blade on the other side.</li>
            <li>Went into the shower, let my face get soft and moist, and the Fusion Proglide  shaved me quickly and easily, but more important, it left me with a smooth face.  </li>
            <li>Very minimalist which is fine if that&#x27;s what you want.  </li>
            <li>smaller in size, exclusive design, elegant packing, value for money with 2 free catridges, convenient to use..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to shave the next day and get close enough for it to count, it&#x27;s a good razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw the Gillette Fusion Proglide Midas for $10 here on Amazon, and with a $4 coupon I decided it was worth trying.</li>
            <li>I had about 2 days worth of hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different types, and I was more than happy to let go of my Gillette Fusion Power early last year.</li>
            <li>I think its a good buy because you get a new razor and a total of 2 cartridges.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a bother to me that the lubricating strip wears out quickly (and honestly, on what razor does it not?)</li>
            <li>Love this razor, the package is interesting due to the olympics style but overall I love them.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say, it&#x27;s a great razor that gives a great shave, and at the time I bought it, I think it came to be cheaper than if I were to have simply bought refills for my other Proglide.  </li>
            <li>I really the Fusion series and the fact that the blades last longer than most others, but this new Proglide is even better.</li>
            <li>hugs the best, just be careful as with any razors with that aloe strip, don&#x27;t let it get overly wet since that part will fall off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t feel these &#x60;high end&#x60; razors are worth the money at their full price.  </li>
            <li>the first shave the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I really do hat Gillette!</li>
            <li>WOW this is the&lt;br /&gt;closest shave i&#x27;ve had in years, perfectly smooth with zero cuts or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this Gillette Fusion Proglide seems to have a smaller head surface (than the Hydro 5), so it takes more strokes to cover the area.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended... ! !</li>
            <li>It might be better for one person or another, but I have used both extensively and like this one better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Proglide POWER (yes, power) version for about 6-7 months now.</li>
            <li>When I used it at first, it was kind of rough.</li>
            <li>4.8/5 - It&#x27;s not perfect, but the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used in my life</li>
            <li>experience with the Proglide has been positive in every way as soon as I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li>The lubrication on that thing is funny though, because sometimes the whole thing will fall out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a run down of stats in my own opinion for the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve been able to shave that way with a few other razors, but they don&#x27;t hold a candle to the Fusion Proglide and its superior technology.</li>
            <li>I have a large face and alot of hair, this does the trick.</li>
            <li>Really like the 5 blades, it makes shaving a lot easier.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;d highly recommend getting this razor!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend gets a really close shave and makes him irresistible.</li>
            <li>The proglide can cut through thick stubble as good as it does on your 5 o clock shadow.</li>
            <li>It just feels natural holding it, and every stroke feels just right.</li>
            <li>This razor is great smooth and effortless shave so far curious on how long the blades will last...</li>
            <li>and I wanted an extra razor, which looks very nice on the Limited Edition, and the extra 2 Cartridges that came along with it.</li>
            <li>When it comes down to it, I do get a nice shave from this Fusion (late model?), and I agree with so many smart shoppers when they mention the price on these things (the blades) is ridiculously high.</li>
            <li>Love the black and gold look of the razor.</li>
            <li>Much better comfort and less stress in my skin.</li>
            <li>While these blades are no tougher, at least the results are far superior.</li>
            <li>You only require regular gas, but if you decide to go with the premium (Proglide), your car will run faster and be more responsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>amazing product to shave vagina lips and other private parts too</li>
            <li>I figured it would get a little better</li>
            <li>While I hate GIllette, I can shave everyday for about two weeks with one blade and be happy that my face is happy.</li>
            <li>Only the Cartridges are useful</li>
            <li>That little blade gets in places the front side of the cartridge can&#x27;t reach, and it helps keep sideburns straight, clean and even.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really no where to store it, but the clear is unique.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t shaved for about a week and used the Proglide and it cut me down smooth with no pain and with ease.</li>
            <li>Very sharp - shaves effortlessly and smooth.</li>
            <li>As a guy with an insanely tough beard, I chew through blades quickly and still struggle to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to get an incredibly smooth shave in about 2 minutes without cutting myself.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d notice that all the power razors clearly say \\&quot;Power\\&quot; in the name.</li>
            <li>The five blades made a REAL difference in my daily shave.  </li>
            <li>I have not used the manual proglide yet, but it&#x27;s the same thing without vibration (which I don&#x27;t use much</li>
            <li>MUCH cheaper than going to the local pharmacy</li>
            <li>No need to grab a sharp knife or scissors to open it up (frustration free).</li>
            <li>my case I have always found that I replace the blades every 8 uses, and I like the safe way they are designed, but still it is advisable to shave carefully when using sharp blades.</li>
            <li>I cannot see myself switching razor brands anytime in the near future, unless someone decides to come out with a razor that tops these.</li>
            <li>He throw it out and went back to Fusion old school.</li>
            <li>An earlier reviewer stated that it&#x27;s too slick, however I found the grip on the handle to be better than other razors</li>
            <li>I bought not too long ago the Limited Edition Coast Guard of this same brand, and that one I really dig.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>

            <li> the first shave the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I really do hat Gillette!</li>
            <li> WOW this is the&lt;br /&gt;closest shave i&#x27;ve had in years, perfectly smooth with zero cuts or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this Gillette Fusion Proglide seems to have a smaller head surface (than the Hydro 5), so it takes more strokes to cover the area.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended... ! !</li>
            <li> It might be better for one person or another, but I have used both extensively and like this one better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Proglide POWER (yes, power) version for about 6-7 months now.</li>
            <li> When I used it at first, it was kind of rough.</li>
            <li> 4.8/5 - It&#x27;s not perfect, but the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used in my life</li>
            <li> experience with the Proglide has been positive in every way as soon as I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li> The lubrication on that thing is funny though, because sometimes the whole thing will fall out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is a run down of stats in my own opinion for the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve been able to shave that way with a few other razors, but they don&#x27;t hold a candle to the Fusion Proglide and its superior technology.</li>
            <li> I have a large face and alot of hair, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Really like the 5 blades, it makes shaving a lot easier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;d highly recommend getting this razor!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend gets a really close shave and makes him irresistible.</li>
            <li> The proglide can cut through thick stubble as good as it does on your 5 o clock shadow.</li>
            <li> It just feels natural holding it, and every stroke feels just right.</li>
            <li> This razor is great smooth and effortless shave so far curious on how long the blades will last...</li>
            <li> and I wanted an extra razor, which looks very nice on the Limited Edition, and the extra 2 Cartridges that came along with it.</li>
            <li> When it comes down to it, I do get a nice shave from this Fusion (late model?), and I agree with so many smart shoppers when they mention the price on these things (the blades) is ridiculously high.</li>
            <li> Love the black and gold look of the razor.</li>
            <li> Much better comfort and less stress in my skin.</li>
            <li> While these blades are no tougher, at least the results are far superior.</li>
            <li> You only require regular gas, but if you decide to go with the premium (Proglide), your car will run faster and be more responsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> amazing product to shave vagina lips and other private parts too</li>
            <li> I figured it would get a little better</li>
            <li> While I hate GIllette, I can shave everyday for about two weeks with one blade and be happy that my face is happy.</li>
            <li> Only the Cartridges are useful</li>
            <li> That little blade gets in places the front side of the cartridge can&#x27;t reach, and it helps keep sideburns straight, clean and even.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no where to store it, but the clear is unique.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved for about a week and used the Proglide and it cut me down smooth with no pain and with ease.</li>
            <li> Very sharp - shaves effortlessly and smooth.</li>
            <li> As a guy with an insanely tough beard, I chew through blades quickly and still struggle to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to get an incredibly smooth shave in about 2 minutes without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d notice that all the power razors clearly say \\&quot;Power\\&quot; in the name.</li>
            <li> The five blades made a REAL difference in my daily shave.  </li>
            <li> I have not used the manual proglide yet, but it&#x27;s the same thing without vibration (which I don&#x27;t use much</li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper than going to the local pharmacy</li>
            <li> No need to grab a sharp knife or scissors to open it up (frustration free).</li>
            <li> my case I have always found that I replace the blades every 8 uses, and I like the safe way they are designed, but still it is advisable to shave carefully when using sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I cannot see myself switching razor brands anytime in the near future, unless someone decides to come out with a razor that tops these.</li>
            <li> He throw it out and went back to Fusion old school.</li>
            <li> An earlier reviewer stated that it&#x27;s too slick, however I found the grip on the handle to be better than other razors</li>
            <li> I bought not too long ago the Limited Edition Coast Guard of this same brand, and that one I really dig.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> The problem with shaving against the grain, as many of you may know, is that it can leave you extremely susceptible to irritation and other common shaving problems.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using an old Norelco rotary for the last few years and decided to</li>
            <li> same reviewer also noted that Amazon did not list this as a non-power razor, however if you actually read the name compared to the other Gillette razors</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and just started buying cheaper disposables, but I found myself cutting myself a lot more often with the Sensor Excel (2 blade) razors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as close, and I don&#x27;t feel like any of the vibrating versions of these razors makes much of a difference, at least for me.</li>
            <li> They answered my email and mailed me a coupon for a free Fusion Power to replace my broken one!  </li>
            <li> For beginners or average shavers, you will get at least two weeks worth before you even consider changing it, and, the lubrication will still be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the Mach3 for a long time and thought it was time to try an upgrade.  </li>
            <li> I have used electric for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> I fooled myself into liking it because of its price and how long the lubrication strip lasted.</li>
            <li> I have learned long ago to not hype up any product until I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I would prefer something a little larger but not enough to take off any stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pair</li>
            <li> But... this is the only blade that I can use everyday without facial irritation.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide cartridges seems to last just as long as my previous razors, if not longer.</li>
            <li> Only gripe was that it didn&#x27;t feel as solid and heavy as previous Gillete manual razors but performance</li>
            <li> however, the blades seem to dull way faster than the blades on my old quattro.</li>
            <li> The other thing that makes these top-of-the-line is their single blade edge trimmer (located on the reverse of the cartridge).</li>
            <li> I like being 100% in control of sharp metal blades sliding around my throat, so the swivel wasnt for me.</li>
            <li> i have also found that my thick/coarse hair does not clog between blades like it has with other razors.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s hard to find replacement in the market with the same prices.</li>
            <li> ....way not worth it</li>
            <li> the price is average</li>
            <li> The thing I hate about most razors is the design.</li>
            <li> Yes, like all razors, it&#x27;s very sharp.</li>
            <li> Careful they are slick and don&#x27;t mention that this is not a power handle.</li>
            <li> Close shave, little if any irritation when using it.</li>
            <li> It is not a perfect product, especially you use it lonely.</li>
            <li> and it is now my everyday</li>
            <li> I used to shave with a Mach 3 for a long time, but I grew tired of the cost of refills</li>
            <li> There is a small plastic holder that covers just the blades themselves and a small part of the razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of that would be, but I don&#x27;t find it to add anything to the shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I was getting only a week on my Fusion Power before it started to become uncomfortable because the strip faded out, and I was getting 3-4 weeks with the Hydro 5 until it ran out.</li>
            <li> small complaint is the case, or lack thereof, that this comes with.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dull at all.</li>
            <li> Now to see if I react to the metal in the blades (was a common issue for me before trying the Mach series of razors).</li>
            <li> For the past 2 years I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion non-power razor, but the cartridges are expensive.</li>
            <li> Not a great product, lost my money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I just wish the blades were not so expensive.</li>
            <li> Expensive cartridge replacement.</li>
            <li> but it still was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he hated it.</li>
            <li> thing I hated about the Hydro 5 was the grip.</li>
            <li> It was a horrible design.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i switched my original order from a fusion power to this thinking it was the same but cheaper....way not worth it and then when trying to return they wanted to charge me 80% of cost. Careful they are slick and don&#x27;t mention that this is not a power handle. Guess i got shaved!!!</li>
            <li> Very sharp - shaves effortlessly and smooth. Love the black and gold look of the razor. Only gripe was that it didn&#x27;t feel as solid and heavy as previous Gillete manual razors but performance it does not lack. And the packaging is a lot better this time. No need to grab a sharp knife or scissors to open it up (frustration free).</li>
            <li> Love this razor, just wished the blade replacements could be cheaper</li>
            <li> Simply put one of the best razors on the market. As a guy with an insanely tough beard, I chew through blades quickly and still struggle to get a clean cut. While these blades are no tougher, at least the results are far superior.</li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t feel these &#x60;high end&#x60; razors are worth the money at their full price.  Would buy again fi on sale.</li>
            <li> The five blades made a REAL difference in my daily shave.  Much better comfort and less stress in my skin.</li>
            <li> this is a gift and the guy I bought it for likes this razor the price is average and i added to is gift basket</li>
            <li> Love this razor, the package is interesting due to the olympics style but overall I love them. Smooth shaves, and well built, they don&#x27;t break even though I accidently drop it on the tile floor every now and then.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have purchased my share of this company product, including their shaving gel. When it comes down to it, I do get a nice shave from this Fusion (late model?), and I agree with so many smart shoppers when they mention the price on these things (the blades) is ridiculously high. This package was a very nice deal and I wanted an extra razor, which looks very nice on the Limited Edition, and the extra 2 Cartridges that came along with it. I bought not too long ago the Limited Edition Coast Guard of this same brand, and that one I really dig.&lt;br /&gt;In my case I have always found that I replace the blades every 8 uses, and I like the safe way they are designed, but still it is advisable to shave carefully when using sharp blades. 4 Stars!</li>
            <li> I scoured the info and I could have sworn that this product was one that required battery and had the pulsating effect... I was mistaken. that was the reason that I purchased it. still have not used it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Razor!  shave was smooth and close&amp;#34;  one of the best razors i have used.</li>
            <li> The Razor is perfect for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with one additional blade.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and quality!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for all!</li>
            <li> It is not a perfect product, especially you use it lonely. But it&#x27;s hard to find replacement in the market with the same prices.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor (Gave it to my friend after I didnt want it, and he loves it) the only reason I didnt like it was the swivel of the head of the razor. I like being 100% in control of sharp metal blades sliding around my throat, so the swivel wasnt for me.</li>
            <li> The best, smoothest razor I&#x27;ve ever used. As a men I&#x27;ve used so many others and nothing else compares to it.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace my Mach-3 razor as it finally broke. Works great as a replacement for my manual razor. Now to see if I react to the metal in the blades (was a common issue for me before trying the Mach series of razors). Close shave, little if any irritation when using it. Would recommend it to others :)</li>
            <li> smaller in size, exclusive design, elegant packing, value for money with 2 free catridges, convenient to use.. i love this razor..</li>
            <li> As soon as I saw this razor, I told myself I had to have it.  I used to shave with a Mach 3 for a long time, but I grew tired of the cost of refills so I went ahead and just started buying cheaper disposables, but I found myself cutting myself a lot more often with the Sensor Excel (2 blade) razors.  I actually got a Fusion Proglide for free on a bottle of Head and Shoulders, loved it, and then saw this gold one so I went ahead and bought it.  Not much else to say, it&#x27;s a great razor that gives a great shave, and at the time I bought it, I think it came to be cheaper than if I were to have simply bought refills for my other Proglide.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> The Razor is very nice and sharp, also comes with one additional blade. Special edition and great price, hope the cartridges get cheaper in future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything. I&#x27;m a female, but in terms of how good a razor is I measure it by how well it shaves my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m able to shave the next day and get close enough for it to count, it&#x27;s a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;It hugs the best, just be careful as with any razors with that aloe strip, don&#x27;t let it get overly wet since that part will fall off.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this over shick&#x27;s quattro, the male or female of that razor. It&#x27;s not nearly as close, and I don&#x27;t feel like any of the vibrating versions of these razors makes much of a difference, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with the Gillette Fusion Proglide razors! And the best part is I was able to purchase this item for an outstanding price (sale + coupon). I have always shaved with an upward stroke, going against the grain, because it is the only way for me to truly feel like I&#x27;ve gotten as close as possible. The problem with shaving against the grain, as many of you may know, is that it can leave you extremely susceptible to irritation and other common shaving problems. So I was elated when Gillette came out with the Fusion Proglide and even advertised that these blades are made for going against the grain. Granted, I&#x27;ve been able to shave that way with a few other razors, but they don&#x27;t hold a candle to the Fusion Proglide and its superior technology. The other thing that makes these top-of-the-line is their single blade edge trimmer (located on the reverse of the cartridge). That little blade gets in places the front side of the cartridge can&#x27;t reach, and it helps keep sideburns straight, clean and even. It&#x27;s not really a bother to me that the lubricating strip wears out quickly (and honestly, on what razor does it not?) because I always shave with a fair amount of nice shaving gel (Schick Hydro gel for Sensitive Skin is superb!). The Fusion Proglide cartridges seems to last just as long as my previous razors, if not longer. I cannot see myself switching razor brands anytime in the near future, unless someone decides to come out with a razor that tops these.</li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon for about $5 cheaper than any of my local stores.  I also have the Fusion Power so I got this as my travel razor.  Well, turns out I like this much better than my Fusion Power and it is now my everyday razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small complaint is the case, or lack thereof, that this comes with.  There is a small plastic holder that covers just the blades themselves and a small part of the razor.  Very minimalist which is fine if that&#x27;s what you want.  I would prefer something a little larger but not enough to take off any stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pair this razor with the Cremo shaving cream (http://www.amazon.com/Cremo-Cream-Shave-177/dp/B001KYVZPY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1358801609&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;cremo) and you will have yourself a buttery smooth face everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on Gillette customer service, it is great.  My Fusion Power broke, out of the blue, and I emailed them to express my displeasure as a longtime Gillette user.  They answered my email and mailed me a coupon for a free Fusion Power to replace my broken one!  That is how you keep your customers happy.</li>
            <li> Not the vibration version, is a regular razor like my grandfather used. Not a great product, lost my money. Only the Cartridges are useful</li>
            <li> Gives you a nice close shave, love the touch up blade on the other side. The soothing pad burns off quickly, maybe just my iron beard.  Good product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great razor, I am happy I bought this one.  I have a large face and alot of hair, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Really like the 5 blades, it makes shaving a lot easier.  And the price is quite excellent, would recommend for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> It was a closer shave and a smother one. I could tell it was a closer shave on the first shave the first time I used it</li>
            <li> For the past 2 years I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion non-power razor, but the cartridges are expensive. I saw the Gillette Fusion Proglide Midas for $10 here on Amazon, and with a $4 coupon I decided it was worth trying. Yes, like all razors, it&#x27;s very sharp. However, I was able to get an incredibly smooth shave in about 2 minutes without cutting myself. This razor has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. An earlier reviewer stated that it&#x27;s too slick, however I found the grip on the handle to be better than other razors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;The same reviewer also noted that Amazon did not list this as a non-power razor, however if you actually read the name compared to the other Gillette razors you&#x27;d notice that all the power razors clearly say \\&quot;Power\\&quot; in the name. Also, the picture below the description where they compare the different Gillette razors, the power razor&#x27;s image says it&#x27;s a power razor and the manual doesn&#x27;t mention anything about it being a power razor.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;d highly recommend getting this razor!</li>
            <li> I used the Mach3 for a long time and thought it was time to try an upgrade.  This razor is great smooth and effortless shave so far curious on how long the blades will last...</li>
            <li> I really the Fusion series and the fact that the blades last longer than most others, but this new Proglide is even better. I just wish the blades were not so expensive.</li>
            <li> I really do hat Gillette! Five blades, expensive and goofy advertisements. But... this is the only blade that I can use everyday without facial irritation. So... While I hate GIllette, I can shave everyday for about two weeks with one blade and be happy that my face is happy. Great product (I hat saying that) and a great shave for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I use the same blade for over a year on a weekly usage. It doesn&#x27;t dull at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using the basic Fusion razor for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;Saw the proglide at a very attractive price and bought one to try.&lt;br /&gt;It is a cut above all others.....</li>
            <li> I have used electric for a long, long time.  I thought id give this a whirl and my god, the shave is so close!  I give it 5 stars because ive only been knicked once out of 4 uses.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using an old Norelco rotary for the last few years and decided to&lt;br /&gt;give this razor a shot especially with the $4 off coupon. WOW this is the&lt;br /&gt;closest shave i&#x27;ve had in years, perfectly smooth with zero cuts or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t use any fancy gel or foam, just regular soap in the shower. i&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;definitely sold !</li>
            <li> Always on the lookout for a better razor. This wasn&#x27;t it. In my experience. I&#x27;ve found the best razor so far to be the Schick Hydro 5. In my opinion, this Gillette Fusion Proglide seems to have a smaller head surface (than the Hydro 5), so it takes more strokes to cover the area. It says it has a &amp;#34;drop&amp;#34; of mineral oil. I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of that would be, but I don&#x27;t find it to add anything to the shaving experience. This Gillette Fusion Proglide seems to &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; more than the Hydro 5, IMO. I&#x27;ll stick with the Schick Hydro 5 (unless) until something better comes along. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For the price, I have paid and also getting 2 free cartridges, can&#x27;t beat this deal! Highly recommended... ! !</li>
            <li> the razor has really impressed me with the close, smooth shave i can achieve with it. i have also found that my thick/coarse hair does not clog between blades like it has with other razors.  however, the blades seem to dull way faster than the blades on my old quattro.</li>
            <li> Hands down, Gillette Proglide is the best razor in the market. Smooth clean shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Expensive cartridge replacement.</li>
            <li> I think its a good buy because you get a new razor and a total of 2 cartridges.  If you need new right away, it&#x27;s a good deal.  My boyfriend gets a really close shave and makes him irresistible.</li>
            <li> I love it. I bought a set of blades from BJs, a 16 pack pro glide. Works perfect for this razor.</li>
            <li> I am fully satisfied with this product and it works best. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;This is why i gave it 5 star.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few days ago; it arrived very promptly and I tried it out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.  I had about 2 days worth of hair growth.  Went into the shower, let my face get soft and moist, and the Fusion Proglide  shaved me quickly and easily, but more important, it left me with a smooth face.  I never had it so easy.I love this gem.</li>
            <li> I wish this came with a full sized holster like the others. There&#x27;s really no where to store it, but the clear is unique.</li>
            <li> With Save $3.00 Coupon and getting 2 Cartridges, it is a good deal and off course the Brand and it&#x27;s quality is know to all.</li>
            <li> Great set. Was using Mach 3 for last couple of years. surely will feel difference from Mach3 , way better than Mach3. But pricy for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he hated it. Used a couple of times and didn&#x27;t shave well. He throw it out and went back to Fusion old school.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s experience with a razor is different. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different types, and I was more than happy to let go of my Gillette Fusion Power early last year. I bought a Shick Hydro Power. I thought it was great, cheap all around with an amazing cut. I even have the highest rated review on the product on Amazon currently. Now, I looked at the reviews for this saying Hydro 5 is better. It might be better for one person or another, but I have used both extensively and like this one better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Proglide POWER (yes, power) version for about 6-7 months now. I just purchased this manual version to take with me to basic training (in case the power version would be confiscated). I&#x27;ll backtrack and talk about my experience with the Hydro 5. When I used it at first, it was kind of rough. I figured it would get a little better and it did, but it still was uncomfortable. I fooled myself into liking it because of its price and how long the lubrication strip lasted. I was getting only a week on my Fusion Power before it started to become uncomfortable because the strip faded out, and I was getting 3-4 weeks with the Hydro 5 until it ran out. The lubrication on that thing is funny though, because sometimes the whole thing will fall out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the Proglide has been positive in every way as soon as I took it out of the box. I have learned long ago to not hype up any product until I&#x27;ve used it for a long time. With 6-7 months of experience I&#x27;m telling everyone how it is. The proglide can cut through thick stubble as good as it does on your 5 o clock shadow. I hadn&#x27;t shaved for about a week and used the Proglide and it cut me down smooth with no pain and with ease. I bought myself a replacement pack of 8 cartridges and I have run through 6. That means in 6 months, I have used 6. Actually 7 if you include the one it came with. For those of you out there who know how to make a razor last, one of these can go up to a month or two. For beginners or average shavers, you will get at least two weeks worth before you even consider changing it, and, the lubrication will still be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I hated about the Hydro 5 was the grip. It was a horrible design. With the Proglide, it was made with you in mind. It just feels natural holding it, and every stroke feels just right. As we all know, replacing Gillette cartridges can be a pain in the neck (not physically). To buy a pack of replacements, you&#x27;re looking at about $30 for a pack of 8. The same will cost you under $20 with the Hydro 5. Not everyone cares to pay for it, but it&#x27;s more than worth it. It&#x27;s the best shave I ever had in my life, and I don&#x27;t mind paying $10 extra every 6-9 months for a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of razors like gas, and you are the car. You only require regular gas, but if you decide to go with the premium (Proglide), your car will run faster and be more responsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will state again I have not used the manual proglide yet, but it&#x27;s the same thing without vibration (which I don&#x27;t use much anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully your experience is as good as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a run down of stats in my own opinion for the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fusion Proglide&lt;br /&gt;Standard: $9.74 (comes with 2 cartridges)- replacement pack of 8 - $28.99&lt;br /&gt;Power: $10.94 (1 cartridge) - replacement pack of 8 - $31.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort level: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness of each stroke: 4.5/5 (sometimes you have to run the blade back over)&lt;br /&gt;Smoothness of shave: 5/5 - Your experience may be different, but this is the best shave of my life&lt;br /&gt;Cartridge life: 4/5 - Depends on how you use it. Will get you 2 weeks minimum and up to 2 months maximum&lt;br /&gt;Design: 5/5 - The thing I hate about most razors is the design. This one feels great in hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4.8/5 - It&#x27;s not perfect, but the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used in my life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of box with a razor holder which most gillette razors have, but others don&#x27;t. Also, I strongly recommend buying the Proglide shaving cream. it&#x27;s the best I ever used in my life. You can literally see your hairs rising in seconds if you look closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck everyone!lette razors have, but others don&#x27;t.

            <li> Ordred this as a gift and it came quickly (even though it was on backorder!) MUCH cheaper than going to the local pharmacy plus it came with extra cartridges which was a plus. It&#x27;s a very smooth, efficient razor and the husband is pleased! :)</li>
