            <li>STURDY AND GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it also had a screw mount, just in case the suction wouldn&#x27;t stick well, but it&#x27;s staying up great on my mirror.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Great Item</li>
            <li>This is a great companion to the iron.  </li>
            <li>You could probably mount it vertically too but happy using it on vanity.</li>
            <li>This is actually a really great idea.  </li>
            <li>She was truly happy to have it.</li>
            <li>great angle</li>
            <li>If the wife is happy everybody in the house is happy. :-)</li>
            <li>But good idea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over two weeks suction still good</li>
            <li>and you will be good to go.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the straightener for my daughter, because I loved my HSI straightener.  </li>
            <li>This works well and is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Not the best for space saving, but great for keeping your hot iron off of the counter.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the cost was even greater.</li>
            <li>I very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This is really handy and a great deal - so much better than laying it on the counter and worrying about burning things.</li>
            <li>And now that I have, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>So glad I made this purchase!  </li>
            <li>I love this stand!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>i love this iron stand!</li>
            <li>I am SO glad he got this to go along with my straightener!  </li>
            <li>I love this stand!</li>
            <li>It does come with some kind of mounting screw.  </li>
            <li>Kind of defeats part of the purpose for purchasing it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay put on all countertops but nice to have.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Received as agreed in good conditioned.</li>
            <li>The iron fits perfectly and I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>The suction cups on the bottom are very strong and ensure that the stand is stable.</li>
            <li>Hook very easily to the glass</li>
            <li>because I have this handy stand to make the process all better.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that has given me \\&quot;peace of mind\\&quot; with my 12 year old daughter who is somewhat forgetfull in turning things off.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks great for the first hour</li>
            <li>This was great at first.</li>
            <li>Very handy, very practical, suction cups worked!</li>
            <li>There is also a screw/anchor included to attach it more permanently.  </li>
            <li>I love that it gives me more counter space and keeps my counter from getting burn marks.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t suction to my counter because the counter is textured, but I like it better on the mirror or wall better anyway.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li>I was hoping by the reviews I read it would be better</li>
            <li>Keeps the iron off of my counter and keeps me safe from accidentally touching it.</li>
            <li>This stand is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>So glad I bought this stand to go along with the HSI flatiron</li>
            <li>once I use this product more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this, you&#x27;re better off using the bag</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this additional product.</li>
            <li>Love love love this thing.</li>
            <li>The price I got it for was outstanding, too.</li>
            <li>I think the best testament is that I notice she uses it daily.  </li>
            <li>Seller was fantastic, and I would buy from them again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I love my iron holder.</li>
            <li>many I checked out, this HSI seamed the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any ID my friends :-)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it and it keeps my table clutter free!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having this is better than my straightener burning my counter top.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly with the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li>Perfect accessory for my HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my Chi flat iron for years and this stand is the perfect holder.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect holder for the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li>AS LONG AS THE WIFE LOVES IT, THEN IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>Worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li>This is a perfect fit for the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li>Very cool item.</li>
            <li>Great way to keep your hot hair equipment from falling off the counter or have unsuspecting children putting their hands on the hot end of wands!</li>
            <li>This does come in handy - works great, stores away easily - wouldn&#x27;t use my flat iron without the stand.</li>
            <li>Keeps flatiron secure and everything else on my bathroom counter safe from the heat.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a great add on to the HSI Flat Iron - keeps the unit off the counter top and in a safe secure place.</li>
            <li>so you can easily put it somewhere</li>
            <li>strong suction cups.</li>
            <li>And the holder itself gets pretty warm.</li>
            <li>It is a great idea to have the iron put away in a very convenient place while hot.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it great for controlling curling irons, it&#x27;s also easy to put the curling iron in.</li>
            <li>This is the first one i have ordered my flat Irons fit perfectly and</li>
            <li>Love being able to fasten to wall and love that it is actually a very nice heavy duty product!</li>
            <li>It has never fallen off the sink, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable leaving the room while it heats up.  </li>
            <li>Suction cups on the bottom keep it securely in place.</li>
            <li>Once I did that, the holder is secure.</li>
            <li>Attractive enough to leave on counter and not too bulky.</li>
            <li>Suction cups on the bottom keep it secure on the counter.</li>
            <li>Was  looking for something cheap to mount on the wall for the hair straightener.</li>
            <li>Very useful while straightening or curling hair.</li>
            <li>For the price, I think this is a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product to have if you are using a flat iron.</li>
            <li>If you have a HSI flat iron, this is really a great addition to buy.</li>
            <li>the suction is very good and it holds longer when i added water to the suction cups first when using the flat lron.</li>
            <li>I was able to mount the stand exactly where I needed it.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the fact that my stand holds the hot temp off my countertops, but getting the suction cups to work took some effort.  </li>
            <li>this is great to keep the flat iron off the table and provide somewhere for it to heat and cool.</li>
            <li>We bought it over a year ago and it has worked fine for daily use, which can&#x27;t be said for a lot of products in this price range, so quality seems good.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also nice to be able to put it back in while it&#x27;s cooling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special, but it&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
            <li>This is very handy to put the flat iron in when hot and not worry about burning anything!  </li>
            <li>I have been advised that the iron has to cool before putting it in the holder.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t put it in the holder until its cool.</li>
            <li>Very affordable option and way to get it off your counter and safe.</li>
            <li>I have it on top of my sink vanity and the suction cups don&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>this is a solid product and you can let your straightener warm up or cool off in it.  </li>
            <li>No longer have to worry about my bathroom counter tops getting too hot!</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with both the HSI flat iron and the HSI iron stand.</li>
            <li>I have left my unit on accidentally and this ensures that it is not just laying around for someone to burn themselves or lay something on top of!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty straightforward:</li>
            <li>Great little gadget.</li>
            <li>The flat iron by this company, HSI, is however AMAZING, I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this stand.</li>
            <li>This is a nice and inexpensive Flat Iron Holder.  </li>
            <li>price was right</li>
            <li>It is perfect and does not take up much space, plus it is easier to retrieve the flat iron with burning your fingers, no more laying the flat iron on the sink, the HSI hold perfectly fits a 1 inch flat iron.</li>
            <li>It is made very well though and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, it is!&lt;br /&gt;It attached to the mirror in the bathroom with ease, and can be just as easily reattached / be &amp;</li>
            <li>Thought the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve never had to wonder if the curling iron is hot enough to melt a notable indent into my expensive bathroom marble top.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described by suppliers.</li>
            <li>As soon as I try to rest the iron in the holder the whole thing tips over!</li>
            <li>It does exactly as it said it does.</li>
            <li>if you have a big mirror it is ok, but I am using the portable vanity</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>There are many different items out there like this</li>
            <li>That curling iron gets EXTREMELY hot</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you own an HSI flat iron</li>
            <li>It enables me to work with my hair without having to worry about sitting a hot appliance on my ceramic sink or on my ceramic toilet bowl top.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife so she could lay her $200 flat iron in a safe place.</li>
            <li>Flat Iron holder does not always stay in place and slides around on our granite counter tops, but is still better putting your flat iron in a holder than laying in on your counter top.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this along with the flat iron.</li>
            <li>A big larger than I imagined, but its good.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it does a great job keeping your hot flat iron off the counter.</li>
            <li>Buying this item really helps with my flat iron which can be set for over 400 degrees and would otherwise not have a safe place for me to put when in use.</li>
            <li>mean really its a hunk of plastic to keep the flat on off things that can be damaged and it does that portion of the job perfectly.  </li>
            <li>it looks great suctioned on my mirror, and although i&#x27;m usually highly paranoid about not keeping a direct eye on anything with a heating element, this allows me the piece of mind to turn it on, walk away for a few minutes while it&#x27;s heating up and not have to worry.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking smooth (although I have pretty tame hair, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to make it look smooth and polished).  </li>
            <li>This is a well built holder, and with 4 suction cups, easily holds the flat iron on the mirror.</li>
            <li>Love the new Flat Iron holder!  </li>
            <li>This stand is very convenient and protects any surfaces from being ruined.</li>
            <li>It work really well</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell how that would work</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really tried.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I really do like the product and it makes storing the straightener much easier and neater looking.  </li>
            <li>Also much easier usage when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>i find the suction cups on the bottom dont really adhere all that well, to ANY surface really.</li>
            <li>I always leave my hair straighter on the bathroom counter, which really clutters the space, and annoys my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>This product showed up on time packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The suction cups don&#x27;t really stick.  </li>
            <li>This is functional and does not take up much room.</li>
            <li>Holds the heat within the holder very well.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Seller got it to me fast</li>
            <li>My wife had put this on her Amazon Wish List but had really forgotten it was there.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone that has a curling iron and wants to make the process so much easier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it holds to the mirror all that well, but I value my mirror space too much to attach it there, so that is a non issue.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and sleek.</li>
            <li>I like having a place to put my HSI flat iron while I&#x27;m using it, so this is better than putting it on the bare counter.  </li>
            <li>but it does an amazing job giving me curls that last for days - a rare commodity for an asian with naturally straight long hair that resists any change whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I used to accidentally try to move the old iron not realizing it was hot.</li>
            <li>I purchased this stand after purchasing a flat iron from this same brand which I love but the stand not so much...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it, and know it will last at least as long as the iron!</li>
            <li>My flat iron finally has a &amp;#34;home&amp;#34;, and I love that it can be attached to a wall.  </li>
            <li>The stand doesn&#x27;t suction to my counter for more than a few minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>The product is very useful and came on time (it may have even came earlier than expected but I can&#x27;t remember right now.</li>
            <li>My husband bought me a new flattener for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and this as well.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron holder is a bit larger than I had expected, but it is very nice quality and does protect your counters from the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a lot safer as I can rest the iron in the stand while it&#x27;s still hot, keeping it out of the way of any potential burn accidents.  </li>
            <li>Blue Novelties was very communicative and wanted to ensure all packages products were received well!</li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to do, keep that hot hair iron off the bathroom counter and possibly off the carpet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ruined many surfaces due to the heat of my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time flat iron owner.  </li>
            <li>I received my HSI flat iron stand very promptly!</li>
            <li>The amount of risk this eliminates in having an extremely hot iron in the bathroom is well worth the small change for this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I spent the $8 I spent on this</li>
            <li>Held up good, only disadvantage is base is kind of too big for my liking.</li>
            <li>If I had bought my own flattener, I would never have purchased it, thinking it was unnecessary.  </li>
            <li>Will stick to the mirror but who wants a flat iron sticking off their mirror??</li>
            <li>I was using a Conair flat iron and this one much out performs it.</li>
            <li>Suctions on to the countertop, holds most smaller flat irons but the iron still sticks out quite a bit due to the angle.</li>
            <li>I now just rest the flat iron on a folded towel on top of a closed toilet seat.  </li>
            <li>Finally I found something that works and keeps my hot flat iron or curling wand up and away from my kids.</li>
            <li>At some point i will affix them to the wall, but first i will look to see if there is a holder that will hold two flat Irons or the blow dryer and flat Iron together.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a must-have since I have limited sink real estate, however it doesn’t stay put and topples over.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never touched it with my bare hands</li>
            <li>This product hangs on the mirror, allows iron to stay hot while using, cools down when done , and doesn&#x27;t heat up the mirror</li>
            <li>recommend this for any people who have a normal sized flat iron (Chi, GHB, and HSI - bought the flat iron - will post review).  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to worry about burn marks on the sink or little hands grabbing a hot iron.</li>
            <li>Having autistic 4-1/2 year old twins with no concept of \\&quot;hot\\&quot; meaning \\&quot;hurt\\&quot;, I had to find a way to keep a hot flat iron off the counter in order to use it.</li>
            <li>Before getting the stand, my flat iron would rest on my very small bathroom counter top or sometimes on the back of the toilet.  </li>
            <li>When I tried to put it on the mirror, It came crashing down in the middle of the night and woke the whole house.  </li>
            <li>I bought this stand for my little sister and she really loves it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very spiffy little addition to the HSI straightener.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Excellent product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to use anywhere, and portable so you can drop it in your bag and go.</li>
            <li> but I have found this item to be one of the best.</li>

            <li> Just great!</li>
            <li> This stand is great!</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter to use and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love the Holder!!!!</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly on her vanity.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good looking and can be mounted on the wall.</li>
            <li> This works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I attached this to my mirror and it works great.  </li>
            <li> STURDY AND GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it also had a screw mount, just in case the suction wouldn&#x27;t stick well, but it&#x27;s staying up great on my mirror.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived in great condition.  </li>
            <li> Great Item</li>
            <li> This is a great companion to the iron.  </li>
            <li> You could probably mount it vertically too but happy using it on vanity.</li>
            <li> This is actually a really great idea.  </li>
            <li> She was truly happy to have it.</li>
            <li> great angle</li>
            <li> If the wife is happy everybody in the house is happy. :-)</li>
            <li> But good idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over two weeks suction still good</li>
            <li> and you will be good to go.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the straightener for my daughter, because I loved my HSI straightener.  </li>
            <li> This works well and is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Not the best for space saving, but great for keeping your hot iron off of the counter.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the cost was even greater.</li>
            <li> I very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is really handy and a great deal - so much better than laying it on the counter and worrying about burning things.</li>
            <li> And now that I have, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> So glad I made this purchase!  </li>
            <li> I love this stand!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> i love this iron stand!</li>
            <li> I am SO glad he got this to go along with my straightener!  </li>
            <li> I love this stand!</li>
            <li> It does come with some kind of mounting screw.  </li>
            <li> Kind of defeats part of the purpose for purchasing it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay put on all countertops but nice to have.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Received as agreed in good conditioned.</li>
            <li> The iron fits perfectly and I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> The suction cups on the bottom are very strong and ensure that the stand is stable.</li>
            <li> Hook very easily to the glass</li>
            <li> because I have this handy stand to make the process all better.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that has given me \\&quot;peace of mind\\&quot; with my 12 year old daughter who is somewhat forgetfull in turning things off.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks great for the first hour</li>
            <li> This was great at first.</li>
            <li> Very handy, very practical, suction cups worked!</li>
            <li> There is also a screw/anchor included to attach it more permanently.  </li>
            <li> I love that it gives me more counter space and keeps my counter from getting burn marks.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t suction to my counter because the counter is textured, but I like it better on the mirror or wall better anyway.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> I was hoping by the reviews I read it would be better</li>
            <li> Keeps the iron off of my counter and keeps me safe from accidentally touching it.</li>
            <li> This stand is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> So glad I bought this stand to go along with the HSI flatiron</li>
            <li> once I use this product more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this, you&#x27;re better off using the bag</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this additional product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this thing.</li>
            <li> The price I got it for was outstanding, too.</li>
            <li> I think the best testament is that I notice she uses it daily.  </li>
            <li> Seller was fantastic, and I would buy from them again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I love my iron holder.</li>
            <li> many I checked out, this HSI seamed the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any ID my friends :-)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it and it keeps my table clutter free!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having this is better than my straightener burning my counter top.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> Perfect accessory for my HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Chi flat iron for years and this stand is the perfect holder.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect holder for the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS THE WIFE LOVES IT, THEN IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect fit for the HSI flat iron.</li>
            <li> Very cool item.</li>
            <li> Great way to keep your hot hair equipment from falling off the counter or have unsuspecting children putting their hands on the hot end of wands!</li>
            <li> This does come in handy - works great, stores away easily - wouldn&#x27;t use my flat iron without the stand.</li>
            <li> Keeps flatiron secure and everything else on my bathroom counter safe from the heat.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great add on to the HSI Flat Iron - keeps the unit off the counter top and in a safe secure place.</li>
            <li> so you can easily put it somewhere</li>
            <li> strong suction cups.</li>
            <li> And the holder itself gets pretty warm.</li>
            <li> It is a great idea to have the iron put away in a very convenient place while hot.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it great for controlling curling irons, it&#x27;s also easy to put the curling iron in.</li>
            <li> This is the first one i have ordered my flat Irons fit perfectly and</li>
            <li> Love being able to fasten to wall and love that it is actually a very nice heavy duty product!</li>
            <li> It has never fallen off the sink, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable leaving the room while it heats up.  </li>
            <li> Suction cups on the bottom keep it securely in place.</li>
            <li> Once I did that, the holder is secure.</li>
            <li> Attractive enough to leave on counter and not too bulky.</li>
            <li> Suction cups on the bottom keep it secure on the counter.</li>
            <li> Was  looking for something cheap to mount on the wall for the hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Very useful while straightening or curling hair.</li>
            <li> For the price, I think this is a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product to have if you are using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> If you have a HSI flat iron, this is really a great addition to buy.</li>
            <li> the suction is very good and it holds longer when i added water to the suction cups first when using the flat lron.</li>
            <li> I was able to mount the stand exactly where I needed it.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the fact that my stand holds the hot temp off my countertops, but getting the suction cups to work took some effort.  </li>
            <li> this is great to keep the flat iron off the table and provide somewhere for it to heat and cool.</li>
            <li> We bought it over a year ago and it has worked fine for daily use, which can&#x27;t be said for a lot of products in this price range, so quality seems good.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also nice to be able to put it back in while it&#x27;s cooling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special, but it&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is very handy to put the flat iron in when hot and not worry about burning anything!  </li>
            <li> I have been advised that the iron has to cool before putting it in the holder.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t put it in the holder until its cool.</li>
            <li> Very affordable option and way to get it off your counter and safe.</li>
            <li> I have it on top of my sink vanity and the suction cups don&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> this is a solid product and you can let your straightener warm up or cool off in it.  </li>
            <li> No longer have to worry about my bathroom counter tops getting too hot!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with both the HSI flat iron and the HSI iron stand.</li>
            <li> I have left my unit on accidentally and this ensures that it is not just laying around for someone to burn themselves or lay something on top of!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty straightforward:</li>
            <li> Great little gadget.</li>
            <li> The flat iron by this company, HSI, is however AMAZING, I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this stand.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and inexpensive Flat Iron Holder.  </li>
            <li> price was right</li>
            <li> It is perfect and does not take up much space, plus it is easier to retrieve the flat iron with burning your fingers, no more laying the flat iron on the sink, the HSI hold perfectly fits a 1 inch flat iron.</li>
            <li> It is made very well though and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, it is!&lt;br /&gt;It attached to the mirror in the bathroom with ease, and can be just as easily reattached / be &amp;</li>
            <li> Thought the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve never had to wonder if the curling iron is hot enough to melt a notable indent into my expensive bathroom marble top.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described by suppliers.</li>
            <li> As soon as I try to rest the iron in the holder the whole thing tips over!</li>
            <li> It does exactly as it said it does.</li>
            <li> if you have a big mirror it is ok, but I am using the portable vanity</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> There are many different items out there like this</li>
            <li> That curling iron gets EXTREMELY hot</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you own an HSI flat iron</li>
            <li> It enables me to work with my hair without having to worry about sitting a hot appliance on my ceramic sink or on my ceramic toilet bowl top.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife so she could lay her $200 flat iron in a safe place.</li>
            <li> Flat Iron holder does not always stay in place and slides around on our granite counter tops, but is still better putting your flat iron in a holder than laying in on your counter top.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this along with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> A big larger than I imagined, but its good.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it does a great job keeping your hot flat iron off the counter.</li>
            <li> Buying this item really helps with my flat iron which can be set for over 400 degrees and would otherwise not have a safe place for me to put when in use.</li>
            <li> mean really its a hunk of plastic to keep the flat on off things that can be damaged and it does that portion of the job perfectly.  </li>
            <li> it looks great suctioned on my mirror, and although i&#x27;m usually highly paranoid about not keeping a direct eye on anything with a heating element, this allows me the piece of mind to turn it on, walk away for a few minutes while it&#x27;s heating up and not have to worry.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking smooth (although I have pretty tame hair, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to make it look smooth and polished).  </li>
            <li> This is a well built holder, and with 4 suction cups, easily holds the flat iron on the mirror.</li>
            <li> Love the new Flat Iron holder!  </li>
            <li> This stand is very convenient and protects any surfaces from being ruined.</li>
            <li> It work really well</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell how that would work</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really tried.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I really do like the product and it makes storing the straightener much easier and neater looking.  </li>
            <li> Also much easier usage when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> i find the suction cups on the bottom dont really adhere all that well, to ANY surface really.</li>
            <li> I always leave my hair straighter on the bathroom counter, which really clutters the space, and annoys my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> This product showed up on time packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The suction cups don&#x27;t really stick.  </li>
            <li> This is functional and does not take up much room.</li>
            <li> Holds the heat within the holder very well.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Seller got it to me fast</li>
            <li> My wife had put this on her Amazon Wish List but had really forgotten it was there.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone that has a curling iron and wants to make the process so much easier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it holds to the mirror all that well, but I value my mirror space too much to attach it there, so that is a non issue.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and sleek.</li>
            <li> I like having a place to put my HSI flat iron while I&#x27;m using it, so this is better than putting it on the bare counter.  </li>
            <li> but it does an amazing job giving me curls that last for days - a rare commodity for an asian with naturally straight long hair that resists any change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I used to accidentally try to move the old iron not realizing it was hot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand after purchasing a flat iron from this same brand which I love but the stand not so much...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it, and know it will last at least as long as the iron!</li>
            <li> My flat iron finally has a &amp;#34;home&amp;#34;, and I love that it can be attached to a wall.  </li>
            <li> The stand doesn&#x27;t suction to my counter for more than a few minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> The product is very useful and came on time (it may have even came earlier than expected but I can&#x27;t remember right now.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me a new flattener for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and this as well.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron holder is a bit larger than I had expected, but it is very nice quality and does protect your counters from the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot safer as I can rest the iron in the stand while it&#x27;s still hot, keeping it out of the way of any potential burn accidents.  </li>
            <li> Blue Novelties was very communicative and wanted to ensure all packages products were received well!</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do, keep that hot hair iron off the bathroom counter and possibly off the carpet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ruined many surfaces due to the heat of my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time flat iron owner.  </li>
            <li> I received my HSI flat iron stand very promptly!</li>
            <li> The amount of risk this eliminates in having an extremely hot iron in the bathroom is well worth the small change for this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I spent the $8 I spent on this</li>
            <li> Held up good, only disadvantage is base is kind of too big for my liking.</li>
            <li> If I had bought my own flattener, I would never have purchased it, thinking it was unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> Will stick to the mirror but who wants a flat iron sticking off their mirror??</li>
            <li> I was using a Conair flat iron and this one much out performs it.</li>
            <li> Suctions on to the countertop, holds most smaller flat irons but the iron still sticks out quite a bit due to the angle.</li>
            <li> I now just rest the flat iron on a folded towel on top of a closed toilet seat.  </li>
            <li> Finally I found something that works and keeps my hot flat iron or curling wand up and away from my kids.</li>
            <li> At some point i will affix them to the wall, but first i will look to see if there is a holder that will hold two flat Irons or the blow dryer and flat Iron together.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a must-have since I have limited sink real estate, however it doesn’t stay put and topples over.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never touched it with my bare hands</li>
            <li> This product hangs on the mirror, allows iron to stay hot while using, cools down when done , and doesn&#x27;t heat up the mirror</li>
            <li> recommend this for any people who have a normal sized flat iron (Chi, GHB, and HSI - bought the flat iron - will post review).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about burn marks on the sink or little hands grabbing a hot iron.</li>
            <li> Having autistic 4-1/2 year old twins with no concept of \\&quot;hot\\&quot; meaning \\&quot;hurt\\&quot;, I had to find a way to keep a hot flat iron off the counter in order to use it.</li>
            <li> Before getting the stand, my flat iron would rest on my very small bathroom counter top or sometimes on the back of the toilet.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to put it on the mirror, It came crashing down in the middle of the night and woke the whole house.  </li>
            <li> I bought this stand for my little sister and she really loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very spiffy little addition to the HSI straightener.</li>
            <li> Fits my Babyliss Ultra Thin Flat iron just fine.  </li>
            <li> I used to always worry that the flat iron would be left on, or that it would cause damage while it was cooling.  </li>
            <li> This holder adheres tight to the bathroom mirror and sustains high heat temperatures for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand to hold my daughter&#x27;s HSI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the flat iron from damaging the counter and prevents flat iron from falling off counter onto the floor.  </li>

            <li> The stand works well with the HSI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> After doing my hair, I leave the flat iron in the stand until the appliance cools.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described by suppliers. Very useful while straightening or curling hair. Would recommend this product to anyone that uses heated hair styling tools.</li>
            <li> I had order this product but it would not hold down due to the weight of the flat iron.  I had reported this to Amazon and Blue Novelties.  It was replaced.  It is still not holding down due to the weight of the flat iron.  I think this product need to be made heavier in order for it to hold down the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love the new Flat Iron holder!  Love being able to fasten to wall and love that it is actually a very nice heavy duty product! No longer have to worry about my bathroom counter tops getting too hot! Worth the money for sure!</li>
            <li> I bought this stand to hold my daughter&#x27;s HSI flat iron.  I used the suction cups to fasten the stand to her wooden vanity.  There is also a screw/anchor included to attach it more permanently.  I used to always worry that the flat iron would be left on, or that it would cause damage while it was cooling.  Now I can worry a little less because if it&#x27;s in its holder, it&#x27;s less likely to start a fire.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ruined many surfaces due to the heat of my flat iron. This stand is very convenient and protects any surfaces from being ruined.</li>
            <li> I got this because my hair straightener was starting to leave marks on my counter.  I attached this to my mirror and it works great.  I have had it for several weeks now, and it is still firmly attached to the mirror.  I love that it gives me more counter space and keeps my counter from getting burn marks.</li>
            <li> This is a well built holder, and with 4 suction cups, easily holds the flat iron on the mirror. Not only does this de-clutter my sink area, but it also prevents other items from getting inadvertently burned.  The amount of risk this eliminates in having an extremely hot iron in the bathroom is well worth the small change for this item. I&#x27;m very happy with it, and know it will last at least as long as the iron!</li>
            <li> It work really well, I actually have it attached to the mirror on medicine cabinet so up out of reach of child.</li>
            <li> The stand doesn&#x27;t suction to my counter for more than a few minutes at a time. When I tried to put it on the mirror, It came crashing down in the middle of the night and woke the whole house.  It does come with some kind of mounting screw.  I can&#x27;t really tell how that would work but I haven&#x27;t really tried. I don&#x27;t want to use any screws because I&#x27;m renting. Now I keep it on my counter.  I like having a place to put my HSI flat iron while I&#x27;m using it, so this is better than putting it on the bare counter.  I just have to be careful not to knock it on the floor.</li>
            <li> It keeps the flat iron from damaging the counter and prevents flat iron from falling off counter onto the floor.  Thought the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This product holds the straightener with no problem and the sticky cups work wonderful.  this is a solid product and you can let your straightener warm up or cool off in it.  no need to worry about where you are setting the straightener anymore!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife so she could lay her $200 flat iron in a safe place. It&#x27;s very good looking and can be mounted on the wall. She loves it! It&#x27;s great for the price!</li>
            <li> This does come in handy - works great, stores away easily - wouldn&#x27;t use my flat iron without the stand. Thank you.[[ASIN:B003TJG6CK Sally Flat Iron Stand]]</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS THE WIFE LOVES IT, THEN IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT!!! STURDY AND GREAT PRICE. JUST WISHED IT WOULD STICK TO THE BATHROOM COUNTER (WE HAVE A WEIRD STONE TILE COUNTER)SHE USES, BUT IT WORKS AS ADVERTISED</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with the HSI flat iron. keeps it off the counter-top. Highly recommended if you own an HSI flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought this because it also had a screw mount, just in case the suction wouldn&#x27;t stick well, but it&#x27;s staying up great on my mirror.  It wouldn&#x27;t suction to my counter because the counter is textured, but I like it better on the mirror or wall better anyway.  This is really handy and a great deal - so much better than laying it on the counter and worrying about burning things.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand for my little sister and she really loves it. Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in great condition.  The only thing that I do not care for is that the suction cups do not stick to the sink counter, resulting in the stand tilting over a bit.  It has never fallen off the sink, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable leaving the room while it heats up.  Otherwise, I really do like the product and it makes storing the straightener much easier and neater looking.  Also much easier usage when straightening my hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> suction is awful! It pops off nearly EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it</li>
            <li> I have been advised that the iron has to cool before putting it in the holder. SO I can&#x27;t put it on my counter and I can&#x27;t put it in the holder until its cool. Kind of defeats part of the purpose for purchasing it. Someone tell me I&#x27;m wrong please. It is made very well though and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron after my Chi died.  For the price, I think this is a great flat iron.  It leaves my hair looking smooth (although I have pretty tame hair, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to make it look smooth and polished).  That being said, it doesn&#x27;t run through my hair with the silky-smoothness that the Chi did.  Of course, the Chi is much more expensive.</li>
            <li> this was the best purchase I have made!  I have seen them in salons and wondered where I could get one.  And now that I have, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Flat Iron holder does not always stay in place and slides around on our granite counter tops, but is still better putting your flat iron in a holder than laying in on your counter top. Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stick well or at all to my counter. Couldn&#x27;t use it. But good idea.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a flat iron that would take care of my frizzy hair. But this one I found same as a lot of others do the same. My hair looks great for the first hour and then it is back to frizzy hair. I was hoping by the reviews I read it would be better but it isn&#x27;t. I would rate this average on flat irons out there.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t have one of these before. Keeps the iron off of my counter and keeps me safe from accidentally touching it. Suction cups on the bottom keep it securely in place.</li>
            <li> Very cool item. Helps keep my wife&#x27;s straightener/flat iron out of the way. My only reason I didn&#x27;t give this item 5 stars is the poor suction cups. They would stick, but wouldnt support the weight of the straightener/flat iron when placed inside. Had to drill a hole in our dresser for the screw mount. Once I did that, the holder is secure. Great Item</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay put on all countertops but nice to have. It makes the process of doing your hair easier.</li>
            <li> This was great at first. However after 6 months the iron plates started coming unglued and it would pull my hair. I have now donated this product to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> When flat iron is in holder, the suction does not hold.  Trying to figure out a way to fix hat.</li>
            <li> This stand is fantastic!  I attached it to the side of the mirror and it is there ever since.  It is a great idea to have the iron put away in a very convenient place while hot.  This is a great companion to the iron.  The iron fits perfectly and I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> i find the suction cups on the bottom dont really adhere all that well, to ANY surface really. So a lot of the time I go to put the straightener in it and it falls off whatever surface it was on.  It can get frustrating. Other than that it does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very spiffy little addition to the HSI straightener. For anyone who says it doesn&#x27;t stay in place, just add a drop of water to each suction cup before pressing onto counter and it won&#x27;t raise back up. I&#x27;m really glad I spent the $8 I spent on this, it helps a lot when doing hair!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the cost was even greater. This is the first one i have ordered my flat Irons fit perfectly and the suction is very good and it holds longer when i added water to the suction cups first when using the flat lron. At some point i will affix them to the wall, but first i will look to see if there is a holder that will hold two flat Irons or the blow dryer and flat Iron together. I very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I think this product is a great idea! I always leave my hair straighter on the bathroom counter, which really clutters the space, and annoys my boyfriend. I think this is the perfect solution to the problem BUT about  once a week it falls off my bathroom mirror, so I find myself having to re-attach it. Other than that, it does a great job keeping your hot flat iron off the counter.</li>
            <li> Great way to keep your hot hair equipment from falling off the counter or have unsuspecting children putting their hands on the hot end of wands! Has some nifty suction cups to stick it to your mirror to put those tools even further out of reach of little hands!  Great Product!!</li>
            <li> Buying this item really helps with my flat iron which can be set for over 400 degrees and would otherwise not have a safe place for me to put when in use. Such a simple solution to something I&#x27;ve been using for years!</li>
            <li> Great little gadget. Don&#x27;t have to worry about burn marks on the sink or little hands grabbing a hot iron. Glad I purchased this along with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Cannot get the suction cups to work on either of my vanities. Will stick to the mirror but who wants a flat iron sticking off their mirror??</li>
            <li> So glad I made this purchase!  The stand perfectly fits my Chi 1&amp;#34; flat iron.  Before getting the stand, my flat iron would rest on my very small bathroom counter top or sometimes on the back of the toilet.  Not ideal, and not very safe.  Because the design of this stand has a very small footprint, the flat iron can now sit on my countertop and not take up much room!  It&#x27;s also a lot safer as I can rest the iron in the stand while it&#x27;s still hot, keeping it out of the way of any potential burn accidents.  The suction cups on the bottom are very strong and ensure that the stand is stable.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect fit for the HSI flat iron. It was suction cups on the bottom so you can easily put it somewhere and it will stay in place.</li>
            <li> Perfect accessory for my HSI flat iron. It stays in place and it helps with the cord not getting twisted.</li>
            <li> Hook very easily to the glass so my wife hooked to her mirror and she have it there with her Ionic Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> This product showed up on time packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with it is that the suction cup do not stick to the counter.</li>
            <li> I love this stand!  I&#x27;ve used my Chi flat iron for years and this stand is the perfect holder. Just like what your stylist uses.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this stand to go along with the HSI flatiron I purchased. Keeps flatiron secure and everything else on my bathroom counter safe from the heat.  My only complaint (which is not really a complaint) is that the suction cups don&#x27;t hold on my quartz countertop unless I wet them, but not a big deal to wet them.  All in all a great purchase!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product because it is made of plasitic, but it seems to hold well.  I will keep this upated once I use this product more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand after purchasing a flat iron from this same brand which I love but the stand not so much...it comes with suctions but it does not stand up! As soon as I try to rest the iron in the holder the whole thing tips over! I tried to mount it on the wall with the screw it came with and it fell out as soon as I put the iron in the holder yet again! Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this, you&#x27;re better off using the bag the iron comes in!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this additional product. I am just learning about hair straightening and find I have to set the iron down often. This works beautifully.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as it said it does. Very affordable option and way to get it off your counter and safe.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves this holder. I thought the suction was not going to hold, but I was wrong. It&#x27;s been over two weeks suction still good and it feels like its glued on there. If the wife is happy everybody in the house is happy. :-)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay stuck to my dresser. This is horrible! I would send it back but it was only $5.</li>
            <li> I stuck this on my mirror and it hasn&#x27;t even slightly loosened once. Love love love this thing. Finally I found something that works and keeps my hot flat iron or curling wand up and away from my kids.</li>
            <li> strong suction cups. Held up good, only disadvantage is base is kind of too big for my liking. if you have a big mirror it is ok, but I am using the portable vanity so my mirror holds it just takes up a bit of the side. I would recomend</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it! She bought one for her daughter as well and her niece too.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter, and she said it&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s ever used.  The price I got it for was outstanding, too.</li>
            <li> I was able to mount the stand exactly where I needed it. Helps keep the heat off surfaces that can be damaged.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Bought this for my wife, so she would stop leaving her iron out on the vanity.  Works very well.  Suction cups hold it in place.  I think the best testament is that I notice she uses it daily.  A big larger than I imagined, but its good.  You could probably mount it vertically too but happy using it on vanity.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the fact that my stand holds the hot temp off my countertops, but getting the suction cups to work took some effort.  Seller was fantastic, and I would buy from them again!</li>
            <li> This holder adheres tight to the bathroom mirror and sustains high heat temperatures for long periods of time. This is a must have if you have small children in your home!</li>
            <li> How do I put my straightner in this thing!?!? I&#x27;m wondering if it comes apart! I like the suction cups but Im very confused on now to put my straightner in the stand</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use it. Wasn&#x27;t thinking when I ordered . It holds by suction cup and I have a wood vanity. Will take on vacation with me.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I love it! Attractive enough to leave on counter and not too bulky.</li>
            <li> this is great to keep the flat iron off the table and provide somewhere for it to heat and cool.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with hair straightener and stand, also very happy with the transaction.  It arrived within two days of ordering.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the flat iron.  It&#x27;s ok.  The suction cups don&#x27;t really stick.  And the holder itself gets pretty warm.</li>
            <li> I love my iron holder. I just suctioned it to my mirror and it stays! It&#x27;s up out of the way and I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning the house down!</li>
            <li> A must have for flat irons! If you want to avoid burn marks on your bathroom counter (or wherever you flat iron your hair), grab one of these and you will be good to go.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the straightener for my daughter, because I loved my HSI straightener.  My daughter loves the stand.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> The stand works well with the HSI flat iron.  It enables me to work with my hair without having to worry about sitting a hot appliance on my ceramic sink or on my ceramic toilet bowl top.  After doing my hair, I leave the flat iron in the stand until the appliance cools.  The stand stays where I put it.  It does not slide around.  It has some suction cups at the bottom.  I have been very pleased with both the HSI flat iron and the HSI iron stand.</li>
            <li> This is actually a really great idea.  It&#x27;s perfect to use anywhere, and portable so you can drop it in your bag and go.</li>
            <li> It does and performs as stated. I was using a Conair flat iron and this one much out performs it.</li>
            <li> Suctions on to the countertop, holds most smaller flat irons but the iron still sticks out quite a bit due to the angle. Not the best for space saving, but great for keeping your hot iron off of the counter. This holder won&#x27;t melt.</li>
            <li> There are many different items out there like this but I have found this item to be one of the best. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it because it gives her a convenient place to put her flat iron before and after usage.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have if you are using a flat iron. I have had several burn marks on my counter from the heat of the iron and I always hated leaving it while still hot. This is functional and does not take up much room. Holds the heat within the holder very well. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> i love this iron stand! it looks great suctioned on my mirror, and although i&#x27;m usually highly paranoid about not keeping a direct eye on anything with a heating element, this allows me the piece of mind to turn it on, walk away for a few minutes while it&#x27;s heating up and not have to worry. it&#x27;s also nice to be able to put it back in while it&#x27;s cooling.  i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a must have for any flat iron owner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time flat iron owner.  Just got one... When I realized I needed some sort of stand or holder, I went on a search!&lt;br /&gt;From many I checked out, this HSI seamed the best.&lt;br /&gt;So far, it is!&lt;br /&gt;It attached to the mirror in the bathroom with ease, and can be just as easily reattached / be &amp;#34;relocated&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The size is perfect for either 3/4&amp;#34; or 1&amp;#34; flat irons&lt;br /&gt;Can withstand the heat, doesn&#x27;t melt (although my iron is only on for 15 - 20 mins at a time)&lt;br /&gt;The price was right&lt;br /&gt;Seller got it to me fast&lt;br /&gt;I am a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item because I burned the surface if my drawer once. This awesome product is perfect to hold my flatten iron after I used it and stores it perfectly. I would recommend this product to any ID my friends :-)</li>
            <li> I received my HSI flat iron stand very promptly! Blue Novelties was very communicative and wanted to ensure all packages products were received well! Unto the stand, I WISH I HAD BOUGHT THIS SOONER! Seriously! This is a God-send!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for any people who have a normal sized flat iron (Chi, GHB, and HSI - bought the flat iron - will post review).  Very handy, very practical, suction cups worked! Yeah! Just great!</li>
            <li> My wife had put this on her Amazon Wish List but had really forgotten it was there.  I saw it and got it for her for Christmas. She was truly happy to have it. It does what it is supposed to do, keep that hot hair iron off the bathroom counter and possibly off the carpet.</li>
            <li> A must have to go with the flat iron in tight quarters in a motorhome. I used to accidentally try to move the old iron not realizing it was hot. This holder will prevent accidentally burning&#x27;</li>
            <li> The product is very useful and came on time (it may have even came earlier than expected but I can&#x27;t remember right now. It&#x27;s been too long). I use it along with my Enzo Milano Clipless Curling Iron 1&amp;#34; Round. That curling iron gets EXTREMELY hot (I&#x27;ve never touched it with my bare hands but it does an amazing job giving me curls that last for days - a rare commodity for an asian with naturally straight long hair that resists any change whatsoever. You can just imagine how hot that baby gets) and I&#x27;ve never been afraid of putting it down on the counter/burning myself because I have this handy stand to make the process all better. I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve never had to wonder if the curling iron is hot enough to melt a notable indent into my expensive bathroom marble top. Not only is it great for controlling curling irons, it&#x27;s also easy to put the curling iron in. Not too loose (which would make it likely to get knocked out) or too tight (which would require some manuvering). I would recommend it for anyone that has a curling iron and wants to make the process so much easier.</li>
            <li> This is very handy to put the flat iron in when hot and not worry about burning anything!  I love it</li>
            <li> I bought it with the actual flat-iron of same name.  I LOVE the flat-iron but am disappointed with this iron stand.  The suction cups on base of stand DO NOT suction at all.  It was a wasted of money.  It might be easier to but a plain old upright cylinder of sorts than this contraption.</li>
            <li> Having autistic 4-1/2 year old twins with no concept of \\&quot;hot\\&quot; meaning \\&quot;hurt\\&quot;, I had to find a way to keep a hot flat iron off the counter in order to use it. This product hangs on the mirror, allows iron to stay hot while using, cools down when done , and doesn&#x27;t heat up the mirror it&#x27;s suctioned cup to. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Received as agreed in good conditioned. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This stand is great! I got it for my daughter to use and it works perfectly. The material is sturdy and the suction cups are not flimsy.</li>
            <li> This flat iron holder is a bit larger than I had expected, but it is very nice quality and does protect your counters from the flat iron.  IT has suctions cups on the base to hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean really its a hunk of plastic to keep the flat on off things that can be damaged and it does that portion of the job perfectly.  If you have a HSI flat iron, this is really a great addition to buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this iron stand along with the HSI hair straightner to prevent leaving burnt marks on my table surface.&lt;br /&gt;However the suction rubbers on the stand does not hold strongly.&lt;br /&gt;My hair iron fell on the ground multiple times, until I got so fed up and ended up throwing this stand away.&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money..</li>
            <li> This is the perfect holder for the HSI flat iron. Suction cups on the bottom keep it secure on the counter. Must buy with any flat iron purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great add on to the HSI Flat Iron - keeps the unit off the counter top and in a safe secure place. I have left my unit on accidentally and this ensures that it is not just laying around for someone to burn themselves or lay something on top of!</li>
            <li> My husband bought me a new flattener for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and this as well.  If I had bought my own flattener, I would never have purchased it, thinking it was unnecessary.  I am SO glad he got this to go along with my straightener!  I don&#x27;t have to worry about my counters, it burning anyone while it is heating up, or it falling.  My flat iron finally has a &amp;#34;home&amp;#34;, and I love that it can be attached to a wall.  I don&#x27;t think it holds to the mirror all that well, but I value my mirror space too much to attach it there, so that is a non issue.</li>
            <li> The HSI flat Iron holder beat my expectations. It is perfect and does not take up much space, plus it is easier to retrieve the flat iron with burning your fingers, no more laying the flat iron on the sink, the HSI hold perfectly fits a 1 inch flat iron. great angle, so there are no worries about dropping your flat iron or leaving a burn mark. Very sturdy and sleek. I love the Holder!!!!</li>
            <li> Does not stick well to the surface.</li>
            <li> Unnecessary.  I thought it would be a must-have since I have limited sink real estate, however it doesn’t stay put and topples over.  I now just rest the flat iron on a folded towel on top of a closed toilet seat.  The flat iron by this company, HSI, is however AMAZING, I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this stand.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that has given me \\&quot;peace of mind\\&quot; with my 12 year old daughter who is somewhat forgetfull in turning things off.  It fits perfectly on her vanity. Stays firm with the suction cups.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and inexpensive Flat Iron Holder.  It has suction cups to stick to your counter or mirror so your flat iron stays put.  We bought it over a year ago and it has worked fine for daily use, which can&#x27;t be said for a lot of products in this price range, so quality seems good.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations.  I have it on top of my sink vanity and the suction cups don&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li> I love this stand! I can turn my flat iron on while doing my makeup and not worry about scorching my countertop (which I&#x27;ve previously done). Also, the stand is equipped with slots that let the heat through, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the stand melting or burning my fingertips.</li>
            <li> Fits my Babyliss Ultra Thin Flat iron just fine.  I love it and it keeps my table clutter free!  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Was  looking for something cheap to mount on the wall for the hair straightener. This works well and is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty straightforward: A stand that holds your flat hair iron.&lt;br /&gt;Having this is better than my straightener burning my counter top. It&#x27;s nothing special, but it&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
