            <li>:-D    </li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li>ordered mine from Best Buy Beauty in NoHo/LA, CA.</li>
            <li>are great!</li>
            <li>best hair elastics i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because they are so much superior to a &amp;#34;elastic band&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to see that they are now offered on the internet.  </li>
            <li>but they are still as great as ever.</li>
            <li>Regardless of, these hair elastics are great.  </li>
            <li>my package had a nice surprise of goodies!</li>
            <li>They are great for styling my daughter&#x27;s hair as well as my own.</li>
            <li>and I try to take as good care of it as I can</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly sturdy.</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s been Hell trying to find a suitable hair band!  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i found beautyhabit!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>what i LOVE most: and hand written note from a miss emily!</li>
            <li>Love, love these hair elastics!</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love these for the gym and running.</li>
            <li>I love these elastics.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;ll be great for tying end of braids, not thick pony tails.</li>
            <li>and these prevent snugging, they come out as easily as I want them too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend these for those of you who need a really strong elastic, one that does not slip at all.</li>
            <li>Then when I remove it, there&#x27;s no elasticity available to stretch it out and easily pull her poofy pony tail through.  </li>
            <li>Now I wear my hair more appropriate for an older woman</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved these for quite some time now, they are the only elastics I trust for my hair.</li>
            <li>It is true that they don&#x27;t snag in her hair.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t snag-free but as good as it gets with a hold for my Asian hair.  </li>
            <li>They are rather pricy, but you can re-use so not a bad bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>And the best part is that one last weeks if you&#x27;re gentle with it, so one package lasts a long while.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought it for my daughter because it is totally snag free.</li>
            <li>thanks gals!</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to them when I was wearing my hair in a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so how different can it be?  </li>
            <li>Read positive reviews about Blax Hair Elastics, and decided to purchase.</li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t slip - keeps the style exactly as you set it - are quite gentle (don&#x27;t pull or rip hair).  </li>
            <li>but luckily I found the Blax name on an old packaging I had.  </li>
            <li>i really do appreciate the gesture</li>
            <li>I have medium/thick straight hair</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Blax Hair Elastics.</li>
            <li>These are the best elastics I&#x27;ve found since the old drugstore ones turned into worthless things that would stretch and snap the first time I tried to use them.</li>
            <li>While Scunci No Damage &amp; Kai bands are about the same as far as snagging, BLAX has a way tighter hold, especially for those who do NOT have as much hair.  </li>
            <li>but I work as an Army sub-contractor, and the &#x27;Hello Kitty&#x27;, and &#x27;Hot Pink and Mauve hair Elastics available, usually elicit a chuckle from my co-worker&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Got these for my 2-year-old who has thick, fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Warning: These things are too thin to get a grip on and slide off your pony tail without them grabbing many hairs and breaking them off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*About as snag-free as it gets for a band (snags less than Kai bands, maybe a little bit better than/equal to Scunci No Damage/Goody)&lt;br /&gt;*Best</li>

            <li> I only wish my local store still carried these. They are great for styling my daughter&#x27;s hair as well as my own.</li>
            <li> i just moved to co and couldn&#x27;t find blax anywhere. i was bummed.    i&#x27;m glad i found beautyhabit! the order came before it&#x27;s estimation. my package had a nice surprise of goodies! what i LOVE most: and hand written note from a miss emily! i really do appreciate the gesture :-D    thanks gals!</li>
            <li> Read positive reviews about Blax Hair Elastics, and decided to purchase. My hair stays up all day at work with this product, and doesn&#x27;t fall down. I would highly recommend Blax Hair Elastics. I purchased the 4 mm black elastics. A++++++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved these for quite some time now, they are the only elastics I trust for my hair. I am very careful with my hair and I try to take as good care of it as I can and these prevent snugging, they come out as easily as I want them too and they don&#x27;t damage my hair at all . Perfect!</li>
            <li> Love, love these hair elastics! Have been using it for years. Originally bought it for my daughter because it is totally snag free. It&#x27;s perfect for my hair. Not too tight not too loose, does not pull on my hair. Highly recommended especially for little girl&#x27;s hair.</li>

They hold my thick hair, stay put, and only pull slightly, when I take them out. I&#x27;ve been using them for weeks and none of them have broken.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering these.  I love the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly sturdy. I kept expecting the rubber/plastic to snap and break, but it never did. Unfortunately, the smooth surface of the plastic doesn&#x27;t help to keep it in place, so the bands kept sliding down~ down~ down~ all day. I think it&#x27;ll be great for tying end of braids, not thick pony tails.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because they are so much superior to a &amp;#34;elastic band&amp;#34;!  They don&#x27;t pull and they don&#x27;t break off your hair at the base.  I have been using them for the past 20 years.  I was so happy to see that they are now offered on the internet.  I was first introduced to them when I was wearing my hair in a pony tail.  Now I wear my hair more appropriate for an older woman but they are still as great as ever.</li>
            <li> Holds your hair tight and does not pull or slip.</li>
            <li> Got these for my 2-year-old who has thick, fine curly hair.  It is true that they don&#x27;t snag in her hair.  The problem is that they&#x27;re only a little bit elastic, so to get them to stay on properly, I have to wrap it around until it&#x27;s on pretty tight.  Then when I remove it, there&#x27;s no elasticity available to stretch it out and easily pull her poofy pony tail through.  So I have to slowly inch it off (except it&#x27;s more on the order of centimeters), while holding tightly to the base so I don&#x27;t yank her head.  And yes, it doesn&#x27;t get snagged in that process, but it&#x27;s time consuming and no easy feat on a squirmy 2 year-old.  This is probably not an issue for people whose hair is straight/wavy and maybe even for looser curls, but hers are really tight and result in quite a poof.  And I&#x27;m sure people who are older could manage the removal, but it still seems like it would be annoying</li>
            <li> I love these! The only hair tie I will use. They hold my hair tightly and never tangle or snag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these for those of you who need a really strong elastic, one that does not slip at all. I love these for the gym and running. I never have to adjust my ponytail during workouts. I wouldn&#x27;t call them \\&quot;snag-free\\&quot; but they are not damaging. If you just need casual elastics to pull your back for around the house, no need to splurge on these. They are rather pricy, but you can re-use so not a bad bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase these elastics under the Sephora brand (not realizing that they were produced by Blax).  I couldn&#x27;t find these at Sephora anymore but luckily I found the Blax name on an old packaging I had.  Regardless of, these hair elastics are great.  If I don&#x27;t manage to lose it, one elastic will last me for months before the rubber finally rips.  I&#x27;ll use the same elastic everyday and it will stretch out but you just create another loop over your ponytail and it&#x27;ll hold tightly.  I have medium/thick straight hair and it holds while I&#x27;m running, crossfitting or sleeping.  I love these elastics.</li>
            <li> Ok, so how different can it be?  They aren&#x27;t snag-free but as good as it gets with a hold for my Asian hair.  While Scunci No Damage &amp; Kai bands are about the same as far as snagging, BLAX has a way tighter hold, especially for those who do NOT have as much hair.  NOTE: BLAX 4mm and 2mm bands are 1.625 inches in diameter (1.5 inch plus 1/8th).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;*About as snag-free as it gets for a band (snags less than Kai bands, maybe a little bit better than/equal to Scunci No Damage/Goody)&lt;br /&gt;*Best tight hold. Hands-down tighter than Scunci, Goody &amp; Kai.&lt;br /&gt;*Best hold for people with less/thinner hair.  Band diameter is ~1.5 inches, significantly smaller than Scunci No Damage, Goody &amp; Kai bands.&lt;br /&gt;*Band stretches out less after use than other brands (Scunci, Goody &amp; Kai).  Mine stretch out ~20%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;*Can be a little more difficult to tighten your ponytail by pulling strands of your hair given the tightness of the band.&lt;br /&gt;*While the hold does NOT loosen at all during the day, the band does slide down a bit (~1/4 inch after a few hours if you don&#x27;t tighten your hair).&lt;br /&gt;*Have to order online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered mine from Best Buy Beauty in NoHo/LA, CA. My order shipped within 24hrs and I received it in a few days.</li>
            <li> Love them. Will be the only rubberbands I will by in the future.</li>
            <li> Warning: These things are too thin to get a grip on and slide off your pony tail without them grabbing many hairs and breaking them off.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended these to me and gave me one to try.  I often wear my hair in a pony tail and all elastics cause pain after a few hours.  I was amazed that these do not.  Also, they don&#x27;t slip - keeps the style exactly as you set it - are quite gentle (don&#x27;t pull or rip hair).  And the best part is that one last weeks if you&#x27;re gentle with it, so one package lasts a long while.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair pulled back, &#x27;a la&#x27;  colonial style for the last 15 years or so! AND it&#x27;s been Hell trying to find a suitable hair band!  I don&#x27;t know why but I work as an Army sub-contractor, and the &#x27;Hello Kitty&#x27;, and &#x27;Hot Pink and Mauve hair Elastics available, usually elicit a chuckle from my co-worker&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well these hair Elastics come in solid black, lasts for weeks of removals and re-ties and doesn&#x27;t pull or damage your hair when you pull them out at night!&lt;br /&gt;They are great!</li>
            <li> best hair elastics i&#x27;ve ever used. slide off your hair like silk. durable. i will never use anything else for my ponytail.</li>
