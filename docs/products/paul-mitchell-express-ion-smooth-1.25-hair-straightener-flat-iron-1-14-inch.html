            <li>I also got advice on the best way to put some curls in my hair.</li>
            <li>In addition, I do use a mixture of Chi Silk Infusion and Biosilk hair serum....  awesome combo!</li>
            <li>That being said, if you don&#x27;t need an iron to go over 400 degrees, then this is an EXCELLENT product.  </li>

            <li>Great iron.  </li>
            <li>Well the hair looks great, shines and have a bouncy feel but smells burnt.</li>
            <li>Was great until the iron died on me in 2 months.</li>
            <li>so I had to buy my own!</li>
            <li>and this iron is perfect! :)</li>
            <li>It works wonderful, WAY better than my Chi.</li>
            <li>There are some video demos online on youtube.com and they are good.</li>
            <li>and I loved it...</li>
            <li>and I was worried I could not find another as good at smoothing my hair without burning it.  </li>
            <li>I have owned two Chi&#x27;s before, and thought they were good.  </li>
            <li>so good</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED it.</li>
            <li>This is all they use there and for good reason to.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous, bouncy hair should not smell burnt.</li>
            <li>The Chi flattens faster, smoother and without fly aways or static.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this hair straightener because, unlike the CHI, with this one I can choose the temperature I need and not damage my hair.</li>
            <li>This one is even better!  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love this straightener!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My hair is so much more healthier!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome hot iron.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener because, even before I had purchased it, the box had all of its attributes and how it worked, labeled on to it!</li>
            <li>The first one, my cats knocked off the counter after three years of perfect use.</li>
            <li>It has great storage capabilities and is easy to use and work with.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>Good job Paul Mitchell :)</li>
            <li>I was impressed that it did a really good job on my mixed hair (black/white hair type)</li>
            <li>This has been the best iron for hair by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and this is by far the best one yet.</li>
            <li>and I need Exceptional products, &amp; this is probably the best flat iron ive ever used in 12 years of styling hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length, very fine</li>
            <li>This iron would be the perfect iron except for one major flaw.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth process.</li>
            <li>Plates do not pull hair, very, very smooth.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it daily and each time she tells me how wonderful it is.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t at all believe her when she said it was better than the Chi.  </li>
            <li>I love the heat control component</li>
            <li>It is the Pro series so it does cost more....</li>
            <li>and I like it even better.  </li>
            <li>Your better off buying a Chi since they are cheaper.</li>
            <li>I bought this for $100, but would not pay more than $70 for it.</li>
            <li>This straightener is 10000 times better than the chi.</li>
            <li>Love this Straightener, bought one for my daughter to replace her CHI.</li>
            <li>Everyone has different types of hair...for mine, the Chi is best.  </li>
            <li>I love the quality and performance of this straightener.</li>
            <li>It may cost a tad bit more than some</li>
            <li>The second one, burned in a house fire after three years of perfect use.</li>
            <li>After reviewing many irons, I chose this one.</li>
            <li>I love that I can control the temperature too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Awesome flat iron simply love it.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best flat iron that Ive ever used!  </li>
            <li>lol I let her have it and ordered me a new one..</li>
            <li>You can adjust the heat giving you more freedom to fit the texture of your hair and the amount of time you have to get your hair</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I even bought someone one as a gift</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>This, by far is the best I&#x27;ve used, not only on my own hair, but it has worked well on all types of hair I&#x27;ve used it on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in 2012 and it is still works amazing like when i first had it.</li>
            <li>I use the lower setting because my hair is fine, and it does the job without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, and straightens hair without any frizz!</li>
            <li>When it died I found that model was no longer available</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth without frying it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair silky smooth, not like the Chi where as soon as you&#x27;ve straightened it, it looks fried.  </li>
            <li>well it&#x27;s worth it. :-)</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel so smooth &amp; makes it shiny too.</li>
            <li>Most Useful Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a straightener from Walmart, it started shorting out.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair shine and it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>I need to use this iron at the highest heat setting to smooth and straighten some of the course textures that I style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairstylist and a great iron like this is essential.</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener to replace my old Paul Mitchell straightener, which I loved and used for 10+ years.  </li>
            <li>This one is just as good as the old one.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was pretty good at first until I used the Chi.  </li>
            <li>The Chi straightens pretty good (in comparison) but also leaves your hair feeling kind of dry; the Paul Mitchell straightener leaves your hair silky smooth, straightens AWESOME, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>super easy to use</li>
            <li>I switched to paul mitchel and the price is worth it!</li>
            <li>but so worth it!</li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I love love love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly &amp; leaves hair smooth.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair smooth, soft, and so nice</li>
            <li>They can flat iron any type of hair, they get hot fast; Paul Mitchell&#x27;s are the best ever!</li>
            <li>Not as great as I expected based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and better than a chi straightner ...</li>
            <li>I have to say for how much I paid for this straightener it dosent do any better than my 40$ one from tjmaxx.  </li>
            <li>and I say personally I made a good choice...</li>
            <li>I figured this would be a true test of it working if it can straighten my curly hair</li>
            <li>It is definitely superior (as it should be since its over double the price).</li>
            <li>and I got a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I get keratin treatments/brazilian blowouts, so it&#x27;s not nearly as bad anymore.</li>
            <li>My clients pay too much money for anything less than perfectly styled hair.     </li>
            <li>This flat iron is not as good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good flat iron</li>
            <li>It does heat up quickly, and you can choose the temperature.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this fabulous flat iton and I am so glad that I invested in this!  </li>
            <li>have super curly hair that I have been fighting since I was in 8th grade.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, definitely a must for curly-haired women that love and protect their curls, and sometimes want to change it up without hurting their locks.</li>
            <li>This straightener heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot but still doesn&#x27;t burn/damage my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a stylist of 11+ years, and have tried many, many flat irons.  </li>
            <li>But love, love, LOVE this new PaulMitchell Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>I have had several different brands of straighteners--including the famous Chi--and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you pay attention to how much heat you&#x27;re applying according to your hair thickness, and just like with every other styling tool, it is a wise investment to use a protectant spray before applying heat to your hair.</li>
            <li>This would be on my top 5 list of can&#x27;t live without items.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product really is \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; and glides through hair easily.</li>
            <li>- that&#x27;s definitely a first for me!</li>
            <li>It makes my wavy hair very smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>This straightener works great for my daughter that has fine, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>It does not pull hair, and is easy on your arm as it is fairly lightweight in comparison to my old 1\\&quot; flat iron (which was not Paul Mitchell).</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The price is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li>def worth the price.</li>
            <li>Dependable and is worth buying.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a shot, since if I bought another Chi</li>
            <li>this is one by far way better.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, thick hair and this flat iron works wonderfully; it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
            <li>and she was absolutely right.  </li>
            <li>The multiple heat settings and useful recommendations made it very easy to use the first time, and I can get my hair done in literally 15 minutes</li>
            <li>It doesnt pull on my hair, it makes it smooth, shiny and very soft.</li>
            <li>But my hair is light and very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>works great and the cord is really long, so i dont have to find a plug right next to a mirror</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fussy/high-maintenance about my hair and all products that I use on it.  </li>
            <li>so I returned it so make sure you actually go to a store and get it there because they sent me a defective one</li>
            <li>and it absolutely did!</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair silky, smooth and shiney, and it gets hot enough to straighten the most coarse and curly hair, usually with use per section, works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted 6 years and was used often and traveled everywhere with no problems.</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast!</li>
            <li>I actually like this better than my Chi.</li>
            <li>It gets hot in seconds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hair styling tool for several months now, and I really enjoy the effects it has on my hair!</li>
            <li>I love this hair straightener, still 2 years later!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Probably better for someone who has thicker longer hair than mine, which is only just to my shoulders.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m pretty pissed.</li>
            <li>My hair was starting to become damaged due to an old straightener and this one makes it look great!</li>
            <li>This is a lovely flat iron.</li>
            <li>I had a Paul Mitchell flat iron but dropped it one to many times on the tile floor.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much that I bought it again after I killed the first</li>
            <li>Love my Paul Mitchell flat iron .</li>
            <li>We have bought this flat iron before and love it.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the time I had with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: straighten slowly in small pieces to achieve best effect and use oil hair serum periodically as it can dry your ends.</li>
            <li>When I needed a new one I again went to the Paul Mitchell brand and paid more than some of the more expensive store brands because I figured I would love it.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron - Paul Mitchell products tend to work very well with my hair (type</li>
            <li>I use Pureology split end correcting treatment (2-3 pumps), Moroccan Oil (2-3 pumps) on my damp hair, Rusk thermal spray on my dry hair, straighten, and then put some more Moroccan oil on.</li>
            <li>I have had numerous straighteners over the years from the original Hot Tools, Sedu, Chi -</li>
            <li>It works great - especially considering my hair is thick and super wavy.</li>
            <li>This straightener is made out of cheap-feeling plastic and gets very hot near the top of the handle, so I found myself nearly burning my thumb if I positioned it there (which happened naturally several times).</li>
            <li>There is a thing as way too much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull at you hair as much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is sturdy, well made and it is very thorough.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to go over anything again to really get it straight.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It smoothed out all the waves and kept my hair straight all day.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints really.</li>
            <li>The seller was very responsive and helpful</li>
            <li>looking as well as straight...</li>
            <li>My hair took too much of a beating over time with this Paul Mitchell iron.  </li>
            <li>Fast in sending and responding.</li>
            <li>Your hair does feel much smoother.</li>
            <li>However, I purchased this straightener before I had ever had a treatment, and it really works.</li>
            <li>With that being said, this straightener (before I ever had a keratin treatment) would fool people into thinking I had straight hair with just 20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>none of them got my hair completely straight.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair pin straight within minutes</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently debating between replacing the burned EIS with either another EIS or the Neuro Smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it heats really fast</li>
            <li>You should really  try it.</li>
            <li>I used this new one for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>Cord is long and has a self-wrap for easy storage.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing for multiple reasons.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER COARSE SUPER CURLY hair naturally.</li>
            <li>Simply said: it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>and yes, it&#x27;s like a small investment for me, but I am so glad I ordered this!</li>
            <li>It smooths our hair much better than other types, without over-drying.</li>
            <li>My hair is long &amp; fine with some waves &amp; frizz.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended for a woman on the go who needs to create a good hair day in 5 minutes or less.    </li>
            <li>I have in between hair which is not exactly thin but yet not thick either.</li>
            <li>It sure out does the other brands in the malls!</li>
            <li>I can straighten my hair in 1/3 the time of other straighteners and it leaves it feeling silky smooth and straight all day despite living in a very humid climate with</li>
            <li>It is far superior to the Chi or other similar products.</li>
            <li>Straight from the box, brand new.</li>
            <li>It took me several passes to get my hair soft and smooth, but in the end it achieved it.</li>
            <li>I have thick, very curly hair and this straightener is amazing for it.</li>
            <li>definately worth the extra money, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My first one (the exact same as this one) lasted 5.5years!</li>
            <li>I think that after the second day it straightened my hair better for the rest of the weekend (only wash my hair twice a week).</li>
            <li>The paddles get very hot on the outside and it doesn&#x27;t seem to grip my hair as well as the infra-shine hair</li>
            <li>As for straightening, I found that it doesn&#x27;t clamp the hair as well as my Sedu, and you have to hold the handle more tightly.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It straightens with two passes, and you don&#x27;t have to set it on a high setting.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this model that is why we bought it again.</li>
            <li>High quality iron.</li>
            <li>She also stated that even though the PM flat irons that have the silicone strips they do grip better but they will melt and you have to constantly replace them.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly (30 seconds, approximately) and straightens beautifully without having to go over the same section of hair multiple times.</li>
            <li>You could use a little more hair than the one I just bought and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little better in that it seems to heat up faster.  </li>
            <li>I love this straightner, my daughter got it for Christmas a few years ago and moved out</li>
            <li>For time saved alone, it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>This is no ordinary straightener, it has volcanic and conditioning minerals to keep your hair very soft!</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and new as promised.</li>
            <li>It takes her almost half the time to get ready than it used to when she was using a more generic straightener.</li>
            <li>and I found that this iron just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to handle it.  </li>
            <li>The only reason that I replaced my first one is because we traveled to Europe and the converter blew it out.</li>
            <li>I bought the same one again because the first one worked so well</li>
            <li>I thought I would not like the new one as much as my old one</li>
            <li>Have patience and there is certain techniques for different curls that you want done.</li>
            <li>Worth every single stinking penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also small and lightweight, very easy to travel with, as I recently did, and I don&#x27;t fear damaging my hair with this iron.</li>
            <li>Humidity/rain/snow didn&#x27;t bother my hair too much with the Chi, but I do have to say that the Paul Mitchell straightener is one step above Chi.  </li>
            <li>I use Mixed Chicks Hair Silk to really lock it</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair completely shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I have very curly/frizzy Italian hair and my hair ends up being smoothe and silky every time</li>
            <li>but I would think it should last much, much longer.</li>
            <li>would def recommend this if you need a REALLY GOOD iron for your difficult hair.</li>
            <li>But the day I used this my hair was in a curly mood from the humidity and already dry so the curl was pretty formed by then.</li>
            <li>It worked so well, and I was pleased with my first &#x27;expensive&#x27; hair product purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this item is fake.</li>
            <li>I plugged it into a different outlet and then the light blinked WAY faster than normal that time and the next few times I used it, but I think it&#x27;s the electrical wiring in my old apartment rather than something with the straightener.</li>
            <li>The cord ended up showing wires (not safe, but I continued to use it), and it got where I had to hold it a certain way for it to get hot.</li>
            <li>I had an older style Paul Mitchell flat iron</li>
            <li>Usually if I unplugged it and left it alone for a day or two, or plugged it into the wall and reset the circuit, I would be able to plug it back in and it would start working again...</li>
            <li>I thought maybe the squared edges would make it hard to curl with, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>and I was looking into buying a new flat iron because my CHI seems to be on</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair, this iron does not work well for my hair,for the price I was hoping for better.</li>
            <li>I only use 3 things in my hair as far as product.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be a little better then my previous chi.  </li>
            <li>only downsides are that it does not straighten wet hair (but I find these straighteners sub-par in their ability to truly achieve perfectly straight hair) and it is not dual voltage.</li>
            <li>Due to it&#x27;s well known name and high price</li>
            <li>My blowouts are still EXTREMELY POOFY AND FRIZZY, and this iron makes it look flat, straight and no frizz</li>
            <li>This was a christmas present for my girlfriend, she LOVES it, says it works a lot faster then her other older one.</li>
            <li>Since the second one burned, we have had several people loan/give us straighteners, and not a single one of them cut it.</li>
            <li>She has very thick curly hair and it makes her hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, wiry, coarse (caucasian) hair, and everything I&#x27;ve ever tried (cheap Remingtons and Conairs to stylist-quality Chis) struggled.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> And she even used it to put curls or waves in my hair and it did a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I also got advice on the best way to put some curls in my hair.</li>
            <li> In addition, I do use a mixture of Chi Silk Infusion and Biosilk hair serum....  awesome combo!</li>
            <li> That being said, if you don&#x27;t need an iron to go over 400 degrees, then this is an EXCELLENT product.  </li>
            <li> Great tool!</li>

            <li> Well the hair looks great, shines and have a bouncy feel but smells burnt.</li>
            <li> Was great until the iron died on me in 2 months.</li>
            <li> so I had to buy my own!</li>
            <li> and this iron is perfect! :)</li>
            <li> It works wonderful, WAY better than my Chi.</li>
            <li> There are some video demos online on youtube.com and they are good.</li>
            <li> and I loved it...</li>
            <li> and I was worried I could not find another as good at smoothing my hair without burning it.  </li>
            <li> I have owned two Chi&#x27;s before, and thought they were good.  </li>
            <li> so good</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED it.</li>
            <li> This is all they use there and for good reason to.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous, bouncy hair should not smell burnt.</li>
            <li> The Chi flattens faster, smoother and without fly aways or static.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hair straightener because, unlike the CHI, with this one I can choose the temperature I need and not damage my hair.</li>
            <li> This one is even better!  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>

            <li> My hair is so much more healthier!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome hot iron.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener because, even before I had purchased it, the box had all of its attributes and how it worked, labeled on to it!</li>
            <li> The first one, my cats knocked off the counter after three years of perfect use.</li>
            <li> It has great storage capabilities and is easy to use and work with.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Shipped really fast and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Good job Paul Mitchell :)</li>
            <li> I was impressed that it did a really good job on my mixed hair (black/white hair type)</li>
            <li> This has been the best iron for hair by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and this is by far the best one yet.</li>
            <li> and I need Exceptional products, &amp; this is probably the best flat iron ive ever used in 12 years of styling hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, very fine</li>
            <li> This iron would be the perfect iron except for one major flaw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very smooth process.</li>
            <li> Plates do not pull hair, very, very smooth.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it daily and each time she tells me how wonderful it is.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t at all believe her when she said it was better than the Chi.  </li>
            <li> I love the heat control component</li>
            <li> It is the Pro series so it does cost more....</li>
            <li> and I like it even better.  </li>
            <li> Your better off buying a Chi since they are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought this for $100, but would not pay more than $70 for it.</li>
            <li> This straightener is 10000 times better than the chi.</li>
            <li> Love this Straightener, bought one for my daughter to replace her CHI.</li>
            <li> Everyone has different types of hair...for mine, the Chi is best.  </li>
            <li> I love the quality and performance of this straightener.</li>
            <li> It may cost a tad bit more than some</li>
            <li> The second one, burned in a house fire after three years of perfect use.</li>
            <li> After reviewing many irons, I chose this one.</li>
            <li> I love that I can control the temperature too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Awesome flat iron simply love it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best flat iron that Ive ever used!  </li>
            <li> lol I let her have it and ordered me a new one..</li>
            <li> You can adjust the heat giving you more freedom to fit the texture of your hair and the amount of time you have to get your hair</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I even bought someone one as a gift</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> This, by far is the best I&#x27;ve used, not only on my own hair, but it has worked well on all types of hair I&#x27;ve used it on.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in 2012 and it is still works amazing like when i first had it.</li>
            <li> I use the lower setting because my hair is fine, and it does the job without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, and straightens hair without any frizz!</li>
            <li> When it died I found that model was no longer available</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth without frying it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair silky smooth, not like the Chi where as soon as you&#x27;ve straightened it, it looks fried.  </li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s worth it. :-)</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel so smooth &amp; makes it shiny too.</li>
            <li> Most Useful Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a straightener from Walmart, it started shorting out.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair shine and it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> I need to use this iron at the highest heat setting to smooth and straighten some of the course textures that I style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and a great iron like this is essential.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener to replace my old Paul Mitchell straightener, which I loved and used for 10+ years.  </li>
            <li> This one is just as good as the old one.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty good at first until I used the Chi.  </li>
            <li> The Chi straightens pretty good (in comparison) but also leaves your hair feeling kind of dry; the Paul Mitchell straightener leaves your hair silky smooth, straightens AWESOME, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> super easy to use</li>
            <li> I switched to paul mitchel and the price is worth it!</li>
            <li> but so worth it!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love love love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly &amp; leaves hair smooth.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair smooth, soft, and so nice</li>
            <li> They can flat iron any type of hair, they get hot fast; Paul Mitchell&#x27;s are the best ever!</li>
            <li> Not as great as I expected based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and better than a chi straightner ...</li>
            <li> I have to say for how much I paid for this straightener it dosent do any better than my 40$ one from tjmaxx.  </li>
            <li> and I say personally I made a good choice...</li>
            <li> I figured this would be a true test of it working if it can straighten my curly hair</li>
            <li> It is definitely superior (as it should be since its over double the price).</li>
            <li> and I got a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I get keratin treatments/brazilian blowouts, so it&#x27;s not nearly as bad anymore.</li>
            <li> My clients pay too much money for anything less than perfectly styled hair.     </li>
            <li> This flat iron is not as good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good flat iron</li>
            <li> It does heat up quickly, and you can choose the temperature.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this fabulous flat iton and I am so glad that I invested in this!  </li>
            <li> have super curly hair that I have been fighting since I was in 8th grade.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, definitely a must for curly-haired women that love and protect their curls, and sometimes want to change it up without hurting their locks.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot but still doesn&#x27;t burn/damage my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stylist of 11+ years, and have tried many, many flat irons.  </li>
            <li> But love, love, LOVE this new PaulMitchell Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> I have had several different brands of straighteners--including the famous Chi--and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you pay attention to how much heat you&#x27;re applying according to your hair thickness, and just like with every other styling tool, it is a wise investment to use a protectant spray before applying heat to your hair.</li>
            <li> This would be on my top 5 list of can&#x27;t live without items.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product really is \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; and glides through hair easily.</li>
            <li> - that&#x27;s definitely a first for me!</li>
            <li> It makes my wavy hair very smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This straightener works great for my daughter that has fine, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not pull hair, and is easy on your arm as it is fairly lightweight in comparison to my old 1\\&quot; flat iron (which was not Paul Mitchell).</li>
            <li> but it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li> def worth the price.</li>
            <li> Dependable and is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a shot, since if I bought another Chi</li>
            <li> this is one by far way better.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick hair and this flat iron works wonderfully; it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
            <li> and she was absolutely right.  </li>
            <li> The multiple heat settings and useful recommendations made it very easy to use the first time, and I can get my hair done in literally 15 minutes</li>
            <li> It doesnt pull on my hair, it makes it smooth, shiny and very soft.</li>
            <li> But my hair is light and very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> works great and the cord is really long, so i dont have to find a plug right next to a mirror</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fussy/high-maintenance about my hair and all products that I use on it.  </li>
            <li> so I returned it so make sure you actually go to a store and get it there because they sent me a defective one</li>
            <li> and it absolutely did!</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair silky, smooth and shiney, and it gets hot enough to straighten the most coarse and curly hair, usually with use per section, works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted 6 years and was used often and traveled everywhere with no problems.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast!</li>
            <li> I actually like this better than my Chi.</li>
            <li> It gets hot in seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair styling tool for several months now, and I really enjoy the effects it has on my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener, still 2 years later!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Probably better for someone who has thicker longer hair than mine, which is only just to my shoulders.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m pretty pissed.</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to become damaged due to an old straightener and this one makes it look great!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had a Paul Mitchell flat iron but dropped it one to many times on the tile floor.  </li>
            <li> Loved it so much that I bought it again after I killed the first</li>
            <li> Love my Paul Mitchell flat iron .</li>
            <li> We have bought this flat iron before and love it.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the time I had with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: straighten slowly in small pieces to achieve best effect and use oil hair serum periodically as it can dry your ends.</li>
            <li> When I needed a new one I again went to the Paul Mitchell brand and paid more than some of the more expensive store brands because I figured I would love it.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron - Paul Mitchell products tend to work very well with my hair (type</li>
            <li> I use Pureology split end correcting treatment (2-3 pumps), Moroccan Oil (2-3 pumps) on my damp hair, Rusk thermal spray on my dry hair, straighten, and then put some more Moroccan oil on.</li>
            <li> I have had numerous straighteners over the years from the original Hot Tools, Sedu, Chi -</li>
            <li> It works great - especially considering my hair is thick and super wavy.</li>
            <li> This straightener is made out of cheap-feeling plastic and gets very hot near the top of the handle, so I found myself nearly burning my thumb if I positioned it there (which happened naturally several times).</li>
            <li> There is a thing as way too much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull at you hair as much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sturdy, well made and it is very thorough.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to go over anything again to really get it straight.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It smoothed out all the waves and kept my hair straight all day.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints really.</li>
            <li> The seller was very responsive and helpful</li>
            <li> looking as well as straight...</li>
            <li> My hair took too much of a beating over time with this Paul Mitchell iron.  </li>
            <li> Fast in sending and responding.</li>
            <li> Your hair does feel much smoother.</li>
            <li> However, I purchased this straightener before I had ever had a treatment, and it really works.</li>
            <li> With that being said, this straightener (before I ever had a keratin treatment) would fool people into thinking I had straight hair with just 20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> none of them got my hair completely straight.</li>
            <li> It gets my hair pin straight within minutes</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently debating between replacing the burned EIS with either another EIS or the Neuro Smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and it heats really fast</li>
            <li> You should really  try it.</li>
            <li> I used this new one for the first time this morning</li>
            <li> Cord is long and has a self-wrap for easy storage.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing for multiple reasons.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER COARSE SUPER CURLY hair naturally.</li>
            <li> Simply said: it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> and yes, it&#x27;s like a small investment for me, but I am so glad I ordered this!</li>
            <li> It smooths our hair much better than other types, without over-drying.</li>
            <li> My hair is long &amp; fine with some waves &amp; frizz.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended for a woman on the go who needs to create a good hair day in 5 minutes or less.    </li>
            <li> I have in between hair which is not exactly thin but yet not thick either.</li>
            <li> It sure out does the other brands in the malls!</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair in 1/3 the time of other straighteners and it leaves it feeling silky smooth and straight all day despite living in a very humid climate with</li>
            <li> It is far superior to the Chi or other similar products.</li>
            <li> Straight from the box, brand new.</li>
            <li> It took me several passes to get my hair soft and smooth, but in the end it achieved it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, very curly hair and this straightener is amazing for it.</li>
            <li> definately worth the extra money, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My first one (the exact same as this one) lasted 5.5years!</li>
            <li> I think that after the second day it straightened my hair better for the rest of the weekend (only wash my hair twice a week).</li>
            <li> The paddles get very hot on the outside and it doesn&#x27;t seem to grip my hair as well as the infra-shine hair</li>
            <li> As for straightening, I found that it doesn&#x27;t clamp the hair as well as my Sedu, and you have to hold the handle more tightly.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It straightens with two passes, and you don&#x27;t have to set it on a high setting.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this model that is why we bought it again.</li>
            <li> High quality iron.</li>
            <li> She also stated that even though the PM flat irons that have the silicone strips they do grip better but they will melt and you have to constantly replace them.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly (30 seconds, approximately) and straightens beautifully without having to go over the same section of hair multiple times.</li>
            <li> You could use a little more hair than the one I just bought and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little better in that it seems to heat up faster.  </li>
            <li> I love this straightner, my daughter got it for Christmas a few years ago and moved out</li>
            <li> For time saved alone, it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This is no ordinary straightener, it has volcanic and conditioning minerals to keep your hair very soft!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and new as promised.</li>
            <li> It takes her almost half the time to get ready than it used to when she was using a more generic straightener.</li>
            <li> and I found that this iron just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to handle it.  </li>
            <li> The only reason that I replaced my first one is because we traveled to Europe and the converter blew it out.</li>
            <li> I bought the same one again because the first one worked so well</li>
            <li> I thought I would not like the new one as much as my old one</li>
            <li> Have patience and there is certain techniques for different curls that you want done.</li>
            <li> Worth every single stinking penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also small and lightweight, very easy to travel with, as I recently did, and I don&#x27;t fear damaging my hair with this iron.</li>
            <li> Humidity/rain/snow didn&#x27;t bother my hair too much with the Chi, but I do have to say that the Paul Mitchell straightener is one step above Chi.  </li>
            <li> I use Mixed Chicks Hair Silk to really lock it</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair completely shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I have very curly/frizzy Italian hair and my hair ends up being smoothe and silky every time</li>
            <li> but I would think it should last much, much longer.</li>
            <li> would def recommend this if you need a REALLY GOOD iron for your difficult hair.</li>
            <li> But the day I used this my hair was in a curly mood from the humidity and already dry so the curl was pretty formed by then.</li>
            <li> It worked so well, and I was pleased with my first &#x27;expensive&#x27; hair product purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this item is fake.</li>
            <li> I plugged it into a different outlet and then the light blinked WAY faster than normal that time and the next few times I used it, but I think it&#x27;s the electrical wiring in my old apartment rather than something with the straightener.</li>
            <li> The cord ended up showing wires (not safe, but I continued to use it), and it got where I had to hold it a certain way for it to get hot.</li>
            <li> I had an older style Paul Mitchell flat iron</li>
            <li> Usually if I unplugged it and left it alone for a day or two, or plugged it into the wall and reset the circuit, I would be able to plug it back in and it would start working again...</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the squared edges would make it hard to curl with, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> and I was looking into buying a new flat iron because my CHI seems to be on</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, this iron does not work well for my hair,for the price I was hoping for better.</li>
            <li> I only use 3 things in my hair as far as product.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be a little better then my previous chi.  </li>
            <li> only downsides are that it does not straighten wet hair (but I find these straighteners sub-par in their ability to truly achieve perfectly straight hair) and it is not dual voltage.</li>
            <li> Due to it&#x27;s well known name and high price</li>
            <li> My blowouts are still EXTREMELY POOFY AND FRIZZY, and this iron makes it look flat, straight and no frizz</li>
            <li> This was a christmas present for my girlfriend, she LOVES it, says it works a lot faster then her other older one.</li>
            <li> Since the second one burned, we have had several people loan/give us straighteners, and not a single one of them cut it.</li>
            <li> She has very thick curly hair and it makes her hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wiry, coarse (caucasian) hair, and everything I&#x27;ve ever tried (cheap Remingtons and Conairs to stylist-quality Chis) struggled.</li>
            <li> and personally I use my flat iron every day.</li>
            <li> After researching numerous product reviews, I chose the Paul Mitchell flat iron.</li>
            <li> The edges of the flat iron catch my hair and overall</li>
            <li> I was worried when my flat master iron finally gave out.</li>
            <li> I needed to get a new one, but I didn&#x27;t want one that would only last a few months.  </li>
            <li> I use the Regis Silk Drops..not too thin and not too thick...when my hair is wet...then I spray some heat resistant product from Dove when hair is wet and blow dry most of the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gone through 4 or 5 chis and was about to purchase a replacement when a friend suggested a Paul Mitchell flat iron instead.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say this works like a dream because I usually blow dry my hair as straight as possible then I iron it.</li>
            <li> These flat irons are the truth!</li>
            <li> and it leaves hair still very flat.</li>
            <li> I would pick this above any of the other flat irons I have seen anywhere.</li>
            <li> and I have curly long hair to my belly button.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair very flat!!</li>
            <li> I also have very long hair</li>
            <li> Then I use the the Regis Flat Iron Spray...not too much..wait a few minutes and then flat iron.</li>
            <li> I sent it back and bought a Babyliss Nano which blows it away and costs a bit less.</li>
            <li> I expected it to last longer than two and half years though.</li>
            <li> It has a temperature dial, so if you are just doing a second day touch up or have fine hair you don&#x27;t have to damage your hair as badly.</li>
            <li> I do straighten in small sections with a clip since my hair is half way down my back &amp; it only takes 6-9 minutes total depending on the day.</li>
            <li> Came on time, was all that I expected.  </li>
            <li> as to be expected from Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t turn on a few days ago and now despite various attempts to get it to start working</li>
            <li> Also when I looked up the warranty center on Google it sent me to a some ones house.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair and straighten my hair daily.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron does the job however after a few times of ironing the strand of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Of the two other professional-grade irons I have used over the years, this one provides the smoothest results.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to send it back.</li>
            <li> Notice - I&#x27;m not considering anything other than Paul Mitchell, and I never ever will.</li>
            <li> I used to have the green and black flat iron by Paul Mitchell and it lasted for 7 years.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and even pressing firmly, the plates had gaps and were not tight against the hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not feel dry &amp; it&#x27;s less harsh on your hair unlike other straighteners.</li>
            <li> But this flat iron was not for me because my hair is long and the iron was too short for my hair, so that is why I had to return, nothing wrong with iron itself</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it pulls some hair out while straightening.  </li>
            <li> That will weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> hands down</li>
            <li> I glide down once on my hair</li>
            <li> if I can use all this product without it being weighed down.</li>
            <li> Iron I previously had.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> but there is 2 little chips in the iron.  </li>
            <li> the one with the green plates.  </li>
            <li> missing the on/off switch.   </li>
            <li> I would plug it in and nothing; not a light on, not a trace of heat.</li>
            <li> But as of a few days ago, it is completely dead.</li>
            <li> it is completely dead.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curling thick hair, this straightner has cut my straightning time in half!  </li>
            <li> Now that my hair is shorter (just past my shoulders than closer to waist length)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Chi and a Sedu in the past.</li>
            <li> The Chi seriously takes less serum and styling spray, etc.</li>
            <li> However, in the past year, it had about three episodes of not turning on.</li>
            <li> The chi would fry my hair and it smelled like burnt hair... not cute.  </li>
            <li> One small negative (about the listing, not the product)</li>
            <li> I am really late writing my review on this.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, curly hair and agrees.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in my recent purchase of the Paul Mitchell flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair is VERY thick and kinky</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair that I like to straighten from time to time</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener after I thought my Sedu had shorted out (turns out my electrical socket was broken).</li>
            <li> The life span was approximately 3 yrs.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Also, my hair would get caught in the seam between the plates and the casing, which caused uncomfortable pulling.  </li>
            <li> It did do something weird where it wouldn&#x27;t turn on once.</li>
            <li> weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, the Chi pulls my hair really bad, so I refuse to use a Chi.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> If I could rank the straighteners, I would rank them Paul Mitchell &lt; Chi &lt; Sedu.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the way it straightens my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner, my daughter got it for Christmas a few years ago and moved out so I had to buy my own!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  I found the price was great through Amazon.  My wife uses it daily and each time she tells me how wonderful it is.  It takes her almost half the time to get ready than it used to when she was using a more generic straightener.</li>
            <li> I just bought this today. But stylist has used this on my hair since last Sept. And she even used it to put curls or waves in my hair and it did a wonderful job. It doesnt pull on my hair, it makes it smooth, shiny and very soft. When I had longer hair I bought the BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium 1 3/4 and ithad the longer plates on it and it worked so great. You could use a little more hair than the one I just bought and it would straighten it beautifully. Now that my hair is shorter (just past my shoulders than closer to waist length) the Paul Mitchell works great on me and does wonderful job on my hair my hair. I asked her which one to get to do the curls since the BaByliss has squared plates and dont do curls...she suggested the BaByliss or the Paul Mitchell and chose to get the Paul Mitchell. She also stated that even though the PM flat irons that have the silicone strips they do grip better but they will melt and you have to constantly replace them. You have to order then...wait for them to come in the mail and personally I use my flat iron every day. I also got advice on the best way to put some curls in my hair. You have to section it. Have patience and there is certain techniques for different curls that you want done. There are some video demos online on youtube.com and they are good. I only use 3 things in my hair as far as product. I use the Regis Silk Drops..not too thin and not too thick...when my hair is wet...then I spray some heat resistant product from Dove when hair is wet and blow dry most of the way. Then I use the the Regis Flat Iron Spray...not too much..wait a few minutes and then flat iron. Your hair doesnt come out heavy or greasy/oily looking from too much product. There is a thing as way too much. But my hair is light and very soft to the touch. This is just my suggestion from trying out several things. And never put product on the scalp or too close to it. That will weigh your hair down. It will lose volume. But love, love, LOVE this new PaulMitchell Flat Iron. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. I have noticed it started to damage my hair. Don&#x27;t buy! It also pulls and breaks my hair while styling.</li>
            <li> I have had numerous straighteners over the years from the original Hot Tools, Sedu, Chi - you name it.  I have extremely curly hair.  Humidity makes my hair frizz, rain drops make my hair curl, etc.  I&#x27;m pretty fussy/high-maintenance about my hair and all products that I use on it.  I was currently using the Chi when my friend at work told me about this straightener.  I didn&#x27;t at all believe her when she said it was better than the Chi.  So I took it home to borrow...  and she was absolutely right.  The Chi straightens pretty good (in comparison) but also leaves your hair feeling kind of dry; the Paul Mitchell straightener leaves your hair silky smooth, straightens AWESOME, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.  Humidity/rain/snow didn&#x27;t bother my hair too much with the Chi, but I do have to say that the Paul Mitchell straightener is one step above Chi.  If you are trying to decide between this straightener and the Chi....  hands down I&#x27;d choose this one. In addition, I do use a mixture of Chi Silk Infusion and Biosilk hair serum....  awesome combo!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I love the heat control component so I doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as some of the \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; straightners would. The product really is \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; and glides through hair easily. Every girl should have this!</li>
            <li> I had an older style Paul Mitchell flat iron and I loved it...the one with the green plates.  When it died I found that model was no longer available and I was worried I could not find another as good at smoothing my hair without burning it.  Eureka!  This one is even better!  It is the Pro series so it does cost more....but it is worth every penny.  It leaves my hair silky smooth without frying it.  I would pick this above any of the other flat irons I have seen anywhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron on the advice of a friend after using a Rusk for years.  My hair is VERY thick and kinky and I found that this iron just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to handle it.  Also I need something wider.  So I&#x27;m returning it and going back to my Rusk.  That being said, if you don&#x27;t need an iron to go over 400 degrees, then this is an EXCELLENT product.  Does a great job of getting close to the roots too.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely flat iron. It heats up quickly (30 seconds, approximately) and straightens beautifully without having to go over the same section of hair multiple times. It does not pull hair, and is easy on your arm as it is fairly lightweight in comparison to my old 1\\&quot; flat iron (which was not Paul Mitchell). Temperature is adjustable, I leave it around 400 degrees. Definitely recommended for a woman on the go who needs to create a good hair day in 5 minutes or less.    Cord is long and has a self-wrap for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I just received mine and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> After researching numerous product reviews, I chose the Paul Mitchell flat iron. It arrived on time and new as promised. It heats up quickly and is easy to handle. I use the lower setting because my hair is fine, and it does the job without damaging my hair. Of the two other professional-grade irons I have used over the years, this one provides the smoothest results. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent flat iron.  I had a Paul Mitchell flat iron but dropped it one to many times on the tile floor.  I thought I would not like the new one as much as my old one and I like it even better.  It doesn&#x27;t pull at you hair as much.  Great tool!</li>
            <li> I have owned two Chi&#x27;s before, and thought they were good.  But once you buy the Paul Mitchel straightener, you will throw your Chi out the door.  It straightens with two passes, and you don&#x27;t have to set it on a high setting.  It leaves your hair silky smooth, not like the Chi where as soon as you&#x27;ve straightened it, it looks fried.  I read some complaints about the Paul Mitchel one, that it pulls their hair.  I haven&#x27;t found any truth to that.  I use it to straighen and to make it curly and have had no pulling when I curl it.  Simply said: it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;m a Hair -Expert and I need Exceptional products, &amp; this is probably the best flat iron ive ever used in 12 years of styling hair!</li>
            <li> Great Flatiron!  This is probably the best flat iron that Ive ever used!  I would highly recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in my recent purchase of the Paul Mitchell flat iron.  It arrived defective..missing the on/off switch.   It took 4 emails to finally get a refund.  I would not order from this company again.  Amazon did a great job and refunded my money almost immediately after I contacted them.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and better than a chi straightner ...happy I switched to paul mitchel and the price is worth it!</li>
            <li> Great price! Wife loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair straightener. It is salon quality. The only reason that I replaced my first one is because we traveled to Europe and the converter blew it out. I bought the same one again because the first one worked so well</li>
            <li> This was a christmas present for my girlfriend, she LOVES it, says it works a lot faster then her other older one. A little pricey but if it&#x27;ll make and keep her happy...well it&#x27;s worth it. :-)</li>
            <li> Beautiful and fast..thank u</li>
            <li> This would be on my top 5 list of can&#x27;t live without items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of straighteners out there, including the CHI and this one blows them all away. For time saved alone, it is worth the extra money. I don&#x27;t have to reswipe the same strand multiple times. I can straighten my hair in 1/3 the time of other straighteners and it leaves it feeling silky smooth and straight all day despite living in a very humid climate with frizzy/wavy hair at baseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides are that it does not straighten wet hair (but I find these straighteners sub-par in their ability to truly achieve perfectly straight hair) and it is not dual voltage. I have another straighter (Amika)  that is dual voltage when I travel abroad, but I find myself looking forward to returning home to be reunited with my Paul Mitchell during these trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased one for each of my sisters and my mother and now neither one can imagine life before it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: straighten slowly in small pieces to achieve best effect and use oil hair serum periodically as it can dry your ends.</li>
            <li> We bought this after it was recommended to us by our stylist.  She loves hers and uses one at home and one in her salon.&lt;br /&gt;It is sturdy, well made and it is very thorough.</li>
            <li> I have to say for how much I paid for this straightener it dosent do any better than my 40$ one from tjmaxx.  Your better off buying a Chi since they are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener to replace my old Paul Mitchell straightener, which I loved and used for 10+ years.  This one is just as good as the old one.  It&#x27;s a little better in that it seems to heat up faster.  One small negative (about the listing, not the product): the description said it would come with Argan oil, but it did not.</li>
            <li> Loved it! it was a gift I ordered my self and I say personally I made a good choice... My hair doesnt smell burned and it straightens my hair so good Thank you Paul Mitchell!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly &amp; leaves hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener after I thought my Sedu had shorted out (turns out my electrical socket was broken). I&#x27;ve owned a Chi and a Sedu in the past. This straightener is made out of cheap-feeling plastic and gets very hot near the top of the handle, so I found myself nearly burning my thumb if I positioned it there (which happened naturally several times). As for straightening, I found that it doesn&#x27;t clamp the hair as well as my Sedu, and you have to hold the handle more tightly. It doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair, however. It took me several passes to get my hair soft and smooth, but in the end it achieved it. It does heat up quickly, and you can choose the temperature. I bought this for $100, but would not pay more than $70 for it. If I could rank the straighteners, I would rank them Paul Mitchell &lt; Chi &lt; Sedu. Hope this review is helpful.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel so smooth &amp; makes it shiny too. My hair does not feel dry &amp; it&#x27;s less harsh on your hair unlike other straighteners. The price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This iron was everything everyone said it would be.  I have very thick, course hair.  I glide down once on my hair and I don&#x27;t have to go over anything again to really get it straight.  I also have very long hair and it works brilliantly.  It has great storage capabilities and is easy to use and work with.  The cord doesn&#x27;t ever get in the way.  Worth every single stinking penny!</li>
            <li> Came on time, was all that I expected.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a chi for years but decided it was time for something different. This straightener is 10000 times better than the chi. I have thick, very curly hair and this straightener is amazing for it. It gets very hot but still doesn&#x27;t burn/damage my hair like I felt the Chi did. It&#x27;s a very smooth process.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener.  My hair was starting to become damaged due to an old straightener and this one makes it look great!</li>
            <li> I used to have the green and black flat iron by Paul Mitchell and it lasted for 7 years. When I needed a new one I again went to the Paul Mitchell brand and paid more than some of the more expensive store brands because I figured I would love it. This flat iron is not as good. The edges of the flat iron catch my hair and overall the design doesn&#x27;t seem as solid. It works as well as some that I&#x27;ve tried for $50 so it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had the same straightener and it lasted about 4 years so I ordered another one from amazon.  It works fine but there is 2 little chips in the iron.  Not sure how to send it back.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron that I have ever purchased. Heats quickly, and straightens hair without any frizz! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the best Straightener I have bought!  It is well worth the money.  My daughter is bi-racial and her hair is course and curly.  I can straighten her hair and it will last for a week!!! I use Mixed Chicks Hair Silk to really lock it in.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I received it and it didnt turn on so I returned it so make sure you actually go to a store and get it there because they sent me a defective one</li>
            <li> I gave this product two stars because it will burn the heck out of your hair. I sent it back and bought a Babyliss Nano which blows it away and costs a bit less.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this fabulous flat iton and I am so glad that I invested in this!  I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair that I like to straighten from time to time and I was looking into buying a new flat iron because my CHI seems to be on it&#x27;s way out and so I stumbled onto all the great reviews for this and decided to give it a try. Believe me when I say this works like a dream because I usually blow dry my hair as straight as possible then I iron it. But the day I used this my hair was in a curly mood from the humidity and already dry so the curl was pretty formed by then. I figured this would be a true test of it working if it can straighten my curly hair and it absolutely did! It smoothed out all the waves and kept my hair straight all day. I am very impressed by this tool and yes, it&#x27;s like a small investment for me, but I am so glad I ordered this!</li>
            <li> This is the same one my hairdresser uses. It works great - especially considering my hair is thick and super wavy.</li>
            <li> My hair is long &amp; fine with some waves &amp; frizz. This straightener makes my hair so shiny &amp; sleek. I do straighten in small sections with a clip since my hair is half way down my back &amp; it only takes 6-9 minutes total depending on the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stylist of 11+ years, and have tried many, many flat irons.  This, by far is the best I&#x27;ve used, not only on my own hair, but it has worked well on all types of hair I&#x27;ve used it on.  It leaves the hair silky, smooth and shiney, and it gets hot enough to straighten the most coarse and curly hair, usually with use per section, works beautifully.  I&#x27;m sold,  definately worth the extra money, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick hair and this flat iron works wonderfully; it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used by far. My daughter has thick, curly hair and agrees. It smooths our hair much better than other types, without over-drying. Loved it so much that I bought it again after I killed the first while on a trip in Europe.</li>
            <li> This is our second purchase of this model.  The first one lasted 6 years and was used often and traveled everywhere with no problems. Finally after all the wear and tear thru teenage years and college life it bit the dust.  Would highly recommend this model that is why we bought it again.</li>
            <li> I am really late writing my review on this. I believe I have had this for over 2+ years now. Still works great! No complaints here. I prefer this over the Chi any day.</li>
            <li> Great straightener!  My only complaint is it pulls some hair out while straightening.  I have thick, coarse, curly hair and straighten my hair daily.  I also have a Chi Deep Brilliance and bought this to compare them.  This straightener works great for my daughter that has fine, thick hair.  I would recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li> BEST. STRAIGHTENER. EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super curly hair that I have been fighting since I was in 8th grade. I have had several different brands of straighteners--including the famous Chi--and this one is by far the best. You can adjust the heat giving you more freedom to fit the texture of your hair and the amount of time you have to get your hair done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is my secong Paul Mitchell straightener! I absolutely love it! My first one (the exact same as this one) lasted 5.5years! The only reason I had to get another one was because instead of bending the cord and velcrowing it like you&#x27;re suppose to, I always wrapped it around the straightener itself. The cord ended up showing wires (not safe, but I continued to use it), and it got where I had to hold it a certain way for it to get hot. I will prob always get this straightener.. I&#x27;ve tried others, the Chi pulls my hair really bad, so I refuse to use a Chi. This one, it glides through your hair with ease!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron - Paul Mitchell products tend to work very well with my hair (type 2b curly, if you check out curly.com&#x27;s hair classifications). The multiple heat settings and useful recommendations made it very easy to use the first time, and I can get my hair done in literally 15 minutes - that&#x27;s definitely a first for me! It&#x27;s also small and lightweight, very easy to travel with, as I recently did, and I don&#x27;t fear damaging my hair with this iron. Absolutely love it, definitely a must for curly-haired women that love and protect their curls, and sometimes want to change it up without hurting their locks.</li>
            <li> Love this Straightener, bought one for my daughter to replace her CHI.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener! It makes my wavy hair very smooth and soft to the touch. Heats up really fast!</li>
            <li> I actually like this better than my Chi. It is definitely superior (as it should be since its over double the price). It gets hot in seconds. I have no complaints really.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!! It leaves the hair very flat!!</li>
            <li> Had to return this one.  I have thick hair, and even pressing firmly, the plates had gaps and were not tight against the hair.  Also, my hair would get caught in the seam between the plates and the casing, which caused uncomfortable pulling.  The seller was very responsive and helpful and I got a full refund.  I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair styling tool for several months now, and I really enjoy the effects it has on my hair! It&#x27;s the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. It leaves the hair completely shiny and soft. Just make sure you pay attention to how much heat you&#x27;re applying according to your hair thickness, and just like with every other styling tool, it is a wise investment to use a protectant spray before applying heat to your hair. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The flat iron does the job however after a few times of ironing the strand of hair.  I was expecting this to be a little better then my previous chi.  Over all it does a descent job.</li>
            <li> Works great Got it within a couple of days of ordering. Very happy thinking about buying another one for my daughter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for a couple of months.And I like how the iron straightens and makes my hair shine! I recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love my Paul Mitchell flat iron . This one does not burn my hair like the others!</li>
            <li> super easy to use and it makes my hair smooth, soft, and so nice looking as well as straight...def worth the price.</li>
            <li> My stylist talked me out of getting a Chi and I bought this iron.  I thought it was pretty good at first until I used the Chi.  The Chi seriously takes less serum and styling spray, etc. My hair took too much of a beating over time with this Paul Mitchell iron.  The Chi flattens faster, smoother and without fly aways or static.  Everyone has different types of hair...for mine, the Chi is best.  This one just doesn&#x27;t do the job for colored and highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the same brand in 2004 and it JUST died. That&#x27;s 11 years!! I used this new one for the first time this morning and I love it! This is a great iron, lasts forever. Plates do not pull hair, very, very smooth. Heats up in seconds. Love it! My hair is shoulder length, very fine and this iron is perfect! :)</li>
            <li> the seller was great. Fast in sending and responding. But this flat iron was not for me because my hair is long and the iron was too short for my hair, so that is why I had to return, nothing wrong with iron itself</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener, still 2 years later! It works wonderful, WAY better than my Chi. Arrived on time and exactly what I ordered. Straight from the box, brand new. My hair is so much more healthier! LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2012 and it is still works amazing like when i first had it. This has been the best iron for hair by far. Your hair does feel much smoother. and it leaves hair still very flat.</li>
            <li> We have bought this flat iron before and love it.  The life span was approximately 3 yrs.  We used it daily.  Dependable and is worth buying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s o.k. Not as great as I expected based on the reviews. The paddles get very hot on the outside and it doesn&#x27;t seem to grip my hair as well as the infra-shine hair Iron I previously had. Probably better for someone who has thicker longer hair than mine, which is only just to my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER COARSE SUPER CURLY hair naturally. I get keratin treatments/brazilian blowouts, so it&#x27;s not nearly as bad anymore. However, I purchased this straightener before I had ever had a treatment, and it really works. It is far superior to the Chi or other similar products. I&#x27;d gone through 4 or 5 chis and was about to purchase a replacement when a friend suggested a Paul Mitchell flat iron instead. I figured it was worth a shot, since if I bought another Chi it would probably break in a year (again) anyways. This flat iron is amazing for multiple reasons. It has a temperature dial, so if you are just doing a second day touch up or have fine hair you don&#x27;t have to damage your hair as badly. Also, the width being 1.25 inches instead of 1 makes SUCH a difference. Before my blowouts, it would take me close to an hour to straighten my hair with a Chi, or a mere 20 minutes to do a better job with the Paul Mitchell. I&#x27;ve had this straightener for 3 or 4 years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. It did do something weird where it wouldn&#x27;t turn on once. I plugged it into a different outlet and then the light blinked WAY faster than normal that time and the next few times I used it, but I think it&#x27;s the electrical wiring in my old apartment rather than something with the straightener. I use Pureology split end correcting treatment (2-3 pumps), Moroccan Oil (2-3 pumps) on my damp hair, Rusk thermal spray on my dry hair, straighten, and then put some more Moroccan oil on. Keep in mind I also get 2-3 keratin treatments a year, so just imagine how coarse/frizzy my hair was BEFORE if I can use all this product without it being weighed down. With that being said, this straightener (before I ever had a keratin treatment) would fool people into thinking I had straight hair with just 20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up quickly. It locks in a &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; position. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a straightener.</li>
            <li> These flat irons are the truth! They can flat iron any type of hair, they get hot fast; Paul Mitchell&#x27;s are the best ever!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Shipped really fast and in excellent condition. works great and the cord is really long, so i dont have to find a plug right next to a mirror ( i travel a lot).</li>
            <li> works great.... as to be expected from Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li> This is an awesome hot iron. It warms up immediately and works great.  Thinking of purchasing one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 2 chis, 3 revlons, one that I bought off an infomercial and none of them got my hair completely straight. But this straightener is amazing!!!!!! It gets my hair pin straight within minutes and I have curly long hair to my belly button. Its a must have!</li>
            <li> Works great and came well packaged in shipment!</li>
            <li> I bought my Paul Mitchell straightener in September 2012 as a birthday gift for my self. I absolutely LOVED it. It worked so well, and I was pleased with my first &#x27;expensive&#x27; hair product purchase. However, in the past year, it had about three episodes of not turning on. I would plug it in and nothing; not a light on, not a trace of heat. Usually if I unplugged it and left it alone for a day or two, or plugged it into the wall and reset the circuit, I would be able to plug it back in and it would start working again...weird. But as of a few days ago, it is completely dead. It wouldn&#x27;t turn on a few days ago and now despite various attempts to get it to start working it is completely dead. So disappointed. I will not purchase another Paul Mitchell product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this item is fake. I just bought it and when I turned it on it smelled burnt. Also when I looked up the warranty center on Google it sent me to a some ones house. I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
            <li> Most Useful Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a straightener from Walmart, it started shorting out. I needed to get a new one, but I didn&#x27;t want one that would only last a few months.  So, at Paul Mitchel they had hair straighteners!  I got the newest one for only $150.00!  I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year. I love this straightener because, even before I had purchased it, the box had all of its attributes and how it worked, labeled on to it! This is no ordinary straightener, it has volcanic and conditioning minerals to keep your hair very soft! I am very satisfied with my purchase! I would recommend this to lady&#x27;s who want to straighten their hair but dont want all the damage that could follow! Because this straightener has specific built-in specialties to avoid heat damage. This is a wonderful hair straightener!!</li>
            <li> I love the quality and performance of this straightener. Its the only one that will NOT burn my hair. I have in between hair which is not exactly thin but yet not thick either. The chi would fry my hair and it smelled like burnt hair... not cute.  I have a friend who works at Visible Changes who sold me this straightener two years ago. This is all they use there and for good reason to.  Unfortuantly I left my cousin borrow it 6  months ago and she never gave it back! lol I let her have it and ordered me a new one.. it makes my hair shine and it feels so smooth. Good job Paul Mitchell :)</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. She has very thick curly hair and it makes her hair silky smooth. She loves it!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair! I have tried almost every hair straightner you can think of. I love love love this flat iron! Have had almost 3 years and never had a problem. It may cost a tad bit more than some but so worth it! I loved it so much I even bought someone one as a gift and it&#x27;s all she&#x27;s been using for years as well!</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these. The first one, my cats knocked off the counter after three years of perfect use. The second one, burned in a house fire after three years of perfect use. I have very thick, wiry, coarse (caucasian) hair, and everything I&#x27;ve ever tried (cheap Remingtons and Conairs to stylist-quality Chis) struggled. Since the second one burned, we have had several people loan/give us straighteners, and not a single one of them cut it. Pulled hair, crinkles, flat-out not straightening? Can&#x27;t handle it. I have decided that I will replace my ProTools EIS before I replace anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently debating between replacing the burned EIS with either another EIS or the Neuro Smooth. Notice - I&#x27;m not considering anything other than Paul Mitchell, and I never ever will.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron! Highly recommend it! I have very curly/frizzy Italian hair and my hair ends up being smoothe and silky every time</li>
            <li> I was worried when my flat master iron finally gave out. After reviewing many irons, I chose this one. I was impressed that it did a really good job on my mixed hair (black/white hair type) and it heats really fast (i put on about 320-360). I think that after the second day it straightened my hair better for the rest of the weekend (only wash my hair twice a week). I thought maybe the squared edges would make it hard to curl with, but it works just fine. I love that I can control the temperature too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would def recommend this if you need a REALLY GOOD iron for your difficult hair. My hair is cork-screw curly, so i always give myself a blow out before i straighten. My blowouts are still EXTREMELY POOFY AND FRIZZY, and this iron makes it look flat, straight and no frizz (but i also know that&#x27;s bc of the aveda products i put in it before doing my hair)</li>
            <li> I have owned several Chi&#x27;s that kept dying.  I finally decided to go out on a limb and find something different.  After hours of research, I decided on Paul Mitchell.  I have not regretted that choice!!  THE BEST STRAIGHTNER ON THE MARKET!! I have extremely curling thick hair, this straightner has cut my straightning time in half!  This straightner is  the only way to go!</li>
            <li> It maintains the heat and does the job in only minutes! It sure out does the other brands in the malls! It is absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hair straightener because, unlike the CHI, with this one I can choose the temperature I need and not damage my hair.</li>
            <li> had chi before for years this is one by far way better. one time flattening your hair and its done.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the time I had with this flat iron. Due to it&#x27;s well known name and high price I expected it to last longer than two and half years though. It&#x27;s a good flat iron but I would think it should last much, much longer. Caution: I bought this from Amazon through the seller NY Beauty and they do not accept returns on any electronics so that is a risk you will have to take if you buy from them.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Great quality</li>
            <li> High quality iron. Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, this iron does not work well for my hair,for the price I was hoping for better.</li>
            <li> Great iron.  I&#x27;ve tried others and this is by far the best one yet.</li>
            <li> Awesome flat iron simply love it. You should really  try it.</li>
            <li> Revised: TK beauty sent me a replacement iron. This iron would be the perfect iron except for one major flaw. I need to use this iron at the highest heat setting to smooth and straighten some of the course textures that I style. Well the hair looks great, shines and have a bouncy feel but smells burnt. That smell will not go away until it is shampooed. Fix that flaw and it would be the best. Gorgeous, bouncy hair should not smell burnt. Such a shame. Back to my search for a beveled 1.25 iron that straightens curl and works without flaws. My clients pay too much money for anything less than perfectly styled hair.     Was great until the iron died on me in 2 months. Mine came from a company called TK Beauty. It seems they might be selling refurbished irons. What a waste of money. i&#x27;m pretty pissed. Now I need a replacement. I&#x27;m a hairstylist and a great iron like this is essential.</li>
