            <li>I could never understand why people pay up to $200 for a battery operated brush when manual seems to make more sense.  </li>
            <li>like i said, its amazingly soft and feels wonderful on your skin but deosnt make my face feel clean</li>
            <li>I use it every night with charcoal bar soap and my face looks and feels very clean.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>This brush is very soft on my face which is great because I have rosacea and probably should not be using any brush at all.  </li>
            <li>but it does feel nice on the skin and does clean the skin pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Soft, supple and perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>skin is smooth and breathing.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is great.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks my face looks radiant, it&#x27;s fantastic, wish I&#x27;d known about this years ago.</li>
            <li>It leaves me with smooth skin every time.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, it&#x27;s bristles are super soft and gentle on the skin but do a great job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li>But, it really works for get  more clean skin!</li>
            <li>Love the facial brush- does a great job at gently but thoroughly cleaning my face-</li>
            <li>my face feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Good facial brush.</li>
            <li>its really soft but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like its cleaning my pores as good as my hands would.</li>
            <li>I feel more clean and clear when washing my face with this product.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is when it first arrived.</li>
            <li>I combine it with a non-drying cleanser and my skin feels amazing the next morning.</li>
            <li>kinda defeats the purpose right?  </li>
            <li>Worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li>but since it takes so long to dry and its a pain to clean... I have to say I honestly don&#x27;t feel safe using it.</li>
            <li>Received my brush super fast.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>I was used to using the Youthful Essence Microdermabrasion system which is hard to find, but was a great product.</li>
            <li>But after that first use it was a piece of garbage to me.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very glad I found this hidden treasure.</li>
            <li>Try it for the first time last nite and can feel skin so fresh &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, and highly recommend it since it left my skin so soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>and my pores were becoming prominent and my skin looked dull.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really give it a shot</li>
            <li>the brush is a bit too gentle for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so effective, yet gentle enough for me to use daily without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li>This brush has really diminished the size of my pores and exfoliates gently to make my skin look and feel cleaner, younger and more alive.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time washing my face in the morning, because this brush makes things so much</li>
            <li>REALLY LOOOOOVe this brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This brush is extremely soft and very gentle.</li>
            <li>I like the fact it has a ton of super soft bristles for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have older skin</li>
            <li>So, save your money and buy a brush with a little more umph</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>Feels soft &amp; gentle</li>
            <li>I do wish the handle was wood or recycled plastic rather than new plastic, but I would still buy it again.</li>
            <li>That being said, even though I like this brush, the bristles were just a little too long for me &amp; made the brush too soft to really feel like it was washing effectively.  </li>
            <li>Very soft while also doing a thorough job cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Very soft brush</li>
            <li>It is very soft yet thoroughly cleans my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really feel tight and clean skin after used this product.</li>
            <li>Better than any brush I have used in the past</li>
            <li>; for her skin because the brush is gentle enough not to irritate her skin, and still leaves her skin feeling soft and looking vibrant ( I agree ).</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush, along with a Bass facial brush, because I wasn&#x27;t sure which I would prefer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week and my skin is almost clear.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft as a baby&#x27;s butt and it is well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend for someone who is looking for an exfoliating facial brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazingly soft to cleanse my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft to me.</li>
            <li>Used  nutrogena natural facial cleanser with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is soft enough to use 2 or 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>Initially, I did notice a few breakouts, but those quickly cleared with continued use.  </li>
            <li>Have no idea how it&#x27;s possible to created a brush with such densely spaced (but very soft) \\&quot;bristles.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>ive struggled with adult acne for several years now and have tried everything under the sun~ I was using clarisonic which helped initially</li>
            <li>The reason that i gave four stars, because it really can&#x27;t clean your pore, i mean inside, still have some blackhead or stuff.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft, at first I did not think that it was going to clean my face, but I was wrong!</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased it due to its visual effect thinking I could finally do away with the washcloth.</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t really exfoliate even a little...</li>

            <li> I feel like I spent a lot of money on something I dont use and its a major bummer.</li>
            <li> It is well made and and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I expect this to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a wood base either which is good as the wood always splits sooner or later.</li>
            <li> The bristles are still dense &amp; soft to the touch, but a little firmer than before I trimmed the bristles.  </li>
            <li> It was dry and one of the softest brushes i had ever touched.</li>
            <li> Takes 2days to dry the brush.</li>
            <li> I use the Bass facial brush for dry brushing my face &amp; neck &amp; this brush for washing my face &amp; neck.  </li>
            <li> Also the bristles are falling out and after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> It never really got all my makeup off my face.</li>
            <li> Unlike other exfoliators, my skin is not red and tight after using this product.</li>
            <li> I will continue to dry brush with my Bass brush &amp; wash with my Cheek Room brush.</li>
            <li> I have used about 15 times and not once has it affected my face like other brushes</li>
            <li> if you read my other review</li>
            <li> The product was too small for my hand (and I have small hands) and the brush was so soft that it could have been used on a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item for my wife because I was tired of seeing the same raggedy washcloth hanging in our bathroom shower.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and less congested.</li>
            <li> If I want a less harsh cleaning.</li>
            <li> I like this little brush.</li>
            <li> Not very appealing when you are trying to &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> You need very little cleanser when washing your face with this brush.</li>
            <li> So now the pure white bristles are nasty brown.  </li>
            <li> I ended up cutting the bristles down about 1/4\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It was awkward to grasp and not adequately cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> Needless to say....</li>
            <li> very expensive in my opinion.</li>

I have tried every product on the market and this brush is the best thing that I have ever used on my face. I love that it has a rope to hang it up with.

            <li> I would like the bristles to be firmer. It does not exfoliate if that is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> wish this was easier to clean but a good product. I didn&#x27;t cut it as described by some youtubers. I find it cleans well If I want a less harsh cleaning.</li>
            <li> Just started using it and I&#x27;m totally happy. It&#x27;s so soft and I like the feeling while cleaning))&lt;br /&gt;The skin is smooth and breathing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really give it a shot but since it takes so long to dry and its a pain to clean... I have to say I honestly don&#x27;t feel safe using it. So whats the point? I feel like I spent a lot of money on something I dont use and its a major bummer. It does seem well made though. But the hanging rope gets in the way when you&#x27;re trying to wash your face. The brush uses up a lot of your facial product so I&#x27;d put that on before you start rubbing in with the brush just dampened.</li>
            <li> its really soft but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like its cleaning my pores as good as my hands would. I also feel like it might mold</li>
            <li> I really feel tight and clean skin after used this product. It makes my skin feel like reborn. The reason that i gave four stars, because it really can&#x27;t clean your pore, i mean inside, still have some blackhead or stuff. But, it really works for get  more clean skin!</li>
            <li> the brush is a bit too gentle for me but it does feel nice on the skin and does clean the skin pretty well.  I was used to using the Youthful Essence Microdermabrasion system which is hard to find, but was a great product.</li>
            <li> Good facial brush. It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Soft, supple and perfect for my sensitive skin. I combine it with a non-drying cleanser and my skin feels amazing the next morning. Overseas shipping but it arrived WAY ahead of the estimated shipping date.</li>
            <li> It is good item. I like this item and I &#x27;m satisfied. I will recommend this item to my friends.</li>
            <li> If I could give it 0 stars I would.  This brush NEVER DRIES.  It has begun to smell like mildew to me.  No matter how well I wash it out and squeeze it, it never dries.  Also the bristles are falling out and after only a few uses.  It never really got all my makeup off my face. it would just smear it around. I would have to wash my face again afterwards with a cloth and i could see the leftover makeup. Or I would have to wash my face before washing with this brush. kinda defeats the purpose right?  The brush held any of the makeup it did pick up and held onto it and never let go. I CAN&amp;#34;T wash it out.  So now the pure white bristles are nasty brown.  Not very appealing when you are trying to &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34;.  The only good thing about it is when it first arrived. It was dry and one of the softest brushes i had ever touched. But after that first use it was a piece of garbage to me. Needless to say....This thing is going back!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing complexion brush--like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  Worth the higher price.  Very soft while also doing a thorough job cleansing.  Have no idea how it&#x27;s possible to created a brush with such densely spaced (but very soft) \\&quot;bristles.\\&quot;  Has a \\&quot;velvety\\&quot; feel against the skin.  You need very little cleanser when washing your face with this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush has made a big impact on how my skin looks and feels. My skin is smoother and less congested. It&#x27;s so effective, yet gentle enough for me to use daily without damaging my skin. I only wish they made this in a bigger size for your body.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush but didn&#x27;t really exfoliate even a little... Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend for someone who is looking for an exfoliating facial brush. Better for a very light wash. Otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have older skin and my pores were becoming prominent and my skin looked dull. This brush has really diminished the size of my pores and exfoliates gently to make my skin look and feel cleaner, younger and more alive. I&#x27;ve had the brush about 4 months and been using it daily. The brush has held up well. I would buy another. I do wish the handle was wood or recycled plastic rather than new plastic, but I would still buy it again.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and not irritating at all. I feel more clean and clear when washing my face with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazingly soft to cleanse my face.  And it doesn&#x27;t cause any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;I feel it&#x27;s very good for my skin to stay healthy.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is great. It cleans my pores effectively. It gives my pores a deep cleanse, yet it&#x27;s gentle enough to use everyday. My acne breakouts have also been reduced.</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely soft and very gentle. It does not feel harsh on the skin and my skin feels very refreshed after using it. Unlike other exfoliators, my skin is not red and tight after using this product. After using this brush for 3 days my skin has definitely looked healthier and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use as much facial cleanser and I feel that my cleanser is more effective now (quality over quantity). None of the brush hairs have fallen out. And I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time washing my face in the morning, because this brush makes things so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone of any skin type.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Shipment was fast and this brush is amazing! It&#x27;s strong and bristles were nice to the touch. A++++++ Would do business again!</li>
            <li> I like this little brush. My skin feels a lot different after using this brush. Extremely soft, at first I did not think that it was going to clean my face, but I was wrong! Great product, I wouldn&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it has a ton of super soft bristles for my sensitive skin. It isn&#x27;t a wood base either which is good as the wood always splits sooner or later. I have used about 15 times and not once has it affected my face like other brushes seem to do. I love it.</li>
            <li> The best way to clean the pore n exfoliation. Got results after using 3 weeks. Love it. Takes 2days to dry the brush. Used  nutrogena natural facial cleanser with it. Worked out well.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it&#x27;s bristles are super soft and gentle on the skin but do a great job of exfoliating. After 2 weeks my face looks radiant, it&#x27;s fantastic, wish I&#x27;d known about this years ago.</li>
            <li> Very gentle. A washcloth does a better job. So, save your money and buy a brush with a little more umph</li>
            <li> This brush is a necessity for me as I use it daily. It leaves me with smooth skin every time. It&#x27;s really soft to me. Love the feeling around the nose area. It is very gentle on my skin so I used it every night to remove my makeup along with my cleanser. It is well made and and seems like it will last a long time. I am very happy with it and highly recommend it. REALLY LOOOOOVe this brush.</li>
            <li> The product was too small for my hand (and I have small hands) and the brush was so soft that it could have been used on a baby&#x27;s skin. It was awkward to grasp and not adequately cleanse my face. Definitely not well designed for its purpose.</li>
            <li> love the product. my face feel so clean. I purchased 2 more for my sister and my mom. I would introduce the product to my friends</li>
            <li> like i said, its amazingly soft and feels wonderful on your skin but deosnt make my face feel clean AT ALL. it seems quality made and is light weight but isnt real effective for the cost</li>
            <li> holds water well. good quality brush and handle. very expensive in my opinion. if you read my other review the earth therapeutics  facial brush has the same quality bristles and a longer handle. I bought a 4 pack for around the same price as this one brush.</li>
            <li> Received my brush super fast.  Try it for the first time last nite and can feel skin so fresh &amp; smooth.  Try it again this morning and absolutely in love with it.  Will even take it to travel with me too.  Great product!! Feels soft &amp; gentle</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft on my face which is great because I have rosacea and probably should not be using any brush at all.  This brush has not irritated my skin at all.  I use it every night with charcoal bar soap and my face looks and feels very clean.</li>
            <li> I love the brush. It is very soft yet thoroughly cleans my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is soft enough to use 2 or 3 times a day. Better than any brush I have used in the past</li>
            <li> ive struggled with adult acne for several years now and have tried everything under the sun~ I was using clarisonic which helped initially but my acne always seemed to creep back. I received this as a gift and started using it and saw immediate results! ive been using it every day since and my skin glows and feels so replenished. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love the facial brush- does a great job at gently but thoroughly cleaning my face- thanks so much for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and highly recommend it since it left my skin so soft and smooth...try it out, you&#x27;ll enjoy the feeling!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item for my wife because I was tired of seeing the same raggedy washcloth hanging in our bathroom shower. I mainly purchased it due to its visual effect thinking I could finally do away with the washcloth. Well, it turns out that it was a perfect purchase. My wife loves it! She tells me it&#x27;s &amp;#34;so perfect&amp;#34; for her skin because the brush is gentle enough not to irritate her skin, and still leaves her skin feeling soft and looking vibrant ( I agree ). This is actually my second time purchasing the brush because she was insistent on having one for when we travel. You&#x27;ve made my wife happy so that of course makes me happy. So I&#x27;m very glad I found this hidden treasure. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush, along with a Bass facial brush, because I wasn&#x27;t sure which I would prefer.  I ended up liking both brushes, but for different reasons &amp; uses.  I use the Bass facial brush for dry brushing my face &amp; neck &amp; this brush for washing my face &amp; neck.  I could never understand why people pay up to $200 for a battery operated brush when manual seems to make more sense.  That being said, even though I like this brush, the bristles were just a little too long for me &amp; made the brush too soft to really feel like it was washing effectively.  I ended up cutting the bristles down about 1/4\\&quot;.  The bristles are still dense &amp; soft to the touch, but a little firmer than before I trimmed the bristles.  My face &amp; neck feel cleaner with the shorter bristles than it did with the longer bristles. Initially, I did notice a few breakouts, but those quickly cleared with continued use.  I am very happy with both brushes I purchased.  My friends have even noticed the difference in my skin &amp; have asked what I am doing differently.  I will continue to dry brush with my Bass brush &amp; wash with my Cheek Room brush.</li>
