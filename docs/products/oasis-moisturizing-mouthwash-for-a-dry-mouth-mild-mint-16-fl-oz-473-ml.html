            <li>Great product with quick delivery</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that it is available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d like the spray better</li>
            <li>it does what it needs to do but the spray just works better for me</li>
            <li>I like Oasis much better than Biotene for a moisturizing mouth wash.  </li>
            <li>I like the taste of this much better than Biotene</li>
            <li>I have used this for years, and most retailers have stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>She likes the Oasis better than Biotine as it keeps her mouth from drying out better.</li>
            <li>Works better than the biotene mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Tried various products and found that Biotene works the best.  </li>
            <li>Better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I will use the spray from now on and the mouthwash was OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been surprised and pleased that it&#x27;s very good at keeping my mouth comfortable throughout the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she says it tastes pretty good.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best product made for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found for correcting dry mouth.</li>
            <li>It gives the refreshing feeling that mint does, but the mint isn&#x27;t so strong that it burns my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available online</li>
            <li>It  works and it has a  nice, fresh taste.</li>
            <li>It tastes good and really works for CPAP machine users.  </li>
            <li>This is strongly recommended by our dentist.  </li>
            <li>They are both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>This product is not always readily available  in stores.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted when I found this product, but I cannot buy it locally any more, to my chagrin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my mouth moisturize and smelling great, if you have dry mouth or throat at you</li>
            <li>used it only a while; good while I used it</li>
            <li>Helps with mouth ulcers quickly without damaging tender mouth tissure.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash says mild mint</li>
            <li>I will say using this before bed is much better than using a normal mouthwash (like Listerine).</li>
            <li>But as long as it works and tastes reasonable, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Leaves my breath fresh without smelling minty or mediciny.</li>
            <li>This brand is totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I like a strong mint flavor (Listerine Cool Mint), and the Oasis Mild Mint flavor is definitely much more tame than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure how much of a difference it&#x27;s made; I don&#x27;t use it nearly as often as I should, but I had used it just before the dental appointment today.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather go back to Biotene (which I don&#x27;t love) than have to make cleaning appointments twice a month because of this product.</li>
            <li>but it was hot and burned my mouth.  </li>
            <li>This is my preferred mouthwash for a dry mouth as it really works and has a nice taste.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash tastes good and offers relief for about a minute and then the sensitive tongue feeling is back.</li>
            <li>husband and I love it for dry mouth and allergies</li>
            <li>However, that is much better than waking up with a dry mouth and feeling discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>I used the product as directed but didn&#x27;t really see any improvement over not using any mouth wash at all.</li>
            <li>Tried it and really like it.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the few dollars more.</li>
            <li>Not to strong, seems to help with dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Shipment is always fast and very professional.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Tastes fine, I&#x27;ve tried keeping it in my mouth 60 sec.</li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t say this made my dry mouth better, but it at least is better than using normal mouth wash.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste and the effect of the product seems to last longer than other products such as Biotene Mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I really like this mouthwash so far.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to tell what the moisturizing part is yet.  </li>
            <li>and I preferred it to the other sprays available</li>
            <li>While I am sure it did the moisturizing part, my mouth felt like it had an oil slick in it after using it,.</li>
            <li>Oasis mouthwash for dry mouth and the Oasis spray work better than the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I found the Oasis dry mouth spray was very helpful</li>
            <li>I much prefer this over Biotene dry mouthwash, which has a sticky mouth feel.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for dry mouth symptoms.</li>
            <li>Had a major allergic reaction to this product</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who takes medication that causes dry mouth - a condition not at all funny or simple.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash really burned and seems to stimulate less natural &amp;#34;mouth moisture&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it several times a day &amp; before bed, it really does help my dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Normal mouthwash gives me all sorts of dry mouth issues.</li>
            <li>A few seconds after using it, my mouth is still as dry as it ever was, but I suppose it&#x27;s still a better choice than some of the other brands.</li>
            <li>but I have a sensitive, dry mouth from Lupus and medications.</li>

            <li> but I have a sensitive, dry mouth from Lupus and medications.</li>
            <li> Having entered the unfortunate stage in a women&#x27;s life, detestable menopause, I begain experiencing severe dry mouth-- a known symptom of this affiction (one of the many sordid stages we women endure).  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble with dry mouth at night and this really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now if I forget to brush after dinner or feel I need an extra cleanse before bed, I use this mouthwash and have never been awakened by dry mouth after using it.  </li>
            <li> It is the only one that works for his dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and especially bothersome at night.  </li>
            <li> Dry mouth is a big problem for him.</li>
            <li> The only dry mouth rinse that I like the taste of.</li>
            <li> Yes, the price may seem prohibitive, but if you have \\&quot;enjoyed\\&quot; a similar experience with this unwelcome side effect of menopause, then search the house for loose change, sell plasma, aluminum cans, whatever-- just get it!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash does what it promises it will do:  it moisturizes your mouth and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back is that your mouth will feel a little coated immediately after using it.  </li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have dry mouths due to medication, and we use this twice a day (especially before bed) to keep our mouths moister and protect our teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a woman that I care for that has dry mouth from all the medication she takes.  </li>
            <li> I have dry mouth as a result of reflux and/or the medicine I am taking for it.</li>
            <li> Works for my dry mouth, where others do not work.</li>
            <li> Chronic dry mouth is a problem to me</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin, chronic dry eyes...</li>
            <li> I have a naturally dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to any one with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to friends with dry mouth problems and they seem to like it as well.</li>
            <li> I started to realize that I was being offered chewing gum by my co-workers suggesting that my breath was not, shall we say, \\&quot;welcome\\&quot;, as a result of dry and sore mouth conditions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have severe dry mouth</li>
            <li> The Oasis mouthwash does help lessen dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> He can just about get through a night without the dry mouth waking him if he uses it before bedtime.</li>
            <li> For a number of years, my dentist has been suggesting that I use a dry mouth product.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve stopped some medications that she thought might have been contributing to the dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve seen it at BB&amp;B.  Highly recommended for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> It does seem pricey but you use less of it than you would of a standard mouthwash such as Listerine or other.</li>
            <li> mouth gets very dry at night</li>
            <li> I suffer from extreme dry mouth, both from an immune disorder and from medications.  </li>
            <li> instead of the 30 sec.</li>
            <li> Since that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve seen when I&#x27;ve looked where I typically shop, my dentist suggested checking with independent pharmacies instead of the typical chain stores.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist commented that my mouth wasn&#x27;t dry like it&#x27;s typically been.</li>
            <li> recommended, and it still does little to help my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I used to be awakened by severe and uncomfortable dry mouth frequently during the night and had to keep a moisturizing spray by my bed.</li>
            <li> I learned that it helped to brush my teeth well before bed to allow the natural saliva to recover, but I sometimes forget or have a late snack that requires late brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Crest Nighttime toothpaste also helps keep my mouth from being too dry if I brush late.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it has questionable ingredients with no dental benefits; no fluoride, no xylitol, and it contains parabens - that go in your mouth!</li>
            <li> My Father suffers from &amp;#34;Dry Mouth&amp;#34; and he says that this mouthwash works really well for him.</li>
            <li> I identified a few products on line to resolve this and tried Biotene gum and spray and Oasis mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> So there may be a few factors contributing to the difference, but it does seem like Oasis has probably been helping, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure out why all of a sudden I had brown stains on a few of my teeth, but after a month of using this product it kept getting worse.</li>
            <li> No more morning breath.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Very few places carry this around my area..</li>
            <li> Oasis burned and without cavity fighting ingredients, it seems pretty worthless.</li>
            <li> Between this product and the toothpaste I haven&#x27;t been troubled by dry mouth at night in months and now don&#x27;t even need the spray.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be a little less expensive.  </li>
            <li> : My problem is that I have a hard time finding it in stores.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, and no one has complained about my breath.  </li>
            <li> I get very bad dry mouth from medications I take and nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others which taste horrible and do not last.</li>

            <li> This mouthwash is really good as well but I&#x27;d like the spray better but I would definitely purchase this mouth wash again it does what it needs to do but the spray just works better for me but I recommend the mouthwashes as well</li>
            <li> Had a major allergic reaction to this product</li>
            <li> Tastes fine, I&#x27;ve tried keeping it in my mouth 60 sec. instead of the 30 sec. recommended, and it still does little to help my dry mouth.  A few seconds after using it, my mouth is still as dry as it ever was, but I suppose it&#x27;s still a better choice than some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> Helps with mouth ulcers quickly without damaging tender mouth tissure.</li>
            <li> Really like this. Not to strong, seems to help with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best product made for dry mouth. It  works and it has a  nice, fresh taste. Shipment is always fast and very professional.</li>
            <li> I used to be awakened by severe and uncomfortable dry mouth frequently during the night and had to keep a moisturizing spray by my bed. I learned that it helped to brush my teeth well before bed to allow the natural saliva to recover, but I sometimes forget or have a late snack that requires late brushing.  I started using the Biotene products but eventually just threw the mouthwash away.  It didn&#x27;t help at all.  It may be good for mouth health but didn&#x27;t moisturize.  I found the Oasis dry mouth spray was very helpful and I preferred it to the other sprays available so I tried this brand of mouthwash.  I&#x27;ve been surprised and pleased that it&#x27;s very good at keeping my mouth comfortable throughout the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I forget to brush after dinner or feel I need an extra cleanse before bed, I use this mouthwash and have never been awakened by dry mouth after using it.  I&#x27;ve found that Crest Nighttime toothpaste also helps keep my mouth from being too dry if I brush late.  Between this product and the toothpaste I haven&#x27;t been troubled by dry mouth at night in months and now don&#x27;t even need the spray.  I went through a number of products before finding this one, but now my search has happily ended.  This will be my product of choice henceforth.  I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available online if I can&#x27;t find it locally.  Lately I&#x27;ve seen it at BB&amp;B.  Highly recommended for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> First of all, it has questionable ingredients with no dental benefits; no fluoride, no xylitol, and it contains parabens - that go in your mouth! Ew. Anyway, I tried Oasis mouthwash after a reviewer said it seemed to last longer than Biotene. This mouthwash really burned and seems to stimulate less natural &amp;#34;mouth moisture&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth gets very dry at night and I&#x27;m trying to prevent cavities but I have a sensitive, dry mouth from Lupus and medications. Oasis burned and without cavity fighting ingredients, it seems pretty worthless. I&#x27;ll stick with Biotene Mouthwash and Toms of Maine Juicy Mint Fluoride Rinse for Kids. They are both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> I like Oasis much better than Biotene for a moisturizing mouth wash.  It tastes a lot better and feels a lot more pleasant in the mouth. Note to marketers: My problem is that I have a hard time finding it in stores.  They all seem to carry Biotene but not Oasis.</li>
            <li> Contains the ingredient cetylpyridinium chloride which stains teeth. Couldn&#x27;t figure out why all of a sudden I had brown stains on a few of my teeth, but after a month of using this product it kept getting worse. Finally connected the dots. Yes, the dentist can remove the stains but I&#x27;d rather go back to Biotene (which I don&#x27;t love) than have to make cleaning appointments twice a month because of this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for correcting dry mouth. Because of medications I take, I have a problem with keeping my mouth mousturized. I was delighted when I found this product, but I cannot buy it locally any more, to my chagrin. The flavor is mildly mint, and the rinse does an excellent job that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I really like this mouthwash so far.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to tell what the moisturizing part is yet.  Pros:  The tase is the best of any mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used.  It gives the refreshing feeling that mint does, but the mint isn&#x27;t so strong that it burns my mouth.  Cons:  None yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a woman that I care for that has dry mouth from all the medication she takes.  I bought this instead of Biotene for a change.  Works great and she says it tastes pretty good.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this over Biotene dry mouthwash, which has a sticky mouth feel. It&#x27;s worth the few dollars more.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth as a result of reflux and/or the medicine I am taking for it. The mouthwash tastes good and offers relief for about a minute and then the sensitive tongue feeling is back.</li>
            <li> It keeps my mouth moisturize and smelling great, if you have dry mouth or throat at you gotta try this. No more morning breath.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Works for my dry mouth, where others do not work. It is pleasant to use and rinses effectively.</li>
            <li> The mouthwash says mild mint but it was hot and burned my mouth.  Former user of Biotene.</li>
            <li> While I am sure it did the moisturizing part, my mouth felt like it had an oil slick in it after using it,. Could not stand that feeling.</li>
            <li> I like the taste of this much better than Biotene</li>
            <li> This is my preferred mouthwash for a dry mouth as it really works and has a nice taste. I&#x27;ve tried others which taste horrible and do not last. I would recommend this to anyone who takes medication that causes dry mouth - a condition not at all funny or simple.</li>
            <li> Chronic dry mouth is a problem to me whatever the cause.  I also have dry skin, chronic dry eyes...This mouthwash does what it promises it will do:  it moisturizes your mouth and lasts a long time.  I like it.  The taste is pleasant and it does not burn excessively.l</li>
            <li> I have a naturally dry mouth.  If I use Listerine before bed I&#x27;ll be up all night drinking water. I asked my dentist and he recommended Oasis.      This mouthwash is great. I recommend it to any one with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> used it only a while; good while I used it</li>
            <li> This product works very well for dry mouth symptoms. It has a pleasant taste and the effect of the product seems to last longer than other products such as Biotene Mouthwash. It does seem pricey but you use less of it than you would of a standard mouthwash such as Listerine or other. I recommend this to friends with dry mouth problems and they seem to like it as well.</li>
            <li> Having entered the unfortunate stage in a women&#x27;s life, detestable menopause, I begain experiencing severe dry mouth-- a known symptom of this affiction (one of the many sordid stages we women endure).  I was desperate to reverse this unforgiving symptom which also causes bad breath.  I started to realize that I was being offered chewing gum by my co-workers suggesting that my breath was not, shall we say, \\&quot;welcome\\&quot;, as a result of dry and sore mouth conditions.  I identified a few products on line to resolve this and tried Biotene gum and spray and Oasis mouthwash.  The Biotene was of marginal value, but the Oasis has resolved the issue almost entirely within one week!  Yes, the price may seem prohibitive, but if you have \\&quot;enjoyed\\&quot; a similar experience with this unwelcome side effect of menopause, then search the house for loose change, sell plasma, aluminum cans, whatever-- just get it!</li>
            <li> This may be a product that works for some but not others. I don&#x27;t have severe dry mouth but I do have issue with it when I sleep. It has great reviews so I gave it a try. I used the product as directed but didn&#x27;t really see any improvement over not using any mouth wash at all. I bought this in January and used the entire bottle before writing a review. I will say using this before bed is much better than using a normal mouthwash (like Listerine). Normal mouthwash gives me all sorts of dry mouth issues. So I wouldn&#x27;t say this made my dry mouth better, but it at least is better than using normal mouth wash. For the price, I won&#x27;t be getting it again though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after complaining to my dental hygienist about waking in the night with uncomfortable dryness in my mouth.  While it has not eliminated the problem, I have found that it has reduced the discomfort.  I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from this problem.  I do not seem to experience the discomfort during the daytime, but it was increasingly severe at night.  I was very pleased that it is available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Tried it and really like it. I use it several times a day &amp; before bed, it really does help my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Great product with quick delivery</li>
            <li> It works very well. I highly recommend it. I tried others and this works better than all the rest !</li>
            <li> husband and I love it for dry mouth and allergies</li>
            <li> My dad looked everywhere for this mouthwash. It was not sold in any of the local stores. It is the only one that works for his dry mouth. We were thrilled to find it on Amazon. We were even happier to find out it was affordable. We will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, and most retailers have stopped carrying it.  It was a delight to find I could still get it from Amazon.  Leaves my breath fresh without smelling minty or mediciny.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extreme dry mouth, both from an immune disorder and from medications.  Oasis mouthwash for dry mouth and the Oasis spray work better than the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It did seem to help quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom as it is on amazon prime. She likes the Oasis better than Biotine as it keeps her mouth from drying out better. It arrived as scheduled and without any problems.</li>
            <li> The Oasis mouthwash does help lessen dry mouth.  It tastes good and really works for CPAP machine users.  The only draw back is that your mouth will feel a little coated immediately after using it.  However, that is much better than waking up with a dry mouth and feeling discomfort.  This product is not always readily available  in stores.  Thank you for offering it to us.</li>
            <li> My Father suffers from &amp;#34;Dry Mouth&amp;#34; and he says that this mouthwash works really well for him. I have not tried it myself.</li>
            <li> Works better than the biotene mouthwash.  It appears to be a little less expensive.  Very few places carry this around my area..</li>
            <li> I get very bad dry mouth from medications I take and nothing seems to work. This brand is totally worth the purchase. My mouth feel refreshed and it helps eliminate the dry-mouth.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mouthwash.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, and no one has complained about my breath.  Either I have a bunch of polite friends, or they have lost their sense of smell, or it works.  I prefer to think it works.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with dry mouth at night and this really worked for me.  I use it before bed and I don&#x27;t wake up in the middle of the night dying for water.  I tried another product that worked, but in wore off in the middle of the night and I had to get up and use it again.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and especially bothersome at night.  Tried various products and found that Biotene works the best.  Oasis did not help.</li>
            <li> My friend has had oral cancer, and he had chemo and radiation. Dry mouth is a big problem for him. He complains about the price of Biotene, so I bought this when my son &amp; I had to have a bunch of teeth taken out.&lt;br /&gt;I took it to him and he LIKES it! He can just about get through a night without the dry mouth waking him if he uses it before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Great for unfogging dental mirrors.</li>
            <li> I think this is as effective as Biotene ! I really like it a lot and it&#x27;s consistency is thicker than Biotene so it seems to work longer.</li>
            <li> I have a bad case of dy mouth. The Oasis products are the best I have found. I keep a bottle of the spray in my purse all the time. I like the taste of both the mouth wash and spray.</li>
            <li> For a number of years, my dentist has been suggesting that I use a dry mouth product. I tried Biotene a while back, and it tasted simply awful. Since that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve seen when I&#x27;ve looked where I typically shop, my dentist suggested checking with independent pharmacies instead of the typical chain stores. I found this Oasis product today, and it is 100% tolerable. I like a strong mint flavor (Listerine Cool Mint), and the Oasis Mild Mint flavor is definitely much more tame than I&#x27;m used to. But as long as it works and tastes reasonable, I&#x27;m happy. I&#x27;ll update my review in 6 months after my next dentist visit to see what he thinks of the results.  Updated: My dental hygienist commented that my mouth wasn&#x27;t dry like it&#x27;s typically been. I was going to ask her and mention that I had been using Oasis, but she volunteered the information out of the blue. I can&#x27;t say for sure how much of a difference it&#x27;s made; I don&#x27;t use it nearly as often as I should, but I had used it just before the dental appointment today. Would she have noticed if I hadn&#x27;t used it within the last day? Not sure. Also, I&#x27;ve stopped some medications that she thought might have been contributing to the dry mouth problem. So there may be a few factors contributing to the difference, but it does seem like Oasis has probably been helping, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is strongly recommended by our dentist.  Both my husband and I have dry mouths due to medication, and we use this twice a day (especially before bed) to keep our mouths moister and protect our teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the spray and I thought it might work the same way.  My fault and not the products.  I will use the spray from now on and the mouthwash was OK.</li>
            <li> Better than Biotene anyday!</li>
            <li> The only dry mouth rinse that I like the taste of.</li>
