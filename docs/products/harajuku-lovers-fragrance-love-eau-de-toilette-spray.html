            <li>I tried this one day when passing by a sales assistant by a cosmetic counter and loved it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This would make a great stocking stuffer though.</li>
            <li>Great value for your money.</li>
            <li>gwen stefani &amp; like this one best :)</li>
            <li>This would be a good work smell, assuming you don&#x27;t wanna impress anyone but want to have an all-day smell.</li>
            <li>she loved it</li>
            <li>It brings good memories and helps me feel good about myself all day.</li>
            <li>She loved it! :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great on the top of a dresser...</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance and great quality.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of something when I was a kid &amp; that makes me happy :)</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the packaging.</li>
            <li>The perfume itself though does not smell so great, but its ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s so cute!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances!</li>
            <li>My meme(grandmother) love the smell of this stuff and so do I!</li>
            <li>The bottle is so cute and not to mention with a full 1oz, you can get up to around 200-300 uses :D</li>
            <li>Smells amazing</li>
            <li>so I go real light on it.</li>
            <li>The manufactuer says the fragrance is infused with notes of bergamot, pomelo (citrus), peach, rose, jasmine, orchid and musk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery of a great product!</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s not too incredible--it&#x27;s a nice floral scent, but with kind of an alcohol-like note that I&#x27;ve grown to dislike more and more with time.  </li>
            <li>I love the bottle</li>
            <li>but the fragrance is just ok.  </li>
            <li>it sounds a lot better than it smells.  </li>
            <li>The bottle and packaging are still completely adorable, however, and I keep them for that reason.</li>
            <li>absolutely my favorite perfume of the harajuku collection.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS SCENT</li>
            <li>this is one of my favorites, the harajuku lovers love perfume.  </li>
            <li>i am so glad to have found it on amazon, and for such a good price too!!  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>My favorite Harajuku scent, and the bottle is so cute.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li>she loves most every fragrance</li>
            <li>This is my favorite spray.</li>
            <li>and I love it. .</li>
            <li>It makes a lovely statement on a vanity.</li>
            <li>and I got so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I just love this smell.</li>
            <li>I like the scent on this perfume and the bottle itself is adorable as well.</li>
            <li>large size I bought at Amazon is even more visually spectacular.  </li>
            <li>Life was never so easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a vey light fragrance, not too flowery either</li>
            <li>it has a very strong alcohol at first then settles in and has a light scent compared to the original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the original scent/perfume.</li>
            <li>Harajuku Lovers perfume has to win the award for some of the cutest bottles around, as I absolutely love the little girls!</li>
            <li>The smell of this perfume is just oh so sweet and calming.</li>
            <li>.. :) I have payed more for a much smaller bottle before.</li>
            <li>It should be clear and it does not smell and potent as the original.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells so good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>it smells good, but not really what i was hoping for.</li>
            <li>i originally got ths as a birthday gift a few yeas ago and was estatic when i was finally able to find it at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Nice perfume, its a little strong</li>
            <li>More romantic smelling....</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I have nostalgia for this product because it was the first perfume I wore, and it&#x27;s what I wore when we first started dating.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent and have bought it several times.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty scent without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I first found this perfume at a Nordstroms Fragrance Festival for $50 or so</li>
            <li>Maybe it was a refilled bottle and they cut it with alcohol to preserve more of the scent for more bottles, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li>The original liquid was clear.</li>
            <li>The packaging was very secure, it arrived faster than I had expected.</li>
            <li>The little doll cover is a nice decorative touch too.  </li>
            <li>I liked it very much and bought a small bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love the little Asian girl on the to top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I really like the bottles in this 4-part collection by Gwen Stefani.</li>
            <li>i get so much compliments when i wear it, and people want to know what it is and where to get it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;According to the information I found online:  the top notes include sparkling bergamot, pink pomelo, peach, and bamboo leaf mist; the middle notes include water peony, living hydroponic lace rose, jasmine sambac, nectarine, creamy paperwhites, and egyptian jasmine; and the bottom notes include ylang ylang, vanilla orchid, sensual musk, and blonde wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the bottle and the association with Gwen Stefani, I really wanted to like this scent.</li>
            <li>The smell fades too fast.</li>
            <li>Good product, arrived late though...</li>
            <li>The liquid fragrance is yellow which is not the color of the original.</li>
            <li>I love amazon for almost anything, but probably will not purchase any other perfumes here.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very cute and not to small!</li>
            <li>Some strange guy told me he thought I was wearing some special perfume that attracts men.</li>
            <li>retail in the store, you pay a good (high) price for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li>This smells more common and while stronger than G, is not as crisp and refined.</li>
            <li>smells sweet, but not all alcoholy or too much like a little girl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to make this tiny sacrifice on smelling alcohol for the first few minutes for the price difference between here and there, so worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderfully light, youthful, and slightly floral.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s the same kind as I usually get</li>
            <li>This is less &#x27;special&#x27; than the first one I bought my wife, which was the \\&quot;G\\&quot;, and has a blonde (presumably Gwen.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe It was such a big bottle for such a cheap price</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a new scent.</li>
            <li>Very disappointing, and I&#x27;m glad now that I didn&#x27;t pay full price or collect the whole</li>
            <li>I simply Love this fragrance and it is very hard to find..</li>
            <li>a little flat, not as soft and sweet as what I remember.</li>
            <li>Like so many other people, my introduction to this fragrance was  being spritzed with it by a salesperson at Macy&#x27;s a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>Wish i couldve found a bigger size, im not sure if its available.  </li>

            <li> but it smells just a little different...</li>
            <li> rather than 5 is because it smells like it&#x27;s been alcoholed down.</li>
            <li> It has hints of musk and less of bergamont (which I adore).  </li>
            <li> Also, in Amazon I bought it for a half of the price on stores.</li>
            <li> Never picked up a bottle as I was afraid I&#x27;d want to collect the whole set, but couldn&#x27;t resist when I saw this one on sale.</li>
            <li> sucks that i cannot return it.</li>
            <li> I am sad that it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore</li>
            <li> Smells weird.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite perfume! Love it!</li>
            <li> bought this via goldbox for about $23.  I love the bottle and it&#x27;s great on the top of a dresser... but the fragrance is just ok.  Nothing you&#x27;d write home about.  It has hints of musk and less of bergamont (which I adore).  The manufactuer says the fragrance is infused with notes of bergamot, pomelo (citrus), peach, rose, jasmine, orchid and musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO it sounds a lot better than it smells.  I prefer the G frangrance in this series.  More romantic smelling....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great stocking stuffer though.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I have nostalgia for this product because it was the first perfume I wore, and it&#x27;s what I wore when we first started dating.

            <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my friend. Since it&#x27;s always been a scent that she wished she had, I decided why not? The smell of this perfume is just oh so sweet and calming. The bottle is so cute and not to mention with a full 1oz, you can get up to around 200-300 uses :D She loved it! :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It is my favorite! It&#x27;s not overpowering like the others. I am sad that it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore but so happy I can find it on amazon!</li>
            <li> absolutely my favorite perfume of the harajuku collection. smells sweet, but not all alcoholy or too much like a little girl. perfect</li>
            <li> Smells wonderfully light, youthful, and slightly floral. The little doll cover is a nice decorative touch too.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SCENT AND I WANT MORE!!!</li>
            <li> Great value for your money. Smells amazing</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s the same kind as I usually get but it smells just a little different... a little flat, not as soft and sweet as what I remember.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of a great product!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister! she loved it it&#x27;s so cute! great price!</li>
            <li> Good product, arrived late though...</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorites, the harajuku lovers love perfume.  i get so much compliments when i wear it, and people want to know what it is and where to get it.  i am so glad to have found it on amazon, and for such a good price too!!  retail in the store, you pay a good (high) price for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume. This why I decide to purchase 2 bottles for me for Christmas  I will have my perfume for a while now</li>
            <li> My favorite Harajuku scent, and the bottle is so cute. This perfume smells so good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> great!! Excellent!! Lovely fragrance and great quality. Also, in Amazon I bought it for a half of the price on stores.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances! It reminds me of something when I was a kid &amp; that makes me happy :)</li>
            <li> My meme(grandmother) love the smell of this stuff and so do I!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and always get compliments when I wear it!  I always have a &#x27;spare&#x27; on hand!</li>
            <li> The liquid fragrance is yellow which is not the color of the original. It should be clear and it does not smell and potent as the original. it has a very strong alcohol at first then settles in and has a light scent compared to the original. ordered a tester bottle from another website. I love amazon for almost anything, but probably will not purchase any other perfumes here. it smells good, but not really what i was hoping for. sucks that i cannot return it.</li>
            <li> i originally got ths as a birthday gift a few yeas ago and was estatic when i was finally able to find it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and have bought it several times. I get many compliments when wearing it. It&#x27;s a vey light fragrance, not too flowery either</li>
            <li> my fave perfume! Wish i couldve found a bigger size, im not sure if its available.  You should try it</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for my daughter.  she loves most every fragrance&lt;br /&gt;by gwen stefani &amp; like this one best :)</li>
            <li> Nice perfume, its a little strong so I go real light on it. I love the little Asian girl on the to top of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite spray. I only gave it 4 stars because once I smelled Harajuku Lovers &amp;#34;wicked style love&amp;#34; I fell harder for that.</li>
            <li> Luv the scent. Best out of all the collection !!! I&#x27;ve purchased four bottles of this same scent and I love it. .</li>
            <li> My daughter ( 15 ) loves the smell of this fragrance. It is a pretty scent without being overpowering. She has used it since it was  launched several years ago.</li>
            <li> Harajuku Lovers perfume has to win the award for some of the cutest bottles around, as I absolutely love the little girls! Never picked up a bottle as I was afraid I&#x27;d want to collect the whole set, but couldn&#x27;t resist when I saw this one on sale. Thought it was time I tried it, as you couldn&#x27;t beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the information I found online:  the top notes include sparkling bergamot, pink pomelo, peach, and bamboo leaf mist; the middle notes include water peony, living hydroponic lace rose, jasmine sambac, nectarine, creamy paperwhites, and egyptian jasmine; and the bottom notes include ylang ylang, vanilla orchid, sensual musk, and blonde wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the bottle and the association with Gwen Stefani, I really wanted to like this scent. And I do. But unfortunately, the scent is just too light and doesn&#x27;t last. Even when I reapply it, the scent soon fades. Very disappointing, and I&#x27;m glad now that I didn&#x27;t pay full price or collect the whole set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute bottle&lt;br /&gt;Pleasing scent&lt;br /&gt;Can be found on sale as several different retailers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is too light&lt;br /&gt;Has no staying power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will finish the bottle, but will not buy again</li>
            <li> BEWARE! It&#x27;s not the original scent/perfume. They did try their best to match it... The smell fades too fast. The original liquid was clear. NOT yellow...</li>
            <li> Smells weird. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> The packaging was very secure, it arrived faster than I had expected. I was very pleased with the packaging. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Like so many other people, my introduction to this fragrance was  being spritzed with it by a salesperson at Macy&#x27;s a few years ago.  I liked it very much and bought a small bottle.  Since I don&#x27;t go to the fragrance department often, if ever, I didn&#x27;t know if it was still around.  Here comes the wonder of Amazon!  Type it in and if its still made Amazon will find it for you!  Life was never so easy.  No multiple phone calls, no misunderstanding about name or sizes and no driving around to get it!&lt;br /&gt;The large size I bought at Amazon is even more visually spectacular.  It makes a lovely statement on a vanity.</li>
            <li> I first found this perfume at a Nordstroms Fragrance Festival for $50 or so and I got so many compliments. Some strange guy told me he thought I was wearing some special perfume that attracts men. I just love this smell. It brings good memories and helps me feel good about myself all day.</li>
            <li> I like the scent on this perfume and the bottle itself is adorable as well. The reason I gave it a 4 rather than 5 is because it smells like it&#x27;s been alcoholed down. Maybe it was a refilled bottle and they cut it with alcohol to preserve more of the scent for more bottles, I&#x27;m not sure. Once the initial alcohol smell goes away, you&#x27;re left with the same scent as it had when I was at the perfume store. I&#x27;m willing to make this tiny sacrifice on smelling alcohol for the first few minutes for the price difference between here and there, so worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very cute and not to small! The perfume itself though does not smell so great, but its ok.</li>
            <li> I tried this one day when passing by a sales assistant by a cosmetic counter and loved it!  Would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a new scent.</li>
