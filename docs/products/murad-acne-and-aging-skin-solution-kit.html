            <li>The product is good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this set!  </li>
            <li>but it does make my skin look and feel nice</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve found for adult acne.</li>
            <li>first, like always, my packages for the most part always arrive before the arrival date, that i love!!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the lotion has a spf already in it.</li>
            <li>Love the products.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many.</li>
            <li>helps my skin, gentle no irritation and great price</li>
            <li>I have tried most moisturizers out there, specifically ones that are supposed to be for acne prone skin, and all of them have made me break out.</li>
            <li>I began to see results in about 3 weeks and my skin is clearer and feels more supple.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>, most make me break out</li>
            <li>For me, I LOVE all of it.</li>
            <li>THIS JUST MADE ME BREAK OUT A LOT MORE...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>an I get told I look 22ish :)  </li>
            <li>Great for acne pro older skin.</li>
            <li>It is Amazing and worth every penny</li>
            <li>It seems to be great with combo and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Murad is an amazing product keeps my face nice and clear.</li>
            <li>I used them up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This was shipped to me very quickly received it in two days of ordering.</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much I ordered another set.</li>
            <li>This kit gives you four products, that work great, for the same amount of money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try :)</li>
            <li>Acne and Aging Skin solution kit works to reduce acne, but is more gentle and provides more moisture where needed after 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so far, so good on keeping my breakouts at bay</li>
            <li>I was excited but this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what difference it would like in a month or two</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and have used many products for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing the full size products.</li>
            <li>just love this whole line.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure I owe that to good genes, proper facial care, and this set. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My niece loved this product and worked out wel on her acne but ageing skin, was gentle enough.</li>
            <li>I read through some Proactive reviews and one response mentioned Murad was better for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin, so I decided to try.</li>
            <li>The product is great, but the amount of product is quite small for the price.</li>
            <li>know a lot of people complain about the size, but you don&#x27;t need very much of any of the products</li>
            <li>Both kits work well, but the spot corrector in the regular kit works better on me that the aging skin spot corrector.  </li>
            <li>As described, fast shipping, and no problems!</li>
            <li>I  have been using  Murad for 3 months and will now become an avid user of it.</li>
            <li>but I hope these products keep it that way ;)</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, most from my dermatologist, very expensive and not as effective as I hoped.</li>
            <li>but it does seem to be working positively.</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t oily, it doesn&#x27;t lay like lard on my face - it just cleans and moisturizes and does some sort of magic trick all day long.</li>
            <li>REALLY.. SAVE YOUR MONEY...</li>
            <li>I really do like this a lot, it&#x27;s not a miracle cream</li>
            <li>really like  the quality, price  and scent.</li>
            <li>wrinkles much yet,</li>
            <li>The bottles in the set are very small, but it&#x27;s a great way to try the line before making a bigger purchase.</li>
            <li>It has lasted a little more than a month</li>
            <li>Is this normal???</li>
            <li>Maybe the starter kit sizes are not enough to see results right away.</li>
            <li>especially when i can go to sephora and get samples for free and are the same size..</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As previously mentioned in other reviews, the bottles are small - think smaller than most travel sizes, but it&#x27;s a great way to see if the system works for you.</li>
            <li>These products did nothing really to clear my skin</li>
            <li>If they try to charge me a restocking fee, I will fight it tooth and nail as this is clearly deceptive selling.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and my pores diminished.  </li>
            <li>I too was surprised with the size of the products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 months and have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I am 39 years old as of this posting and still have breakouts all of the time.  </li>
            <li>and I am 31 years old</li>
            <li>If you think about it, buying a regular size face wash and moisturizer of a higher-end anti-aging drugstore brand is going to cost you about $30, and really will only last you about a month, month and a half at most.  </li>
            <li>and I will hopefully remember to edit this post when they&#x27;re finished to give an idea of how long the kit really lasts.</li>
            <li>My face has stayed clear the longest when I use this regimen daily.  </li>
            <li>I am in my mid-30s and have sensitive and dry skin that is prone to pore-clogging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typically a product hog, I use way more of everything than I&#x27;m supposed to, but I use just what I need with this kit and it lasts me at least a month.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t emphasize just how tiny they really are, but, I have been using them for a couple days and only a little of each product is required.</li>
            <li>Sometimes people say if a product is really effective, your skin will get worse before it gets better because it is drawing out all the bad stuff from lower layers.  </li>

            <li> I hope the items last long enough to see some definitive change</li>
            <li> So maybe I didn&#x27;t give this a long enough try.  </li>
            <li> First of all-  pay close attention to the sizes -- they are extremely small!  </li>
            <li> Works well and clear my face in just about two and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> Also as a 41 year old who has always had a slight acne problem....</li>
            <li> this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that produces a balance between not making my skin dry and helping fight acne.</li>
            <li> They prevent breakouts and leave my skin soft and clear, not oily or dry, and I definitely notice a difference in the small lines and dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> That is not completely unheard of for my skin</li>
            <li> I have struggled with finding sunscreens that don&#x27;t cause me to break out and acne treatments that don&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I was considering Proactive, but was concerned it would really dry out and crackle finish my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> But for these teeny tiny sizes, the cost is not worth it to me to try again.</li>
            <li> I developed a small rash and can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> all the tubes are only half gone.</li>
            <li> at least 80 year-round - I sweat and stress and come home shiny, but my face has stayed clear!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product that is both anti-acne and anti-aging, and these Murad products are the only ones that have actually worked for me.  </li>
            <li> The regimen only takes a few minutes, it&#x27;s not greasy at all</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This sample pack lasted me just about 8 weeks, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin.  </li>
            <li> This was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> but usually I&#x27;ll just get one in a long while -</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help my skin at all unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Would I have been shocked if they were full sizes, yes, but I did not expect anything this small....</li>
            <li> I am 40, and have always had problem skin, possibly even worse now in hormone-o-ville than ever before.</li>
            <li> but even though i read the reviews on this product i was still super shocked at how small the bottles were in this set..</li>
            <li> We found it at Amazon less expensive and the very same product.  </li>
            <li> but I periodically have 1-3 small blemishes every few days and oily skin.</li>
            <li> and I actually got a few blind pimples while using them.  </li>
            <li> At least the bottles are small, less to throw away.  </li>
            <li> Small tubes..</li>
            <li> I got it because Dr. Murad seems to be at the forefront of skincare with his Water Secret book, etc.</li>
            <li> NO WHERE on the ad did it say these were minis, let alone tiny, pathetic minis.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This was not worth the money. The best part of the kit is the eye cream!</li>
            <li> Works well. I wish they had bigger sized tubes. Kinda prices but works well</li>
            <li> My face has not broke out since I started using this product.  My skin feels soft and my pores diminished.  I love the fact that the lotion has a spf already in it.</li>
            <li> Love the products. Great travel sizes.</li>
            <li> This is the best acne solution I have EVER TRIED and I have tried so many. I don&#x27;t have severe acne but I periodically have 1-3 small blemishes every few days and oily skin. Plus reddness around the nose area. After ONE DAY my face drastically improved in every way. I even left the house several times without any foundation and I NEVER do that. My tone was even out and cleared up perfectly after just 3 days. I have been using it every morning and night and have not had a blemish yet. It has been about a month now since I&#x27;ve had it. It is Amazing and worth every penny</li>
            <li> helps my skin, gentle no irritation and great price</li>
            <li> Great value for the set. It has lasted a little more than a month and I will be purchasing the full size products.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve found for adult acne.</li>
            <li> I too was surprised with the size of the products HOWEVER.... a little goes a long way. I&#x27;d say this would be a month&#x27;s supply perhaps?  Also as a 41 year old who has always had a slight acne problem....this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that produces a balance between not making my skin dry and helping fight acne. It seems to be great with combo and sensitive skin and I no longer have to use powder with my make up...my skin stays balanced all day with or without make up.  I&#x27;d say give it a try for yourself....</li>
            <li> The products don&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, however, since day one I have even more breakouts!!! Is this normal??? I&#x27;ve been using all products for 3 days/nights now.</li>
            <li> First of all-  pay close attention to the sizes -- they are extremely small!  Yes, you are getting 4 products for your money, but the eye cream especially looks like a sample size.  I used them up very quickly.  I also don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re very effective.  I got it because Dr. Murad seems to be at the forefront of skincare with his Water Secret book, etc., so I thought I&#x27;d give his products a try. Also, I need something that is Anti-Aging and Anti-Acne as I&#x27;m mid-40s but still get pimples.  These products did nothing really to clear my skin and I actually got a few blind pimples while using them.  That is not completely unheard of for my skin but usually I&#x27;ll just get one in a long while - I got 2 or 3 on this stuff, about one a week.  Sometimes people say if a product is really effective, your skin will get worse before it gets better because it is drawing out all the bad stuff from lower layers.  So maybe I didn&#x27;t give this a long enough try.  But for these teeny tiny sizes, the cost is not worth it to me to try again.</li>
            <li> Murad is an amazing product keeps my face nice and clear. This was shipped to me very quickly received it in two days of ordering. Love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin. I have tried most moisturizers out there, specifically ones that are supposed to be for acne prone skin, and all of them have made me break out. I thought this might work out for me, because I used to love a different brand&#x27;s anti-aging, anti-acne that has been discontinued, but unfortunately this didn&#x27;t work for me either. I like the scents of everything and it didn&#x27;t cause any rashes, just did make me break out with whiteheads. As previously mentioned in other reviews, the bottles are small - think smaller than most travel sizes, but it&#x27;s a great way to see if the system works for you.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I developed a small rash and can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> The eye serum is the only thing I don&#x27;t like.  It makes my eyes swell.  But a great 3 step combo otherwise!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-30s and have sensitive and dry skin that is prone to pore-clogging. I have struggled with finding sunscreens that don&#x27;t cause me to break out and acne treatments that don&#x27;t dry my skin out. Thankfully, this system solved both of those problems. I began to see results in about 3 weeks and my skin is clearer and feels more supple. This set is about enough product for a 1 month supply and I liked it so much I ordered another set.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, most from my dermatologist, very expensive and not as effective as I hoped. I bought this this summer and I love it. I am really pleased with the sunscreen. I am very fair and I need to wear sunscreen every day, most make me break out this does not. The cleanser cleans without drying my skin out.  This sample pack lasted me just about 8 weeks, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Small tubes.. And I broke out!! I&#x27;m no longer going to use. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My niece loved this product and worked out wel on her acne but ageing skin, was gentle enough. we will order again.</li>
            <li> I was excited but this product didn&#x27;t work for me. At least the bottles are small, less to throw away.  I will spare you all photos of my gross face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set!  It&#x27;s hard to find a product that is both anti-acne and anti-aging, and these Murad products are the only ones that have actually worked for me.  They prevent breakouts and leave my skin soft and clear, not oily or dry, and I definitely notice a difference in the small lines and dark spots on my face.  I am 35, but people tell me all the time that I look like I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties.  Pretty sure I owe that to good genes, proper facial care, and this set. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people complain about the size, but you don&#x27;t need very much of any of the products - a little really does go a long way.  I&#x27;m typically a product hog, I use way more of everything than I&#x27;m supposed to, but I use just what I need with this kit and it lasts me at least a month.  If you think about it, buying a regular size face wash and moisturizer of a higher-end anti-aging drugstore brand is going to cost you about $30, and really will only last you about a month, month and a half at most.  And you&#x27;re only getting those two products, which in my experience, don&#x27;t even work well.  This kit gives you four products, that work great, for the same amount of money.  It&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> Great for acne pro older skin. Mirad has great products all around. Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> These are sample size. Will last about 3 weeks to 1 month. Good way to see if you like it. For me, I LOVE all of it. Works well and clear my face in just about two and a half weeks. I now have the bigger size and I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 months now and all the tubes are only half gone. I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> first, like always, my packages for the most part always arrive before the arrival date, that i love!! but even though i read the reviews on this product i was still super shocked at how small the bottles were in this set..40$ for this set is a bit over priced..especially when i can go to sephora and get samples for free and are the same size..</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a couiple of weeks now but it does seem to be working positively. I am excited to see what difference it would like in a month or two</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and have used many products for many years.  My face has stayed clear the longest when I use this regimen daily.  I combine the acne regimen with the aging skin solution by simply adding the eye cream to the regular acne kit.  Both kits work well, but the spot corrector in the regular kit works better on me that the aging skin spot corrector.  Both have their advantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Acne and Aging Skin solution kit works to reduce acne, but is more gentle and provides more moisture where needed after 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this whole line.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 months and have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> As described, fast shipping, and no problems! People who say there isnt enough are just ignorant. Youre buying trial sizes dummies!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help my skin at all unfortunately.</li>
            <li> THIS JUST MADE ME BREAK OUT A LOT MORE... I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE REALLY.. SAVE YOUR MONEY...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T THINK ITS EVEN REAL TO BE HONEST.. I THINK THIS WAS A KNOCK OFF.</li>
            <li> NO WHERE on the ad did it say these were minis, let alone tiny, pathetic minis. Would I have been shocked if they were full sizes, yes, but I did not expect anything this small....I would have never purchased it if the site had disclosed the actual sizes of the product. If they try to charge me a restocking fee, I will fight it tooth and nail as this is clearly deceptive selling.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the amount of product is quite small for the price.</li>
            <li> I really do like this a lot, it&#x27;s not a miracle cream but it does make my skin look and feel nice</li>
            <li> I am 39 years old as of this posting and still have breakouts all of the time.  I have extremely oily skin.  This product in just a 2 weeks has dramatically improved my skin.  My skin not only looks clearer it feels great too.  Love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is good. No doubt about it. I too am 40 and have some acne and oily skin. This is the perfect balance. I don&#x27;t have to choose from acne or anti aging.. This has both! Maybe the starter kit sizes are not enough to see results right away. However I would get the starter kit when I travel.</li>
            <li> My wife initially purchased this product through the local Ulta store.  She loves what it is doing to her face.  We found it at Amazon less expensive and the very same product.  If you&#x27;re concerned about aging spots and wrinkles, this definitely helps the issue.</li>
            <li> I  have been using  Murad for 3 months and will now become an avid user of it. I  really like  the quality, price  and scent. I  was using the Murad acne line before this purchase and I  use both lines combined now. One difference  is the face wash, this wash is creamy not lathery. I  use when I  am not washing  off foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it&#x27;s works!!!!!  Been using its for months and I am 31 years old an I get told I look 22ish :)  When I start to brake out with acne an it&#x27;s gone by night time. It&#x27;s worth a try :)</li>
            <li> Just ordered the &#x27;life sized&#x27; products! I am 40, and have always had problem skin, possibly even worse now in hormone-o-ville than ever before. I was considering Proactive, but was concerned it would really dry out and crackle finish my face. I read through some Proactive reviews and one response mentioned Murad was better for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin, so I decided to try. The bottles in the set are very small, but it&#x27;s a great way to try the line before making a bigger purchase. The set lasted me a month using it all twice daily. I cannot believe the difference this made in a really short period of time! I am a nurse, work 12-13 hour shifts in a long-term care facility where the thermostat is set at at least 80 year-round - I sweat and stress and come home shiny, but my face has stayed clear!  I actually have started going to work WITHOUT MAKEUP ON MY FACE!!! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it isn&#x27;t oily, it doesn&#x27;t lay like lard on my face - it just cleans and moisturizes and does some sort of magic trick all day long. I haven&#x27;t battled lines/wrinkles much yet, but I hope these products keep it that way ;)</li>
            <li> The items in the box are really very, very, very tiny - I can&#x27;t emphasize just how tiny they really are, but, I have been using them for a couple days and only a little of each product is required. The regimen only takes a few minutes, it&#x27;s not greasy at all and so far, so good on keeping my breakouts at bay (again, it has just been a couple days so, that may change). I hope the items last long enough to see some definitive change and I will hopefully remember to edit this post when they&#x27;re finished to give an idea of how long the kit really lasts.</li>
