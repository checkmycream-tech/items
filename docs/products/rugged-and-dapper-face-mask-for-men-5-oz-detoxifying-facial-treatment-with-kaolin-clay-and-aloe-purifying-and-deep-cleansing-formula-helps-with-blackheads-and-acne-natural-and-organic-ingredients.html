            <li>After using it my face feels even more soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Huge fan of the whole line.</li>
            <li>Now with this clay mask we&#x27;re going wild in the bathroom :)</li>
            <li>I was just one of those men that didn&#x27;t feel the need to use any kind of facial treatment.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>15 minutes after application I washed my face rinsing all the clay off, my skin never felt sooo smooth and soft</li>
            <li>For sure a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left it on longer than directed because we got sucked into our show on TV</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s fragrance free for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a product like this.</li>
            <li>What can I say, I am a General Contractor and I&#x27;m outside all day in the hot California heat, and it get pretty dang ruff out there, after using my new mineral clay that my beautiful wife got me, my crackly old leathery cowboy face is disappearing, and a young beautiful 19 year old Calvin Klein yachtsman model has appeared in front of me, But seriously I feel amazing</li>
            <li>We loved how refreshing it felt while applying it, and how a little goes a long way around your face.</li>
            <li>He gets dirt lodged in his pores constantly at work and this mask is really working its magic.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it off, my skin felt so clean, clear and it didn&#x27;t make my face feel dry like most of the masks I use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s left both our faces feeling so smooth after rinsing.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>you can really see and feel the benefits.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see my pores shrinking and see my face is more clear.</li>
            <li>My face felt so soft after ever use and with consistent use</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this to all the men out there.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>My acne has gone away and my pores are at a normal size now.</li>
            <li>but besides the fun of it it&#x27;s actually working!</li>
            <li>Now with the new mask I got him to try</li>
            <li>it was such a success with his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I applied the clay to my face for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>so he was pretty red</li>
            <li>The Rugged &amp; Dapper products make his skin so soft and it smells intoxicating!</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a men&#x27;s facial product.</li>
            <li>It did well rebalancing the oiliness of my skin and clear my pores during these summer months.  </li>
            <li>My teenage son uses it and I am amazed at how fast it worked for him.  </li>
            <li>But its like half full.</li>
            <li>I received it in less than 2 days and was surprised at how large the case was!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using R&amp;D&#x27;s other products and I really like them,</li>
            <li>I thought, well at least I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>After using their products for a few months now my skin has improved a lot and the fact that these products are made with all natural ingredients, high in nutrition and without any chemicals or fragrances makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well, but as some other reviewers have noted, arrives looking like its half full and unsealed.</li>

            <li> WOW!! What can I say, I am a General Contractor and I&#x27;m outside all day in the hot California heat, and it get pretty dang ruff out there, after using my new mineral clay that my beautiful wife got me, my crackly old leathery cowboy face is disappearing, and a young beautiful 19 year old Calvin Klein yachtsman model has appeared in front of me, But seriously I feel amazing, I want to thank the Rugged and Dapper team, who I feel&lt;br /&gt;Are like family to me, and the customer service is frigen awesome!! I give u guys 10 stars. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and could not wait to try it. Washed my face with mild soap and on the mask went! I felt it drying up five minutes after application. I like how it made my face feel when drying up, you can almost feel all the impurities being sucked out of your pores. 15 minutes after application I washed my face rinsing all the clay off, my skin never felt sooo smooth and soft, I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> Have yet to use it just arrived.  But its like half full. So im a bit annoyed.</li>
            <li> After getting my husband started using the moisturizer and face wash it was such a success with his sensitive skin. Now with the new mask I got him to try and I had to try it out myself it&#x27;s left both our faces feeling so smooth after rinsing. Best of all is how your skin looks the morning after wearing the mask. We loved how refreshing it felt while applying it, and how a little goes a long way around your face. Great product!</li>
            <li> such a great product!! I applied the clay to my face for the first time last night.  as soon as it started to dry i felt the product working its magic.  After rinsing it off, my skin felt so clean, clear and it didn&#x27;t make my face feel dry like most of the masks I use.  I don&#x27;t care that its for mens, it works so well on my face so well :) Oh and the packaging is rad! Super clean!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband, I had to do the mask with him in order for him to do it. LOL!  I myself will be using this mask again.  I&#x27;ve not used any type of clay mask for quite some years now and I am sold on using this one!  My pores were instantly smaller after rinsing of the mask, as were my husbands.  My face seemed brighter as well and was very smooth.  My husband will now use this mask without me having to force him as he loves it too, however I think I will make it a couples ritual for us.  :)</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great. After using, my face feels incredible.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I&#x27;ve never used this type of product before, but boy can I tell a difference! My skin feels clean and rejuvenated! I can highly recommend this to all the men out there.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but as some other reviewers have noted, arrives looking like its half full and unsealed.</li>
            <li> Wow! I rarely write reviews, but this is by far the best clay mask I have ever found.  My teenage son uses it and I am amazed at how fast it worked for him.  Really cleared up his complexion after using it just a few days, no kidding, this stuff removes everything. Great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of their facial moisturizer but this stuff is awesome. I can feel it taking all the impurities off of my face. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Never tried anything like this before. I can definitely see my pores shrinking and see my face is more clear.</li>
            <li> Great mask! Works great and recieved quickly! Add this to your once per week facial routine guys! Gets them pores cleaned out!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME. Huge fan of the whole line.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using R&amp;D&#x27;s other products and I really like them, I decided to give the face mask a try. After using it my face feels even more soft and clean. Highly recommended! I do HVAC work and my face get really dirty and that&#x27;s why I decided to start taking care of my face!</li>
            <li> Just tried this last night with my husband. For sure a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left it on longer than directed because we got sucked into our show on TV and I have to say that in the past when I&#x27;ve done any kind of clay mask my whole face feels crazy tight and it cracks like crazy. This one never felt that way. It dried out but it was never actually uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s face felt noticeably smoother and his complexion kind of evened out. He had been working in the sun and heat all day yesterday so he was pretty red and after we did the mask it didn&#x27;t seem as red so that was cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed it and my face FEELS better and smoother. Will be using this again for sure. Even if it is meant for boys. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: You&#x27;re welcome for the picture World of Amazon. Now go get your rugged and dapper on.</li>
            <li> Really nice mask for guys.  Nice texture and great that it&#x27;s fragrance free for sensitive skin.  It did well rebalancing the oiliness of my skin and clear my pores during these summer months.  Another nice touch is that the packaging has a second plastic lid which rests on top of the tub to prevent the mask from drying out or leaking if you throw it in your dopp kit.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a product like this. My acne has gone away and my pores are at a normal size now. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this weekly. Skin feels amazing after we rinse it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiancé because he likes to use my skincare line. He loves it! The Rugged &amp; Dapper products make his skin so soft and it smells intoxicating!</li>
            <li> My face felt so soft after ever use and with consistent use you can really see and feel the benefits. Applied the product is the most troublesome trying to get an &amp;#34;even&amp;#34; layer. An applicator would be awesome if included in the future!</li>
            <li> Bought this mask for my husband and now we both use once a week. He&#x27;s never been into taking care of his skin, but with this mask and the other R&amp;D products he can&#x27;t deny the difference it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I really love the whole line of products from Rugged &amp; Dapper. After using their products for a few months now my skin has improved a lot and the fact that these products are made with all natural ingredients, high in nutrition and without any chemicals or fragrances makes all the difference. I&#x27;m looking forward to future products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my husband going on this product line for a while now with great success. Now with this clay mask we&#x27;re going wild in the bathroom :) Im getting a kick out of doing the mask together but besides the fun of it it&#x27;s actually working! He gets dirt lodged in his pores constantly at work and this mask is really working its magic. It really feels wonderful after as well!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a men&#x27;s facial product. I was just one of those men that didn&#x27;t feel the need to use any kind of facial treatment. In fact I&#x27;ve never used anything but cheap bar soap on my face. Anyway, the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; packaging of this product jumped out at me and I read many great reviews of the product and decided to buy it. I received it in less than 2 days and was surprised at how large the case was! I thought, well at least I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth! I applied the treatment to my face and immediately could feel a soothing cleansing feeling on my skin. After I washed it off, my face felt lighter, cleaner and almost like it was able to assimilate oxygen better! I have a feeling that soap I use just clogs my pores! Thank you Rugged and Dapper!! I will absolutely be buying more of this when I run out. Great product.</li>
            <li> The packaging was very appealing to a man; it&#x27;s not feminine looking which is a plus. The smell was light and not over bearing. It made my husbands face feel very smooth. We would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I usually don&#x27;t have the patience to let a clay mask dry then try to scrub it off. This one is light so it goes on smooth, dries fast and is easy to wash off best part is how great my skin looks. Definitely recommend!</li>
