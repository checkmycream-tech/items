            <li>I have cut my families hair for many years.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these and am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t cut hair often, I thought a inexpensive scissor would be ok.</li>
            <li>These are much better and smooth, and I ended up using them on my husband!</li>
            <li>If you really want to cut your hair by your own, then don&#x27;t buy it any more.</li>
            <li>It also shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>works fine.</li>
            <li>Rather they were a cheap knockoff that could easily be sold at the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li>Just needed a pair of scissors to cut my babies hair and these are a bit smaller and worked great</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and these are SO much better than the nail scissors I used to use(!).  </li>
            <li>they did their job, but they aren&#x27;t anything special.</li>

            <li>These scissors are very convenient to use and are light.</li>
            <li>No snap or closure of any kind and actually inferior to a ziploc bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>what can I say good quality sharp</li>
            <li>The pair I got was pretty beat</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>first it&#x27;s packaging indicated made in Pakistan and on the scissors, it is engraved as made in Germany.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive and this scissors is nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>You certainly get what you pay for here-</li>
            <li>Cut is clean and the scissor &#x27;legs&#x27; are sturdy and seem to stay sharp and clean.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate these things.</li>
            <li>They were cheaply made and packaged and no different than a cheap pair of regular scissors.</li>
            <li>the handles and metal looks really old.</li>
            <li>I ordered these \\&quot;professional barber scissors\\&quot; based on the picture and reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like new but like a recycle trash,and its not sharp enough to cut any of my hair.</li>
            <li>These scissors are sharp and cut easily, but they have small finger holes.  </li>

            <li> they aren&#x27;t super sharp and they are small.</li>
            <li> These are a very sharp and precision pair of cutters ... Was tired of tracking down my mustache scissors all the time and simply purchased a better pair of scissors for my wife and all the things she needs them for.</li>
            <li> I use them all the time and even take them with me when I go out of the country for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> This product is strange-</li>
            <li> these scissors look like they were manufactured in the 80s and the seller found a hidden stash of them in the back of their closet.</li>
            <li> It is a pair of scissors as expected.</li>
            <li> plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> These cut well and are not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and I like to use them.</li>
            <li> They come in a little plastic pocket to store them in.</li>
            <li> I have needed a small pair of sharp scissors for quite awhile to help me in doing this.  </li>
            <li> This would not matter so much if the scissors did not lock up while cutting.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, you get what you pay for when it comes to haircutting scissors.</li>
            <li> These are flimsy, dull, hair caught in hinge, would return but not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, they are small, quality German-produced scissors.</li>
            <li> They do not work well for cutting hair, guess I&#x27;m going back to Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> it is just a thin plastic bag used for shipping-</li>
            <li> These scissors are terrible and are not sharp at all.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>

            <li> I cut my own hair and these are SO much better than the nail scissors I used to use(!).  Cut is clean and the scissor &#x27;legs&#x27; are sturdy and seem to stay sharp and clean.  No fuss, no muss.  I really appreciate these things.</li>
            <li> This is a good scissor to cut your hair or someone else&#x27;s at home. It is the same type of scissor professionals use. I used to go to beauty school and that&#x27;s how I know.</li>
            <li> The scissors I received were not like the ones pictured. They were cheaply made and packaged and no different than a cheap pair of regular scissors.</li>
            <li> good value.  works fine.</li>
            <li> Just needed a pair of scissors to cut my babies hair and these are a bit smaller and worked great</li>

            <li> they are just scissors. plain and simple.  they did their job, but they aren&#x27;t anything special. they aren&#x27;t super sharp and they are small. so its up to you, but if you are trying to do salon quality cuts, these arent the scissors for you</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors for the low price and good review comments.  After 2 haircuts, these scissors are still sharp and doing great.  I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have cut my families hair for many years.  I have needed a small pair of sharp scissors for quite awhile to help me in doing this.  I ordered these and am so glad that I did.  The scissors are perfect for my needs!.</li>
            <li> You certainly get what you pay for here- these scissors look like they were manufactured in the 80s and the seller found a hidden stash of them in the back of their closet. The pair I got was pretty beat up- the handles and metal looks really old. The \\&quot;storage pouch\\&quot; is an outright lie- it is just a thin plastic bag used for shipping- it is the same thickness as a ziploc bag. No snap or closure of any kind and actually inferior to a ziploc bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they work- they cut my hair well enough for trimming stray hairs/bangs, so I&#x27;ll rate it a 3 - definitely just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I use it to cut my bangs and it works alright. It was a good replacement for the scissors I used to use.</li>
            <li> It is a pair of scissors as expected. They are sharp and I like to use them. They arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I ordered these \\&quot;professional barber scissors\\&quot; based on the picture and reviews. What the company (610 Products) sent me was not the same scissors pictured. Rather they were a cheap knockoff that could easily be sold at the Dollar Store. Also, they did not come with a storage pouch. I will of course return them, but it&#x27;s a shame that companies try to pull a bait and switch. As always, it&#x27;s buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Totally happy with this product!  It exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone.  It also shipped very quickly.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and cut easily, but they have small finger holes.  They also have not been put together in the highest standards.  Blades rub together and do not move well.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t cut hair often, I thought a inexpensive scissor would be ok. Wrong! Don&#x27;t waste your money, you get what you pay for when it comes to haircutting scissors. These are flimsy, dull, hair caught in hinge, would return but not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> These are a very sharp and precision pair of cutters ... Was tired of tracking down my mustache scissors all the time and simply purchased a better pair of scissors for my wife and all the things she needs them for.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. Inexpensive and this scissors is nice and sharp. No pulling nose and ear hairs. Great on mustache too! Did the job for me.</li>
            <li> The item description states that you will receive a \\&quot;travel pouch.\\&quot; In reality, you&#x27;ll get a flimsy plastic bag like I received, not any sort of snapped travel container as I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they are small, quality German-produced scissors.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very convenient to use and are light. I will buy these again when needed. Excellent quality scissors.</li>
            <li> This product is strange- first it&#x27;s packaging indicated made in Pakistan and on the scissors, it is engraved as made in Germany.  This would not matter so much if the scissors did not lock up while cutting.  Not a quality product.  I also ordered Oster pet grooming shears for our standard poodle.  These are much better and smooth, and I ended up using them on my husband!</li>
