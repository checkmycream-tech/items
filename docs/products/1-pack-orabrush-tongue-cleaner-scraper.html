            <li>I gag easily so</li>
            <li>I finally gave in to buy this one at Walmart - it was a nice bright orange color.</li>
            <li>Not for people with a strong gag reflex...</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time with amazing results.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but TUNG brush worked better for me.</li>
            <li>It picks up more debris, comfortably and quickly.</li>
            <li>The tongue cleaner is great at getting the white stuff off your tongue.</li>

            <li>it makes my mouth feeling fresh :)</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I seriously consider this one of the best inventions in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>When my Orabrush came in the mail I was really excited.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and I will definitely be purchasing another later on :)</li>
            <li>Better then the first original one I had.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean as well as it would if it was bristles instead of silicone(like it has).</li>

            <li>This totally works my breath even feels fresher and when you brush ur tounge you see the gunk unlike a toothbrush on your tounge defenitaly worth the hype!!!!</li>

            <li>I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special to say.</li>
            <li>The first several passes felt great</li>
            <li>I got great results instantly after the first use.  </li>
            <li>will update this review if it doesn&#x27;t improve, but I would say if you should get it, just be a bit more gentle than I was.</li>
            <li>This made my tongue very sore, even after watching a video to make sure I was doing it correctly.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, doesn&#x27;t make me gag.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit surprising seeing the gunk from my tongue and having to go all the way to the back of my tongue .</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>keeps my tongue clean and fresh</li>
            <li>It would be nice to get my money back or a free Orabrush.</li>
            <li>sure others have left more in-depth reviews</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Great support amazon have had a problem charging me for free shipping and they fixed it and gave me back my money</li>
            <li>I have a pretty pink tongue now , lol.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic just what I needed will be ordering again thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>you have to put some effort into it, the tongue cleaner in the back of the toothbrush worked just as good as this, not need to buy this really.</li>
            <li>My breath has never felt so fresh</li>
            <li>Cleans your toung and let&#x27;s you breath stay fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I have had this for 4 months or so now and my breath is always fresh now.</li>
            <li>You will notice a difference in the way your mouth feels in regards to being fresh.</li>
            <li>Although I am almost certain it was my fault, they made it so as if it was their issue!</li>
            <li>It is soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I brushed very lightly and it still hurt.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have much to say, but that it does what it supposed to do, and that&#x27;s clean your tongue.</li>
            <li>(Not like I would know since my oral hygiene is stellar).</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think it would work at first.</li>
            <li>keeps my tongue nice and pink.</li>
            <li>I got the first Orabrush design that didn&#x27;t have the sides.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling fresh much longer than just brushing or mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Became aware of the Orabrush on youtube commercials years ago and have purchased about 3 over the years.</li>
            <li>I first saw this on a YouTube video</li>
            <li>i swear by this as it leaves my mouth feeling so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>I love this product overall .</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to clean my tongue completely</li>
            <li>Or that I need to be more gentle and not such an aggressive brusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>absolutely, just wish they were a little more accurate with the effectiveness of it.</li>
            <li>&quot; And the bristles in the brush are so soft, but strong &amp; sturdy enough to really clean your tongue.</li>
            <li>Within the first use my smelly breathe had gone away and my breathe felt much fresher.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li>BTW, I didn&#x27;t purchase the foam that you are supposed to use with it, but regular toothpaste works just fine.</li>
            <li>What helps with gagging is to hold your breath while cleaning the tongue and very minty toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>so I got a whole separate tongue brush for it.</li>
            <li>I really like the Orabrush scraper.  </li>
            <li>I was resistant to try it because I didnt think it could really get my tongue cleaner then</li>
            <li>My whole mouth felt cleaner immediately.</li>
            <li>better than I expected</li>
            <li>It clans the tongue so well and gently.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really all that is needed is one or two scrapes</li>
            <li>This really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li>I got this tongue cleaner because I had really smelly breathe.</li>
            <li>Really freshens the breath every morning.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in breath smell.</li>
            <li>and this really is a breakthrough for me .</li>
            <li>I really recommend this to everyone and anyone .</li>
            <li>- so i advise to split your cleaning area of your tongue into &amp;#34;thirds&amp;#34; (the long way) and then only go over the &amp;#34;thirds&amp;#34; once or twice at most!  </li>
            <li>Next time, I think I need to purchase the Orabrush Tongue Foam to clean my tongue.</li>
            <li>I use this for the roof of my mouth, as strange as it might sound.</li>
            <li>For under $5, it&#x27;s worth a shot and your social life will thank you.</li>
            <li>High quality merchandise.</li>
            <li>I am split on whether it is worth using in my daily routine or not.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different tongue brushes over the years, and so I wanted to try this one because it&#x27;s something new and has a fun appeal to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gad to see the new design have sides.</li>
            <li>New and improved.</li>
            <li>My tongue feels so clean and is clear pink after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The old fashioned plastic tongue scrapper does a lot better job than the orabrush bristles, It feels like its barely cleaning anything although the design does allow it to go a little deeper then</li>
            <li>but at least it cleans the tongue well, better than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and they all feel in love with it; I am yet to hear a complaint about it.</li>
            <li>Too soft to be of any use.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed one of these things until it became a part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely  say that I really do appreciate this product.</li>
            <li>This is my least favorite tongue scraper.  </li>
            <li>I got a blue one and it looks very sleek.</li>
            <li>Overall this product really works and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>this is the second time i am purchasing the orabrush it really works.</li>
            <li>This prouduct works very well, although it is very gross to see what comes off of your tongue</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li>Base on my own personal experience, I&#x27;ve always liked the orabrush ever since I was introduced to one.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, I used a spoon and put it at the back of my throat, brought it forward, and let it dry.</li>
            <li>I got a second one simply because I lost the first one.</li>
            <li>Made my tounge hurt, maybe i brushed too hard, i might update this if i get better use out of this.</li>
            <li>Plus I like the concept of a simple scraper, having used several now, as it is so easy to clean and it is difficult to &amp;</li>
            <li>This products works great for bad breath after brushing teeth.</li>
            <li>Hard to get overly excited by a tongue brush, but it works well.</li>
            <li>, it just gets the excess off, you&#x27;ll still have a natural amount of white left over.</li>
            <li>Someone using this with a sensitive gag reflex is pretty hard.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve found that it does a good job in controlling bad breath WHEN you incorporate in a program of brushing ur teeth with a essential-oil added tooth soap like Uncle Harry&#x27;s.)</li>

            <li> It was a bit surprising seeing the gunk from my tongue and having to go all the way to the back of my tongue .</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> keeps my tongue clean and fresh</li>
            <li> It would be nice to get my money back or a free Orabrush.</li>
            <li> sure others have left more in-depth reviews</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Great support amazon have had a problem charging me for free shipping and they fixed it and gave me back my money</li>
            <li> I have a pretty pink tongue now , lol.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic just what I needed will be ordering again thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> you have to put some effort into it, the tongue cleaner in the back of the toothbrush worked just as good as this, not need to buy this really.</li>
            <li> My breath has never felt so fresh</li>
            <li> Cleans your toung and let&#x27;s you breath stay fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 4 months or so now and my breath is always fresh now.</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference in the way your mouth feels in regards to being fresh.</li>
            <li> Although I am almost certain it was my fault, they made it so as if it was their issue!</li>
            <li> It is soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I brushed very lightly and it still hurt.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have much to say, but that it does what it supposed to do, and that&#x27;s clean your tongue.</li>
            <li> (Not like I would know since my oral hygiene is stellar).</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think it would work at first.</li>
            <li> keeps my tongue nice and pink.</li>
            <li> I got the first Orabrush design that didn&#x27;t have the sides.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling fresh much longer than just brushing or mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Became aware of the Orabrush on youtube commercials years ago and have purchased about 3 over the years.</li>
            <li> I first saw this on a YouTube video</li>
            <li> i swear by this as it leaves my mouth feeling so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> I love this product overall .</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to clean my tongue completely</li>
            <li> Or that I need to be more gentle and not such an aggressive brusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> absolutely, just wish they were a little more accurate with the effectiveness of it.</li>
            <li> &quot; And the bristles in the brush are so soft, but strong &amp; sturdy enough to really clean your tongue.</li>
            <li> Within the first use my smelly breathe had gone away and my breathe felt much fresher.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> BTW, I didn&#x27;t purchase the foam that you are supposed to use with it, but regular toothpaste works just fine.</li>
            <li> What helps with gagging is to hold your breath while cleaning the tongue and very minty toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> so I got a whole separate tongue brush for it.</li>
            <li> I really like the Orabrush scraper.  </li>
            <li> I was resistant to try it because I didnt think it could really get my tongue cleaner then</li>
            <li> My whole mouth felt cleaner immediately.</li>
            <li> better than I expected</li>
            <li> It clans the tongue so well and gently.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really all that is needed is one or two scrapes</li>
            <li> This really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> I got this tongue cleaner because I had really smelly breathe.</li>
            <li> Really freshens the breath every morning.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in breath smell.</li>
            <li> and this really is a breakthrough for me .</li>
            <li> I really recommend this to everyone and anyone .</li>
            <li> - so i advise to split your cleaning area of your tongue into &amp;#34;thirds&amp;#34; (the long way) and then only go over the &amp;#34;thirds&amp;#34; once or twice at most!  </li>
            <li> Next time, I think I need to purchase the Orabrush Tongue Foam to clean my tongue.</li>
            <li> I use this for the roof of my mouth, as strange as it might sound.</li>
            <li> For under $5, it&#x27;s worth a shot and your social life will thank you.</li>
            <li> High quality merchandise.</li>
            <li> I am split on whether it is worth using in my daily routine or not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different tongue brushes over the years, and so I wanted to try this one because it&#x27;s something new and has a fun appeal to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gad to see the new design have sides.</li>
            <li> New and improved.</li>
            <li> My tongue feels so clean and is clear pink after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The old fashioned plastic tongue scrapper does a lot better job than the orabrush bristles, It feels like its barely cleaning anything although the design does allow it to go a little deeper then</li>
            <li> but at least it cleans the tongue well, better than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and they all feel in love with it; I am yet to hear a complaint about it.</li>
            <li> Too soft to be of any use.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed one of these things until it became a part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely  say that I really do appreciate this product.</li>
            <li> This is my least favorite tongue scraper.  </li>
            <li> I got a blue one and it looks very sleek.</li>
            <li> Overall this product really works and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> this is the second time i am purchasing the orabrush it really works.</li>
            <li> This prouduct works very well, although it is very gross to see what comes off of your tongue</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li> Base on my own personal experience, I&#x27;ve always liked the orabrush ever since I was introduced to one.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, I used a spoon and put it at the back of my throat, brought it forward, and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I got a second one simply because I lost the first one.</li>
            <li> Made my tounge hurt, maybe i brushed too hard, i might update this if i get better use out of this.</li>
            <li> Plus I like the concept of a simple scraper, having used several now, as it is so easy to clean and it is difficult to &amp;</li>
            <li> This products works great for bad breath after brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> Hard to get overly excited by a tongue brush, but it works well.</li>
            <li> , it just gets the excess off, you&#x27;ll still have a natural amount of white left over.</li>
            <li> Someone using this with a sensitive gag reflex is pretty hard.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve found that it does a good job in controlling bad breath WHEN you incorporate in a program of brushing ur teeth with a essential-oil added tooth soap like Uncle Harry&#x27;s.)</li>
            <li> While I thought I understood the warning indicating that you should not brush too hard or you can damage your tongue, the first time I used it I learned that even if you brush very lightly - constantly doing it in the same spot can cause you to bleed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply another step to my oral hygiene that slows down an often busy time.</li>
            <li> It does not just eliminate bad breath, it also makes your tongue look more red and alive.</li>
            <li> Better than your average tongue scraper, just don&#x27;t scrape too hard or you&#x27;ll bleed a little.</li>
            <li> Once or twice a year Big Lots has single tungbrushes at about half price or less - In my book, $5 is too much to pay for ANY single tongue brush.</li>
            <li> long term customer and fan of oral health</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other ones whose bristles were either ineffective or way too stiff and painful...or whose blade was wavy (i.e., not consistent in touching the tongue) or way too hard and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty outstanding how unaware everyone is of the amount of nasty gunk that forms on tongue, specifically towards the back.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Please also know I have absolutely nothing to do with the company, nor do I even know anyone that works there, I just seriously like the product.</li>
            <li> This product works great, it gets on the disgusting white gunk off of your tongue.</li>
            <li> I use mine every single day and think that everyone should.</li>
            <li> The brush definitely made a visible improvement after a few days of use, not In a single stroke of the tongue like some videos like to suggest.</li>
            <li> the brush is to soft/ plastiquy feeling and feel like my tongue is not clean enough...</li>
            <li> I have found nothing better for getting rid of bad breath than this.</li>
            <li> I agree that a lot of bad breath comes from a dirty tongue and this tongue brush is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I thought the idea of a brush made sense but in truth it was not really of much help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s neither too wide nor too narrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Yeah it works in getting all the gunk off your tongue, but don&#x27;t expect it to make it completely pink</li>
            <li> As of a few months later I have yet to notice any difference in my breath or the appearance of my tongue in color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little obsessed about keeping my mouth clean, so when I saw these advertised on You Tube (&amp; could not find it in Walmart, anywhere), I ordered it here.</li>
            <li> Son used this everyday until it fell in the toilet.</li>
            <li> the other ones.</li>
            <li> I do have a hard time because I gag when I reach back</li>
            <li> It says on the back of the package, don&#x27;t brush too hard or it could hurt the tissues of your tongue.</li>
            <li> This one gets down between the tastebuds where the germs hide.</li>
            <li> It worked a little.</li>
            <li> Your basically scrapping your tongue with pointy little plastic pieces.</li>
            <li> or else I&#x27;ll feel dirty haha.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have one of this tongue cleaner, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, there is not a completion of one&#x27;s hygiene routine, if one doesn&#x27;t use this &amp;#34;fellow&amp;#34; tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> the crudd that gets left behind on a tongue, even after brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li> I will never live without one again!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I might have overdone it because today my tongue is very sensitive, I couldn&#x27;t use it today as a single pass was too painful and my tongue started bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since starting to use the Orabrush, I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic change in the way my mouth feels and even the color of my tongue.</li>
            <li> It mixes a brush w/ a scraper, &amp; it&#x27;s not as harsh as the usual tongue scraper that \\&quot;draws</li>
            <li> It really does help prevent bad breath.</li>
            <li> This thing will knock out your bad breath immediately and leaves you feeling ready to go.</li>
            <li> not sure that everybody would experience that.</li>
            <li> so I am not going to  go into very heavy detail, but</li>
            <li> I never liked the taste of toothpaste, and I felt like brushing my tongue didn&#x27;t really help with bad breath anyway.</li>
            <li> I really like it and think you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a hard tongue scraper before and it hurt my tongue.  </li>
            <li> This Orabrush will clear up bad breath 90% of the time.</li>
            <li> The gunk I mean.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to press the orabrush into your tongue, but just apply a VERY small bit of pressure and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as ergonomic as your average tooth brush and is very thin</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if you have bad breath I would recommend trying this as it does get stuff off your tongue even after you have already brushed it.</li>
            <li> Not good for tongue scrapper, is just like a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t see again, and I&#x27;m not happy about that.</li>
            <li> I have to admit , I was a bit skeptical to buy this , the youtube videos had me hooked though</li>
            <li> To me the idea of not using my Orabrush is just as disgusting as the idea of not using toilet paper.</li>
            <li> No more bad breath!!</li>
            <li> the shape is square which is not appropiate for your mouth (bad design)...</li>
            <li> Mouthwash destroys microbes and covers up bad breath.</li>
            <li> Orabrush doesn&#x27;t cover up bad breath; it eliminates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed like it would be helpful, but it does not help with bad breath.</li>
            <li> But I suffered from bad breath for a while</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with bad breath!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about bad breath anymore!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up with bad morning breath because of this tool and have made all my friends by it!</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all that nasty junk on your tongue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I don&#x27;t have terrible breath, but everyone has morning breath.</li>
            <li> the disgusting gook comes off your tongue and onto the orabrush.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Made my tounge hurt, maybe i brushed too hard, i might update this if i get better use out of this.</li>
            <li> i love this prduct after I&#x27;m done brushing my teeth and using this product I feel like my mouth is extreamly clean. I would definantly recomend it</li>
            <li> It makes me gag anyway but at least it cleans the tongue well, better than a toothbrush. I gag easily so not sure that everybody would experience that. What helps with gagging is to hold your breath while cleaning the tongue and very minty toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Cleans well!! It doesn&#x27;t clean as well as it would if it was bristles instead of silicone(like it has).</li>
            <li> this brush made me gag... the shape is square which is not appropiate for your mouth (bad design)... the brush is to soft/ plastiquy feeling and feel like my tongue is not clean enough... I have used the tung brush before and would recommend the tung brush over this one</li>
            <li> This products works great for bad breath after brushing teeth. It is easy to use and will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> When my Orabrush came in the mail I was really excited. I don&#x27;t know what was about this tongue cleaner and its promises for better oral hygiene but it had me almost gleeful as I went to the bathroom sink to try it out. The first several passes felt great, my tongue felt warm from all the bristles cleaning away and my tongue felt softer in a way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I might have overdone it because today my tongue is very sensitive, I couldn&#x27;t use it today as a single pass was too painful and my tongue started bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this might improve overtime as my tongue gets used to it. Sort of like how your gums need to get used to flossing if you haven&#x27;t done it in a while. (Not like I would know since my oral hygiene is stellar). Or that I need to be more gentle and not such an aggressive brusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if it doesn&#x27;t improve, but I would say if you should get it, just be a bit more gentle than I was.</li>
            <li> I decided to add tongue scrapers to my oral regimen and bought several to see what worked best. I thought the idea of a brush made sense but in truth it was not really of much help. I felt that the impulse to scrape your tongue with a brush could be overdone and even irritate the tongue. Plus I like the concept of a simple scraper, having used several now, as it is so easy to clean and it is difficult to &amp;#34;over do it&amp;#34; with a simpler device. Not bad but I think a simple scraper is the best way to go.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. High quality merchandise.</li>
            <li> Base on my own personal experience, I&#x27;ve always liked the orabrush ever since I was introduced to one. I don&#x27;t like brushing my tongue with my toothbrush because the tongue itself have a lot of bacteria so I got a whole separate tongue brush for it. My tongue always feel nice and clean after I brush it. I only use the orabrush tongue cleaner, without the tongue foam.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt and everything washes off easily! Clean your tongue in under a minute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always use my electric toothbrush to brush my tongue, but now I use this after brushing my tongue.  It&#x27;s even more effective.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and works amazing</li>
            <li> you have to put some effort into it, the tongue cleaner in the back of the toothbrush worked just as good as this, not need to buy this really.</li>
            <li> Son used this everyday until it fell in the toilet. I hope to buy more!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. It does not just eliminate bad breath, it also makes your tongue look more red and alive. It is simply AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got the stuff. well it takes it away. The gunk I mean. You know, on my Tongue! way to go orabrush.</li>
            <li> Never leave home without it. My breath has never felt so fresh I&#x27;m loving the way I feel as well as My tongue being totally clean.</li>
            <li> I really like the Orabrush scraper.  My tongue feels so clean and is clear pink after use.&lt;br /&gt;I feel it&#x27;s an additional health helper over and above brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Love it! It really does help prevent bad breath.</li>
            <li> This tongue cleaner is gentle on the tongue and very effective.  I&#x27;ve tried other ones whose bristles were either ineffective or way too stiff and painful...or whose blade was wavy (i.e., not consistent in touching the tongue) or way too hard and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s neither too wide nor too narrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Goldilocks said, &amp;#34;this one is just right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This Orabrush will clear up bad breath 90% of the time. It is definitely a hygiene item every person should have</li>
            <li> Not for people with a strong gag reflex...</li>
            <li> It was okay but I thought I got a similar tongue cleansing with just my toothbrush. It&#x27;s simply another step to my oral hygiene that slows down an often busy time.</li>
            <li> keeps my tongue clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I was resistant to try it because I didnt think it could really get my tongue cleaner then a toothbrush but the difference is like night and day. My whole mouth felt cleaner immediately. I will forever use this product.</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered 2 and only got 1 Orabrush.  It would be nice to get my money back or a free Orabrush.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this. I just replaced mine and it does what it claims. Gets rid of all that nasty junk on your tongue. No more bad breath!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush and will always re-order it. Try it you&#x27;ll like it. I guarantee it. Do it now.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised :)</li>
            <li> long term customer and fan of oral health</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t use this on my tongue, I use the Dr Tung Scraper. I use this for the roof of my mouth, as strange as it might sound. It makes my mouth feel cleaner, so I like it.</li>
            <li> This was the one that works the best for me.  I really like it and think you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The tongue cleaner is great at getting the white stuff off your tongue. I use it everyday and it is definitely noticeable. I&#x27;ve given it to family and friends and they all feel in love with it; I am yet to hear a complaint about it.</li>
            <li> Use it regularly - helps eliminate odors.</li>
            <li> Well designed and does a good job of keeping my tongue so fresh and so clean. All the ladies be lining up to receive kisses. The freshness of my breath is so turnt up. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> better than I expected</li>
            <li> Works fantastic just what I needed will be ordering again thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> This made my tongue very sore, even after watching a video to make sure I was doing it correctly. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The brush definitely made a visible improvement after a few days of use, not In a single stroke of the tongue like some videos like to suggest. Would I buy it again? absolutely, just wish they were a little more accurate with the effectiveness of it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It clans the tongue so well and gently. It is very easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> Too soft to be of any use.  I have used a firm toothbrush as a tongue brush for some time and it works very well.  I will stick with it.</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed one of these things until it became a part of my daily routine.  It&#x27;s pretty outstanding how unaware everyone is of the amount of nasty gunk that forms on tongue, specifically towards the back.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is 100% effective and is pretty safe and easy to use once you get the hang of it.  While I thought I understood the warning indicating that you should not brush too hard or you can damage your tongue, the first time I used it I learned that even if you brush very lightly - constantly doing it in the same spot can cause you to bleed - so i advise to split your cleaning area of your tongue into &amp;#34;thirds&amp;#34; (the long way) and then only go over the &amp;#34;thirds&amp;#34; once or twice at most!  That&#x27;s really all that is needed is one or two scrapes and everything is taken care off.  You get to see the results for yourself instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure others have left more in-depth reviews so I am not going to  go into very heavy detail, but I will definitely  say that I really do appreciate this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little obsessed about keeping my mouth clean, so when I saw these advertised on You Tube (&amp; could not find it in Walmart, anywhere), I ordered it here. I love it so much I will be ordering more for my family. It mixes a brush w/ a scraper, &amp; it&#x27;s not as harsh as the usual tongue scraper that \\&quot;draws blood.\\&quot; And the bristles in the brush are so soft, but strong &amp; sturdy enough to really clean your tongue. BTW, I didn&#x27;t purchase the foam that you are supposed to use with it, but regular toothpaste works just fine.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special to say. It works quite well.</li>
            <li> Honestly, everyone needs an orabrush tongue cleaner and scraper. This thing will knock out your bad breath immediately and leaves you feeling ready to go.</li>
            <li> The old fashioned plastic tongue scrapper does a lot better job than the orabrush bristles, It feels like its barely cleaning anything although the design does allow it to go a little deeper then the other ones. I would still get the G-U-M Fresh-R Tongue Cleaner as my preferred tongue cleaner</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have one of this tongue cleaner, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing. I just love it. I went on to buy one for my mother, and one for my son also. There was some issue with the address to which this item was delivered. Although I am almost certain it was my fault, they made it so as if it was their issue! My God! The customer service this distributor has in incredibly GOOD! I have been not just recommending this tongue cleaner, but telling everyone how good this tool works. In my humble opinion, there is not a completion of one&#x27;s hygiene routine, if one doesn&#x27;t use this &amp;#34;fellow&amp;#34; tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li> Its not as great as people really say it is. It scrubs my tongue and gets rid of bacteria for not 12 hours as they say it will... but only for about 20 minutes then my breath smells again.. the only way for me to fix this is if i combine a tongue scrubber with listerine pocketpaks to kill of any extra bacteria i missed. thats the only way this works for me</li>
            <li> It even came with the foam even though I did order it which made me even more happy about it. Great support amazon have had a problem charging me for free shipping and they fixed it and gave me back my money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different tongue brushes over the years, and so I wanted to try this one because it&#x27;s something new and has a fun appeal to it. I finally gave in to buy this one at Walmart - it was a nice bright orange color. Let&#x27;s just say that&#x27;s $4.50 I won&#x27;t see again, and I&#x27;m not happy about that. The bristles on this brush are pointy but flimsy and short with picking up tongue debris. I had to keep repeating the sweeping motions because I didn&#x27;t see enough debris being picked up (and u can see it because it grabs it on the top), and then it made my tongue bleed from all that! I used it twice and threw it out. I&#x27;m back to using my Tungbrush. It picks up more debris, comfortably and quickly. (I&#x27;ve found that it does a good job in controlling bad breath WHEN you incorporate in a program of brushing ur teeth with a essential-oil added tooth soap like Uncle Harry&#x27;s.) Once or twice a year Big Lots has single tungbrushes at about half price or less - In my book, $5 is too much to pay for ANY single tongue brush.</li>
            <li> Best toung scraper ever!!! Cleans your toung and let&#x27;s you breath stay fresh all day. Would recommend to anyone with bad breath!</li>
            <li> I had a hard tongue scraper before and it hurt my tongue.  This one gets down between the tastebuds where the germs hide.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 4 months or so now and my breath is always fresh now. Always.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think it would work at first. i thought my toothbrush could do the same job. but surprise to me, this product is great, it really cleans ur tongue well!</li>
            <li> This is my least favorite tongue scraper.  It is too soft to remove everything which forces me to press harder and gag. There are better tongue cleaners out there.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, doesn&#x27;t make me gag.  It arrived with a sample tongue cleaner that was very nice.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the wonderful ads on youtube I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Yeah it works in getting all the gunk off your tongue, but don&#x27;t expect it to make it completely pink, it just gets the excess off, you&#x27;ll still have a natural amount of white left over.</li>
            <li> Definitely the only tongue cleaner I&#x27;ll ever buy, it&#x27;s actually impressively gentle and effective</li>
            <li> This totally works my breath even feels fresher and when you brush ur tounge you see the gunk unlike a toothbrush on your tounge defenitaly worth the hype!!!!</li>
            <li> Hard to get overly excited by a tongue brush, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Better than your average tongue scraper, just don&#x27;t scrape too hard or you&#x27;ll bleed a little. I can&#x27;t go a day without scrubbing my tongue anymore or else I&#x27;ll feel dirty haha. This really gets the job done. Now if only I could find an Oratoothbrush...</li>
            <li> I bought 2 orabrushes and they both don&#x27;t have a scraper just the bristles or what ever you call them. But anyway it doesn&#x27;t take anything off. So it doesn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> Someone using this with a sensitive gag reflex is pretty hard. I assumed that it would make my tongue spotless of any white bacteria but some remains. It&#x27;s really good though, it gets most of the gunk that&#x27;s stuck on your tongue.</li>
            <li> keeps my tongue nice and pink.</li>
            <li> I got great results instantly after the first use.  This product is awesome and I will definitely be purchasing another later on :)</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have much to say, but that it does what it supposed to do, and that&#x27;s clean your tongue. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Orabrushes are great. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I do, I notice a cleaner mouth. I agree that a lot of bad breath comes from a dirty tongue and this tongue brush is the best on the market. I got the first Orabrush design that didn&#x27;t have the sides. It only had a back, which didn&#x27;t collect all of the ... stuff. I&#x27;m gad to see the new design have sides. I believe you will get a random color; however, you might be able to request a specific color. I got a blue one and it looks very sleek. It&#x27;s as ergonomic as your average tooth brush and is very thin so you don&#x27;t choke yourself. The foam is optional - it&#x27;s not like toothpaste - you don&#x27;t need it (I don&#x27;t use the tongue foam). I got a second one simply because I lost the first one. For under $5, it&#x27;s worth a shot and your social life will thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product... Love the cleanse</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I seriously consider this one of the best inventions in my lifetime. I use mine every single day and think that everyone should. I&#x27;ve even bought them for friends that had never heard of them. To me the idea of not using my Orabrush is just as disgusting as the idea of not using toilet paper. These are a must when it comes to hygiene. Don&#x27;t be gross people! Please also know I have absolutely nothing to do with the company, nor do I even know anyone that works there, I just seriously like the product.</li>
            <li> I got this tongue cleaner because I had really smelly breathe. Within the first use my smelly breathe had gone away and my breathe felt much fresher. I do have a hard time because I gag when I reach back but after a couple days it gets better. Overall this product really works and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good tongue cleaner. I would recommend it,and would purchase it again as long as it doesn&#x27;t cost more then $5!:)</li>
            <li> I have found nothing better for getting rid of bad breath than this. Leaves your mouth feeling fresh much longer than just brushing or mouthwash.</li>
            <li> After hearing about the Orabrush Tongue Cleaner Scraper, I decided to order this product and give it a try. It worked a little. Most of the time, my tongue would bleed. Next time, I think I need to purchase the Orabrush Tongue Foam to clean my tongue.</li>
            <li> As of a few months later I have yet to notice any difference in my breath or the appearance of my tongue in color.</li>
            <li> Once you start using the Orabrush, you will never go back. I never liked the taste of toothpaste, and I felt like brushing my tongue didn&#x27;t really help with bad breath anyway. Since starting to use the Orabrush, I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic change in the way my mouth feels and even the color of my tongue. I don&#x27;t worry about bad breath anymore! Everyone should have an Orabrush!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tongue cleaner. It is soft and easy to use. Bought another for my friend.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Will purchase again.  Became aware of the Orabrush on youtube commercials years ago and have purchased about 3 over the years.</li>
            <li> this is the second time i am purchasing the orabrush it really works. it has become part of my daily brushing routine. i use it every day and i cant imagine living without one. it makes my mouth feeling fresh :)</li>
            <li> This prouduct works very well, although it is very gross to see what comes off of your tongue</li>
            <li> Really freshens the breath every morning.</li>
            <li> I bought a tongue scrapper at the dollar store and it worked better than this. This scrapper didn&#x27;t remove anything and it made my tongue sore. It says on the back of the package, don&#x27;t brush too hard or it could hurt the tissues of your tongue. I brushed very lightly and it still hurt. Your basically scrapping your tongue with pointy little plastic pieces. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It seems to work but I cant tell how well.  I have never had any complaints about breath and I haven&#x27;t gotten any since using this, but it does seem to get some stuff off your tongue.  I am split on whether it is worth using in my daily routine or not.  HOWEVER, if you have bad breath I would recommend trying this as it does get stuff off your tongue even after you have already brushed it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Better then the first original one I had. New and improved.</li>
            <li> Best tongue scraper I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It feels and looks like your tongue is cleaner.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in breath smell.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Great idea!  This is preferred for tongue cleaning rather than toothbrush or scraper.</li>
            <li> I will never live without one again!!!!! Ewww, I had no idea the crudd that gets left behind on a tongue, even after brushing teeth.  I have a pretty pink tongue now , lol.</li>
            <li> I first saw this on a YouTube video and I&#x27;m surprised. It delivered and met all of my requirements.  It did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but TUNG brush worked better for me.</li>
            <li> i swear by this as it leaves my mouth feeling so much cleaner! I don&#x27;t wake up with bad morning breath because of this tool and have made all my friends by it!</li>
            <li> I ran into the Orabrush on Youtube, and I must say, it does work! It really is incredible HOW well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I don&#x27;t have terrible breath, but everyone has morning breath. The Orabrush takes all of the stinky food smell that was on your tongue, and yes, IN your tongue off. You don&#x27;t need to press the orabrush into your tongue, but just apply a VERY small bit of pressure and (pardon the graphic description) boom! the disgusting gook comes off your tongue and onto the orabrush. The very first time I used it, I used a spoon and put it at the back of my throat, brought it forward, and let it dry. This is what they(the youtube video) recommended you do before and after using the orabrush, and I&#x27;m not exaggerating. My breath didn&#x27;t smell at all after I used the orabrush!! Truly a remarkable product if you&#x27;re one of those people who no one sits by at work because your breath smells like a opossum died in your mouth. Mouthwash destroys microbes and covers up bad breath. It just prolongs the problem. Orabrush doesn&#x27;t cover up bad breath; it eliminates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET IT!</li>
            <li> This product works great, it gets on the disgusting white gunk off of your tongue. It also makes your breath smell soo good! Love it!</li>
            <li> Not good for tongue scrapper, is just like a tooth brush. I regrate buying it, i which i can have my money back.</li>
            <li> Not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. It seemed like it would be helpful, but it does not help with bad breath.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to clean my tongue completely but when I used it nothing happened. But I still use it after brushing my teeth and tongue with my toothbrush</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but durable and do a great job scraping the tongue. You will notice a difference in the way your mouth feels in regards to being fresh.</li>
            <li> I started to use as directed and just makes my mouth feel cleaner! Not a noticeable difference in breath smell.</li>
            <li> I have to admit , I was a bit skeptical to buy this , the youtube videos had me hooked though and I bought this anyway . I used it for the first time with amazing results. It was a bit surprising seeing the gunk from my tongue and having to go all the way to the back of my tongue . But I suffered from bad breath for a while and this really is a breakthrough for me . I really recommend this to everyone and anyone . It&#x27;s really simple to use. It&#x27;s gentle bristles were incredible at doing it&#x27;s job . I love this product overall .</li>
