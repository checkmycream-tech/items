            <li> but this conditioner leaves my hair with body and not looking flat.</li>
            <li> well and isn&#x27;t flat.</li>
            <li> But even twice does&#x27;t excessively dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> Second time washing, lots of lather and your hair will be a little dryer cleaner.</li>
            <li> It really adds body to my thin hair but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> The reason why I&#x27;m giving this a poor review is because I&#x27;m not sure the product I received is a true Eufora shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> It feels different than other conditioners so it takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Used with the shampoo and this also left hair lifeless and dull.</li>
            <li> Not worth even 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> Doesnt weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner will leave your hair shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a genuine Eufora product.</li>
            <li> (i used to wash my hair everyday because it would get greasy looking).  </li>
            <li> my hair is a bit tough to comb through</li>
            <li> I believe this is a fake.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is difficult to run through my hair.</li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser, but almost twice was expensive at the hairdresser&#x27;s salon!</li>
            <li> ; I am extremely disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great conditioner I have been using for years. Doesnt weigh down hair. I have medium hair and tends to be oily easily. Also, smells great has a mint smell to it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic, keeps my hair hydrated and from drying out from blow dryer and flat iron</li>
            <li> Worth the money. A little goes a long way. It does a great job of adding moisture, softness, shine.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. I like having the pump. If you only wash your hair once, you may not get a lot of lather. Your hair will come out soft and clean. Second time washing, lots of lather and your hair will be a little dryer cleaner. I have fine hair so washing once is enough. But even twice does&#x27;t excessively dry my hair out. Great product. You don&#x27;t need as much conditioner because you sren&#x27;t stripping the batural oils from your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner for everyday use.  It doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair like so many other conditioners.  It leaves your hair soft, yet manageable.  I think it&#x27;s the perfect product.</li>
            <li> light and rinses clean, but not super conditioning/detangling... my hair is a bit tough to comb through</li>
            <li> I believe this is a fake. As I said, I am going to check with the manufacturer. Just tried them both. I was not out of product until now and it is &amp;#34;past time for returns ----- 30 days!&amp;#34; I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This conditioner will leave your hair shiny without weighing it down. It works great on fine hair and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes a real difference on how my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Came new and unopened. Totally transformed my hair. Nice smell to it also. Doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals at all for the great difference it gave to my hair. Fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> smells great and works great too! No complaints. Will always use this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;might not be good for some one with overly greasy/oily hair.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I have ever used.  It smells so good and leaves your hair soft and shiny.  I also love the fact that it is made with mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> As i have said before i live in the desert &amp; need all the moisture i can get for my hair. This conditioner was recommended from my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!! It really adds body to my thin hair but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. It looks and feels good all day. At a great price compared to salon prices.</li>
            <li> It smells good, however I have fine hair and it&#x27;s still not moisturizing enough for me.  I love the Hydrating Shampoo... so I hope they make a good hydrating conditioner to go with that!</li>
            <li> FAKE! The product looks like the real one but contents inside are not the real thing. Not worth even 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is not the same quality that is sold in salons. Definitely not a genuine Eufora product.</li>
            <li> the conditioner to go with the eufora shampoo is the best combination. get both and you will be happy, happy, happy.</li>
            <li> Received item as stated. I love the conditioner but can&#x27;t get pump on top to work.</li>
            <li> Eufora was recommended to me since I have very fine hair. The product is very nice - not a heavy scent, and provides conditioning without being too heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li> Make your hair soft ,sleeky,and manageable. Everyone should use this product for this reason. The price should be lower . What do you think?</li>
            <li> My hair stylist introduced me to Eufora products and I absolutely love them even better than that I swear by them. My hair is really picky with shampoos and when I used a Eufora product I noticed the difference immediately. My hair was softer, shinier, easy to style and my hair actually started growing which I was thrilled because my hair seemed to grow very slowly before.  I actually moved to a state that doesnt have any salons that sell Eufora so I looked around and was happy to see the products being sold here and cheaper than retail price almost $20. The reason why I&#x27;m giving this a poor review is because I&#x27;m not sure the product I received is a true Eufora shampoo &amp; conditioner. Im skeptical about it because the products smell different and because all the good things i mentioned before are unseen. My hair doesnt feel soft, its not shiny and since I&#x27;ve started using these products my hair has been falling off alot. I never complain but I think if your going to sell Eufora products it should be the real deal.</li>
            <li> I like that the product is cruelty free and made in the U.S.A. I have fine hair that tends to get weighed down by other product but this conditioner leaves my hair with body and not looking flat. It feels different than other conditioners so it takes a little getting used to (It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling silky or detangled). But it works and I&#x27;m buying three more bottles.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> I love the feel ot this conditioner because it&#x27;s light. I have fine hair, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> great product, only use a tiny amount! Recommended by my hairdresser, but almost twice was expensive at the hairdresser&#x27;s salon!</li>
            <li> The product smells nothing like what I received at the actual salon. It dries out my hair each time I wash it, and I wash my hair about twice a week. The conditioner is difficult to run through my hair.</li>
            <li> Used with the shampoo and this also left hair lifeless and dull. Unimpressed.</li>
            <li> Not the best at de-tangling, but it smells great and with fine hair, I appreciate that my hair styles well and isn&#x27;t flat.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner along with the shampoo and think it&#x27;s the best thing out there.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Eufora by my hair stylist about 6 years ago and haven&#x27;t used anything else since.  My hair always feels clean and one wash will last days (i used to wash my hair everyday because it would get greasy looking).  The price might be higher then  the store brand but it lasts forever, I can get almost a year of washes out of one bottle.</li>
