            <li>I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>something I wasn&#x27;t sure would ever happen for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s love it for their flyaways.</li>
            <li>I found that if you straighten the relaxed hair it works better.</li>
            <li>BUT most hair is manageable when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Its great for the winter and fall time, not to much for the summer to me.</li>
            <li>It is just okay.</li>
            <li>so we can assume that they are being enjoyed.</li>
            <li>So this Mimosa Hair honey is like a healthy scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so satisfied with results.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I ended up returning the product because I found better and more cost-effective alternative for myself.</li>
            <li>now i love the loc butter to i</li>
            <li>I had used some of Carol daughter things and enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of her products because everyone loves them</li>
            <li>Love this stuff it keeps my hair moisturize.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a fizz tamer that works better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of the smell, but others told me that it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>My curls are now incredibly consistent, soft (not crunchy), and my hair smells delicious!</li>
            <li>The product smells good but makes your hair look and feel really greasy.</li>
            <li>It arrives as pictured and has a strong citrusy scent that reminded me of orange juice and lemon concentrate.</li>
            <li>First of all, the texture is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter, 4 oz.]] does absolute wonders for my hair!!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re so light that my hair curled tighter and shrunk shorter than it ever has before--</li>
            <li>When I wake up, most of the product has been absorbed by my scalp and hair follicles, but there still is some greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell and frizz control.</li>
            <li>Light weight product&lt;</li>
            <li>I sometimes will use just a touch with the hair balm and my hair stays frizz free and moisturized for days.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It provides a light coat on my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it too greasy.</li>
            <li>Mimosa Hair Honey made me nauseous, light headed, and dizzy</li>
            <li>This one smells really good, isn&#x27;t overpowering for my fragrance sensitive allergies.</li>
            <li>It keeps the hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>This pomade is a very light oil almost as light and fast absorbing as rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li>I only need to gently glide my finger over the top and smooth it on my hair for a very nice shine.  </li>
            <li>but it was completely worth it!</li>
            <li>I like to use it as a last-step sealant pomade on my ends on clean damp hair after using a leave in moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but so far I love this product!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t find anything special about this product.  </li>
            <li>I realized the problem and now have an almost full jar I plan to toss out.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a full two inches shorter now than it was 24 hours ago.  </li>
            <li>Full of oils and BEESWAX.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product for us.</li>
            <li>My hair is super frizzy and this does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I read through comments on their website about how this product smells great like citrus without a lingering musty smell that comes from black hair products.</li>
            <li>I love it, it softens my hair prior to styling and it makes it easy to detangle during styling.</li>
            <li>i used this product some time ago, I wear my hair mostly in set, it kept my hair moist and my stylist always complemented on how soft my hair was.</li>
            <li>buy many Carols daughter products because they work!&lt;br /&gt;2)the product is all natural</li>
            <li>I use Wen to wash my hair but wanted more mioterizer but something not heavy on my hair</li>
            <li>Also I had a lot of success using this product as a mask and watching it out.</li>
            <li>right after I washed it???</li>
            <li>put it on my braids right before I unbraided</li>
            <li>If you notice a burning sensation stop using right away</li>
            <li>But for   right now I like it.</li>
            <li>so I treated them with this product right after washing ...sort of like a hot oil treatment.  </li>
            <li>Great shine but moisture only last for one day using the recommend amount.</li>
            <li>Great for African American hair .</li>
            <li>Other than that it a great natural ingredient product.</li>
            <li>when she first tried it, I jumped on board.  </li>
            <li>So when I first started using it</li>
            <li>I also had the spray scalp oil and upon my first use of that I felt a sort of burning sensation on my scalp...</li>
            <li>But I found a workaround for the greasy issue, for those who are interested:</li>
            <li>Love this product; I have purchase this from Amazon.com on several occasions.</li>
            <li>I have used it almost daily for well over a year, one 8 oz jar, and i&#x27;m just ordering more today.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed her products more when she was in small storefront in Brooklyn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have the residue you get with other products.</li>
            <li>First things first, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of this.  </li>
            <li>But my experiences were still positive; maybe this will help someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However there was a certain musty smell that came from using it continuously.</li>
            <li>This product not only has healthy ingredients but does exactly what it says, mositurizes my natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li>Great shine and moisture but last less than a day.</li>
            <li>particular product works great, as several other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li>If you have fine or straight hair, these products will likely be too much for you.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like Carol&#x27;s daughter products</li>
            <li>yeah, really?&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and my 4a hair seemed to like it.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>Does not create softness and/or make more manageable unless the hair is wet</li>
            <li>Not much of a difference, I feel as though the mimosa honey protects hair more because of the beeswax.</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this product for any woman who needs only light moisture coverage to keep her hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase because I don&#x27;t like spending so much on hair products</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use that much of it.</li>
            <li>I am an older guy, whitish straight hair.</li>
            <li>The same is true for all Carol&#x27;s daughter products.</li>
            <li>Not enough true hair moisture.</li>
            <li>I washed and conditioned by older daughter&#x27;s hair and applied this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those that have a lot of unwieldy hair.  </li>
            <li>BUT if you have curly hair that is often unmanageable I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The top is a little harden and must be penetrated.</li>
            <li>My scalp is no longer dry, and my hair is significantly softer in part because of it</li>
            <li>The initial sticker price was a shock to the wallet, but it is worth every dime.</li>
            <li>a person with extremely dry hair this product has a great shine and moisture but last less than a day.</li>
            <li>my sister stole my jar so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying a new one.</li>
            <li>I dont think you should use it for styling purposes, maybe on your scalp but not to much on your hair because it will most likely weight it down.</li>
            <li>add this in and wow!  </li>
            <li>I switched to As I Am products, first trying their Double Moisturizer Butter and settling on their Twist Defining Cream.</li>
            <li>My brother uses this on his natural hair and it moisturizes and makes his hair very soft.</li>
            <li>and they came out soft and shiny with no frizz.</li>
            <li>Manageable natural hair that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Only recommend this product for relaxed hair,if you really want to spend that much on hair dressing when you can get the same effect with a lower costing hair dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it lasts all day and it give you a natural looking style.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a product that will keep my hair moisturize and I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years.</li>
            <li>However it does keep my hair shiny and soft, but also greasy</li>
            <li>Since I have never used this product, I am rating it based on my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li>I am recommending this product to anyone and everyone who is natural.</li>
            <li>I use as a twist loc because I don&#x27;t use gel on my hair and my hair was so shiny and soft and kept its hold.</li>
            <li>My hair is considerably healthier and longer.</li>
            <li>I bought it over a year ago as part of a natural program I was doing, and just ran out.</li>
            <li>This product completely transformed my hair in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR TYPE:&lt;br /&gt;1)I have naturally wavy/straight</li>
            <li>I was looking for a pomade to do an old fashioned twist out with just &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; and I got the hold of a hair butter without the softness.</li>
            <li>It did not give me the soft definition I was using it for.</li>
            <li>If you have natural hair be cautious when using this product because of the chemical reaction and after smell.</li>
            <li>I use it on top of a moisturizer to add extra shine and tame my hair.</li>
            <li>I have also tried it on dry hair and it still works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Love this-a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>For African American 4b hair, it is a perfect scalp &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; - reminds me of the soothing/moisturizing grease of the 90s before grease (w/Petroleum) was deemed bad.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much so the jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>That being said I don&#x27;t think this product would be well suited for anyone with fine or thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li>have a thick head of fine 3c4a kinky</li>
            <li>buy this all natural high quality product that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>My original honey jar lasted several years and it still has half of it left.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a recent convert to the Curly Girl no shampoo method, and I&#x27;ve replaced my silicone-based hair products with natural ones from Carol&#x27;s Daughter.  </li>
            <li>KIND OF EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li>but if you try it on wet frizzy hair to will stay un-frizzy until your hair is dried and you will need to use alot more of the product than recommend for it last.</li>
            <li>Her hair is natural and she swears this is the only product that lays it down nicely when she wants to pull it back in a ponytail (this hair honey apparently keeps it laying down flat for the entire day, as opposed to other products we have tried that caused her hair to frizz at some point during the day).</li>
            <li>they are rich (not watered down) and so will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can already see that this honey is going to last me many months even though I have very thick, curly hair that requires a lot of product.</li>
            <li>Its been a long journey with my natural transition.</li>
            <li>It also smooths the hair down along the hairline for a much neater</li>
            <li>instead of buying a drug store hair moisturizer that is watered down and wont really work.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little of this product to really make my hair shine and behave.</li>

            <li> so we can assume that they are being enjoyed.</li>
            <li> So this Mimosa Hair honey is like a healthy scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning the product because I found better and more cost-effective alternative for myself.</li>
            <li> now i love the loc butter to i</li>
            <li> I had used some of Carol daughter things and enjoyed them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of her products because everyone loves them</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it keeps my hair moisturize.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a fizz tamer that works better.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of the smell, but others told me that it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> My curls are now incredibly consistent, soft (not crunchy), and my hair smells delicious!</li>
            <li> The product smells good but makes your hair look and feel really greasy.</li>
            <li> It arrives as pictured and has a strong citrusy scent that reminded me of orange juice and lemon concentrate.</li>
            <li> First of all, the texture is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter, 4 oz.]] does absolute wonders for my hair!!</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re so light that my hair curled tighter and shrunk shorter than it ever has before--</li>
            <li> When I wake up, most of the product has been absorbed by my scalp and hair follicles, but there still is some greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell and frizz control.</li>
            <li> Light weight product&lt;</li>
            <li> I sometimes will use just a touch with the hair balm and my hair stays frizz free and moisturized for days.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It provides a light coat on my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it too greasy.</li>
            <li> Mimosa Hair Honey made me nauseous, light headed, and dizzy</li>
            <li> This one smells really good, isn&#x27;t overpowering for my fragrance sensitive allergies.</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> This pomade is a very light oil almost as light and fast absorbing as rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li> I only need to gently glide my finger over the top and smooth it on my hair for a very nice shine.  </li>
            <li> but it was completely worth it!</li>
            <li> I like to use it as a last-step sealant pomade on my ends on clean damp hair after using a leave in moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but so far I love this product!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find anything special about this product.  </li>
            <li> I realized the problem and now have an almost full jar I plan to toss out.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a full two inches shorter now than it was 24 hours ago.  </li>
            <li> Full of oils and BEESWAX.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product for us.</li>
            <li> My hair is super frizzy and this does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I read through comments on their website about how this product smells great like citrus without a lingering musty smell that comes from black hair products.</li>
            <li> I love it, it softens my hair prior to styling and it makes it easy to detangle during styling.</li>
            <li> i used this product some time ago, I wear my hair mostly in set, it kept my hair moist and my stylist always complemented on how soft my hair was.</li>
            <li> buy many Carols daughter products because they work!&lt;br /&gt;2)the product is all natural</li>
            <li> I use Wen to wash my hair but wanted more mioterizer but something not heavy on my hair</li>
            <li> Also I had a lot of success using this product as a mask and watching it out.</li>
            <li> right after I washed it???</li>
            <li> put it on my braids right before I unbraided</li>
            <li> If you notice a burning sensation stop using right away</li>
            <li> But for   right now I like it.</li>
            <li> so I treated them with this product right after washing ...sort of like a hot oil treatment.  </li>
            <li> Great shine but moisture only last for one day using the recommend amount.</li>
            <li> Great for African American hair .</li>
            <li> Other than that it a great natural ingredient product.</li>
            <li> when she first tried it, I jumped on board.  </li>
            <li> So when I first started using it</li>
            <li> I also had the spray scalp oil and upon my first use of that I felt a sort of burning sensation on my scalp...</li>
            <li> But I found a workaround for the greasy issue, for those who are interested:</li>
            <li> Love this product; I have purchase this from Amazon.com on several occasions.</li>
            <li> I have used it almost daily for well over a year, one 8 oz jar, and i&#x27;m just ordering more today.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed her products more when she was in small storefront in Brooklyn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have the residue you get with other products.</li>
            <li> First things first, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of this.  </li>
            <li> But my experiences were still positive; maybe this will help someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However there was a certain musty smell that came from using it continuously.</li>
            <li> This product not only has healthy ingredients but does exactly what it says, mositurizes my natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li> Great shine and moisture but last less than a day.</li>
            <li> particular product works great, as several other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> If you have fine or straight hair, these products will likely be too much for you.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like Carol&#x27;s daughter products</li>
            <li> yeah, really?&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and my 4a hair seemed to like it.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This product works really well in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Does not create softness and/or make more manageable unless the hair is wet</li>
            <li> Not much of a difference, I feel as though the mimosa honey protects hair more because of the beeswax.</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this product for any woman who needs only light moisture coverage to keep her hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase because I don&#x27;t like spending so much on hair products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use that much of it.</li>
            <li> I am an older guy, whitish straight hair.</li>
            <li> The same is true for all Carol&#x27;s daughter products.</li>
            <li> Not enough true hair moisture.</li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned by older daughter&#x27;s hair and applied this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those that have a lot of unwieldy hair.  </li>
            <li> BUT if you have curly hair that is often unmanageable I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The top is a little harden and must be penetrated.</li>
            <li> My scalp is no longer dry, and my hair is significantly softer in part because of it</li>
            <li> The initial sticker price was a shock to the wallet, but it is worth every dime.</li>
            <li> a person with extremely dry hair this product has a great shine and moisture but last less than a day.</li>
            <li> my sister stole my jar so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying a new one.</li>
            <li> I dont think you should use it for styling purposes, maybe on your scalp but not to much on your hair because it will most likely weight it down.</li>
            <li> add this in and wow!  </li>
            <li> I switched to As I Am products, first trying their Double Moisturizer Butter and settling on their Twist Defining Cream.</li>
            <li> My brother uses this on his natural hair and it moisturizes and makes his hair very soft.</li>
            <li> and they came out soft and shiny with no frizz.</li>
            <li> Manageable natural hair that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Only recommend this product for relaxed hair,if you really want to spend that much on hair dressing when you can get the same effect with a lower costing hair dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it lasts all day and it give you a natural looking style.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find a product that will keep my hair moisturize and I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years.</li>
            <li> However it does keep my hair shiny and soft, but also greasy</li>
            <li> Since I have never used this product, I am rating it based on my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li> I am recommending this product to anyone and everyone who is natural.</li>
            <li> I use as a twist loc because I don&#x27;t use gel on my hair and my hair was so shiny and soft and kept its hold.</li>
            <li> My hair is considerably healthier and longer.</li>
            <li> I bought it over a year ago as part of a natural program I was doing, and just ran out.</li>
            <li> This product completely transformed my hair in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR TYPE:&lt;br /&gt;1)I have naturally wavy/straight</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pomade to do an old fashioned twist out with just &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; and I got the hold of a hair butter without the softness.</li>
            <li> It did not give me the soft definition I was using it for.</li>
            <li> If you have natural hair be cautious when using this product because of the chemical reaction and after smell.</li>
            <li> I use it on top of a moisturizer to add extra shine and tame my hair.</li>
            <li> I have also tried it on dry hair and it still works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this-a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> For African American 4b hair, it is a perfect scalp &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; - reminds me of the soothing/moisturizing grease of the 90s before grease (w/Petroleum) was deemed bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much so the jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> That being said I don&#x27;t think this product would be well suited for anyone with fine or thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> have a thick head of fine 3c4a kinky</li>
            <li> buy this all natural high quality product that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My original honey jar lasted several years and it still has half of it left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to the Curly Girl no shampoo method, and I&#x27;ve replaced my silicone-based hair products with natural ones from Carol&#x27;s Daughter.  </li>
            <li> KIND OF EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> but if you try it on wet frizzy hair to will stay un-frizzy until your hair is dried and you will need to use alot more of the product than recommend for it last.</li>
            <li> Her hair is natural and she swears this is the only product that lays it down nicely when she wants to pull it back in a ponytail (this hair honey apparently keeps it laying down flat for the entire day, as opposed to other products we have tried that caused her hair to frizz at some point during the day).</li>
            <li> they are rich (not watered down) and so will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can already see that this honey is going to last me many months even though I have very thick, curly hair that requires a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Its been a long journey with my natural transition.</li>
            <li> It also smooths the hair down along the hairline for a much neater</li>
            <li> instead of buying a drug store hair moisturizer that is watered down and wont really work.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little of this product to really make my hair shine and behave.</li>
            <li> This product should not be used to moisturize, but only to tame frizz and add shine and it does that VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would want to be different is the price - it is a little on the high side.</li>
            <li> so I stopped using it on my hair and put it on my feet which are a bit dry this time of the year. :o</li>
            <li> This product is very lightweight, but a little on the fingertips goes a long way - especially on the ends.  </li>
            <li> As much as I don&#x27;t want to like this product because I feel like carols daughters formulas changed in other products due to expanding and possibly ingredient cost, I must say I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t very long, so what I write here may only be of interest to others with short hair.</li>
            <li> but it did not last as long as the hair balm does.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> If a rub it on my hands then apply to her flat braids and them brush with a baby  </li>
            <li> flat iron</li>
            <li> I used a very small amount of the product to smooth down my hair and add shine.</li>
            <li> IDK why it only does this with dry hair but on the plus size it creates softness.</li>
            <li> Only down side was it was such a tiny bottle it came in for that price.</li>
            <li> As long as Lisa makes this product, I will buy it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant since it was called hair honey.it is thick in the jar but quickly liquifies once rubbed between your hands.</li>
            <li> I add it to my hair when it is damp out of the shower and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I also have a naturally dry scalp that needs tons and tons of moisturizing, otherwise my head will start looking like an ant farm.</li>
            <li> and it gets dry sometimes after washing....</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders on my dry hair this winter.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry</li>
            <li> The main complaint is its too greasy.</li>
            <li> Mine is relaxed and just the tinest bit will weigh my hair down and cause it to be gunky feeling for an entire week.</li>
            <li> I had to turn on my fan and lay down because I actually felt my temperature rising.</li>
            <li> not to mention this relentless itching and very dry flakey scalp...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white girl with medium-bodied, curly hair (3B if that resonates with you) and I&#x27;ve found that just a little of this in combination with [[ASIN:B0034DMC88</li>
            <li> So I decided to venture a little further with this product.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little dab of it...</li>
            <li> it is a little pricey but it will LAST A LIFETIME!</li>
            <li> I am transitioning and been having a hard trying to manage my relaxed ends and natural roots.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later she tells me my nieces hair is falling out and her scalp is itching...</li>
            <li> I have Caucasian hair, but partial gray and a ton of it.</li>
            <li> this is money well spent.</li>
            <li> This was on wet hair which it says you can use.</li>
            <li> I found out that I am a product junkie who is obsessed with trying to find a natural product that works for and with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> And you really only need the tiniest bit, despite how much other crap you&#x27;ve had to slather on in the past to get hair that looks half as good as it will after you try this.  </li>
            <li> I little goes a long way and will do the job with an initial application, but wears off and leaves the hair feeling sticky and stiff.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is a lot less dry when I use the Mimosa Hair Honey.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way, it melts in your hands when you put in your finger tips.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a very little bit.</li>
            <li> Especially knowing that a very small amount of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I only use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Like all of the other products I have used from Carol&#x27;s Daughter, this too smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other products yet from this company, but I&#x27;m looking foward to the experience.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would use during the summer but definitely will be a winter staple</li>
            <li> After trying to mix fragrances with the loc butter I researched about other hair products for locs without the smell.</li>
            <li> She is Black and Italian so her hair is thick, curly, and dry.</li>
            <li> I used a minimum of 2 jars when using othe products and they left my hair oily, hard and oily smelling.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t absorb fully in my hair.</li>
            <li> BUT THE PRICE NEEDS TO GO DOWN LIKE $10.</li>
            <li> This product does not weight down on relaxed hair and does not create softness.</li>
            <li> This partly explains why my hair has been so dry and kinky in the past.  </li>
            <li> I use the Mimosa Hair Honey, along with a few other Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, to make my hair \\&quot;something</li>
            <li> I get rid of this by putting in some Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Hair Smoothie, then rinsing it out with water.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t subject her to it.</li>
            <li> I also use the Black Vanilla Hair Conditioner as well which helps to keep my hair hydrated and moisturized as well.</li>
            <li> It also works well on the kids&#x27; hair which are all long and thick.  </li>
            <li> I used to finish off the process by using a little of Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s Hair Milk, but my hair and scalp no longer need</li>
            <li> no matter how little I use.</li>
            <li> a little and one jar lasts me about a year.</li>
            <li> The texture reminds me a little of the castor oil I used to put in my hair as a kid</li>
            <li> I dont think its too thick for me because I have 4c hair but to someone with finer hair and a loose curl pattern</li>
            <li> I will tell you that it is thick and would probably weigh down your hair if you used it for something other than ponytail days.</li>
            <li> then after a few uses, it went away.  </li>
            <li> and now I have scabs that I&#x27;m treating and a patch of hair missing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, one drawback is that this product is quite greasy, which I do not enjoy at all.</li>
            <li> So far I am not impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t too greasy nor heavy.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that these products actually hold my hair and keep it from disintegrating into a fluffy, puffy, gross mess.  </li>
            <li> It will weights down and make your hair thick even with the recommend amount</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair that has a tendency to dry out and frizz.</li>
            <li> So if it seems expensive, no worries, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they are putting in these products</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t put to much on, very heavy.</li>
            <li> The beeswax in this product makes it incredibly hard to wash out and with my hair all stuck together when the water hits it makes it feel as though I have honey in hair.</li>
            <li> It works for at least one person in the house.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I ordered this product and very disappointed that I can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> but because my sister in law can be a little dramatic some times, I was like &#x27;yeah</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying it due to the price</li>
            <li> This product actually works well to tame my daughter&#x27;s curls, which is too bad because it is DISTURBINGLY PERFUMEY-</li>
            <li> Due to a bad haircut was my hair was fluffy, big and look terrible.</li>
            <li> Too expensive</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get the shine and moisture</li>
            <li> It was greaser than Blue bergamot and washed out terribly.</li>
            <li> Second day had to rewash because my hair looked terrible after pineappling.</li>
            <li> After three days of using my hair was itching so bad...</li>
            <li> This hair product complexly saved me!!!!</li>
            <li> It occurred to me, my sister-in-law was not being hysterical, I was having problems with it too!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I really wanted to like Carol&#x27;s daughter products so when my sister in law said she bought it for my niece and it was working wonders when she first tried it, I jumped on board.  A few weeks later she tells me my nieces hair is falling out and her scalp is itching...but because my sister in law can be a little dramatic some times, I was like &#x27;yeah yeah, really?&#x27;.  So when I first started using it I&#x27;d alternate it with another product.  I have my hair in sisterlocks so I treated them with this product right after washing ...sort of like a hot oil treatment.  When I started using the product exclusively, I started noticing my hair all over the house, at my desk at work and everywhere...not to mention this relentless itching and very dry flakey scalp...right after I washed it??? It occurred to me, my sister-in-law was not being hysterical, I was having problems with it too!  I stopped using this product the second I realized the problem and now have an almost full jar I plan to toss out.  I also had the spray scalp oil and upon my first use of that I felt a sort of burning sensation on my scalp...then after a few uses, it went away.  I&#x27;m not sure what they are putting in these products but they are not for our family... We cannot do the itchy flaky scalp and hair falling out...</li>
            <li> I love this product it worked great on my two strand twists. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and my 4a hair seemed to like it. Only down side was it was such a tiny bottle it came in for that price. For that reason I never reordered.</li>
            <li> i still don&#x27;t see how this pomade will benefit my hair... the only ting i like about it is the smell smells; makes you wanna eat it...lol</li>
            <li> My brother uses this on his natural hair and it moisturizes and makes his hair very soft. Mine is relaxed and just the tinest bit will weigh my hair down and cause it to be gunky feeling for an entire week. If your relaxed hair is damaged this would be a good option to keep the hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I am transitioning and been having a hard trying to manage my relaxed ends and natural roots. I&#x27;ve been doing braid out which hadn&#x27;t been coming out so well. I bought this put it on my braids right before I unbraided and they came out soft and shiny with no frizz. It also smells wonderful. I had to tell my friends!</li>
            <li> This has made such a difference with my hair.  It exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> This pomade is a very light oil almost as light and fast absorbing as rose hip seed oil. It arrives as pictured and has a strong citrusy scent that reminded me of orange juice and lemon concentrate. I had no idea why it was named honey when it doesn&#x27;t smell like honey or have it in the ingredient list until I went to wash this out of my hair. The beeswax in this product makes it incredibly hard to wash out and with my hair all stuck together when the water hits it makes it feel as though I have honey in hair. I will not repurchase this product. And I won&#x27;t even bother using it again.</li>
            <li> Great product, versatile. I love that a little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had mine well over a year.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It is light and smells wonderful. It gives a gloss to the hair that leaves it nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on me and my daughter&#x27;s relaxed hair.  First of all, the texture is absolutely amazing.  I only need to gently glide my finger over the top and smooth it on my hair for a very nice shine.  It also smooths the hair down along the hairline for a much neater look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also pleasant and not overpowering.  I was skeptical about buying it due to the price but I am very satisfied with my purchasing.  Especially knowing that a very small amount of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white girl with medium-bodied, curly hair (3B if that resonates with you) and I&#x27;ve found that just a little of this in combination with [[ASIN:B0034DMC88 Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter, 4 oz.]] does absolute wonders for my hair!! I&#x27;m a recent convert to the Curly Girl no shampoo method, and I&#x27;ve replaced my silicone-based hair products with natural ones from Carol&#x27;s Daughter.  I am shocked that these products actually hold my hair and keep it from disintegrating into a fluffy, puffy, gross mess.  Not only that, but they&#x27;re so light that my hair curled tighter and shrunk shorter than it ever has before--it&#x27;s a full two inches shorter now than it was 24 hours ago.  Amazing!  If you have fine or straight hair, these products will likely be too much for you.  And you really only need the tiniest bit, despite how much other crap you&#x27;ve had to slather on in the past to get hair that looks half as good as it will after you try this.  I add it to my hair when it is damp out of the shower and let it air dry.  I love my hair now!!  It&#x27;s so soft and shiny, and it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I highly recommend it. It has a great scent and it keeps my daughter&#x27;s scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li> KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT I LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT MAKES MY HAIR LOOK LIKE IT BEEN PERMED..AND YES I WILL BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN...I LOVE IT...BUT THE PRICE NEEDS TO GO DOWN LIKE $10.</li>
            <li> Saw the hype about this product and wanted to try it. After three days of using my hair was itching so bad... I started seeing bumps in my hair like when you got braids put in. By day four the front of my hair was burned up like after you got a perm and now I have scabs that I&#x27;m treating and a patch of hair missing. I don&#x27;t know what was in the product but it was a no go for me. If you notice a burning sensation stop using right away</li>
            <li> The product smells good but makes your hair look and feel really greasy. I got a couple of friends to try it and all three said the same thing...it makes your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t very long, so what I write here may only be of interest to others with short hair. I have perhaps the coarsest or second-most coarse grade of hair a human being can have. I also have a naturally dry scalp that needs tons and tons of moisturizing, otherwise my head will start looking like an ant farm. As you can imagine, managing my hair has always been an issue for me. I use the Mimosa Hair Honey, along with a few other Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, to make my hair \\&quot;something manageable.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product works great, as several other reviewers have mentioned. My scalp is no longer dry, and my hair is significantly softer in part because of it (I also use Vanilla Hair Smoothie), making it easier to manage. I&#x27;m actually starting to get waves, something I wasn&#x27;t sure would ever happen for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one drawback is that this product is quite greasy, which I do not enjoy at all. This partly explains why my hair has been so dry and kinky in the past.  Growing up, I&#x27;d rather go nappy than greasy, if those were my only two choices.  But I found a workaround for the greasy issue, for those who are interested: First things first, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of this.  Seriously, a little goes a long way. Before going to bed, I just dab the tip of one finger into the product and use just that amount for my entire scalp. I then put on a cap and call it a night.  When I wake up, most of the product has been absorbed by my scalp and hair follicles, but there still is some greasy residue. I get rid of this by putting in some Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Hair Smoothie, then rinsing it out with water. Doing this gets rid of all the grease, while your hair retains all of the moisture and texture from overnight.  I used to finish off the process by using a little of Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s Hair Milk, but my hair and scalp no longer need that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result? Manageable natural hair that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever!!!  I have worn my hair in dred-locs for 13 years and this product is non greasy, not build on my hair and it smells wonderful.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It can be greasy depending on ur hair texture. Im a 3c...so I only use a small amount.  Other than that it a great natural ingredient product.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  Will buy more.</li>
            <li> This product works really well in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair is a lot less dry when I use the Mimosa Hair Honey.  The smell is an added bonus, the orange oil smells great.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell and frizz control. My daughter&#x27;s love it for their flyaways. It&#x27;s nice to not have the residue you get with other products.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product. I tried this product on 3 different types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only works well with relaxed hair but when you have relaxed hair just about any type of hair dressing works.I found that if you straighten the relaxed hair it works better. Great shine but moisture only last for one day using the recommend amount.This product does not weight down on relaxed hair and does not create softness. Only recommend this product for relaxed hair,if you really want to spend that much on hair dressing when you can get the same effect with a lower costing hair dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work well if you have frizzy hair but if you try it on wet frizzy hair to will stay un-frizzy until your hair is dried and you will need to use alot more of the product than recommend for it last. Great shine and moisture but last less than a day. Does not create softness and/or make more manageable unless the hair is wet BUT most hair is manageable when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a person with extremely dry hair this product has a great shine and moisture but last less than a day. It will weights down and make your hair thick even with the recommend amount IDK why it only does this with dry hair but on the plus size it creates softness.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this product. It provides great Sheen and conditioning benefits. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> As much as I don&#x27;t want to like this product because I feel like carols daughters formulas changed in other products due to expanding and possibly ingredient cost, I must say I have no complaints. I love it, it softens my hair prior to styling and it makes it easy to detangle during styling. The main complaint is its too greasy. Well...its a pomade and did you read the ingredients like what did you expect? Full of oils and BEESWAX. Yes this is like a grease, an amazing grease. in room temp it does soften a bit. I dont think its too thick for me because I have 4c hair but to someone with finer hair and a loose curl pattern I dont think you should use it for styling purposes, maybe on your scalp but not to much on your hair because it will most likely weight it down. Its great for the winter and fall time, not to much for the summer to me. I like the fact that when you co wash it, it still stays in your hair. Now if you wanna get all of it out just simply use a clarifying shampoo. I also use the Oyin handmade brown sugar pomade. Not much of a difference, I feel as though the mimosa honey protects hair more because of the beeswax.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Carol&#x27;s daughter product.  I purchased the hair balm and loved it. So I decided to venture a little further with this product.  I purchased this from Target for $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Smells great&lt;br /&gt;- Light weight product&lt;br /&gt;- I did not find it to be too greasy for me. The [[ASIN:B000WJ5XNI Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Hair Balm, Packaging may Vary, 4 Ounce]] is greasier.&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t know how to explain the texture. The top is a little harden and must be penetrated. I added a picture that may give an idea.&lt;br /&gt;- My daughter has eczema and she did not scratch when this was applied.&lt;br /&gt;- I added the product to my hair after I applied a leave-in conditioner it gave my hair a nice shine but it did not last as long as the hair balm does.&lt;br /&gt;- This works well for my younger daughter. If a rub it on my hands then apply to her flat braids and them brush with a baby  brush it makes her hair look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Too expensive&lt;br /&gt;- So far I am not impressed with the product. It is just okay. I washed and conditioned by older daughter&#x27;s hair and applied this product.  It added a gloss but not enough for her hair. I ended up applying the hair balm anyway. It is difficult to get the shine and moisture I want for her hair.&lt;br /&gt;- This is not a bad product for us. It works for at least one person in the house.</li>
            <li> This product actually works well to tame my daughter&#x27;s curls, which is too bad because it is DISTURBINGLY PERFUMEY- you can smell it across the room. I just can&#x27;t subject her to it.</li>
            <li> These were a gift. I am unsure as to how well the person likes them.  However, we have not heard anything back from them so we can assume that they are being enjoyed.</li>
            <li> For African American 4b hair, it is a perfect scalp &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; - reminds me of the soothing/moisturizing grease of the 90s before grease (w/Petroleum) was deemed bad. So this Mimosa Hair honey is like a healthy scalp moisturized. Amazing for dandruff-inclined scalps.  It also is is great as a hair moisturized. A little does go a long way, it melts in your hands when you put in your finger tips.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair shiny but gives no definition.  I like it but I don&#x27;t need to buy it again.</li>
            <li> this is such an oily product that we can&#x27;t use it in our hair, so it became a massage cream!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my locks healthy!!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I have short, sassy hair and it gets dry sometimes after washing....add this in and wow!  You only need a little dab of it...it lasts all day and it give you a natural looking style.  It also works well on the kids&#x27; hair which are all long and thick.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is very lightweight, but a little on the fingertips goes a long way - especially on the ends.  I sometimes will use just a touch with the hair balm and my hair stays frizz free and moisturized for days.  I definitely would recommend this product for any woman who needs only light moisture coverage to keep her hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Its been a long journey with my natural transition. Finally found a product that my hair tolerates. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t absorb fully in my hair. Not that I believe its The products fault I have yet to find a product that will keep my hair moisturize and I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years.Wonderful for twist outs but once I pull them apart it my hair is a fro by the end is the day. However it does keep my hair shiny and soft, but also greasy no matter how little I use. The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Since I have never used this product, I am rating it based on my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s review. Her hair is natural and she swears this is the only product that lays it down nicely when she wants to pull it back in a ponytail (this hair honey apparently keeps it laying down flat for the entire day, as opposed to other products we have tried that caused her hair to frizz at some point during the day). Like all of the other products I have used from Carol&#x27;s Daughter, this too smells heavenly. I will tell you that it is thick and would probably weigh down your hair if you used it for something other than ponytail days.</li>
            <li> This smells really good, but.....Not very effective.  I do not feel like it moisturizes the hair at all.  I little goes a long way and will do the job with an initial application, but wears off and leaves the hair feeling sticky and stiff.  Not a fan and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. It seems to be working well. As I continue  to use this product I will find out how good it is. But for   right now I like it. But don&#x27;t put to much on, very heavy.</li>
            <li> I am recommending this product to anyone and everyone who is natural. This product not only has healthy ingredients but does exactly what it says, mositurizes my natural 4c hair. I use as a twist loc because I don&#x27;t use gel on my hair and my hair was so shiny and soft and kept its hold. I haven&#x27;t tried the other products yet from this company, but I&#x27;m looking foward to the experience. I&#x27;m so satisfied with results. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a very little bit. Love it.</li>
            <li> i used this product some time ago, I wear my hair mostly in set, it kept my hair moist and my stylist always complemented on how soft my hair was.</li>
            <li> **I ended up returning the product because I found better and more cost-effective alternative for myself. But my experiences were still positive; maybe this will help someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thick head of fine 3c4a kinky coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second product from CD (I only wanted to try two). This one smells really good, isn&#x27;t overpowering for my fragrance sensitive allergies. A little goes a long way. I like to use it as a last-step sealant pomade on my ends on clean damp hair after using a leave in moisturizer. I have also tried it on dry hair and it still works pretty well. I like it for the scent, moisture properties, sealant ability, and longevity for the price. It melts in your hand and I only use about a dime to nickel size amount on my entire head and only on wash days. I moisturize my hair every night and sometimes I use it again on the ends.</li>
            <li> I brought this after a recommendation. I was a little hesitant since it was called hair honey.it is thick in the jar but quickly liquifies once rubbed between your hands. It has worked wonders on my dry hair this winter. After spritzing with water, I apply the hair honey. It provides a light coat on my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it too greasy. I am not sure if I would use during the summer but definitely will be a winter staple</li>
            <li> Mimosa Hair Honey made me nauseous, light headed, and dizzy I had to turn on my fan and lay down because I actually felt my temperature rising. I found out that I am a product junkie who is obsessed with trying to find a natural product that works for and with my natural hair. I was really excited when I ordered this product and very disappointed that I can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 years and it has done WONDERS for my hair. The initial sticker price was a shock to the wallet, but it is worth every dime. My hair is considerably healthier and longer. You only need a little and one jar lasts me about a year. I used a minimum of 2 jars when using othe products and they left my hair oily, hard and oily smelling. As long as Lisa makes this product, I will buy it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It provides great shine to the hair and somewhat of a hold.  The smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this product; I have purchase this from Amazon.com on several occasions. The only thing I would want to be different is the price - it is a little on the high side.</li>
            <li> I use this specifically when I heat style my hair - its a great moisturizer and leaves my hair smelling great. I don&#x27;t have to use much so the jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> She is Black and Italian so her hair is thick, curly, and dry. I especially like it around her edges and ends, it isn&#x27;t too greasy nor heavy.</li>
            <li> I am an older guy, whitish straight hair. It only takes a little of this product to really make my hair shine and behave. I bought it over a year ago as part of a natural program I was doing, and just ran out. So if it seems expensive, no worries, a little goes a long way. I have used it almost daily for well over a year, one 8 oz jar, and i&#x27;m just ordering more today. Wonderful natural product, love it!</li>
            <li> This hair product complexly saved me!!!! I had an on-air appearance. Due to a bad haircut was my hair was fluffy, big and look terrible. I happened to find some of Carol&#x27;s product at the shopping channel where I was to have a guest appearance. I used a very small amount of the product to smooth down my hair and add shine. This product completely transformed my hair in a matter of seconds. I have Caucasian hair, but partial gray and a ton of it. I highly recommend this product for those that have a lot of unwieldy hair.  I have never found a product that performs so well. Bravo Carol. Carol&#x27;s daughter rocks!</li>
            <li> just my personal preference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find anything special about this product.  Almost like vaseline/petroleum jelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. did not like the scent.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like mimosa, maybe a whiff of honey.&lt;br /&gt;2. product texture was a  too greasy even when using just a dab so I stopped using it on my hair and put it on my feet which are a bit dry this time of the year. :o(</li>
            <li> MY HAIR TYPE:&lt;br /&gt;1)I have naturally wavy/straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;2)I am NOT African american&lt;br /&gt;3) My hair is dry&lt;br /&gt;4)I flat iron my hair a lot so I need a product to help put back moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY I BUY THIS PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;1)I buy many Carols daughter products because they work!&lt;br /&gt;2)the product is all natural&lt;br /&gt;3)SMELLS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;4)yes it is a little pricey but it will LAST A LIFETIME! all you need is a tiny amount of product for it to work. My original honey jar lasted several years and it still has half of it left. my sister stole my jar so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying a new one. The same is true for all Carol&#x27;s daughter products. they are rich (not watered down) and so will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;this is a quality product and product line that works for ALL HAIR TYPES! this is money well spent. instead of buying a drug store hair moisturizer that is watered down and wont really work. buy this all natural high quality product that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> love it wrks great for me ive been growing dreds 12 yrs now i love the loc butter to i also use it in my grandson and granddaughters hair</li>
            <li> I had used some of Carol daughter things and enjoyed them. I use Wen to wash my hair but wanted more mioterizer but something not heavy on my hair and this does just the thing it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week but so far I love this product! I was hesitant to purchase because I don&#x27;t like spending so much on hair products but it was completely worth it! I can already see that this honey is going to last me many months even though I have very thick, curly hair that requires a lot of product. That being said I don&#x27;t think this product would be well suited for anyone with fine or thin, straight hair. The texture reminds me a little of the castor oil I used to put in my hair as a kid and it adds a lot of weight to your hair. BUT if you have curly hair that is often unmanageable I would highly recommend it. My curls are now incredibly consistent, soft (not crunchy), and my hair smells delicious! Also I had a lot of success using this product as a mask and watching it out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like how the beeswax affected my hair. I&#x27;ve tried many of her products because everyone loves them it seems but they&#x27;re all a no go to me. I was looking for a pomade to do an old fashioned twist out with just &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; and I got the hold of a hair butter without the softness. When coupled with just aloe vera gel I got Hairspray hold. This was on wet hair which it says you can use. It was greaser than Blue bergamot and washed out terribly. Second day had to rewash because my hair looked terrible after pineappling. It did not give me the soft definition I was using it for.</li>
            <li> Love this-a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This stuff totally rocks. I have very thick, wavy hair that has a tendency to dry out and frizz. This product makes it manageable and moist for days without feeling too greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it keeps my hair moisturize. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now</li>
            <li> I have locs and used the loc butter. However there was a certain musty smell that came from using it continuously. Twisting my hair I wasn&#x27;t aware of the smell, but others told me that it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant smell. After trying to mix fragrances with the loc butter I researched about other hair products for locs without the smell. I read through comments on their website about how this product smells great like citrus without a lingering musty smell that comes from black hair products. So for about two years now I have used this exclusively for my locs and its a wonderful smell. I also use the Black Vanilla Hair Conditioner as well which helps to keep my hair hydrated and moisturized as well. This is one of Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s best selling products and I can understand why. If you have natural hair be cautious when using this product because of the chemical reaction and after smell. I switched to As I Am products, first trying their Double Moisturizer Butter and settling on their Twist Defining Cream.</li>
            <li> Too waxy. Not enough true hair moisture. I enjoyed her products more when she was in small storefront in Brooklyn. Something has changed.</li>
            <li> Great for African American hair . It keeps the hair soft and smelling good. Not oily looking. My children are bi racial and this was perfect for their type of hair.</li>
            <li> This product should not be used to moisturize, but only to tame frizz and add shine and it does that VERY WELL. My hair is super frizzy and this does the trick for me. I haven&#x27;t found a fizz tamer that works better. I don&#x27;t even have to use that much of it. It lasts for ever. The shine it gives is AMAZING. I use it on top of a moisturizer to add extra shine and tame my hair. My hair comes out perfect with this product.</li>
