            <li>This product is very helpful for a clean, nice looking bun.</li>
            <li>It gives me a thick perfect, professional looking bun that I love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still figuring out how to use it, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of.</li>
            <li>and thats EXACTLY what it does!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair that is fairly thin and this product works great!</li>
            <li>I got a blonde one....not ideal for a redhead when I thought I was getting a brown one, but it works fine and is easier to use than a sock or the other options for this look.  </li>
            <li>Item came quick and product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tricky to use but when you get it right, the look is amazing!</li>
            <li>My hair is far to fine to pull this off, and if you have any layers in your hair, this probably wouldn&#x27;t work for you either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to figure out exactly what to do with the hair doesn&#x27;t just flip over and stay, but I&#x27;ll get there.</li>

            <li>This donut is pretty fantastic, albeit a little on the puffy side for &amp;#34;medium.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t come apart, and while there&#x27;s a seam, the hair covers it without a problem.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance and she has worn it and has not complained about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so small, my first doesn&#x27;t even fit inside.</li>
            <li>This hair donut gives a very professional clean look to my hair having to put it up being in the military.  </li>
            <li>I recommend a smaller sized donut for first time use.</li>
            <li>Used just like a sock bun, except you can stick pins directly into it, not just around it.  </li>
            <li>us straight hair girls with thin hair would love to have a big hair bun too!</li>
            <li>This is fine if you have a lot of long thick hair, which I don&#x27;t.  </li>

            <li> not for thin hair! us straight hair girls with thin hair would love to have a big hair bun too!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair that is fairly thin and this product works great! I&#x27;m still figuring out how to use it, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of.</li>
            <li> Perfect for military uniforms, or ballet.  Used just like a sock bun, except you can stick pins directly into it, not just around it.  I pass all of my Marine Corps ROTC uniform inspections with flying colors now!</li>
            <li> Item came quick and product was exactly as described. I love putting my hair in buns and this product made it so easy to achieve the look! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Works for me. Makes a nice bun. Easy to use. I recommend bobby pins to keep the bun in place.</li>
            <li> No surprises here, the function for this product is to make your bun bug and beautiful and thats EXACTLY what it does!</li>
            <li> Joining the Army soon and trying to get used to my hair in a bun. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out exactly what to do with the hair doesn&#x27;t just flip over and stay, but I&#x27;ll get there. This product is very helpful for a clean, nice looking bun.</li>
            <li> I got a blonde one....not ideal for a redhead when I thought I was getting a brown one, but it works fine and is easier to use than a sock or the other options for this look.  With this product you can pin/anchor through the Donut and it&#x27;s more secure, obviously a sock won&#x27;t do that and the black bendy one is the same issue.  If you have questions, check out YouTube, lots of great tutorials on how to do it so it looks really sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to use but when you get it right, the look is amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent, i&#x27;m very happy for the shopping, it was that ai needed and the price is perfect , , ,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small, my first doesn&#x27;t even fit inside. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying online...Go buy it from a beauty store so you can actually see it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very user friendly.</li>
            <li> The hair donut is nice and forms your hair into a nice looking bun.  And the hair donut airs out/dry without sticking.</li>
            <li> This donut is pretty fantastic, albeit a little on the puffy side for &amp;#34;medium.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t come apart, and while there&#x27;s a seam, the hair covers it without a problem.</li>
            <li> LOVE this, hair looks awesome up, SO easy . looks clean, neat and trendy! You need bobby pins and a comb then done!!!</li>
            <li> I recently decided to stop trying to work with my super thin, fine hair and just buy products to fake it. This was my first one, and it&#x27;s awesome!

            <li> My 9 year old has thick long hair but this size was too big. Plus the &amp;#34;directions&amp;#34; are three small drawings that don&#x27;t really tell you how to do it. No words. It was a waste for us.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair so I could use one a bit smaller to completely cover the roll, but boy is this easy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS &amp;#34;DONUT&amp;#34;!! I wear it every clinical day in nursing school and my instructor is always commenting on how nice and neat my hair looks! If your hair is thick enough you can even where it with no bobby pins and it will stay tight all day (Which are 12 hour days for me). If you are into the sock bun trend then this thing is an essential!!</li>
            <li> My hair is a darker blonde and this works perfectly. Really easy to use and lets you have a pretty hairstyle with minimal effort</li>
            <li> This hair donut gives a very professional clean look to my hair having to put it up being in the military.  My daughter even uses it for her ROTC class.  Very easy to use., price was great</li>
            <li> This is fine if you have a lot of long thick hair, which I don&#x27;t.  Although my hair is long, it is quite fine and I don&#x27;t have a lot of it so it was difficult to get used to maneuvering it properly without showing the donut.  I recommend a smaller sized donut for first time use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance and she has worn it and has not complained about it. The lack of complaining leads me to conclude that this must satisfy her hair donut needs.</li>
            <li> My hair is far to fine to pull this off, and if you have any layers in your hair, this probably wouldn&#x27;t work for you either.</li>
