            <li>I just received this moisturizer yesterday and I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen ever!!!</li>
            <li>She also recommended Sanitas spf too which is very good</li>
            <li>This is very good face cream with SPF 30.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a sunscreen that is as ideal as this use to be and still have yet to find one.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I used this moisturizer for over a year and loved it and was very happy with the ingredients.</li>
            <li>What a shame, this stuff USED to be great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a great experience with it</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Great sun protection under makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this project for years, and, like others have said, it was great until DeVita changed the product.  </li>
            <li>This one is great for the face.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Today I ordered Devita&#x27;s Solar Body Moisturizer and hope it will be just as great.</li>
            <li>Great spf</li>
            <li>Great &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lotion with the added benefit of sunscreen that does not use nano particles.</li>
            <li>He says it is not greasy and feels great.</li>
            <li>It is the best sunscreen/moisturizer and I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>He said he has tried absolutely every type of sunscreen on the market, with a preference for sports sunscreens, and he said this one worked the best and had the best tactical application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it</li>
            <li>up to this point the best I found was Keys because it smoothed on easily and was non-whitening</li>
            <li>I had a good experience for a year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>I loved the way this made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I loved the way it smelled.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really fair though,</li>
            <li>Protects and moisturizes, good product</li>
            <li>I borrowed a friend&#x27;s 7 oz version on this and loved it.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s a good consistency</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>(that I hadn&#x27;t seen in a good 7 months).</li>
            <li>I tried this product for a good 3 weeks before deciding to quit using it.</li>
            <li>Goes on well, not greasy, smells good.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to tell u all that it works effectively and am happy that it&#x27;s safe.    </li>
            <li>I love how this product has great ingredients and is basically as good as sunscreen gets.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is also a great moisturizer without causing oil skin to look more oily.</li>
            <li>Great clean product!</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer/sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you rub it in well!</li>
            <li>Uuuuummm, are you sure this is a sunscreen?!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a lightweight mineral sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher and this one seemed perfect.</li>
            <li>I found this and love it!  </li>
            <li>my skin feels better than ever!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Over all, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love Devita!</li>
            <li>This product goes on so smoothly, leaving my skin feeling great.  </li>
            <li>I liked the texture when I tried it 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>I really liked it</li>
            <li>nice, non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A friend tried it at my house after she realized she forgot to pack her own and</li>
            <li>I honestly wondered what people were complaining about....</li>
            <li>but in my experience if I apply it over a serum or oil of any kind then it goes on like it used to.</li>
            <li>I liked the tube version.</li>
            <li>I charted ingredients for some moisturizing sunscreens, and chose this one because it has many good ingredients (aloe vera, glycerin, hyaluronic acid (vegan source), allantoin, grape seed extract, etc.)</li>
            <li>Very nice sunscreen, light, not oily.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and seems to do a good job of protecting from the sun.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist specifically recommended this product to me, and I have been very impressed with it so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this item with enthusiasm because my friend recommended it as &amp;#34;the best natural SPF moisturizer&amp;#34; she had ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  67 with sensitive skin, and this is the best moisturizer with SPF that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is very light.  </li>
            <li>The texture is that of a very light lotion, almost gel-like.</li>
            <li>I am a redhead, with very fair, sensitive, and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light feel, and does not sting my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stunning.</li>
            <li>It does make for a nice light moisturized, but I didn&#x27;t trust Devita for sun protection after what I&#x27;ve learned.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I also love that is has an SPF of 30.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it and will use it forever.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, where this does rub in it&#x27;s lovely and matte</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has sunscreen in it, too.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for warmer months, especially since my skin tends to be a bit on the oily side.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this product - it was my go-to-spf.</li>
            <li>On the Devita homepage they claimed that it was &amp;#34;back and better than ever&amp;#34; so I took a leap of faith and bought it.</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I just wish there were more stuff in the bottle...</li>
            <li>This SPF was my favorite ever for over a year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a shame because this was probably the best SPF I had ever used until they changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the cream and will continue to use it</li>
            <li>Love ingredients</li>
            <li>This is the best mineral sunscreen daily moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried to date.  </li>
            <li>I love that is has hylauronic acid in it and does not contain silicones or retinoids.</li>
            <li>Wish the company would be more forthcoming wit the date.</li>
            <li>Devita, would love to hear from you.</li>
            <li>I still love it because it&#x27;s a 30 spf sunscreen that does not have parabens and a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Normally, it is an awesome facial moisturizer with sunblock (always ordered through Luckyvitamin).  </li>
            <li>I love this block.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it&#x27;s ever looked.</li>
            <li>I love using this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>For all this time until my most recent purchase, the moisturizer was perfect.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the protection.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite SPF which I am going to purchase again and again.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product was that is has no added fragrance.</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens and lotions have fragrance of some sort, which bothers my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this moisturizer for a couple years, and like some reviewers have said, it used to be better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really love it because it moisturizes perfectly without clogging pores or leaving white residue.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more items in the line.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but in a perfect world....</li>
            <li>I love that it is made from all-natural products.</li>
            <li>but I am going to shop around and see if I can get a better price.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>I used to love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my very effective, yet very toxic Neutrogena sunscreen.</li>
            <li>They use really high quality materials and it feels great.</li>
            <li>I like the texture, the easy absorption, and the fact that it is a light but effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is mild, yet effective.</li>
            <li>It had to be the older version, it was sooo nice!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and don&#x27;t like the feel of regular sunscreen on my face.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s great - goes on clear.</li>
            <li>Best of all it is natural and well rated by the environmental working group, which is how I stumbled across this recommended product when I googled the bliss good skintentions I was using only to find out</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like normal spf and it has a great light lotion texture that makes it easy for makeup application afterwards.</li>
            <li>SPF, environmentally friendly, non-toxic (good rating from the Environmental Working Group) and reasonably priced every-day face lotion!</li>
            <li>They then told me that it has been worked with and changed to be more like the original and</li>
            <li>The whiteness faded very quickly, and it is matte to the touch rather than shiny like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use that</li>
            <li>I have always liked how this product feels and works especially since I&#x27;ve had skin cancer and need good protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While a fine review -- it is not mine, so</li>
            <li>I once got a tube that was not as creamy in consistency as all of the others I&#x27;ve ever gotten, but the product still worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It smell fine and does not get rancid.</li>
            <li>I gave this two stars as the ingredients are great (excellent EWG rating) and other than the white goo ball problem it goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>Like very much!!</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t apply or absorb smoothly and feels like there is grit in the lotion.</li>
            <li>I feel obligated to update my review in light of information that Devita uses UNCOATED zinc oxide in their sunscreens.</li>
            <li>However, because it got such great ratings on the EWG website for safety I decided that I would just buy it for my mom (who probably never had acne in her life).  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer does not contain gluten, which is important for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working great until the last bottle I received.</li>
            <li>(Fortunately I was at the end of the tube).</li>
            <li>Lost its primary advantage which was ease of application.</li>
            <li>The texture was like moisturizer or lotion and it was light weigh on my face.</li>
            <li>I saw this product on the EWG website, as it is a sunscreen/moisturizer that&#x27;s free of oxybenzone.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and feels great!</li>
            <li>I am so happy to finally find THE SUNSCREEN!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen and it goes on even and smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the product and I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>Basically a great daily moisturizer+sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It has a nice gentle scent and is silky to put on your face.</li>
            <li>The package says it&#x27;s good through 2016, so I have to assume the smell and goo are not because the product is old.</li>
            <li>I ended up with the old formulation and I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like using moisturizer or sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I love the SPF 30 protection too, and I love that it gets high marks from the Environmental Working Group.  </li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>and I combine it with Devita Evening Rich moisturizer, too.</li>
            <li>I know some people think $16 is a steep price to pay for a sunscreen, but I think it is WELL worth it!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen used to be so emollient - but the tube I received on Friday does not contain the original formula.  </li>
            <li>This gives me that protection and the moisturizer my dry skin needs at a great price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a total shame because the old formulation was literally the perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(though what it does have is pleasant), and I&#x27;ve never had any white residue at all.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>I loved the way it wasn&#x27;t sticky and didn&#x27;t leave a white film.  </li>
            <li>The only issue he have to test how good it is with preventing tanning of the skin.</li>
            <li>All-natural, good for your skin, physical sunblock (no nano-particled laboratory experiments), disappears and absorbs into skin well, not TOO pricey considering</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t given it a true sunburn test yet,</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li>It is good to use every morning, but I always try to reapply later in the day.</li>
            <li>This just brightens your face and makes you feel good about going outside.</li>
            <li>I have used this for at least a year and loved it!!!</li>
            <li>I waited a good 20 minutes before putting anything else on my face, and it flaked off entirely.</li>
            <li>Anyway, hers rubbed in fabulously while mine flaked right off again.</li>
            <li>it goes so quickly.</li>
            <li>You need to work quickly with it.</li>
            <li>(LOVE their products), but the spf leaves more of a white cast than Devita.</li>
            <li>This does not feel sticky when i put it on and has been an adequate sun protector.</li>
            <li>The original was lighter, creamier and absorbed right away.</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that it is natural and has a high concentration of zinc oxide.      </li>
            <li>I have tried several other natural products that received great reviews from the EWG as far as SPF effectiveness but none of them were perfect..</li>
            <li>The high zinc oxide % means it offers very good protection against UVA rays (the ones that cause aging and skin cancer), and it&#x27;s all natural formula absorbs pretty well and is non-irritating.</li>
            <li>and it made my face feel as calm as it did before I started using anything on it.</li>
            <li>Very even and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled with the Devita product and will DEFINITELY buy it again.</li>
            <li>I got a sample and so far it&#x27;s ok,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>I understand that zinc oxide is a barrier sunscreen and is not meant to absorb, but it seemed like none of the lotion, even the moisturizers, absorbed, leaving a somewhat sticky layer on my face all day.  </li>
            <li>I tried this at Whole Foods &amp; loved it instantly.</li>
            <li>After exhausting amounts of research I decided to try Devita Solar Protective Moisturizer which seemed like the best option.</li>
            <li>I gave Devita 2 stars because it did not leave my face white nor did it smell like chalk which is incredible for a physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It has a really high concentration of zinc oxide, yet goes on unbelievably easily.</li>
            <li>The first day I opened my new tube the top broke off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other micro sunscreens, and there&#x27;s definitely more thickness to them and more whiteness before they are rubbed in.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena made his face itch and breakout as did other good brands, but we found a winner with this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Devita, I hope you read all these reviews and try to right this.</li>
            <li>Flakes off right away, how is it supposed to protect my skin when it&#x27;s flaking off already?</li>
            <li>I had read all the reviews on this product before I had purchased it and decided I needed to try it out for myself to determine whether or not it would be the right product for me.</li>
            <li>It melts right into the skin and no greyish film.</li>
            <li>It is just right for one&#x27;s face, day in and day out.  </li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and light, and it quickly absorbs into my skin without leaving a white residue.</li>
            <li>this used to be the absolute best sun screen but now, since the reformulation, leaves my face white and dry looking.</li>
            <li>The product is VERY easy to spread and cover the entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>I am a 22 year old male who was looking for the best physical sunscreen for my skin.</li>
            <li>It is highly rated as both effective and as a safe product with little to no chemicals known to cause health problems.</li>
            <li>seems to be a good solid product and does what it is supposed to do as far as moisturizing and protecting against the sun.</li>
            <li>but since it is naturally oily, as the day progresses, most moisturizers tend to be too much.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that on my skin, it went on pretty smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could afford this whole line!</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product at my local health food store, and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>saw a youtube video demonstration of how this Devita sunscreen works better than another physical sunscreen before I bought it.</li>
            <li>If I had purchased this through my local store (which carries it at a higher price than Amazon) I would be able to return it.</li>
            <li>The box said \\&quot;back and better than ever.\\</li>
            <li>Haha what a joke!</li>
            <li>Sure, go ahead and put it on and then walk around all day with white streaks and flakes on your face because this stuff doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li>So if you order it you may get lucky and end up with an older tube or you may not.</li>
            <li>Thanks EWG and Amazon !</li>
            <li>The old formula went on smooth and never clogged my pores.</li>
            <li>So sad as this used to be the best stuff ever.</li>
            <li>The ingredients were natural and the texture of this lotion/lightweight cream felt smooth.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the 2.5oz tube version with the following ingredients:&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been back for about a year or more now.</li>
            <li>So read the most current reviews!</li>
            <li>This product does not smell, it is extremely smooth, and it does go on clear.</li>
            <li>I like most how it protects but the next thing in line is how it goes on my face.</li>
            <li>And, my husband is willing to use this product, which is a milestone.</li>
            <li>That said, I went on Amazon and purchased this for the first time.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and moist and disappears completely in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li>but you can blend it in pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love having to use only one lotion for sun protection and softening.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes when I order this, I get the sheer version that I used to know and love.  </li>
            <li>First product my picky husband tried for sun protection that he likes.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product but as it turns out the experience is exactly the opposite!  </li>
            <li>Interestingly, even though EltaMD Clear is a nano sunscreen with less zinc than Devita, there was definitely more whiteness to it than Devita, which makes me doubt the zinc content in Devita.</li>
            <li>: At this point I have probably purchased and tried around two dozen natural sunscreens for the face, and this is by far my favorite one.</li>
            <li>Before switching my skincare regimin to these two products, I wouldn&#x27;t have dreamed of going out in public without foundation makeup, but now my skin looks good enough to do so.</li>
            <li>Zinc Oxide is naturally white, so this product does an extremely good job at making it as sheer as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>happens more often if you apply it on top of any other product such as lotions or, in my case, an anti-acne gel.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>It became lumpy very quickly and left lumps and flakes on my face that need to be washed off.</li>
            <li>moisturizer has a barely creamy texture that goes on extremely smoothly and readily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>you might get lucky and get the clear one, or you might get the whiter chaulky one.  </li>
            <li>Burnout goes on clear, my face stays smooth and normal looking too.</li>
            <li>It was like applying pure zinx oxide with no moisturizing qualities.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have any strange odors, it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy, and most importantly for me, it never left any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead of the lotion spreading on smoothly and getting absorbed into my skin, it started clumping  and getting dry strands on my face.</li>
            <li>There are also fine particles left on my face.</li>
            <li>The product is a manageable cream, neither runny nor too solid, and it smooths onto the skin quickly and DISAPPEARS!</li>
            <li>Other than this, the product is extremely easy to use, and I actually like it better than the non SPF face moisturizer I had been using.  </li>
            <li>This last bottle was a huge disappoinment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair-skinned</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light yet moisturizing, didn&#x27;t clog my pores, didn&#x27;t leave a white cast.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t see how Devita would have as much zinc in it as they say.</li>
            <li>How disappointing, this used to be the best sunscreen ever!  </li>
            <li>It used to go on smooth, leave no greasy residue or white cast, and it smelled almost like almonds.  </li>
            <li>Much thicker and whiter.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a couple years for a natural, safe and effective moisturizer/sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy or white.</li>
            <li>My esthetician highly recommended this product to me!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am very disapointed and will not buy it again</li>
            <li>I really like all De Vita products.  </li>
            <li>I found it don&#x27;t go on as smooth as my regular moisturizer</li>
            <li>like it so much she had me send her the info for it</li>
            <li>I have very oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this product thanks to EWG&#x27;s recommendations.  </li>
            <li>My friend is really bummed and even approached the company, which said they made the change and they are sticking with</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t have much of a sheen at all, and I use it under a very light/partial application of foundation.</li>
            <li>It also feels very inert and non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Goes on light and rubs in easily, not white.</li>
            <li>The biggest issue is that the quality of this sunscreen is very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>I really like that this is a Vegan product and works really well for the face.</li>
            <li>There is no way this product could ever have received anything but one star from a real user.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT smell like sunscreen and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover an area that you want protected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>However, it is very sunny in Florida</li>
            <li>I am very happy to have finally found an SPF moisturizer than I can wear everyday and not just when it&#x27;s absolutely necessary.  </li>
            <li>Even if not, well worth it product for those with sensitive skins and allergic tendencies.</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite facial sunscreen (I&#x27;ve tried quite a few)--it&#x27;s not greasy or drying, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, it works well under makeup, and it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do--</li>
            <li>So far I have not had any acne issues and my skin remains more matte during the entire day, compared to when I did not have any sunscreen on.  </li>
            <li>I also use this product with harsh meds like Epiduo and AHA 15% which kind of burned a bit, but I did not notice any problems using the sunscreen over the meds.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using this SPF as my HG product for at least 5 years and have loved it.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for a few days and so far so good.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and you don&#x27;t have to use much, so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>but so far, with the right cleanser, it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I was a loyal costumer who genuinely believed this was going to be my sunscreen for life, however after going through a total of four bottles in which the application of the product was no longer smooth, left a noticeable white film, and would rub after drying, I gave up.</li>
            <li>However, the product has screened out the tanning effect of the sun better than any other I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>(It uses zinc oxide) as the main ingredient and so much safer on the skin.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going out hiking or to the beach, I&#x27;ll use a more conventional SPF cream for longer lasting/stronger protection.</li>
            <li>Many of the zinc sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried have been unkind to my skin, or feel too thick and sticky to be comfortable (namely, the natural sunscreen sticks with beeswax in them).</li>
            <li>My only regret is that it is pricey for full body coverage</li>
            <li>Sometimes leaves a white trace but not bad.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen felt nice but it had a grainy texture to it right away, almost as if tiny little beads were suppose to be in this lotion like a scrub.</li>
            <li>So much that it doesn&#x27;t act like a sunscreen at all but rather like a moisturizer- hard to believe it is so effective...</li>
            <li>As many others have mentioned the previous formula has been changed.</li>
            <li>The main component I need in a moisturizer is the SPF</li>
            <li>product did change (as you can see from older reviews).</li>
            <li>After several minutes of a mildly damp feeling where I&#x27;d used the product, there was no sensation at all, just nicely-moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this product for all skin types, including oily/combo.  </li>
            <li>No eye sting, highly rated by Environmental Working Group.</li>
            <li>Rated high on ewg.org/skindeep.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>new squeeze-tube, although it is plastic, not only hold more, but allows every last drop to be used without any voodoo rituals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li>tan VERY easily, and after driving with my left arm in the sun (window closed) for two hours there was a dusting of freckles on that forearm.</li>
            <li>I called the company that makes it and they confirmed that there had to use a different supplier for a certain ingredient and that made some difference similar to what I was describing.</li>
            <li>This product costs a great deal and simply rolls off the skin in little white balls.</li>
            <li>To conclude, after at least 5 years of using this amazing product I just ordered Hydropeptide&#x27;s spf.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin and this sunscreen works really well for me.</li>
            <li>; I really recommend this product for oily, sensitive, acne-prone skins like mine.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s pretty lightweight, barely has a scent</li>
            <li>Most zinc oxide sunscreens are really heavy.</li>
            <li>I put on make up while the lotion hasn&#x27;t dried it&#x27;s ok,</li>
            <li>As to the white flecks some reviewers have mentioned, I find them easily absorbed and not a problem.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t putting it near my eyes to start out with, but I live in a warm, and sometimes humid climate and every time I sweated even a little bit (not from exercise, but from simply walking across the parking lot into a store or from just moving around too much in my 78 degree house)</li>
            <li>I initially avoided purchasing the Devita moisturizer because of the negative reviews related to the formula change, but finally decided to try it one month ago and am very happy I did.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some of the other users I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>In the winter I sometimes have to switch to a heavier SPF 15 (which should be fine since I&#x27;m outside less) because my skin does feel a bit dry, but finding a heavier product is a lot easier than finding a light one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so bummed that I have to find a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this.</li>
            <li>Nano-particles or not, I think I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li>and I actually look decent instead of like a greasy teenager, which is more than I can say for any other face sunblock I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Sunscreens were never something I used until just recently, because I don&#x27;t enjoy being outside</li>
            <li>Frankly it uses a very old and inexpensive method of sun protection - zinc oxide - yet at almost $20 for a 2.5 oz.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very sensitive to how things smell</li>
            <li>it is completely overpriced, vegan or not!  </li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to other reviewers who had similar experiences with this product.  </li>
            <li>so I use my regular one first and add this over it.</li>
            <li>It has clearly changed with the new formula</li>
            <li>I used the body sunscreen in the past and really liked it although I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was actually protecting my skin from UVA/UVB rays.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it like I used to!!!  :(</li>
            <li>I do like the light smell of it, but I do get those little pieces of lotion that come off when I apply my make-</li>
            <li>But to my great disappointment this bottle I bought was not not even close.</li>
            <li>The EltaMD clear does rub in to a clear finish though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing skin care products from Amazon anymore unless it is clear that the product is returnable.</li>
            <li>It used to go on clear.  </li>
            <li>This product is natural.</li>
            <li>I got this sunscreen at my local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to settle for SPF of just 15, which is most common.  </li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li>Uncoated zinc oxide is not nearly as effective as coated zinc oxide in filtering UV rays and is more photo-reactive (meaning it can react to UV rays and damage your skin).</li>
            <li>and my skin is ultra sensitive.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m allergic to all the others plus I spend so much time outside</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 years old and have tried everything.  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars instead of one because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really hoping they change back...</li>
            <li>*micronized* zinc oxide&#x3D; gentle sunblock without the white</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that it has natural ingredients and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>It feels soft and moisturizing, and it protects my skin.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s chalky and very pasty white on the face.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve found it doesn&#x27;t protect from the sun like the early formula</li>
            <li>Let me just preface that I am a natural skin product CONNOISSEUR.</li>
            <li>I have tried and tested literally every natural skin toner, moisturizer, exfoliator -</li>
            <li>So anyway, my go to natural sunscreen was Mychelle&#x27;s 28</li>
            <li>Devita, being the &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; natural skin care line has this sunscreen saying that it moisturizes while providing SPF protection.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I purchase Devita Natural Skin Care Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30+ from Vitacost or iHerb.    </li>
            <li>truly bummed because I spent alot of time looking for a good moisturizer with at least an SPF 30 rating that wasn&#x27;t toxic.</li>
            <li>I then had a major rosacea flare up!!</li>
            <li>the fixed version is available directly through them and later through other suppliers...</li>
            <li>It blends in clear, easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or heavy!</li>
            <li>But I was quickly let down.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when I order it, I get a version that goes on white and takes a decent amount of rubbing in.</li>
            <li>They also rate highly with the EWG/Skin Deep Database.</li>
            <li>I took a risk and bought some at the store again a couple months later, and it was back to normal!!</li>
            <li>I still stand by my original assessment that this sunscreen applies easily, but I am highly wary of whether it actually protects against UV rays.   </li>
            <li>I use Devita Natural Skin Care Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30 + to prevent the worsening of my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from acne as well as general sun damage.</li>
            <li>I used to LOVE this stuff, but the last few I have gotten have been different.  </li>
            <li>Contrary to other natural face SPF creams like 100% pure, this one goes on clear.</li>
            <li>While there was a new zinc supplier, the product was the same.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a new bottle and noticed that the lotion was whiter/thicker in application.</li>
            <li>When you open the lid next time, do it over the sink as the water will spill off, but I still find it much easier than fishing the flake off my face.</li>
            <li>my face is not overly shiny, it actually gives my face a smooth matte finish after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It can go on a tiny bit chalky - only because it has so much zinc oxide -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about what I&#x27;ll put on my face and have been looking for a facial sunscreen I could tolerate putting on daily.</li>
            <li>It has broad spectrum protection.</li>
            <li>I hope DeVita reads all of these reviews and brings back the old formula!</li>
            <li>A little pricey but evades phthalate (endocrine disruptor) absorption of many other brands.</li>
            <li>I love that the moisturizer is even less greasy than my previous tube.  </li>
            <li>I try to apply it by dabbing small amounts on many small areas, rather than taking a glob and rubbing it in a large area.  </li>
            <li>Purchased my own 2.5 oz version on Amazon and immediately after putting it on my face I noticed a rancid smell and a few little white balls of goo that formed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here to tell you this issue has made this product go from amazing to completely useless.  </li>
            <li>I am perplexed by the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s back to clear again...</li>
            <li>they need to bring the old formula back!</li>
            <li>Finally a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my hyper sensitive skin break out</li>
            <li>It is one of only a handful of items that I can use on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>While friends burned in Aruba I barely tanned.</li>
            <li>The change of the zinc ingredient makes it much whiter, clumpy and harder to rub in fully.</li>
            <li>The Devita website&#x27;s customer reviews on this product state that the old formula is back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I do notice that my face seems to tan a little more with this spf moisturizer than some of my previous ones.</li>
            <li>The new formula leaves specks of white all over my face, especially in my eyebrows and eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I put a dab of her lotion on the back of my hand, and a dab of my new lotion next to it.</li>
            <li>so I really needed to avoid chemicals and any other irritants in my skin care products.</li>
            <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t get fully absorbed and would leave dried flakes on my face especially around my nose and my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>the very thin, almost transparent white kind of brightens your complexion a bit.</li>
            <li>The new formulation leaves my skin dry with a white residue.</li>
            <li>you only use it once/day and live in a dry region (like I do)</li>
            <li>Generally the fact that I look like I just stepped out of an Irish stereotype factory renders me largely immune to what other people claim is a white film left by mineral sunblocks, but not in this case.</li>
            <li>Now it is very chalky, and the mere act of rubbing it on makes these little white particles form all over your skin, kind of like the rubbery leftovers from a pencil eraser.  </li>
            <li>If you loved this product as your daily moisturizer you will be sadly disappointed by the new formula.</li>
            <li>I have tested it out and it flakes on me, particularly if I have other stuff on my face.</li>
            <li>It never makes me break out, which is my main concern with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>On the down side, large portions of it don&#x27;t rub in, and leave visible white gunk on your skin.</li>
            <li>actually hadn&#x27;t realized that my previous spf moisturizers had irritated my face so much until I started using this moisturizer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a moisturizer with a higher SPF and eco-conscious ingredients!</li>
            <li>Badger-thick, hard to blend and whitening; Ava Anderson-thick and whitening; Suntegrity-thick and hard to blend in but smelled nice..</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>

            <li> This used to be a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe Devita has reformulated, I can&#x27;t attest to that, but this is my best option for sun protection.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> and so this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> best combination of price and quality</li>
            <li> While the packaging may leave something to be desired, the stuff itself is wonderful.</li>

            <li> I am a bit of a sunscreen connoisseur, and after 30 years this is the best product I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> That was the best choice I could have ever made.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I just received this moisturizer yesterday and I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen ever!!!</li>
            <li> She also recommended Sanitas spf too which is very good</li>
            <li> This is very good face cream with SPF 30.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a sunscreen that is as ideal as this use to be and still have yet to find one.</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> I used this moisturizer for over a year and loved it and was very happy with the ingredients.</li>
            <li> What a shame, this stuff USED to be great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a great experience with it</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection under makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this project for years, and, like others have said, it was great until DeVita changed the product.  </li>
            <li> This one is great for the face.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Today I ordered Devita&#x27;s Solar Body Moisturizer and hope it will be just as great.</li>
            <li> Great spf</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lotion with the added benefit of sunscreen that does not use nano particles.</li>
            <li> He says it is not greasy and feels great.</li>
            <li> It is the best sunscreen/moisturizer and I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> He said he has tried absolutely every type of sunscreen on the market, with a preference for sports sunscreens, and he said this one worked the best and had the best tactical application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it</li>
            <li> up to this point the best I found was Keys because it smoothed on easily and was non-whitening</li>
            <li> I had a good experience for a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I loved the way this made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I loved the way it smelled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really fair though,</li>
            <li> Protects and moisturizes, good product</li>
            <li> I borrowed a friend&#x27;s 7 oz version on this and loved it.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s a good consistency</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> (that I hadn&#x27;t seen in a good 7 months).</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a good 3 weeks before deciding to quit using it.</li>
            <li> Goes on well, not greasy, smells good.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to tell u all that it works effectively and am happy that it&#x27;s safe.    </li>
            <li> I love how this product has great ingredients and is basically as good as sunscreen gets.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is also a great moisturizer without causing oil skin to look more oily.</li>
            <li> Great clean product!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer/sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you rub it in well!</li>
            <li> Uuuuummm, are you sure this is a sunscreen?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a lightweight mineral sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher and this one seemed perfect.</li>
            <li> I found this and love it!  </li>
            <li> my skin feels better than ever!  </li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Over all, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love Devita!</li>
            <li> This product goes on so smoothly, leaving my skin feeling great.  </li>
            <li> I liked the texture when I tried it 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> I really liked it</li>
            <li> nice, non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A friend tried it at my house after she realized she forgot to pack her own and</li>
            <li> I honestly wondered what people were complaining about....</li>
            <li> but in my experience if I apply it over a serum or oil of any kind then it goes on like it used to.</li>
            <li> I liked the tube version.</li>
            <li> I charted ingredients for some moisturizing sunscreens, and chose this one because it has many good ingredients (aloe vera, glycerin, hyaluronic acid (vegan source), allantoin, grape seed extract, etc.)</li>
            <li> Very nice sunscreen, light, not oily.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and seems to do a good job of protecting from the sun.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist specifically recommended this product to me, and I have been very impressed with it so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this item with enthusiasm because my friend recommended it as &amp;#34;the best natural SPF moisturizer&amp;#34; she had ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  67 with sensitive skin, and this is the best moisturizer with SPF that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is very light.  </li>
            <li> The texture is that of a very light lotion, almost gel-like.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead, with very fair, sensitive, and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light feel, and does not sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stunning.</li>
            <li> It does make for a nice light moisturized, but I didn&#x27;t trust Devita for sun protection after what I&#x27;ve learned.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I also love that is has an SPF of 30.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it and will use it forever.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, where this does rub in it&#x27;s lovely and matte</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has sunscreen in it, too.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for warmer months, especially since my skin tends to be a bit on the oily side.  </li>
            <li> I used to love this product - it was my go-to-spf.</li>
            <li> On the Devita homepage they claimed that it was &amp;#34;back and better than ever&amp;#34; so I took a leap of faith and bought it.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I just wish there were more stuff in the bottle...</li>
            <li> This SPF was my favorite ever for over a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a shame because this was probably the best SPF I had ever used until they changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the cream and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Love ingredients</li>
            <li> This is the best mineral sunscreen daily moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried to date.  </li>
            <li> I love that is has hylauronic acid in it and does not contain silicones or retinoids.</li>
            <li> Wish the company would be more forthcoming wit the date.</li>
            <li> Devita, would love to hear from you.</li>
            <li> I still love it because it&#x27;s a 30 spf sunscreen that does not have parabens and a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Normally, it is an awesome facial moisturizer with sunblock (always ordered through Luckyvitamin).  </li>
            <li> I love this block.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it&#x27;s ever looked.</li>
            <li> I love using this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> For all this time until my most recent purchase, the moisturizer was perfect.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the protection.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite SPF which I am going to purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product was that is has no added fragrance.</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens and lotions have fragrance of some sort, which bothers my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for a couple years, and like some reviewers have said, it used to be better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really love it because it moisturizes perfectly without clogging pores or leaving white residue.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more items in the line.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but in a perfect world....</li>
            <li> I love that it is made from all-natural products.</li>
            <li> but I am going to shop around and see if I can get a better price.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> I used to love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my very effective, yet very toxic Neutrogena sunscreen.</li>
            <li> They use really high quality materials and it feels great.</li>
            <li> I like the texture, the easy absorption, and the fact that it is a light but effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is mild, yet effective.</li>
            <li> It had to be the older version, it was sooo nice!</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and don&#x27;t like the feel of regular sunscreen on my face.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s great - goes on clear.</li>
            <li> Best of all it is natural and well rated by the environmental working group, which is how I stumbled across this recommended product when I googled the bliss good skintentions I was using only to find out</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like normal spf and it has a great light lotion texture that makes it easy for makeup application afterwards.</li>
            <li> SPF, environmentally friendly, non-toxic (good rating from the Environmental Working Group) and reasonably priced every-day face lotion!</li>
            <li> They then told me that it has been worked with and changed to be more like the original and</li>
            <li> The whiteness faded very quickly, and it is matte to the touch rather than shiny like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use that</li>
            <li> I have always liked how this product feels and works especially since I&#x27;ve had skin cancer and need good protection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While a fine review -- it is not mine, so</li>
            <li> I once got a tube that was not as creamy in consistency as all of the others I&#x27;ve ever gotten, but the product still worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It smell fine and does not get rancid.</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars as the ingredients are great (excellent EWG rating) and other than the white goo ball problem it goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> Like very much!!</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t apply or absorb smoothly and feels like there is grit in the lotion.</li>
            <li> I feel obligated to update my review in light of information that Devita uses UNCOATED zinc oxide in their sunscreens.</li>
            <li> However, because it got such great ratings on the EWG website for safety I decided that I would just buy it for my mom (who probably never had acne in her life).  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer does not contain gluten, which is important for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working great until the last bottle I received.</li>
            <li> (Fortunately I was at the end of the tube).</li>
            <li> Lost its primary advantage which was ease of application.</li>
            <li> The texture was like moisturizer or lotion and it was light weigh on my face.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the EWG website, as it is a sunscreen/moisturizer that&#x27;s free of oxybenzone.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and feels great!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to finally find THE SUNSCREEN!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen and it goes on even and smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with the product and I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Basically a great daily moisturizer+sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It has a nice gentle scent and is silky to put on your face.</li>
            <li> The package says it&#x27;s good through 2016, so I have to assume the smell and goo are not because the product is old.</li>
            <li> I ended up with the old formulation and I LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like using moisturizer or sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I love the SPF 30 protection too, and I love that it gets high marks from the Environmental Working Group.  </li>
            <li> Original review</li>
            <li> and I combine it with Devita Evening Rich moisturizer, too.</li>
            <li> I know some people think $16 is a steep price to pay for a sunscreen, but I think it is WELL worth it!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen used to be so emollient - but the tube I received on Friday does not contain the original formula.  </li>
            <li> This gives me that protection and the moisturizer my dry skin needs at a great price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total shame because the old formulation was literally the perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (though what it does have is pleasant), and I&#x27;ve never had any white residue at all.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> I loved the way it wasn&#x27;t sticky and didn&#x27;t leave a white film.  </li>
            <li> The only issue he have to test how good it is with preventing tanning of the skin.</li>
            <li> All-natural, good for your skin, physical sunblock (no nano-particled laboratory experiments), disappears and absorbs into skin well, not TOO pricey considering</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t given it a true sunburn test yet,</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is good to use every morning, but I always try to reapply later in the day.</li>
            <li> This just brightens your face and makes you feel good about going outside.</li>
            <li> I have used this for at least a year and loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I waited a good 20 minutes before putting anything else on my face, and it flaked off entirely.</li>
            <li> Anyway, hers rubbed in fabulously while mine flaked right off again.</li>
            <li> it goes so quickly.</li>
            <li> You need to work quickly with it.</li>
            <li> (LOVE their products), but the spf leaves more of a white cast than Devita.</li>
            <li> This does not feel sticky when i put it on and has been an adequate sun protector.</li>
            <li> The original was lighter, creamier and absorbed right away.</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that it is natural and has a high concentration of zinc oxide.      </li>
            <li> I have tried several other natural products that received great reviews from the EWG as far as SPF effectiveness but none of them were perfect..</li>
            <li> The high zinc oxide % means it offers very good protection against UVA rays (the ones that cause aging and skin cancer), and it&#x27;s all natural formula absorbs pretty well and is non-irritating.</li>
            <li> and it made my face feel as calm as it did before I started using anything on it.</li>
            <li> Very even and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled with the Devita product and will DEFINITELY buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got a sample and so far it&#x27;s ok,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> I understand that zinc oxide is a barrier sunscreen and is not meant to absorb, but it seemed like none of the lotion, even the moisturizers, absorbed, leaving a somewhat sticky layer on my face all day.  </li>
            <li> I tried this at Whole Foods &amp; loved it instantly.</li>
            <li> After exhausting amounts of research I decided to try Devita Solar Protective Moisturizer which seemed like the best option.</li>
            <li> I gave Devita 2 stars because it did not leave my face white nor did it smell like chalk which is incredible for a physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It has a really high concentration of zinc oxide, yet goes on unbelievably easily.</li>
            <li> The first day I opened my new tube the top broke off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other micro sunscreens, and there&#x27;s definitely more thickness to them and more whiteness before they are rubbed in.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena made his face itch and breakout as did other good brands, but we found a winner with this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Devita, I hope you read all these reviews and try to right this.</li>
            <li> Flakes off right away, how is it supposed to protect my skin when it&#x27;s flaking off already?</li>
            <li> I had read all the reviews on this product before I had purchased it and decided I needed to try it out for myself to determine whether or not it would be the right product for me.</li>
            <li> It melts right into the skin and no greyish film.</li>
            <li> It is just right for one&#x27;s face, day in and day out.  </li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and light, and it quickly absorbs into my skin without leaving a white residue.</li>
            <li> this used to be the absolute best sun screen but now, since the reformulation, leaves my face white and dry looking.</li>
            <li> The product is VERY easy to spread and cover the entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old male who was looking for the best physical sunscreen for my skin.</li>
            <li> It is highly rated as both effective and as a safe product with little to no chemicals known to cause health problems.</li>
            <li> seems to be a good solid product and does what it is supposed to do as far as moisturizing and protecting against the sun.</li>
            <li> but since it is naturally oily, as the day progresses, most moisturizers tend to be too much.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that on my skin, it went on pretty smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could afford this whole line!</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product at my local health food store, and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> saw a youtube video demonstration of how this Devita sunscreen works better than another physical sunscreen before I bought it.</li>
            <li> If I had purchased this through my local store (which carries it at a higher price than Amazon) I would be able to return it.</li>
            <li> The box said \\&quot;back and better than ever.\\</li>
            <li> Haha what a joke!</li>
            <li> Sure, go ahead and put it on and then walk around all day with white streaks and flakes on your face because this stuff doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li> So if you order it you may get lucky and end up with an older tube or you may not.</li>
            <li> Thanks EWG and Amazon !</li>
            <li> The old formula went on smooth and never clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> So sad as this used to be the best stuff ever.</li>
            <li> The ingredients were natural and the texture of this lotion/lightweight cream felt smooth.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the 2.5oz tube version with the following ingredients:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been back for about a year or more now.</li>
            <li> So read the most current reviews!</li>
            <li> This product does not smell, it is extremely smooth, and it does go on clear.</li>
            <li> I like most how it protects but the next thing in line is how it goes on my face.</li>
            <li> And, my husband is willing to use this product, which is a milestone.</li>
            <li> That said, I went on Amazon and purchased this for the first time.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and moist and disappears completely in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> but you can blend it in pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love having to use only one lotion for sun protection and softening.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes when I order this, I get the sheer version that I used to know and love.  </li>
            <li> First product my picky husband tried for sun protection that he likes.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product but as it turns out the experience is exactly the opposite!  </li>
            <li> Interestingly, even though EltaMD Clear is a nano sunscreen with less zinc than Devita, there was definitely more whiteness to it than Devita, which makes me doubt the zinc content in Devita.</li>
            <li> : At this point I have probably purchased and tried around two dozen natural sunscreens for the face, and this is by far my favorite one.</li>
            <li> Before switching my skincare regimin to these two products, I wouldn&#x27;t have dreamed of going out in public without foundation makeup, but now my skin looks good enough to do so.</li>
            <li> Zinc Oxide is naturally white, so this product does an extremely good job at making it as sheer as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> happens more often if you apply it on top of any other product such as lotions or, in my case, an anti-acne gel.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> It became lumpy very quickly and left lumps and flakes on my face that need to be washed off.</li>
            <li> moisturizer has a barely creamy texture that goes on extremely smoothly and readily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> you might get lucky and get the clear one, or you might get the whiter chaulky one.  </li>
            <li> Burnout goes on clear, my face stays smooth and normal looking too.</li>
            <li> It was like applying pure zinx oxide with no moisturizing qualities.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have any strange odors, it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy, and most importantly for me, it never left any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of the lotion spreading on smoothly and getting absorbed into my skin, it started clumping  and getting dry strands on my face.</li>
            <li> There are also fine particles left on my face.</li>
            <li> The product is a manageable cream, neither runny nor too solid, and it smooths onto the skin quickly and DISAPPEARS!</li>
            <li> Other than this, the product is extremely easy to use, and I actually like it better than the non SPF face moisturizer I had been using.  </li>
            <li> This last bottle was a huge disappoinment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair-skinned</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light yet moisturizing, didn&#x27;t clog my pores, didn&#x27;t leave a white cast.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t see how Devita would have as much zinc in it as they say.</li>
            <li> How disappointing, this used to be the best sunscreen ever!  </li>
            <li> It used to go on smooth, leave no greasy residue or white cast, and it smelled almost like almonds.  </li>
            <li> Much thicker and whiter.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a couple years for a natural, safe and effective moisturizer/sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy or white.</li>
            <li> My esthetician highly recommended this product to me!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I am very disapointed and will not buy it again</li>
            <li> I really like all De Vita products.  </li>
            <li> I found it don&#x27;t go on as smooth as my regular moisturizer</li>
            <li> like it so much she had me send her the info for it</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thanks to EWG&#x27;s recommendations.  </li>
            <li> My friend is really bummed and even approached the company, which said they made the change and they are sticking with</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t have much of a sheen at all, and I use it under a very light/partial application of foundation.</li>
            <li> It also feels very inert and non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Goes on light and rubs in easily, not white.</li>
            <li> The biggest issue is that the quality of this sunscreen is very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> I really like that this is a Vegan product and works really well for the face.</li>
            <li> There is no way this product could ever have received anything but one star from a real user.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT smell like sunscreen and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover an area that you want protected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> However, it is very sunny in Florida</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have finally found an SPF moisturizer than I can wear everyday and not just when it&#x27;s absolutely necessary.  </li>
            <li> Even if not, well worth it product for those with sensitive skins and allergic tendencies.</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite facial sunscreen (I&#x27;ve tried quite a few)--it&#x27;s not greasy or drying, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, it works well under makeup, and it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do--</li>
            <li> So far I have not had any acne issues and my skin remains more matte during the entire day, compared to when I did not have any sunscreen on.  </li>
            <li> I also use this product with harsh meds like Epiduo and AHA 15% which kind of burned a bit, but I did not notice any problems using the sunscreen over the meds.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this SPF as my HG product for at least 5 years and have loved it.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a few days and so far so good.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, and you don&#x27;t have to use much, so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> but so far, with the right cleanser, it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal costumer who genuinely believed this was going to be my sunscreen for life, however after going through a total of four bottles in which the application of the product was no longer smooth, left a noticeable white film, and would rub after drying, I gave up.</li>
            <li> However, the product has screened out the tanning effect of the sun better than any other I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> (It uses zinc oxide) as the main ingredient and so much safer on the skin.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going out hiking or to the beach, I&#x27;ll use a more conventional SPF cream for longer lasting/stronger protection.</li>
            <li> Many of the zinc sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried have been unkind to my skin, or feel too thick and sticky to be comfortable (namely, the natural sunscreen sticks with beeswax in them).</li>
            <li> My only regret is that it is pricey for full body coverage</li>
            <li> Sometimes leaves a white trace but not bad.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen felt nice but it had a grainy texture to it right away, almost as if tiny little beads were suppose to be in this lotion like a scrub.</li>
            <li> So much that it doesn&#x27;t act like a sunscreen at all but rather like a moisturizer- hard to believe it is so effective...</li>
            <li> As many others have mentioned the previous formula has been changed.</li>
            <li> The main component I need in a moisturizer is the SPF</li>
            <li> product did change (as you can see from older reviews).</li>
            <li> After several minutes of a mildly damp feeling where I&#x27;d used the product, there was no sensation at all, just nicely-moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this product for all skin types, including oily/combo.  </li>
            <li> No eye sting, highly rated by Environmental Working Group.</li>
            <li> Rated high on ewg.org/skindeep.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> new squeeze-tube, although it is plastic, not only hold more, but allows every last drop to be used without any voodoo rituals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li> tan VERY easily, and after driving with my left arm in the sun (window closed) for two hours there was a dusting of freckles on that forearm.</li>
            <li> I called the company that makes it and they confirmed that there had to use a different supplier for a certain ingredient and that made some difference similar to what I was describing.</li>
            <li> This product costs a great deal and simply rolls off the skin in little white balls.</li>
            <li> To conclude, after at least 5 years of using this amazing product I just ordered Hydropeptide&#x27;s spf.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and this sunscreen works really well for me.</li>
            <li> ; I really recommend this product for oily, sensitive, acne-prone skins like mine.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s pretty lightweight, barely has a scent</li>
            <li> Most zinc oxide sunscreens are really heavy.</li>
            <li> I put on make up while the lotion hasn&#x27;t dried it&#x27;s ok,</li>
            <li> As to the white flecks some reviewers have mentioned, I find them easily absorbed and not a problem.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t putting it near my eyes to start out with, but I live in a warm, and sometimes humid climate and every time I sweated even a little bit (not from exercise, but from simply walking across the parking lot into a store or from just moving around too much in my 78 degree house)</li>
            <li> I initially avoided purchasing the Devita moisturizer because of the negative reviews related to the formula change, but finally decided to try it one month ago and am very happy I did.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other users I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> In the winter I sometimes have to switch to a heavier SPF 15 (which should be fine since I&#x27;m outside less) because my skin does feel a bit dry, but finding a heavier product is a lot easier than finding a light one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so bummed that I have to find a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this.</li>
            <li> Nano-particles or not, I think I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li> and I actually look decent instead of like a greasy teenager, which is more than I can say for any other face sunblock I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Sunscreens were never something I used until just recently, because I don&#x27;t enjoy being outside</li>
            <li> Frankly it uses a very old and inexpensive method of sun protection - zinc oxide - yet at almost $20 for a 2.5 oz.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very sensitive to how things smell</li>
            <li> it is completely overpriced, vegan or not!  </li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to other reviewers who had similar experiences with this product.  </li>
            <li> so I use my regular one first and add this over it.</li>
            <li> It has clearly changed with the new formula</li>
            <li> I used the body sunscreen in the past and really liked it although I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was actually protecting my skin from UVA/UVB rays.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it like I used to!!!  :(</li>
            <li> I do like the light smell of it, but I do get those little pieces of lotion that come off when I apply my make-</li>
            <li> But to my great disappointment this bottle I bought was not not even close.</li>
            <li> The EltaMD clear does rub in to a clear finish though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing skin care products from Amazon anymore unless it is clear that the product is returnable.</li>
            <li> It used to go on clear.  </li>
            <li> This product is natural.</li>
            <li> I got this sunscreen at my local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to settle for SPF of just 15, which is most common.  </li>
            <li> I like how it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li> Uncoated zinc oxide is not nearly as effective as coated zinc oxide in filtering UV rays and is more photo-reactive (meaning it can react to UV rays and damage your skin).</li>
            <li> and my skin is ultra sensitive.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m allergic to all the others plus I spend so much time outside</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old and have tried everything.  </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars instead of one because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really hoping they change back...</li>
            <li> *micronized* zinc oxide&#x3D; gentle sunblock without the white</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that it has natural ingredients and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> It feels soft and moisturizing, and it protects my skin.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s chalky and very pasty white on the face.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found it doesn&#x27;t protect from the sun like the early formula</li>
            <li> Let me just preface that I am a natural skin product CONNOISSEUR.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tested literally every natural skin toner, moisturizer, exfoliator -</li>
            <li> So anyway, my go to natural sunscreen was Mychelle&#x27;s 28</li>
            <li> Devita, being the &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; natural skin care line has this sunscreen saying that it moisturizes while providing SPF protection.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I purchase Devita Natural Skin Care Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30+ from Vitacost or iHerb.    </li>
            <li> truly bummed because I spent alot of time looking for a good moisturizer with at least an SPF 30 rating that wasn&#x27;t toxic.</li>
            <li> I then had a major rosacea flare up!!</li>
            <li> the fixed version is available directly through them and later through other suppliers...</li>
            <li> It blends in clear, easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or heavy!</li>
            <li> But I was quickly let down.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I order it, I get a version that goes on white and takes a decent amount of rubbing in.</li>
            <li> They also rate highly with the EWG/Skin Deep Database.</li>
            <li> I took a risk and bought some at the store again a couple months later, and it was back to normal!!</li>
            <li> I still stand by my original assessment that this sunscreen applies easily, but I am highly wary of whether it actually protects against UV rays.   </li>
            <li> I use Devita Natural Skin Care Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30 + to prevent the worsening of my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from acne as well as general sun damage.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE this stuff, but the last few I have gotten have been different.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to other natural face SPF creams like 100% pure, this one goes on clear.</li>
            <li> While there was a new zinc supplier, the product was the same.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased a new bottle and noticed that the lotion was whiter/thicker in application.</li>
            <li> When you open the lid next time, do it over the sink as the water will spill off, but I still find it much easier than fishing the flake off my face.</li>
            <li> my face is not overly shiny, it actually gives my face a smooth matte finish after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It can go on a tiny bit chalky - only because it has so much zinc oxide -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what I&#x27;ll put on my face and have been looking for a facial sunscreen I could tolerate putting on daily.</li>
            <li> It has broad spectrum protection.</li>
            <li> I hope DeVita reads all of these reviews and brings back the old formula!</li>
            <li> A little pricey but evades phthalate (endocrine disruptor) absorption of many other brands.</li>
            <li> I love that the moisturizer is even less greasy than my previous tube.  </li>
            <li> I try to apply it by dabbing small amounts on many small areas, rather than taking a glob and rubbing it in a large area.  </li>
            <li> Purchased my own 2.5 oz version on Amazon and immediately after putting it on my face I noticed a rancid smell and a few little white balls of goo that formed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here to tell you this issue has made this product go from amazing to completely useless.  </li>
            <li> I am perplexed by the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s back to clear again...</li>
            <li> they need to bring the old formula back!</li>
            <li> Finally a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my hyper sensitive skin break out</li>
            <li> It is one of only a handful of items that I can use on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> While friends burned in Aruba I barely tanned.</li>
            <li> The change of the zinc ingredient makes it much whiter, clumpy and harder to rub in fully.</li>
            <li> The Devita website&#x27;s customer reviews on this product state that the old formula is back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I do notice that my face seems to tan a little more with this spf moisturizer than some of my previous ones.</li>
            <li> The new formula leaves specks of white all over my face, especially in my eyebrows and eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I put a dab of her lotion on the back of my hand, and a dab of my new lotion next to it.</li>
            <li> so I really needed to avoid chemicals and any other irritants in my skin care products.</li>
            <li> The lotion doesn&#x27;t get fully absorbed and would leave dried flakes on my face especially around my nose and my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> the very thin, almost transparent white kind of brightens your complexion a bit.</li>
            <li> The new formulation leaves my skin dry with a white residue.</li>
            <li> you only use it once/day and live in a dry region (like I do)</li>
            <li> Generally the fact that I look like I just stepped out of an Irish stereotype factory renders me largely immune to what other people claim is a white film left by mineral sunblocks, but not in this case.</li>
            <li> Now it is very chalky, and the mere act of rubbing it on makes these little white particles form all over your skin, kind of like the rubbery leftovers from a pencil eraser.  </li>
            <li> If you loved this product as your daily moisturizer you will be sadly disappointed by the new formula.</li>
            <li> I have tested it out and it flakes on me, particularly if I have other stuff on my face.</li>
            <li> It never makes me break out, which is my main concern with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> On the down side, large portions of it don&#x27;t rub in, and leave visible white gunk on your skin.</li>
            <li> actually hadn&#x27;t realized that my previous spf moisturizers had irritated my face so much until I started using this moisturizer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a moisturizer with a higher SPF and eco-conscious ingredients!</li>
            <li> Badger-thick, hard to blend and whitening; Ava Anderson-thick and whitening; Suntegrity-thick and hard to blend in but smelled nice..</li>
            <li> And then I got to try other zinc based sunscreens like EltaMD Clear that only has 9% of zinc was around 13% that Devita Solar has.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a *little* moisture (especially for that post-washed dryness).</li>
            <li> only con:&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be blended pretty well, otherwise it will leave a white residue in certain areas, especially around the nose and jaw line (not to be confused with the dreadful white cast of other sunscreens); this is more like traces of the product that can be easily swiped away with a blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> He has to be very careful as he has had biopsies on some spots on his face, which caught early.  </li>
            <li> I think the key is to apply it in small dabs, and if your skin is dry to begin with, try moisturizing first.</li>
            <li> There were a ton of small white particles, that got into my eyebrows and hairline, and it really did feel thicker than the tester I tried.</li>
            <li> The active sunscreening ingredient in Devita Natural Skin Care Solar Protective Moisturizer, SPF 30, is Zinc oxide (19%).</li>
            <li> It does leave some white speckles on your face if you don&#x27;t let it dry in or don&#x27;t rub it in well enough, but don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying this product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long in the sun, but maybe I just don&#x27;t reapply as often as I should.</li>
            <li> Good luck :(</li>
            <li> It leaves white streaks and flakes all over the face, even when you don&#x27;t have dry skin.</li>
            <li> most recent purchase however was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> My retinoid makes my skin dry enough sometimes</li>
            <li> Use it on my face every single day, and it is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Every single time I put this stuff on my face, within 2 minutes of application, my face turned so very red.</li>
            <li> Because like other reviewers state, they have recently had issues with a specific ingredient.</li>
            <li> skin is very dry, so the moisturizing factor is essential.</li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin and sometimes (especially during winter)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the hassle since it&#x27;s hard to find a natural sunscreen in general</li>
            <li> Too bad I liked it</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a year now, it leaves skin feeling soft, non oily, and no scent of harsh chemicals that you find in lotions with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> But I found an easier solution I&#x27;d like to share: before closing the container, put a few drops of water (directly from the sink) on the cap-lid.  </li>
            <li> Why did my tube just crack wide open?</li>
            <li> The facial moisturizer is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought some from Whole Foods at first and then reordered it from Amazon as it was significantly less expensive ($10 difference).</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is much better than any other product I have tried and does not leave a white cast or an oil slick behind.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t mean one or two flakes, I mean two dozen or more requiring careful removal with a makeup brush before applying any makeup to your face.  </li>
            <li> Like other people have mentioned, this does leave white flakes on your skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave much of a white sheen like other sun screens.</li>
            <li> The only reason this gets 4 of 5 stars is because sometimes at the end of a tube, the zinc clumps up, so you have a few minor white spots you need to brush off your face.</li>
            <li> I just put this on before i plan on doing makeup and leaving the house so that it has time to absorb and dry, then i just use my dry hand to brush off the flakes.</li>
            <li> Drier skinned peeps may want to layer in a moisturizing/balancing oil (I use argan (dry)</li>
            <li> My skin feels dry in the mornings after I wash it</li>
            <li> I also wanted something that wasn&#x27;t oil-based because one thing I can&#x27;t stand about sunscreens is how oily and shiny they make my skin (and I have dry skin).  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was the dry weather here, but after a week or so, I realized it was the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Minor setback, until I hear natural product hype about the &amp;#34;danger&amp;#34; of nano-particles in sunscreen, now I personally haven&#x27;t read to deep into what that is about, but if it&#x27;s unhealthy or unsafe - I&#x27;ll avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does control shine, although do not expect a completely flat, matte finish; a little primer afterwards is usually enough.</li>
            <li> Also because of it&#x27;s thin consistency (very much like a gel lotion), I was skeptical of how well it protected (I am prone to dark spots, so I very much limit my exposure to direct sunlight).  </li>
            <li> My only objection is that each tube can be a little different - sometimes thicker, sometimes thinner, sometimes a little sparkly - but definitely provides the moisture and protection that I need.</li>
            <li> and I had to scrub this product out of my skin with a wet wipe on my way to work, wasting every other product I had applied to my face prior to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Now will have to track down another non-toxic daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It has a mousse-like finish and feels greasy initially, but once it dries down it&#x27;s no longer shiny.</li>
            <li> However the last bottle I got from this vendor was a little strange.</li>
            <li> one issue, because it is less oily then their body moisturizer (which I use for my body but is too oily-rich for my face), and because the container is not completely air-tight, the part of the lotion at the nozzle can dry out and form a dry flake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it took this long to finish my other tube and begin using this one.  </li>
            <li> This formula is a little thicker, it has this grainy pieces in it, it it WHITE, it takes a little longer for it to absorb into the skin, the white cast is visible unless you rub in A LOT-</li>
            <li> It is now sticky and leaves little white flakes.  </li>
            <li> the* worst moisturizer I have ever used in my life second to the Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free SPF 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were hard to apply and left a white film.</li>
            <li> It also left white streaks that one commonly sees in low-quality sun blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Big disappointment, but I think I&#x27;ll use it on the rest of my body just to get some worth out of it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and research products exhaustively to find ones that will not affect my skin negatively.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy Devita because of a few customer reviews that said the formula had changed and it was leaving a white residue on the skin..</li>
            <li> every time you squirt out some sunscreen you get that flake mixed in, which you can fish for and separate out or find it on your face and remove it (messy either way).  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY NO BREAKOUTS.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 4 years now and my skin hasn&#x27;t aged a bit.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but I feel that it is worth it.</li>
            <li> product has absolutely NO MOISTURIZING qualities at all.</li>
            <li> you rub this in, it DRIES immediately, and then turns into a powder and turns any dead skin on your face porcelain white.</li>
            <li> It varies widely.  </li>
            <li> Devita, please change this back to your previous formula!</li>
            <li> I believed that DeVita changed their sunscreen formula because I can feel the small white particles and dry spot on my face after I applied it.</li>
            <li> I have tested just about all of the other similar products and this is the only one with 30 SPF that is not too thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way, so this tube lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and need serious sun protection for living near the equator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now after a long search for a vegan daily moisturizer with an SPF of at least 30.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that the Devita by itself made my skin incredibly tight, like it was getting dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy looking and doesn&#x27;t cause me to sweat like other zinc products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this problem with any other zinc-based SPF lotion, so there must just be something in this one that doesn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t had to use any other sunscreen on my face.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, your skin drinks it in, and there is no oily or waxy residue from the sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Oh, and I received the order in only a few days!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying other products.</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews here</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t have a slew of other issues.</li>
            <li> After landing on the cosmeticdatabase.com website by ewg.org, I decided to throw away all my skincare products with harmful parabens and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> I sweat the other types off.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy like other items.  </li>
            <li> but as soon as it is dry it does peel a little when applying any make-up.</li>
            <li> I would use my moisturizer and apply this SPF over it and it SOMEHOW manages to dry out all moisture and leave a powdery feel to my face &amp; highlight dead skin.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle version is hard to use when it gets low.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought this lotion, I like the fact that it is SPF30, which is hard to find in a face lotion.</li>
            <li> but it was very jarring and scary looking.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like getting dark.</li>
            <li> now the consistency is thick and white.</li>
            <li> it goes on sticky, thick, flaky and white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not greasy as other sunscreens; never!</li>
            <li> It used to be like low-fat milk and now its like half and half.</li>
            <li> My friend, who is a tennis instructor and spends half his life outdoors, recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars for the affordable price and high ewg rating, however it made my face break out unfortunately.</li>
            <li> A reviewer commented that there is no packaging date and that is not true.</li>
            <li> After the first few days of using this product, my skin began to flake like crazy.</li>
            <li> The old glass pump bottles made it difficult to use the last 20% of the product, and the cap would always crack, so it was not good for travel.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this up on my and my little one&#x27;s arms and legs, but am keeping it off the face to avoid that persistent rancid smell.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s even little grit pieces in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It have little to no fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> If I am outdoors ALL DAY I wear something with chemicals, but for everyday wear, this is divine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> What a rip off and waste of money.</li>
            <li> but once I finish my homemade one I&#x27;ll switch to this everyday.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I will not take the gamble and waste my money again.</li>
            <li> I looked into it a few years ago and have since lost the way to decode the date.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews that said it flaked off, but decided to get it anyway since those were the minority.</li>
            <li> This one did not and was recommended as green by the Environmental Working Group.  </li>
            <li> We both appreciate the absence of any irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li> And when I say it leaves visible white gunk, I mean white in relation to like the fifth palest complexion in the lower 48, which is the only reason I bother with stupid sunblock on my face to begin with.</li>
            <li> I have tried other chemical free sunscreens that were absolutely horrific and discouraging.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy, I used very little.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but it gets flaky and leaves parts of my face dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if the company will exchange the product.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> There really is no better SPF product on the market for faces.</li>
            <li> Then in the past year, they &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; their formula.</li>
            <li> I returned it and bought another one tube from a different vendor, same problem. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I just wore it casually for work days, not for a summer day outside.</li>
            <li> It is definitely grainier, drier, and can leave a white cast without a base serum/oil.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it is way too expensive for an SPF lotion.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with very pale skin</li>
            <li> I choose this moisturizer because the EWG rated it as least toxic moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s free of all the nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> AND it goes on smoothly, without nasty smells or shine, even for someone with oily/combination skin like myself???</li>
            <li> It was rated by the Environmental Working Group as one of the sunscreen and moisturizer combinations with the least harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, at least not the way it is now.</li>
            <li> He feels it&#x27;s too thick</li>
            <li> I was upset and called them and they sent me another bottle, but it was still too thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that lots of other reviewers were getting the changed</li>
            <li> if I were reviewing Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;review\\&quot; function, it would be dissed for being seriously misdirected and unreliable.</li>
            <li> Also, I have gone trekking in deserts with this on, and never burn (I&#x27;m not particularly fair skinned, but do have the tendency to burn).</li>
            <li> This sunscreen flakes like crazy when I use it soon after other skin products.</li>
            <li> I hated the fact that anytime I got it anywhere near my eyes it burned.  </li>
            <li> The zinc makes it filmy like you are smearing thin mud on your face.</li>
            <li> , it would have saved me a lot of money and unnecessary sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> The quality is absolutely horrible for something priced this high.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product has changed or if this was a bad batch?</li>
            <li> Really sad that devita changed their formula.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the numbers on the crimped end of the tube are a coded date.</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t make the skin white and stays matte but those flakes are too annoying!</li>
            <li> But expensive.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> however I am now stuck with an expensive tube that has brought back the worst of my rosacea</li>
            <li> It was completely useless.</li>
            <li> No feeling that the skin is suffocating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate, but it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THAT made me angry.</li>
            <li> This change is very disappointing, and not worth the money :(</li>
            <li> Also, it does not have the nasty typical sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> Further, it provides an awful base for makeup applications and &amp;#34;grabs&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointment and will never be using this again.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I give it four stars instead of five because my skin isn&#x27;t that crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this useless product!  </li>
            <li> but I am very sad.</li>
            <li> Product is grainy and impossible to rub in now.  </li>
            <li> My guess is that I got a bad batch or the heat during shipping has spoiled it.</li>
            <li> In my experience companies are often advised not to respond to reviews because they end up looking bad regardless of the response.</li>
            <li> it had a bad rating by the EWG.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t base my opinions off of one time failures, but I had tried to use this for days after and it still did not work.</li>
            <li> I am very very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> I cannot say how awful this stuff is</li>
            <li> This lotion is horrible.</li>
            <li> Worst sunscreen ever.</li>
            <li> This product ordered thru Amazon was horrible.  </li>
            <li> The texture is awful.</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No matter your skin tone, we all need to take care of our skin now to protect it from the damaging rays of the sun as well as premature aging.  This is wonderfully moisturizing product and has been serving me well for a bit.  Would definitely recommend it if your skin is tending to the drier or maturing side.</li>
            <li> I used this moisturizer for over a year and loved it and was very happy with the ingredients. This last bottle was a huge disappoinment. It became lumpy very quickly and left lumps and flakes on my face that need to be washed off. Such a shame that I will now need to switch moisturizers as this came recommended by EWG and I had a good experience for a year. They must have changed their formula or quality control.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light feel, and does not sting my eyes. It is the oly sunscreen I use on my face. It is a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and need serious sun protection for living near the equator. Many of the zinc sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried have been unkind to my skin, or feel too thick and sticky to be comfortable (namely, the natural sunscreen sticks with beeswax in them). I&#x27;ve also used MyChelle&#x27;s sun shield product, which I found to be waxy feeling on my face and would always wash off as soon as I was finished in the sun. My dermatologist specifically recommended this product to me, and I have been very impressed with it so far. The texture is smooth and light, and it quickly absorbs into my skin without leaving a white residue. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy looking and doesn&#x27;t cause me to sweat like other zinc products. THIS is the sunscreen I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite facial sunscreen (I&#x27;ve tried quite a few)--it&#x27;s not greasy or drying, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, it works well under makeup, and it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do--I&#x27;m very fair-skinned and I have never burned while wearing it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could afford this whole line! It&#x27;s stunning. They use really high quality materials and it feels great.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula, its NOT how it used to be. This formula is a little thicker, it has this grainy pieces in it, it it WHITE, it takes a little longer for it to absorb into the skin, the white cast is visible unless you rub in A LOT- but when you do that, it BALLS up. Horrible. What a shame, this stuff USED to be great. What did they do? The ingredients are the same...they need to bring the old formula back!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer/sunscreen! It has broad spectrum protection. I am a redhead, with very fair, sensitive, and acne-prone skin. This product is natural. I was looking to replace my very effective, yet very toxic Neutrogena sunscreen. Check out cosmeticdatabase.com to see how toxic your beauty products are. My skin is healthier in this stuff than it has ever been after years of using Neutrogena. I got this sunscreen at my local Whole Foods. It is expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I liked the texture when I tried it 4 years ago. It&#x27;s light yet moisturizing, didn&#x27;t clog my pores, didn&#x27;t leave a white cast. I just wore it casually for work days, not for a summer day outside. However, then I read it&#x27;s not FDA approved as a sunscreen since it doesn&#x27;t have the regular emblem sunscreens that have been approved have. And then I got to try other zinc based sunscreens like EltaMD Clear that only has 9% of zinc was around 13% that Devita Solar has. Interestingly, even though EltaMD Clear is a nano sunscreen with less zinc than Devita, there was definitely more whiteness to it than Devita, which makes me doubt the zinc content in Devita. The EltaMD clear does rub in to a clear finish though. I&#x27;ve tried other micro sunscreens, and there&#x27;s definitely more thickness to them and more whiteness before they are rubbed in. I just don&#x27;t see how Devita would have as much zinc in it as they say. It does make for a nice light moisturized, but I didn&#x27;t trust Devita for sun protection after what I&#x27;ve learned. I wonder if they&#x27;ve changed since then...</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m allergic to oxybenzone.  It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long in the sun, but maybe I just don&#x27;t reapply as often as I should.</li>
            <li> I loved the way this made my skin feel.  I loved the way it smelled.  I loved the way it wasn&#x27;t sticky and didn&#x27;t leave a white film.  I loved the fact that it is natural and has a high concentration of zinc oxide.      I hated the fact that anytime I got it anywhere near my eyes it burned.  I wasn&#x27;t putting it near my eyes to start out with, but I live in a warm, and sometimes humid climate and every time I sweated even a little bit (not from exercise, but from simply walking across the parking lot into a store or from just moving around too much in my 78 degree house) it ran into my eyes and burned.  I haven&#x27;t had this problem with any other zinc-based SPF lotion, so there must just be something in this one that doesn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li> How disappointing, this used to be the best sunscreen ever!  It used to go on smooth, leave no greasy residue or white cast, and it smelled almost like almonds.  Now it is very chalky, and the mere act of rubbing it on makes these little white particles form all over your skin, kind of like the rubbery leftovers from a pencil eraser.  Bummer!  I switched to Skinceuticals tinted spf 50 sunscreen and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> I used to recommend this product to everyone. It was perfect. Not anymore. The new formulation leaves my skin dry with a white residue. There are also fine particles left on my face. I&#x27;m so bummed that I have to find a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I read all the reviews saying that the product doesn&#x27;t absorb well and leaves your skin white. I&#x27;ve had a great experience with it--it&#x27;s pretty lightweight, barely has a scent (though what it does have is pleasant), and I&#x27;ve never had any white residue at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month as my only facial moisturizer, and I have no complaints whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While a fine review -- it is not mine, so if I were reviewing Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;review\\&quot; function, it would be dissed for being seriously misdirected and unreliable. Dian Coleman</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It is non greasy (absorbs well), lightweight and 100% vegan.  I also love that is has an SPF of 30.  It works well, I haven&#x27;t had to use any other sunscreen on my face.  It is perfect in every way!  I am so glad I found it and will use it forever.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, where this does rub in it&#x27;s lovely and matte and I actually look decent instead of like a greasy teenager, which is more than I can say for any other face sunblock I&#x27;ve tried. On the down side, large portions of it don&#x27;t rub in, and leave visible white gunk on your skin. Only way to get rid of it seems to be to rub it with a towel, at which point I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve rubbed the protective part off or not. And when I say it leaves visible white gunk, I mean white in relation to like the fifth palest complexion in the lower 48, which is the only reason I bother with stupid sunblock on my face to begin with. Generally the fact that I look like I just stepped out of an Irish stereotype factory renders me largely immune to what other people claim is a white film left by mineral sunblocks, but not in this case. Even Dracula would have his work cut out for him to blend this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for over a year now, it leaves skin feeling soft, non oily, and no scent of harsh chemicals that you find in lotions with sunscreen. Great clean product! Reasonably priced! I also use the eye lift creme!</li>
            <li> I choose this moisturizer because the EWG rated it as least toxic moisturizer.  I use it every morning and every night.  It works great.  I love that it has sunscreen in it, too.  It does leave some white speckles on your face if you don&#x27;t let it dry in or don&#x27;t rub it in well enough, but don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying this product.  Just make sure you rub it in well!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now after a long search for a vegan daily moisturizer with an SPF of at least 30.  I am a redhead with very pale skin and I didn&#x27;t want to settle for SPF of just 15, which is most common.  The moisturizer is very light.  It&#x27;s perfect for warmer months, especially since my skin tends to be a bit on the oily side.  In the winter I sometimes have to switch to a heavier SPF 15 (which should be fine since I&#x27;m outside less) because my skin does feel a bit dry, but finding a heavier product is a lot easier than finding a light one!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product but as it turns out the experience is exactly the opposite!  If your goal is to look like someone from a National Geographic picture of indigenous people using mud as a face decoration then this is for you.  This &amp;#34;back and better&amp;#34; version leaves a grayish, flaky mask on your face along with flecks of what I can only assume is the zinc oxide.  And I don&#x27;t mean one or two flakes, I mean two dozen or more requiring careful removal with a makeup brush before applying any makeup to your face.  As someone who exfoliates regularly, I can guarantee that this effect is strictly the result of the product and not of the condition of the skin before application.  Further, it provides an awful base for makeup applications and &amp;#34;grabs&amp;#34; product.  Frankly it uses a very old and inexpensive method of sun protection - zinc oxide - yet at almost $20 for a 2.5 oz. tube it is completely overpriced, vegan or not!  I should have paid more attention to other reviewers who had similar experiences with this product.  I cannot say how awful this stuff is and I am returning it for a refund.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product - it was my go-to-spf. now the consistency is thick and white. It used to be like low-fat milk and now its like half and half. Much thicker and whiter. It will be white on your face, if you try to blend it into your skin or reapply it will produce white flakes. I don&#x27;t know why they changed formulas but I am very sad. They did the same thing to the body version of this spf. I am disappointment and will never be using this again.</li>
            <li> I just received this moisturizer yesterday and I absolutely love it!!! I have been searching for a couple years for a natural, safe and effective moisturizer/sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling heavy or white. I was hesitant to buy Devita because of a few customer reviews that said the formula had changed and it was leaving a white residue on the skin.. On the Devita homepage they claimed that it was &amp;#34;back and better than ever&amp;#34; so I took a leap of faith and bought it. It&#x27;s amazing!!!!!! It blends in clear, easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or heavy! I have tried several other natural products that received great reviews from the EWG as far as SPF effectiveness but none of them were perfect.. Badger-thick, hard to blend and whitening; Ava Anderson-thick and whitening; Suntegrity-thick and hard to blend in but smelled nice.. up to this point the best I found was Keys because it smoothed on easily and was non-whitening but it did leave my skin sticky. I&#x27;m so thrilled with the Devita product and will DEFINITELY buy it again. Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product at my local health food store, and immediately fell in love with it. I have sensitive combination skin and this sunscreen works really well for me. A little goes a long way, your skin drinks it in, and there is no oily or waxy residue from the sunscreen! I refill the sample pot I have, and keep it in my purse. It is the best sunscreen/moisturizer and I am 100% satisfied. Oh, and I received the order in only a few days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of physical moisturizers and this is the one I&#x27;ve settled on.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Only one issue, because it is less oily then their body moisturizer (which I use for my body but is too oily-rich for my face), and because the container is not completely air-tight, the part of the lotion at the nozzle can dry out and form a dry flake.&lt;br /&gt;If you only use it once/day and live in a dry region (like I do) every time you squirt out some sunscreen you get that flake mixed in, which you can fish for and separate out or find it on your face and remove it (messy either way).  But I found an easier solution I&#x27;d like to share: before closing the container, put a few drops of water (directly from the sink) on the cap-lid.  That will keep the sunscreen moist enough that it won&#x27;t form the flake (but the water won&#x27;t mix up with it since it sits on the lid).  When you open the lid next time, do it over the sink as the water will spill off, but I still find it much easier than fishing the flake off my face.</li>
            <li> This is the one product that is close to being perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy as other sunscreens; never! The texture is that of a very light lotion, almost gel-like. Also, it does not have the nasty typical sunscreen smell. My oily, acne-prone skin feels refreshed and moisturized after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;It does control shine, although do not expect a completely flat, matte finish; a little primer afterwards is usually enough. ABSOLUTELY NO BREAKOUTS. Not a single.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con:&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be blended pretty well, otherwise it will leave a white residue in certain areas, especially around the nose and jaw line (not to be confused with the dreadful white cast of other sunscreens); this is more like traces of the product that can be easily swiped away with a blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;This happens more often if you apply it on top of any other product such as lotions or, in my case, an anti-acne gel.&lt;br /&gt;With this caveat; I really recommend this product for oily, sensitive, acne-prone skins like mine.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  My esthetician highly recommended this product to me! Product arrived swiftly as well. Looking forward to trying other products. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but it gets flaky and leaves parts of my face dry.&lt;br /&gt;But I like how it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was recommended by the environmental working group and had a low toxicity rating. The product doesn&#x27;t apply or absorb smoothly and feels like there is grit in the lotion. It left white particles on my face. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> The old glass pump bottles made it difficult to use the last 20% of the product, and the cap would always crack, so it was not good for travel.  Plus, the spray-on coating/label would always flake off and get into the product, and therefore, on my face.  Yuk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new squeeze-tube, although it is plastic, not only hold more, but allows every last drop to be used without any voodoo rituals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived as shown in time allotted.</li>
            <li> I feel obligated to update my review in light of information that Devita uses UNCOATED zinc oxide in their sunscreens. Uncoated zinc oxide is not nearly as effective as coated zinc oxide in filtering UV rays and is more photo-reactive (meaning it can react to UV rays and damage your skin). I still stand by my original assessment that this sunscreen applies easily, but I am highly wary of whether it actually protects against UV rays.   ------- Original review: At this point I have probably purchased and tried around two dozen natural sunscreens for the face, and this is by far my favorite one. It has a really high concentration of zinc oxide, yet goes on unbelievably easily. It takes awhile for it to sink into my face (makes my face really shiny for a few minutes) but then isn&#x27;t noticeable at all. Also, I have gone trekking in deserts with this on, and never burn (I&#x27;m not particularly fair skinned, but do have the tendency to burn). I just wish there were more stuff in the bottle... it goes so quickly.</li>
            <li> Finally a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my hyper sensitive skin break out AND it&#x27;s free of all the nasty chemicals.  Phew.  Search over.</li>
            <li> This SPF was my favorite ever for over a year. Then about 6 months ago, I bought a tube and the texture had totally changed. It was chalky and gritty and it didn&#x27;t wear well under makeup anymore. I contacted the company twice and got no response. Reading the other reviews here it seems they changed their formula which makes a lot of sense. It&#x27;s such a shame because this was probably the best SPF I had ever used until they changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since switched to John Master&#x27;s organic spf 30 and like it. It&#x27;s not too greasy and I can wear it under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devita, I hope you read all these reviews and try to right this. Seems like you&#x27;ve lost a boatload of customers.</li>
            <li> I have always liked how this product feels and works especially since I&#x27;ve had skin cancer and need good protection. The first day I opened my new tube the top broke off. I called Amazon and they gave me a refund. I love the cream and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Like other people have mentioned, this does leave white flakes on your skin. I was a big fan of this moisturizer before before they changed the formula but i bought it again in hopes it was still wearable. I just put this on before i plan on doing makeup and leaving the house so that it has time to absorb and dry, then i just use my dry hand to brush off the flakes. I don&#x27;t mind the hassle since it&#x27;s hard to find a natural sunscreen in general that doesn&#x27;t have a slew of other issues.</li>
            <li> I got a sample and so far it&#x27;s ok, my face is not overly shiny, it actually gives my face a smooth matte finish after a few minutes. The only issue he have to test how good it is with preventing tanning of the skin.</li>
            <li> This used to be my go-to daily face moisturizer protection.  However, it has been reformulated.  It is now sticky and leaves little white flakes.  So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very nice sunscreen, light, not oily.  Sometimes leaves a white trace but not bad.</li>
            <li> Uuuuummm, are you sure this is a sunscreen?! Zero white film and just feels like the divine face cream or my dreams! It&#x27;s my HG of sunscreens. Only gripe I have heard is that people claim to still get burned wearing it. If I am outdoors ALL DAY I wear something with chemicals, but for everyday wear, this is divine. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Buy this now!</li>
            <li> This used to be a wonderful product.  Not now. The current formulation leaves tiny white balls of yuck on your face after application.  I wrote the company and inquired about the formula change.  They assured me that there was no formula change.  While there was a new zinc supplier, the product was the same.  I&#x27;m here to tell you this issue has made this product go from amazing to completely useless.  I had to toss it.  What a shame.</li>
            <li> I agree with the recent reviews. This lotion is horrible. It leaves white streaks and flakes all over the face, even when you don&#x27;t have dry skin. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> this used to be the absolute best sun screen but now, since the reformulation, leaves my face white and dry looking. I am very disapointed and will not buy it again</li>
            <li> After landing on the cosmeticdatabase.com website by ewg.org, I decided to throw away all my skincare products with harmful parabens and other chemicals. After extensive research, I found this sunscreen/moisturizer. It was a miracle product. Not only it doesn&#x27;t contain the chemical ingredients in regular sunscreens, it also doesn&#x27;t contain the nano particles that some physical sunblocks contain. AND it goes on smoothly, without nasty smells or shine, even for someone with oily/combination skin like myself??? Bingo?! I&#x27;m sad that lots of other reviewers were getting the changed formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a youtube video demonstration of how this Devita sunscreen works better than another physical sunscreen before I bought it. Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> All-natural, good for your skin, physical sunblock (no nano-particled laboratory experiments), disappears and absorbs into skin well, not TOO pricey considering this is a cure-all for your face.  This didn&#x27;t make me break out and my skin is ultra sensitive.  I highly highly recommend this product for all skin types, including oily/combo.  It actually matte-ifies my T-zone.  Drier skinned peeps may want to layer in a moisturizing/balancing oil (I use argan (dry) and/or emu oil (problem spots, acne) in addition to this product on my combination skin).  I could tell you some things about the wonders of face oils but that is for a different product review.</li>
            <li> I break out with just about any product and based on reviews thought I&#x27;d break out with this one.  However, because it got such great ratings on the EWG website for safety I decided that I would just buy it for my mom (who probably never had acne in her life).  She did not like it because she had the same problems with the zinc oxide flaking off.  So I ended up getting the product back.  I was very surprised that on my skin, it went on pretty smoothly.  I try to apply it by dabbing small amounts on many small areas, rather than taking a glob and rubbing it in a large area.  So far I have not had any acne issues and my skin remains more matte during the entire day, compared to when I did not have any sunscreen on.  I did not notice any darkening or burning of the skin.  I also use this product with harsh meds like Epiduo and AHA 15% which kind of burned a bit, but I did not notice any problems using the sunscreen over the meds.  Overall it was a pleasant surprise.  I think the key is to apply it in small dabs, and if your skin is dry to begin with, try moisturizing first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an &amp;quot;year-round outside&amp;quot; person and need SPF 30 all the time.  This gives me that protection and the moisturizer my dry skin needs at a great price.  My only objection is that each tube can be a little different - sometimes thicker, sometimes thinner, sometimes a little sparkly - but definitely provides the moisture and protection that I need.</li>
            <li> If you loved this product as your daily moisturizer you will be sadly disappointed by the new formula. it goes on sticky, thick, flaky and white. I will wear it for sports/exercises but does not work for daily wear unless you like a white/flaky look on your face. Really sad that devita changed their formula. Now will have to track down another non-toxic daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Everyone is complaining that this goes on white but news flash: all zinc oxide based sunblocks do. It soaks in but does leave a hint of ghost tint. I&#x27;m really fair though, so it&#x27;s not really noticeable. I spend a lot of time in the sun, marathon training and lots of biking. I can tell this product works because my summer freckles have not appeared. I give it four stars instead of five because my skin isn&#x27;t that crazy about it. Tends to leave me some blotchiness. I worry about it clogging my pores but so far, with the right cleanser, it hasn&#x27;t. Wearing no sunblock is not an option for me and I&#x27;m allergic to all the others plus I spend so much time outside I sweat the other types off. Maybe Devita has reformulated, I can&#x27;t attest to that, but this is my best option for sun protection.</li>
            <li> Protects and moisturizes, good product</li>
            <li> You need to work quickly with it. It has a mousse-like finish and feels greasy initially, but once it dries down it&#x27;s no longer shiny. My boyfriend and I use this daily. It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> I really like all De Vita products.  I tried this as summer is coming.  I found it don&#x27;t go on as smooth as my regular moisturizer so I use my regular one first and add this over it.</li>
            <li> seems to be a good solid product and does what it is supposed to do as far as moisturizing and protecting against the sun.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  It is one of only a handful of items that I can use on my sensitive skin.  Plus it has a terrific SPF of 30!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer does not contain gluten, which is important for me.  It goes on easily, and you don&#x27;t have to use much, so it lasts a long time.  It also keeps me from getting sunburned.</li>
            <li> I borrowed a friend&#x27;s 7 oz version on this and loved it. Purchased my own 2.5 oz version on Amazon and immediately after putting it on my face I noticed a rancid smell and a few little white balls of goo that formed. The package says it&#x27;s good through 2016, so I have to assume the smell and goo are not because the product is old. If I had purchased this through my local store (which carries it at a higher price than Amazon) I would be able to return it. I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing skin care products from Amazon anymore unless it is clear that the product is returnable. I gave this two stars as the ingredients are great (excellent EWG rating) and other than the white goo ball problem it goes on smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t leave much of a white sheen like other sun screens. I will be using this up on my and my little one&#x27;s arms and legs, but am keeping it off the face to avoid that persistent rancid smell.</li>
            <li> Worst sunscreen ever. Flakes off right away, how is it supposed to protect my skin when it&#x27;s flaking off already? What a rip off and waste of money. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> I really liked it but my husband wasnt a fan. He feels it&#x27;s too thick but once I finish my homemade one I&#x27;ll switch to this everyday. Love ingredients and I think it&#x27;s a good consistency</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars for the affordable price and high ewg rating, however it made my face break out unfortunately.</li>
            <li> nice, non-greasy moisturizer. A friend tried it at my house after she realized she forgot to pack her own and like it so much she had me send her the info for it so she could buy it for herself.</li>
            <li> Have been using this moisturizer for about four years . It&#x27;s been working great until the last bottle I received. Instead of the lotion spreading on smoothly and getting absorbed into my skin, it started clumping  and getting dry strands on my face. My guess is that I got a bad batch or the heat during shipping has spoiled it. What a waste of money. Not sure if the company will exchange the product.</li>
            <li> Why? Because like other reviewers state, they have recently had issues with a specific ingredient. This issue is stated on their website. I decided to try it anyway and bought a tube. I ended up with the old formulation and I LOVED it. I honestly wondered what people were complaining about.... UNTIL I recently purchased a second tube. The box said \\&quot;back and better than ever.\\&quot; Haha what a joke! This tube contains a thicker whiter formula. It is basically unusable for its intended purpose as a daily moisturizer. Sure, go ahead and put it on and then walk around all day with white streaks and flakes on your face because this stuff doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin. The quality is absolutely horrible for something priced this high. So if you order it you may get lucky and end up with an older tube or you may not. In my opinion the company should have pulled all of these obviously defective batches but instead they continue to sell it. I will not take the gamble and waste my money again. It&#x27;s a total shame because the old formulation was literally the perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. It is perfect for my skin. My skin feels dry in the mornings after I wash it but since it is naturally oily, as the day progresses, most moisturizers tend to be too much. The main component I need in a moisturizer is the SPF and so this one is perfect. It goes on feeling silky rather than greasy. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a *little* moisture (especially for that post-washed dryness).</li>
            <li> best combination of price and quality</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin. I&#x27;m 49 years old and have tried everything.  This has zinc oxide and no silicone which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;They must have corrected the problem noted in some of the comments. I just bought it this week.</li>
            <li> This is the best mineral sunscreen daily moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried to date.  The whiteness faded very quickly, and it is matte to the touch rather than shiny like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thanks to EWG&#x27;s recommendations.  I am happy to tell u all that it works effectively and am happy that it&#x27;s safe.    Thanks EWG and Amazon !</li>
            <li> Great sun protection under makeup</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reviewing the EWG&#x27;s skincare website and saw it had a very low toxicity score.  I love how this product has great ingredients and is basically as good as sunscreen gets.  I also wanted something that wasn&#x27;t oil-based because one thing I can&#x27;t stand about sunscreens is how oily and shiny they make my skin (and I have dry skin).  However, this product wasn&#x27;t for me, because although it does feel moisturizing when applying, my skin was oily feeling throughout the day.  I understand that zinc oxide is a barrier sunscreen and is not meant to absorb, but it seemed like none of the lotion, even the moisturizers, absorbed, leaving a somewhat sticky layer on my face all day.  Also because of it&#x27;s thin consistency (very much like a gel lotion), I was skeptical of how well it protected (I am prone to dark spots, so I very much limit my exposure to direct sunlight).  I don&#x27;t use it on my face anymore, I just use it on the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this sunscreen-moisturizer for several years. It was rated by the Environmental Working Group as one of the sunscreen and moisturizer combinations with the least harmful ingredients. In the last several bottles I&#x27;ve used, the texture seems to have changed. The zinc makes it filmy like you are smearing thin mud on your face. It protects my face well and I combine it with Devita Evening Rich moisturizer, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this project for years, and, like others have said, it was great until DeVita changed the product.  The old formula went on smooth and never clogged my pores. The new formula leaves specks of white all over my face, especially in my eyebrows and eyelashes. It&#x27;s greasy, and doesn&#x27;t absorb unless my skin is damp.  I gave it two stars instead of one because of the natural ingredients. I hope DeVita reads all of these reviews and brings back the old formula!</li>
            <li> Product is grainy and impossible to rub in now.  So sad as this used to be the best stuff ever.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this SPF as my HG product for at least 5 years and have loved it. While friends burned in Aruba I barely tanned. It has clearly changed with the new formula and I haven&#x27;t given it a true sunburn test yet, but in my experience if I apply it over a serum or oil of any kind then it goes on like it used to. It is definitely grainier, drier, and can leave a white cast without a base serum/oil. I love that is has hylauronic acid in it and does not contain silicones or retinoids. A reviewer commented that there is no packaging date and that is not true. Unfortunately the numbers on the crimped end of the tube are a coded date. I looked into it a few years ago and have since lost the way to decode the date. Wish the company would be more forthcoming wit the date. In my experience companies are often advised not to respond to reviews because they end up looking bad regardless of the response. Devita, would love to hear from you. What&#x27;s the story? What are your spf ratings? Why so grainy? Why did my tube just crack wide open? (Fortunately I was at the end of the tube). To conclude, after at least 5 years of using this amazing product I just ordered Hydropeptide&#x27;s spf. Doesn&#x27;t look as good. Contains silicones and is tinted, but an aesthetician recommended. She also recommended Sanitas spf too which is very good (LOVE their products), but the spf leaves more of a white cast than Devita. Looking for a reason to continue with Devita…. A response would be helpful.</li>
            <li> Although I heard about the change in the formulation i still purchased this items. I have tested it out and it flakes on me, particularly if I have other stuff on my face. I haven&#x27;t worn it with makeup but will be back with an updated review.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for two or three years now. It used to be in different packaging and a slightly different consistency I guess. Unlike some of the other users I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I still love it because it&#x27;s a 30 spf sunscreen that does not have parabens and a lot of chemicals. (It uses zinc oxide) as the main ingredient and so much safer on the skin. Most zinc oxide sunscreens are really heavy. This one is great for the face. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My friend, who is a tennis instructor and spends half his life outdoors, recommended this product. He said he has tried absolutely every type of sunscreen on the market, with a preference for sports sunscreens, and he said this one worked the best and had the best tactical application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it and I have to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now it seems they are not making the same mix. My friend is really bummed and even approached the company, which said they made the change and they are sticking with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really hoping they change back...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over three years.  Normally, it is an awesome facial moisturizer with sunblock (always ordered through Luckyvitamin).  This product ordered thru Amazon was horrible.  It was like applying pure zinx oxide with no moisturizing qualities.  I would return the product but it took this long to finish my other tube and begin using this one.  Never buy thru Amazon site.</li>
            <li> I love this block. It provides 30 spf without harmful chemicals. I like the texture, the easy absorption, and the fact that it is a light but effective moisturizer. A little goes a long way.  The pump bottle version is hard to use when it gets low. You have to unscrew the bottle and dig for the last quarter or so. When I reordered I switched to the tube version, which should be easier. While the packaging may leave something to be desired, the stuff itself is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The facial moisturizer is not what I expected. I used the body sunscreen in the past and really liked it although I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was actually protecting my skin from UVA/UVB rays. This one is so white and pasty and doesn&#x27;t relly glide on skin. The texture is awful. In all , I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a moisturizer with a higher SPF and eco-conscious ingredients! This is one of the best options I found. I doesn&#x27;t have much of a sheen at all, and I use it under a very light/partial application of foundation. If I&#x27;m going out hiking or to the beach, I&#x27;ll use a more conventional SPF cream for longer lasting/stronger protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a lightweight mineral sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher and this one seemed perfect. The ingredients were natural and the texture of this lotion/lightweight cream felt smooth. I had read all the reviews on this product before I had purchased it and decided I needed to try it out for myself to determine whether or not it would be the right product for me. Well I should have just believed the reviews and avoided purchasing it all together! This sunscreen felt nice but it had a grainy texture to it right away, almost as if tiny little beads were suppose to be in this lotion like a scrub. There we&#x27;re tiny balls of flakes on my skin that I had to flick off. That&#x27;s probably the only downside to this product but it was way too big to overlook. However it doesn&#x27;t make the skin white and stays matte but those flakes are too annoying!</li>
            <li> LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the 2.5oz tube version with the following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micronized Zinc oxide 19%. INACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Aloe barbadensis (organic aloe vera gel), Purified Water (aqua), Capric/caprylic triglycerides (derived from coconut oil), Glycerin (vegetable), Hyaluronic acid (vegan source), Glyceryl stearate SE (derived from vegetable oil), Stearic acid, Lecithin phospholipid, Tocopherol (vitamin E), Allantoin, Vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer has a barely creamy texture that goes on extremely smoothly and readily absorbs into the skin. It also feels very inert and non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I actually hadn&#x27;t realized that my previous spf moisturizers had irritated my face so much until I started using this moisturizer and it made my face feel as calm as it did before I started using anything on it. Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, *micronized* zinc oxide&#x3D; gentle sunblock without the white cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I do notice that my face seems to tan a little more with this spf moisturizer than some of my previous ones. Note that I don&#x27;t reapply (never have) even though the instruction say to.</li>
            <li> It used to come in a tube. I liked the tube version. It is a good product. I wear it under my makeup. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it is way too expensive for an SPF lotion. I do like the fact that it has natural ingredients and hyaluronic acid. Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE this stuff, but the last few I have gotten have been different.  Now it clumps and gets all grainy.  If I put it on before my makeup it makes my makeup clump off.  I am very very disappointed.  :/</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a few days and so far so good. It melts right into the skin and no greyish film. I have very sensitive skin and it has not caused irritation or breakouts. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Formula changed. Lost its primary advantage which was ease of application. Will look for something rlse. Too bad I liked it</li>
            <li> There really is no better SPF product on the market for faces. I love this stuff. I use only Watkins Daily Cleansing Cream facewash and this Davita Solar SPF lotion and that&#x27;s all I need. Only 2 products!!! My skin looks better than it&#x27;s ever looked. Before switching my skincare regimin to these two products, I wouldn&#x27;t have dreamed of going out in public without foundation makeup, but now my skin looks good enough to do so. Before this, I was using chemical-laden facewashes, a consequently mandatory moisturizer, and a facial sunscreen. I did that for years. I wish I would have found Watkins and Davita sooner. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Best mineral sunscreen on the market. Cannot live without this. Use it on my face every single day, and it is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I love using this sunscreen. I found this using the Consumer Working Group&#x27;s Sunscreen Guide. It is highly rated as both effective and as a safe product with little to no chemicals known to cause health problems. It goes on like a lotion and doesn&#x27;t look white. It feels soft and moisturizing, and it protects my skin. It is good to use every morning, but I always try to reapply later in the day. I have found it is my favorite winter sunscreen, and I only apply it to my face (because it is expensive.) Great product.</li>
            <li> No eye sting, highly rated by Environmental Working Group. But expensive.</li>
            <li> This product used to be sooo great, 5 stars! Then in the past year, they &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; their formula. Now it&#x27;s chalky and very pasty white on the face. There&#x27;s even little grit pieces in it. I returned it and bought another one tube from a different vendor, same problem. :( So sad. Also, I&#x27;ve found it doesn&#x27;t protect from the sun like the early formula did. Devita, please change this back to your previous formula!</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a sunscreen connoisseur, and after 30 years this is the best product I have ever used!  Been using it about 3 years, after it was recommended by the health &amp; beauty store.  Skin loves it with no adverse effects,or sensitivity, or clogging of pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Devita&#x27;s Solar Protective Moisturizer for over 3 years after learning about it from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s reviews of skin products. For all this time until my most recent purchase, the moisturizer was perfect. It didn&#x27;t have any strange odors, it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy, and most importantly for me, it never left any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My most recent purchase however was a disappointment. The lotion doesn&#x27;t get fully absorbed and would leave dried flakes on my face especially around my nose and my eyebrows. It also left white streaks that one commonly sees in low-quality sun blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m truly bummed because I spent alot of time looking for a good moisturizer with at least an SPF 30 rating that wasn&#x27;t toxic.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. I use it on my face every morning. It never makes me break out, which is my main concern with other sunscreens. This just brightens your face and makes you feel good about going outside. I&#x27;ve used this for 4 years now and my skin hasn&#x27;t aged a bit. There is no smelly fragrance and the very thin, almost transparent white kind of brightens your complexion a bit. Zinc Oxide is naturally white, so this product does an extremely good job at making it as sheer as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did change (as you can see from older reviews). This was temporary. I was upset and called them and they sent me another bottle, but it was still too thick. I took a risk and bought some at the store again a couple months later, and it was back to normal!! The zinc is very sheer again. It&#x27;s been back for about a year or more now. So read the most current reviews!</li>
            <li> Two years and counting, still using this as my daytime moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy, I used very little. Love the protection. Goes on light and rubs in easily, not white.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have tried other chemical free sunscreens that were absolutely horrific and discouraging. They were hard to apply and left a white film. Also my skin felt so sticky afterwards, I just wanted to jump back into the shower. Not this brand, though,  which felt like applying a silky moisturizer!! This is definitely my favorite SPF which I am going to purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for at least a year and loved it!!! I recently purchased a new bottle and noticed that the lotion was whiter/thicker in application. I then had a major rosacea flare up!! I called the company that makes it and they confirmed that there had to use a different supplier for a certain ingredient and that made some difference similar to what I was describing. They then told me that it has been worked with and changed to be more like the original and the fixed version is available directly through them and later through other suppliers...however I am now stuck with an expensive tube that has brought back the worst of my rosacea (that I hadn&#x27;t seen in a good 7 months). I am leery of this product.... just an fyi.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought this lotion, I like the fact that it is SPF30, which is hard to find in a face lotion. However, I do not think I will buy it again. I do like the light smell of it, but I do get those little pieces of lotion that come off when I apply my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;If I put on make up while the lotion hasn&#x27;t dried it&#x27;s ok, but as soon as it is dry it does peel a little when applying any make-up.</li>
            <li> The biggest issue is that the quality of this sunscreen is very inconsistent.  Sometimes it&#x27;s great - goes on clear. The next time I buy it it&#x27;s white and I have to rub it in and wash it off my beard.  Then it&#x27;s back to clear again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you might get lucky and get the clear one, or you might get the whiter chaulky one.  Good luck :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a year and it&#x27;s a great product. However the last bottle I got from this vendor was a little strange. The lotion has a sandy texture that it never had before. Not sure if the product has changed or if this was a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I bought this item with enthusiasm because my friend recommended it as &amp;#34;the best natural SPF moisturizer&amp;#34; she had ever used. I read a few reviews that said it flaked off, but decided to get it anyway since those were the minority. It was completely useless. I waited a good 20 minutes before putting anything else on my face, and it flaked off entirely. I had to wash my face all over again just so I could get it off to wear makeup. When I told my friend about the problems I had, she and I compared our products. She had a much earlier version of the same moisturizer that had lasted her a while. I put a dab of her lotion on the back of my hand, and a dab of my new lotion next to it. Hers looked different, it wasn&#x27;t as pasty white as mine. Anyway, hers rubbed in fabulously while mine flaked right off again. We figure that the ingredients must have changed somehow since she last bought hers. I would not recommend this product, at least not the way it is now. After my initial use it has been untouched.</li>
            <li> After the first few days of using this product, my skin began to flake like crazy. I thought maybe it was the dry weather here, but after a week or so, I realized it was the moisturizer. Not only was my face noticeably peeling, it was itchy as well, so I had to stop using it altogether. Big disappointment, but I think I&#x27;ll use it on the rest of my body just to get some worth out of it. Definitely WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  67 with sensitive skin, and this is the best moisturizer with SPF that I&#x27;ve ever used. My daughter also relies on it. We both appreciate the absence of any irritating ingredients. As to the white flecks some reviewers have mentioned, I find them easily absorbed and not a problem.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is a Vegan product and works really well for the face. I bought some from Whole Foods at first and then reordered it from Amazon as it was significantly less expensive ($10 difference). I will continue to buy this until they stop making it (which I hope they never do).</li>
            <li> I tried this at Whole Foods &amp; loved it instantly. I thought how could I have overlooked this moisturizer all this time!! But I was quickly let down. I read the reviews &amp; they are spot on. Its not at all like the bottle I tried in the store..this stuff came out of the bottle clumpy looking. There were a ton of small white particles, that got into my eyebrows and hairline, and it really did feel thicker than the tester I tried. It had to be the older version, it was sooo nice! But to my great disappointment this bottle I bought was not not even close.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old male who was looking for the best physical sunscreen for my skin. I use a retinoid at night so I really needed to avoid chemicals and any other irritants in my skin care products. After exhausting amounts of research I decided to try Devita Solar Protective Moisturizer which seemed like the best option. This product does not smell, it is extremely smooth, and it does go on clear. I tried this product for a good 3 weeks before deciding to quit using it. Every single time I put this stuff on my face, within 2 minutes of application, my face turned so very red. It did not go away and it lasted until I washed it off at days end. It was also quite greasy for me even though it claims to be \\&quot;non greasy\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know which ingredient caused any of this but it was very jarring and scary looking. I decided to stop using this product and switch to Burnout Kids SPF. That was the best choice I could have ever made. Burnout goes on clear, my face stays smooth and normal looking too. I also noticed that the Devita by itself made my skin incredibly tight, like it was getting dry which was the opposite of what I needed. My retinoid makes my skin dry enough sometimes so I did not need the tightness from Devita. I gave Devita 2 stars because it did not leave my face white nor did it smell like chalk which is incredible for a physical sunscreen. That is where the goodness stops for me. If you are nervous about this sunscreen, try Burnout. It is non-comedogenic and hypoallergenic. You cannot beat it.</li>
            <li> I just received this and put it on this morning.  This garbage has left white flakes all over my face.  I had to wash it off.  I then tried to see if I could get some use out of it and mixed it with another moisturizer and put it on my face.  It still left flakes.  There is no way this product could ever have received anything but one star from a real user.  Do not buy this useless product!  It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product was that is has no added fragrance. Most sunscreens and lotions have fragrance of some sort, which bothers my skin. I have used this moisturizer for a couple years, and like some reviewers have said, it used to be better. The change of the zinc ingredient makes it much whiter, clumpy and harder to rub in fully. The original was lighter, creamier and absorbed right away. This change is very disappointing, and not worth the money :(</li>
            <li> I use this daily. It goes on easily and seems to do a good job of protecting from the sun.</li>
            <li> I know some people think $16 is a steep price to pay for a sunscreen, but I think it is WELL worth it! This sunscreen is different from ANY sunscreen I have used. It does NOT smell like sunscreen and it is very moisturizing. The product is VERY easy to spread and cover the entire face and neck. Also, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover an area that you want protected. This sunscreen is also a great moisturizer without causing oil skin to look more oily. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Goes on well, not greasy, smells good.  Has an SPF 30 to wear outside during the day.  The package is different than the image shown.  Rated high on ewg.org/skindeep.  A little pricey but evades phthalate (endocrine disruptor) absorption of many other brands.</li>
            <li> I like most how it protects but the next thing in line is how it goes on my face. Very even and smooth. Like very much!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. It is expensive but I feel that it is worth it. I am very fair skinned and don&#x27;t like the feel of regular sunscreen on my face.  This solves that problem! It is lightweight but still does the job.  The moisturizer I received was in a tube though, not the container pictured.</li>
            <li> The active sunscreening ingredient in Devita Natural Skin Care Solar Protective Moisturizer, SPF 30, is Zinc oxide (19%). I charted ingredients for some moisturizing sunscreens, and chose this one because it has many good ingredients (aloe vera, glycerin, hyaluronic acid (vegan source), allantoin, grape seed extract, etc.) and none of the dubious ingredients like Octinoxate and silicon products.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very dry, so the moisturizing factor is essential. The product is a manageable cream, neither runny nor too solid, and it smooths onto the skin quickly and DISAPPEARS! No white film on the skin. No feeling that the skin is suffocating. No greasiness or stickiness. After several minutes of a mildly damp feeling where I&#x27;d used the product, there was no sensation at all, just nicely-moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;I tan VERY easily, and after driving with my left arm in the sun (window closed) for two hours there was a dusting of freckles on that forearm. I&#x27;ll use a thicker layer of the product in the future, or wear a long-sleeved shirt. However, the product has screened out the tanning effect of the sun better than any other I&#x27;ve used before. And, my husband is willing to use this product, which is a milestone.</li>
            <li> As many others have mentioned the previous formula has been changed. I was a loyal costumer who genuinely believed this was going to be my sunscreen for life, however after going through a total of four bottles in which the application of the product was no longer smooth, left a noticeable white film, and would rub after drying, I gave up. I&#x27;ve emailed Devita multiple times and have learnt that the formula isn&#x27;t how it use to be because they changed their Zinc manufacturer. It&#x27;s unfortunate, but it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a sunscreen that is as ideal as this use to be and still have yet to find one.</li>
            <li> Let me just preface that I am a natural skin product CONNOISSEUR. I have tried and tested literally every natural skin toner, moisturizer, exfoliator - you name it I probably have. Sunscreens were never something I used until just recently, because I don&#x27;t enjoy being outside and I don&#x27;t like getting dark. So anyway, my go to natural sunscreen was Mychelle&#x27;s 28+ SPF moisturizer. I really love it because it moisturizes perfectly without clogging pores or leaving white residue. However the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was its waxy feeling it leaves for a while after initial application. Minor setback, until I hear natural product hype about the &amp;#34;danger&amp;#34; of nano-particles in sunscreen, now I personally haven&#x27;t read to deep into what that is about, but if it&#x27;s unhealthy or unsafe - I&#x27;ll avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Devita, being the &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; natural skin care line has this sunscreen saying that it moisturizes while providing SPF protection. Based off these reviews I had to try it. The Devita website&#x27;s customer reviews on this product state that the old formula is back. That said, I went on Amazon and purchased this for the first time. This is literally *the* worst moisturizer I have ever used in my life second to the Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free SPF 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has absolutely NO MOISTURIZING qualities at all. And on the label it even says reapplying after exposure to water or wiping applied area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you rub this in, it DRIES immediately, and then turns into a powder and turns any dead skin on your face porcelain white. Don&#x27;t even fathom using this with make-up. I had never had this happen before and I had to scrub this product out of my skin with a wet wipe on my way to work, wasting every other product I had applied to my face prior to this sunscreen. THAT made me angry. But I don&#x27;t base my opinions off of one time failures, but I had tried to use this for days after and it still did not work. I would use my moisturizer and apply this SPF over it and it SOMEHOW manages to dry out all moisture and leave a powdery feel to my face &amp; highlight dead skin. I hate it! I am running back to Mychelle until I see enough reviews to confirm that this is an actual usable SPF product with Moisturizing capabilites. Please save your money and buy the Mychelle one for $12. Nano-particles or not, I think I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like using moisturizer or sunscreen.  However, it is very sunny in Florida and I needed to use something.  I found this and love it!  It isn&#x27;t greasy like other items.  It soaks in and I don&#x27;t feel like I have anything on and my skin feels better than ever!  Plus, I&#x27;m not getting burnt like before!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and research products exhaustively to find ones that will not affect my skin negatively. I am a big fan of DeVita&#x27;s products. They also rate highly with the EWG/Skin Deep Database.</li>
            <li> I believed that DeVita changed their sunscreen formula because I can feel the small white particles and dry spot on my face after I applied it. It was not like that before. The texture was like moisturizer or lotion and it was light weigh on my face. Now I have to look for another brand of sunscreen moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product costs a great deal and simply rolls off the skin in little white balls. It will not absorb and it cannot be returned. I would definitely suggest looking elsewhere for skin care. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen used to be so emollient - but the tube I received on Friday does not contain the original formula.  It flakes off even while you are applying it, and it leaves white flakes everywhere.  I hope I can return it.</li>
            <li> I use this in the mornings before starting my day. It moisturizes my face with being oily. I use just a dime shape amount, and it covers my face and neck without leaving an white cast from the SPF. I have no complaints with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It have little to no fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the EWG website, as it is a sunscreen/moisturizer that&#x27;s free of oxybenzone.  It goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and feels great!</li>
            <li> love it! I am perplexed by the negative reviews. This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. It goes on smooth and moist and disappears completely in a matter of seconds. So much that it doesn&#x27;t act like a sunscreen at all but rather like a moisturizer- hard to believe it is so effective... It is so easy to use that I find I can use it several times a day because it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy sticky feeling. I am so happy to finally find THE SUNSCREEN!</li>
            <li> This is very good face cream with SPF 30. It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen and it goes on even and smooth. I have very, very dry skin and sometimes (especially during winter), I don&#x27;t feel that it moisturizes quite enough (hence 1 star deduction). Overall I am happy with the product and I am a repeat customer. I plan to purchase more items in the line.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen ever!!! The high zinc oxide % means it offers very good protection against UVA rays (the ones that cause aging and skin cancer), and it&#x27;s all natural formula absorbs pretty well and is non-irritating. Basically a great daily moisturizer+sunscreen. It can go on a tiny bit chalky - only because it has so much zinc oxide - but you can blend it in pretty well.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen flakes like crazy when I use it soon after other skin products.</li>
            <li> I love having to use only one lotion for sun protection and softening.  This does not feel sticky when i put it on and has been an adequate sun protector.</li>
            <li> The ingredients have changed in this product, and it&#x27;s now thicker and leaves a white residue on my skin.  I don&#x27;t love it like I used to!!!  :(</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;m very picky about what I&#x27;ll put on my face and have been looking for a facial sunscreen I could tolerate putting on daily. I&#x27;ve found it! I&#x27;m also very sensitive to how things smell and this is no problem for me. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> SPF, environmentally friendly, non-toxic (good rating from the Environmental Working Group) and reasonably priced every-day face lotion! A very little goes a long way, so this tube lasts quite a long time. The only reason this gets 4 of 5 stars is because sometimes at the end of a tube, the zinc clumps up, so you have a few minor white spots you need to brush off your face. Not a big deal, but in a perfect world.... Over all, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It is mild, yet effective. Doesn&#x27;t make my face oily like a lot of natural/mineral sunscreens do and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes if some get on it. I love Devita!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a face moisturizer with SPF for the last couple of years based on EWG ratings.  I initially avoided purchasing the Devita moisturizer because of the negative reviews related to the formula change, but finally decided to try it one month ago and am very happy I did.  This moisturizer is much better than any other product I have tried and does not leave a white cast or an oil slick behind.  I have found that if I accidentally rub the product over my eyebrows, it will make a white dust, but this can easily be brushed off.  Other than this, the product is extremely easy to use, and I actually like it better than the non SPF face moisturizer I had been using.  I am very happy to have finally found an SPF moisturizer than I can wear everyday and not just when it&#x27;s absolutely necessary.  I just wish I had tried it sooner, it would have saved me a lot of money and unnecessary sun exposure.  Today I ordered Devita&#x27;s Solar Body Moisturizer and hope it will be just as great.</li>
            <li> I love that the moisturizer is even less greasy than my previous tube.  I love that it is made from all-natural products.</li>
            <li> Great spf and it&#x27;s natural. This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like normal spf and it has a great light lotion texture that makes it easy for makeup application afterwards.</li>
            <li> I avoid sunscreens - they make me sneeze, itch and/or feel oily.  This one did not and was recommended as green by the Environmental Working Group.  My only regret is that it is pricey for full body coverage but I am going to shop around and see if I can get a better price.  Even if not, well worth it product for those with sensitive skins and allergic tendencies.</li>
            <li> This product goes on so smoothly, leaving my skin feeling great.  I love the SPF 30 protection too, and I love that it gets high marks from the Environmental Working Group.  I once got a tube that was not as creamy in consistency as all of the others I&#x27;ve ever gotten, but the product still worked fine.  I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have tested just about all of the other similar products and this is the only one with 30 SPF that is not too thick or greasy.  It is just right for one&#x27;s face, day in and day out.  This is the second tube that I&#x27;ve bought after looking around locally and testing the tinted greasy ones before ordering the DeVita. It smell fine and does not get rancid.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lotion with the added benefit of sunscreen that does not use nano particles.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other natural face SPF creams like 100% pure, this one goes on clear. It has a nice gentle scent and is silky to put on your face. I have not worn it in summer yet to see if it keeps the freckles from sun exposure at bay. I really like how it feels and I like the price. Best of all it is natural and well rated by the environmental working group, which is how I stumbled across this recommended product when I googled the bliss good skintentions I was using only to find out it had a bad rating by the EWG. I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> I used to love this moisturizer.  It used to go on clear.  It varies widely.  Sometimes when I order this, I get the sheer version that I used to know and love.  Sometimes when I order it, I get a version that goes on white and takes a decent amount of rubbing in.</li>
            <li> First product my picky husband tried for sun protection that he likes.  Neutrogena made his face itch and breakout as did other good brands, but we found a winner with this one.  He has to be very careful as he has had biopsies on some spots on his face, which caught early.  He says it is not greasy and feels great.</li>
            <li> I use Devita Natural Skin Care Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30 + to prevent the worsening of my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from acne as well as general sun damage. Every day after cleansing and toning, I apply Devita Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30 + to my face, neck and chest (if exposed). It&#x27;s zinc oxide-based, lightweight, non-greasy, leaves NO white cast on my deep brown skin, dries matte and doesn&#x27;t cause acne. It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I use. I purchase Devita Natural Skin Care Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30+ from Vitacost or iHerb.    Ingredients: aloe vera gel, purified water, zinc oxide (19%), capric/caprylic triglycerides, vegetable glycerin, glyceryl sterare SE, steric acid, lectin phospolipid, tocopherol (vitamin E), allantoin, grape seed extract</li>
