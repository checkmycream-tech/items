            <li>Absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>It was perfect for just me, and fit all my travel tolietries.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>Just as good, I think.</li>
            <li>the non-flat pockets, with room to put stuff is good.</li>
            <li>lasted a good year or two.</li>
            <li>and it is secure even if it doesn&#x27;t roll perfectly together.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size for a man.</li>
            <li>It works as a good portable office, but you cannot roll it up though.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and the person I gave it to loved it.</li>
            <li>Fit travel sizes and make-up perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This item is good in concept and I like it</li>
            <li>The good thing is that the pockets zip so if something explodes it won&#x27;t get all over everything else.</li>
            <li>Also works good for jewelry accessories keeps things organized and all together.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice design and wraps really nicely.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and excellent price.</li>
            <li>Quick ship and great price!</li>
            <li>great for carrying jewelry or cosmetics, glad I brought this item</li>
            <li>Makes my mornings hassle free!!</li>
            <li>I love having my make up organized!</li>
            <li>I love how it can hold the Neutrogena sunblock spray I have!</li>
            <li>The organizer looks pretty durable and is perfect for saving some space in your bag or luggage.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I still think its pretty awesome though!</li>
            <li>For light duty travel use, this is a great roll-up.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, not made cheap.</li>
            <li>Rolls up nice.</li>
            <li>For all the room in the thing, it folds up into a nice container...  </li>
            <li>Came in handy.</li>
            <li>The separate compartments are really handy, and the bag is well-made.</li>
            <li>FITS NICELY IN OUR LUGGAGE</li>
            <li>once you pack it you cant roll it up  as nice as it seems in the  photo though</li>
            <li>Liked the idea you could hang it up.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to use as a makeup organizer, however, and I am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and it clouds your own rubber</li>
            <li>Nice item..</li>
            <li>nice for my husband that travels</li>
            <li>The zippers seem like they might break very easily.</li>
            <li>I loved it everything fit.</li>
            <li>It is durable and good for travel but can&#x27;t fit but two travel size in each compartment</li>
            <li>Therefore everything I brought had to be mini-size which is what this organizer is suitable for.</li>
            <li>Great little bag, perfect for Make-up.</li>
            <li>The zippers and plastic on this organizer feel very cheap.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>And i agree that it doesn&#x27;t have an adequate hook to hand in the bathroom or a good placement of the zipper for a vertical use...</li>
            <li>easy to unroll when working on a project and have everything you need in four nice zip pouches on your desk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge help!</li>
            <li>The quality is great, I just think the picture is really misleading.</li>
            <li>When filled with product, the Roll-up Organizer does not roll up!  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It works for me and two of these is all I need for toiletries and makeup.  :)</li>
            <li>Both well pleased</li>
            <li>and I like it a lot better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love this bag.</li>
            <li>The item is good and useful too....</li>
            <li>I am thinking that this will be perfect for all the larger items that are a must when we are on the road.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know that it was such the perfect size.</li>
            <li>The most I can squeeze in one pocket is 3 travel sized bottles, and depending on the shape of your bottles you may not be able to do that.</li>
            <li>Would be even better if it was waterproof.</li>
            <li>It smelled like plastic/chemicals but it seems to have gotten better over time.</li>
            <li>Its okay</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the dimensions and use a ruler to confirm the size.  </li>
            <li>Love it, testing it this weekend</li>
            <li>I wish the top had a hook or something, rather than a non elastic, non adjustable loop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>Used it to take my jewelry,  makeup, perfumes, creams and more on my trip.</li>
            <li>Everything fit nicely.</li>
            <li>Travel bottles will fit nicely.</li>
            <li>I love being organized</li>
            <li>and I was able to hang it up.</li>
            <li>I love that it rolls up</li>
            <li>What I like most is that it fits all of my longer items: toothbrush, makeup brushes, etc.</li>
            <li>I need to experiment more with the placement of it in my luggage.</li>
            <li>but the more I use it, the more I don&#x27;t like the way it looks when it is rolled up while the pockets are full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rolls up nicely and securely closes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good!</li>
            <li>I have used it for almost a year, and it has been perfect- can roll or lay flat depending on how you need it to pack.</li>
            <li>pretty good, no way to hang though.</li>
            <li>If you fill all compartments full then the over all travel organizer doesn&#x27;t roll together nicely.</li>
            <li>I love keeping everything separate and the roll up fashion makes this so easy to carry and take anywhere.</li>
            <li>Decent quality and a great for easy access while traveling.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really fit as many things as shown on the picture.  </li>
            <li>It is good if u do not have much makeup to store</li>
            <li>The rubber band closure allows you to fit more things and still be able to securely fasten the bag closed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compared to other roll up organizers I have seen, I was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It was easy using it at the airport no problems.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to find  what i need.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and pack.  </li>
            <li>Holds everything including my pill box and fits easily on the bathroom counter in a hotel room.</li>
            <li>where you can see them and get to them easily.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t find the compartments easy to access .. to get my toiletries or my makeup in and out of.  </li>
            <li>It gives easy access to everything that I need.</li>
            <li>I leave for months at a time in winter and needed something see thru and easy to stash in carryon bag...</li>
            <li>It would be nice of the pockets were a bit bigger, but it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li>High quality, flexible compartments with good stitching.  </li>
            <li>If you have been looking for a good organizer, I highly recommend this one</li>
            <li>I really liked this at first</li>
            <li>However, its fine for what I use it for.  </li>
            <li>it seems to be perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Fast service, love it!</li>
            <li>photos are accurate.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fit a bottle of shampoo for a week vacation in one of the sections.</li>
            <li>A tube of toothpaste, a toothbrush and a stick of antiperspirant might fit in one section.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come close to trying to fit in any of the compartments.)</li>
            <li>It will fit my longest eyeliners.</li>
            <li>AND CAN FIT ALOT OF OUR STUFF INTO IT.</li>
            <li>Fantastic piece.</li>
            <li>Can barely fit anything in it if you want to roll it up.</li>
            <li>cheap material.</li>
            <li>Fit everything I needed and some.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>However this is also fantastic for make up, sewing supplies,</li>
            <li>The pictures make it look like hair spray can fit</li>
            <li>I LOVED that I could see everything thru the clear case.  </li>
            <li>Everything I needed (for the most part) was sorted right there at arms</li>
            <li>It actually rolls up nicely and is more easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for one everywhere but, in the catalogs are too pricey... found it at Amazon (as usual) ♥</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold anything significant.  </li>
            <li>Super cheap and works just like it should.</li>
            <li>I would not be the easiest organizer to clean.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to fit shampoo and conditioner bottles, but that doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>So you better have a large space for it in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Only good for holding travel-size toiletries.</li>
            <li>This carrier is only good for travel size products.</li>
            <li>: I carry a full size can of aerosol deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It really did hold everything he needed and more.  </li>
            <li>It seems in the photograph that it holds full size bottles</li>
            <li>When full and wrapped up, this bag does not look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li>useful for organizing or going on trips but cheaply made, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li>It is ONLY good for mini-EVERYTHING.  </li>
            <li>Tie will not support full use of storage compartments.</li>
            <li>It sits on a hotel countertop nicely unrolled so I can leave the zippers open and keep my items organized but easy to get to.</li>
            <li>Even liquids are in good standing, because they aren&#x27;t able to shift about in the tight sections.</li>
            <li>I took a trip recently, and it was awesome to simply unhook this bag, roll it up and have all my essential makeup good</li>
            <li>Keeps all my smaller bathroom items in pouches that roll up and fit nicely into my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Item came quickly and as pictured.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend the lewis and clark hanging toiletry bag also on amazon, holds more and is only a dollor or two more.</li>
            <li>adequately advertise this product, it should be listed as a Roll Up Travel size bathroom organizer.</li>
            <li>Used it on multiple trips and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Great organizer, but only holds smaller bottles, so be sure you have the right size containers</li>
            <li>Individual sections are pretty good sized.</li>
            <li>I actually love it so far!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually pretty spacious!</li>
            <li>I have way too much stuff!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>But when I started loading it up with stuff, the little pockets fit a fair amount of stuff.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the simplicity of design and that everything in the organizer is easy to find due to the transparent compartments.</li>
            <li>I am not at all happy with this purchase, it is waste of money.</li>
            <li>I travel frequently for work, and this is proven to be a great asset on my last three trips.</li>
            <li>Really nice to keep smaller toiletries in one place!</li>
            <li>Last trip a bottle of baby soap leaked and it was contained in the compartment which was nice.</li>
            <li>Still useful as organizer though.</li>
            <li>you can put anything in here, crafts, supplies, skin care, make-up, snacks on the go for personal training, list is endless, the size is perfect and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute and clean, it encouraged me to keep what I thought was necessary</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a good product and has been delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not real tight but they stay put really nicely in your suitcase and when you arrive at your hotel you can lay them out in the bathroom and stay organized during your whole trip.  </li>
            <li>but if he shaved, it would probably  have been just right.  </li>
            <li>That spray is so bulky and yet, one compartment of this organizer zips right up with it inside.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to fit all my travel toiletries and it didn&#x27;t even fit half of them.</li>
            <li>only does it fit a TON of makeup, it&#x27;s SO easy to close up and just stick in your suitcase since it conforms to whatever is inside.</li>
            <li>Product with inaccurate sizing and shown as holding full bottle sized items is very misleading.</li>
            <li>love the different compartments and how much you can fit into each one.</li>
            <li>Holds a lot, too much to roll up if full.  </li>
            <li>all I can really say  is it works not bad</li>
            <li>Of course, don&#x27;t try stuffing the entire thing with sunblock spray although I don&#x27;t think it would matter so much since the elastic is nice and stretchy.</li>
            <li>With clear pouches it was easy to see and access what ever we needed.</li>
            <li>Also, since it&#x27;s clear you can easily see where all your makeup is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the compartments are filled, it doesn&#x27;t close like a Kinect toy, but it will roll up and the stretchy band is long and sturdy, and easily portable.</li>
            <li>Thank you very very much</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed........</li>
            <li>It will only be able to hold 2-3 mini size bottles per section.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on Amazon after falling in love with the one I seen a Target by Sonia Kashuk for double the price!</li>
            <li>This would also be appropriate for jewelry, or for basic bathroom toiletries.</li>
            <li>The only way I would be able to use this is if I placed 1 item in each pouch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this for my bathroom toiletries and products and it does pretty well with my travel bottles.</li>
            <li>so you could hang it on towel rack or over doorknob, but overall pleased.</li>
            <li>thats important and necessary instead of a makeup bag full of nonsense.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw it</li>
            <li>The upper most pocket has not chain.</li>
            <li>just as described ;-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a bit smaller than I was expecting, but I still love it.  </li>
            <li>It would be good for a woman who wants to pack some big chunky type jewelry because you can see through the clear plastic.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works as expected. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>, however I&#x27;m pretty positive it&#x27;ll hold a lot of items.</li>
            <li>But it does lay nicely in a suitcase and other items can be packed between the compartments.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful&lt;br /&gt;You can process and Daalchampo and dental putty, mattresses and other concealed its own plastic</li>
            <li>This looks a lot bigger than it is in the photo, and if the compartments are actually full or mostly full it will not roll in a neat square like it shows.</li>
            <li>that I thought and doesn&#x27;t take very much to fill it to the point where it doesn&#x27;t roll very well.  </li>
            <li>The see-thru plastic compartments would likely get messy and not look very good for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You definitely wouldnt be able to fit body wash or anything at regular size.  </li>
            <li>Makes getting ready so much simpler!</li>
            <li>Good for all the small items but not for a brush shampoo etc</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for small things.</li>
            <li>Though the concept of this is good, I find it to be too small.</li>
            <li>Rather I open the compartment in which the product I want is in, and can easily access it.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit medicines, hair products, deodorant, contact solution, and face care all into this small travel bag... for TWO PEOPLE.</li>
            <li>Could possibly fit small travel items better.</li>
            <li>Storing all dry goods and rolling them up works like magic.  </li>
            <li>Easy to store make up in, with enough space.</li>
            <li>Overrall, I think it&#x27;s a good item and will last long, as well as hold a lot of stuff (makeup, hair and hygiene things, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you place large items inside</li>
            <li>It held 2 mini bottles of shampoo 2 tubes of toothpaste, 5 toothbrushes, a large container of face wash, Neosporen and bandages, and a couple bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li>Pretty handy for smaller things... not for big shampoo bottles.</li>
            <li>None of the zippers worked right &amp; one completely broke when trying to unzip the first time.</li>
            <li>I took this internationally and it worked fine, but had to unload the liquids for the gallon sized bag.</li>
            <li>Hold SO much stuff</li>
            <li>Very convenient,  travel bag</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much space there is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so much buyers regret in my life.</li>
            <li>o&#x3D;pockets to comfortably store all of my personal bath items!</li>
            <li>Very convent for traveling</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Very usable.</li>
            <li>but it really just holds the basics.  </li>
            <li>I am very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t possible fit anything</li>
            <li>We used it for a weekend getaway and again on  our vacation,  I really appreciated  the convenience and  durability.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t actually really hang this on anything, and if you could, the zippers are arranged so that everything would fall out.</li>
            <li>For that purpose, it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it really doesnt.</li>
            <li>very well made.</li>
            <li>Really like it.  </li>
            <li>Not as much room as I was led to believe in the description.</li>
            <li>Each compartment didn&#x27;t hold that much stuff.</li>
            <li>I ultimately went with a different organizer that cost about the same but was more rugged and held more stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>Holds a lot more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit standard size shampoo or moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Yes it is small, but for a frequent single traveler this is the best case!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for cosmetics, but not for other toiletries such as shampoo, hairspray, etc.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you are aware that a large bottle will not fit in this organizer.</li>
            <li>so I can have more room in my suitcase for other items.</li>
            <li>You could fit a couple travel size products in each pocket but a full size shampoo type bottle would not fit.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected, but great for all of my smaller items.</li>
            <li>This will not hold multiple full sized bottles (like shampoo).</li>
            <li>Soooo spacious I use it for my makeup only and there&#x27;s so much room left for more makeup.</li>
            <li>In addition the zippers are very cheap, one of them splits open through the middle at any given point.</li>
            <li>Would love to see them make a bigger version for larger items.  </li>
            <li>Each pocket can fit a full can of shaving cream, and not much more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are looking for a travel organizer that can hold lots of stuff</li>
            <li>only down fall of this is the strong plastic smell, but airing it out for a couple hours helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>didnt really seem to be high quality or big enough to fit a lot of things for my needs.</li>
            <li>but i used it more as an organizer for small toiletries and didn&#x27;t really need it to be rolled up anyway.</li>
            <li>A normal sized shampoo bottle would probably take up one of the sections fully.</li>
            <li>This case may be good for airline restrictions but is poor for what I wanted it for (example</li>
            <li>And also when I tried to unzip one pocket, my zip was broken because it is made not with a good quality.</li>
            <li>the stretchy tie is very long, but handy if you need to roll up the bag and wrap the cord around it (looping it around the button) to keep it closed.</li>
            <li>zippers all brake easy, not worth a dime.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected &amp; very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t roll up super tight, and is definitely not going to fit your shampoo/conditioner/bodywash (unless you have those teensy TSA approved travel containers).</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a little bigger and would roll up nicely.</li>
            <li>Good tough clear plastic.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll have to either get new products or new bottles.</li>
            <li>The plastic feels very soft but it has held up well.</li>
            <li>There is very little counter/cabinet space in my bathroom and most makeup bags are too unorganized for my taste, so I bought this organizer.</li>
            <li>I bought two of them and after loading them up, I place one on top of the other and I loop the elastic over the button of the opposite unit.  </li>
            <li>If you have small odds and ends or travel sizes this would be ok.</li>
            <li>This is a small bag, make sure you look at the specifications about it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>First of all, this organizer is not the same as at the photo.</li>
            <li>Stylish sleek and durable... for those who complain it&#x27;s too small</li>
            <li>I would love to have a larger version, something that would accomodate larger containers such as shampoo, deodorant, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way smaller than I expected and doesn&#x27;t fit much at all.</li>
            <li>When packed, even partially, it barely rolls up, not to mention the elastic band and button catch combo for keeping it shut doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li>didnt see it being too useful on a week long trip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Holds quite a bit, not long enough for regular hair styling spray or large enough to fit an average shaving cream can - but will hold more than you would expect.  </li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t  be useful to hold hardly any full size products-</li>
            <li>As soon as i opened it, I knew this was FAR too small for most people to carry some items you want to take with you.</li>
            <li>No full size products could fit in it.</li>
            <li>I can fit my moisturizer, small makeup collection, deoderant, toothbrush/paste, and other assorted things in here just fine.</li>
            <li>I wish it was jut a little bigger since it won&#x27;t hold many of my lotions and hair products.</li>
            <li>ok hard geting in an out off</li>
            <li>I love it, just don&#x27;t over fill it ,because it&#x27;s to hard to close.</li>
            <li>The clear pockets make it so you don&#x27;t have to unpack</li>
            <li>old received this for her B-day.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like it</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and very small</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as nice as my other hanging organizer, which is old and dirty, but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if the latch that holds it closed was a little tighter!</li>
            <li>Cute for travel but very small.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup hoarder, even though I have no idea what the function is for more than half of my cosmetics - and this little guy really helped me with that process.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve bought other brands but MUCH prefer this particular one for durability and rollability</li>
            <li>I received an organizer with black material outside (the cheap one) not like leather.</li>
            <li>I like that the elastic cord isn&#x27;t super tight, doesn&#x27;t crush what&#x27;s inside the bag.</li>
            <li>but the pockets barely fit my makeup and deoterant, those are small items.</li>
            <li>It was too small to fit my stuff .</li>
            <li>This would easily hold toothbrush/paste, small lotions, hair ties, tinkerbell, razors, tiny ponies....</li>
            <li>It generally hangs from one of my shower curtain hooks -</li>
            <li>I know, it&#x27;s a simple clear bathroom organizer.</li>
            <li>This roll up version holds a lot and has clear pockets so you can see what you actually packed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those that are looking for a bag that will fit shampoos, lotion and a plethora of larger items - I&#x27;m not sure this is for you.</li>
            <li>It barely sufficed.</li>
            <li>I fit: travel shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, shaving cream (travel size), razor, facewash in travel bottle, makeup remover + makeup remover pads, toothbrush in long toothbrush travel tube, travel toothpaste, floss, small listerine (not travel bottle</li>
            <li>It is a decent quality product but not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>Not good quality but fantastic for the money and the effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s ok for an overnight stay, but not ideal for longer trips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and black when rolled up, and transparent when unrolled so that you can east see the contents without riffling through the whole bag.</li>
            <li>Small, but ok for those little items like makeup and such.</li>

            <li> It was perfect for just me, and fit all my travel tolietries.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> Just as good, I think.</li>
            <li> the non-flat pockets, with room to put stuff is good.</li>
            <li> lasted a good year or two.</li>
            <li> and it is secure even if it doesn&#x27;t roll perfectly together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size for a man.</li>
            <li> It works as a good portable office, but you cannot roll it up though.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person I gave it to loved it.</li>
            <li> Fit travel sizes and make-up perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This item is good in concept and I like it</li>
            <li> The good thing is that the pockets zip so if something explodes it won&#x27;t get all over everything else.</li>
            <li> Also works good for jewelry accessories keeps things organized and all together.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice design and wraps really nicely.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and excellent price.</li>
            <li> Quick ship and great price!</li>
            <li> great for carrying jewelry or cosmetics, glad I brought this item</li>
            <li> Makes my mornings hassle free!!</li>
            <li> I love having my make up organized!</li>
            <li> I love how it can hold the Neutrogena sunblock spray I have!</li>
            <li> The organizer looks pretty durable and is perfect for saving some space in your bag or luggage.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I still think its pretty awesome though!</li>
            <li> For light duty travel use, this is a great roll-up.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, not made cheap.</li>
            <li> Rolls up nice.</li>
            <li> For all the room in the thing, it folds up into a nice container...  </li>
            <li> Came in handy.</li>
            <li> The separate compartments are really handy, and the bag is well-made.</li>
            <li> FITS NICELY IN OUR LUGGAGE</li>
            <li> once you pack it you cant roll it up  as nice as it seems in the  photo though</li>
            <li> Liked the idea you could hang it up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a makeup organizer, however, and I am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and it clouds your own rubber</li>
            <li> Nice item..</li>
            <li> nice for my husband that travels</li>
            <li> The zippers seem like they might break very easily.</li>
            <li> I loved it everything fit.</li>
            <li> It is durable and good for travel but can&#x27;t fit but two travel size in each compartment</li>
            <li> Therefore everything I brought had to be mini-size which is what this organizer is suitable for.</li>
            <li> Great little bag, perfect for Make-up.</li>
            <li> The zippers and plastic on this organizer feel very cheap.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> And i agree that it doesn&#x27;t have an adequate hook to hand in the bathroom or a good placement of the zipper for a vertical use...</li>
            <li> easy to unroll when working on a project and have everything you need in four nice zip pouches on your desk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge help!</li>
            <li> The quality is great, I just think the picture is really misleading.</li>
            <li> When filled with product, the Roll-up Organizer does not roll up!  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It works for me and two of these is all I need for toiletries and makeup.  :)</li>
            <li> Both well pleased</li>
            <li> and I like it a lot better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love this bag.</li>
            <li> The item is good and useful too....</li>
            <li> I am thinking that this will be perfect for all the larger items that are a must when we are on the road.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know that it was such the perfect size.</li>
            <li> The most I can squeeze in one pocket is 3 travel sized bottles, and depending on the shape of your bottles you may not be able to do that.</li>
            <li> Would be even better if it was waterproof.</li>
            <li> It smelled like plastic/chemicals but it seems to have gotten better over time.</li>
            <li> Its okay</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the dimensions and use a ruler to confirm the size.  </li>
            <li> Love it, testing it this weekend</li>
            <li> I wish the top had a hook or something, rather than a non elastic, non adjustable loop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> Used it to take my jewelry,  makeup, perfumes, creams and more on my trip.</li>
            <li> Everything fit nicely.</li>
            <li> Travel bottles will fit nicely.</li>
            <li> I love being organized</li>
            <li> and I was able to hang it up.</li>
            <li> I love that it rolls up</li>
            <li> What I like most is that it fits all of my longer items: toothbrush, makeup brushes, etc.</li>
            <li> I need to experiment more with the placement of it in my luggage.</li>
            <li> but the more I use it, the more I don&#x27;t like the way it looks when it is rolled up while the pockets are full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rolls up nicely and securely closes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good!</li>
            <li> I have used it for almost a year, and it has been perfect- can roll or lay flat depending on how you need it to pack.</li>
            <li> pretty good, no way to hang though.</li>
            <li> If you fill all compartments full then the over all travel organizer doesn&#x27;t roll together nicely.</li>
            <li> I love keeping everything separate and the roll up fashion makes this so easy to carry and take anywhere.</li>
            <li> Decent quality and a great for easy access while traveling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really fit as many things as shown on the picture.  </li>
            <li> It is good if u do not have much makeup to store</li>
            <li> The rubber band closure allows you to fit more things and still be able to securely fasten the bag closed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to other roll up organizers I have seen, I was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It was easy using it at the airport no problems.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to find  what i need.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pack.  </li>
            <li> Holds everything including my pill box and fits easily on the bathroom counter in a hotel room.</li>
            <li> where you can see them and get to them easily.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t find the compartments easy to access .. to get my toiletries or my makeup in and out of.  </li>
            <li> It gives easy access to everything that I need.</li>
            <li> I leave for months at a time in winter and needed something see thru and easy to stash in carryon bag...</li>
            <li> It would be nice of the pockets were a bit bigger, but it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li> High quality, flexible compartments with good stitching.  </li>
            <li> If you have been looking for a good organizer, I highly recommend this one</li>
            <li> I really liked this at first</li>
            <li> However, its fine for what I use it for.  </li>
            <li> it seems to be perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Fast service, love it!</li>
            <li> photos are accurate.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fit a bottle of shampoo for a week vacation in one of the sections.</li>
            <li> A tube of toothpaste, a toothbrush and a stick of antiperspirant might fit in one section.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come close to trying to fit in any of the compartments.)</li>
            <li> It will fit my longest eyeliners.</li>
            <li> AND CAN FIT ALOT OF OUR STUFF INTO IT.</li>
            <li> Fantastic piece.</li>
            <li> Can barely fit anything in it if you want to roll it up.</li>
            <li> cheap material.</li>
            <li> Fit everything I needed and some.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> However this is also fantastic for make up, sewing supplies,</li>
            <li> The pictures make it look like hair spray can fit</li>
            <li> I LOVED that I could see everything thru the clear case.  </li>
            <li> Everything I needed (for the most part) was sorted right there at arms</li>
            <li> It actually rolls up nicely and is more easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one everywhere but, in the catalogs are too pricey... found it at Amazon (as usual) ♥</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold anything significant.  </li>
            <li> Super cheap and works just like it should.</li>
            <li> I would not be the easiest organizer to clean.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to fit shampoo and conditioner bottles, but that doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> So you better have a large space for it in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Only good for holding travel-size toiletries.</li>
            <li> This carrier is only good for travel size products.</li>
            <li> : I carry a full size can of aerosol deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It really did hold everything he needed and more.  </li>
            <li> It seems in the photograph that it holds full size bottles</li>
            <li> When full and wrapped up, this bag does not look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li> useful for organizing or going on trips but cheaply made, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> It is ONLY good for mini-EVERYTHING.  </li>
            <li> Tie will not support full use of storage compartments.</li>
            <li> It sits on a hotel countertop nicely unrolled so I can leave the zippers open and keep my items organized but easy to get to.</li>
            <li> Even liquids are in good standing, because they aren&#x27;t able to shift about in the tight sections.</li>
            <li> I took a trip recently, and it was awesome to simply unhook this bag, roll it up and have all my essential makeup good</li>
            <li> Keeps all my smaller bathroom items in pouches that roll up and fit nicely into my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Item came quickly and as pictured.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend the lewis and clark hanging toiletry bag also on amazon, holds more and is only a dollor or two more.</li>
            <li> adequately advertise this product, it should be listed as a Roll Up Travel size bathroom organizer.</li>
            <li> Used it on multiple trips and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Great organizer, but only holds smaller bottles, so be sure you have the right size containers</li>
            <li> Individual sections are pretty good sized.</li>
            <li> I actually love it so far!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually pretty spacious!</li>
            <li> I have way too much stuff!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> But when I started loading it up with stuff, the little pockets fit a fair amount of stuff.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the simplicity of design and that everything in the organizer is easy to find due to the transparent compartments.</li>
            <li> I am not at all happy with this purchase, it is waste of money.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently for work, and this is proven to be a great asset on my last three trips.</li>
            <li> Really nice to keep smaller toiletries in one place!</li>
            <li> Last trip a bottle of baby soap leaked and it was contained in the compartment which was nice.</li>
            <li> Still useful as organizer though.</li>
            <li> you can put anything in here, crafts, supplies, skin care, make-up, snacks on the go for personal training, list is endless, the size is perfect and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute and clean, it encouraged me to keep what I thought was necessary</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a good product and has been delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real tight but they stay put really nicely in your suitcase and when you arrive at your hotel you can lay them out in the bathroom and stay organized during your whole trip.  </li>
            <li> but if he shaved, it would probably  have been just right.  </li>
            <li> That spray is so bulky and yet, one compartment of this organizer zips right up with it inside.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to fit all my travel toiletries and it didn&#x27;t even fit half of them.</li>
            <li> only does it fit a TON of makeup, it&#x27;s SO easy to close up and just stick in your suitcase since it conforms to whatever is inside.</li>
            <li> Product with inaccurate sizing and shown as holding full bottle sized items is very misleading.</li>
            <li> love the different compartments and how much you can fit into each one.</li>
            <li> Holds a lot, too much to roll up if full.  </li>
            <li> all I can really say  is it works not bad</li>
            <li> Of course, don&#x27;t try stuffing the entire thing with sunblock spray although I don&#x27;t think it would matter so much since the elastic is nice and stretchy.</li>
            <li> With clear pouches it was easy to see and access what ever we needed.</li>
            <li> Also, since it&#x27;s clear you can easily see where all your makeup is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the compartments are filled, it doesn&#x27;t close like a Kinect toy, but it will roll up and the stretchy band is long and sturdy, and easily portable.</li>
            <li> Thank you very very much</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed........</li>
            <li> It will only be able to hold 2-3 mini size bottles per section.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon after falling in love with the one I seen a Target by Sonia Kashuk for double the price!</li>
            <li> This would also be appropriate for jewelry, or for basic bathroom toiletries.</li>
            <li> The only way I would be able to use this is if I placed 1 item in each pouch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for my bathroom toiletries and products and it does pretty well with my travel bottles.</li>
            <li> so you could hang it on towel rack or over doorknob, but overall pleased.</li>
            <li> thats important and necessary instead of a makeup bag full of nonsense.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw it</li>
            <li> The upper most pocket has not chain.</li>
            <li> just as described ;-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a bit smaller than I was expecting, but I still love it.  </li>
            <li> It would be good for a woman who wants to pack some big chunky type jewelry because you can see through the clear plastic.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works as expected. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> , however I&#x27;m pretty positive it&#x27;ll hold a lot of items.</li>
            <li> But it does lay nicely in a suitcase and other items can be packed between the compartments.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful&lt;br /&gt;You can process and Daalchampo and dental putty, mattresses and other concealed its own plastic</li>
            <li> This looks a lot bigger than it is in the photo, and if the compartments are actually full or mostly full it will not roll in a neat square like it shows.</li>
            <li> that I thought and doesn&#x27;t take very much to fill it to the point where it doesn&#x27;t roll very well.  </li>
            <li> The see-thru plastic compartments would likely get messy and not look very good for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You definitely wouldnt be able to fit body wash or anything at regular size.  </li>
            <li> Makes getting ready so much simpler!</li>
            <li> Good for all the small items but not for a brush shampoo etc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for small things.</li>
            <li> Though the concept of this is good, I find it to be too small.</li>
            <li> Rather I open the compartment in which the product I want is in, and can easily access it.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit medicines, hair products, deodorant, contact solution, and face care all into this small travel bag... for TWO PEOPLE.</li>
            <li> Could possibly fit small travel items better.</li>
            <li> Storing all dry goods and rolling them up works like magic.  </li>
            <li> Easy to store make up in, with enough space.</li>
            <li> Overrall, I think it&#x27;s a good item and will last long, as well as hold a lot of stuff (makeup, hair and hygiene things, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you place large items inside</li>
            <li> It held 2 mini bottles of shampoo 2 tubes of toothpaste, 5 toothbrushes, a large container of face wash, Neosporen and bandages, and a couple bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Pretty handy for smaller things... not for big shampoo bottles.</li>
            <li> None of the zippers worked right &amp; one completely broke when trying to unzip the first time.</li>
            <li> I took this internationally and it worked fine, but had to unload the liquids for the gallon sized bag.</li>
            <li> Hold SO much stuff</li>
            <li> Very convenient,  travel bag</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much space there is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had so much buyers regret in my life.</li>
            <li> o&#x3D;pockets to comfortably store all of my personal bath items!</li>
            <li> Very convent for traveling</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Very usable.</li>
            <li> but it really just holds the basics.  </li>
            <li> I am very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t possible fit anything</li>
            <li> We used it for a weekend getaway and again on  our vacation,  I really appreciated  the convenience and  durability.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t actually really hang this on anything, and if you could, the zippers are arranged so that everything would fall out.</li>
            <li> For that purpose, it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it really doesnt.</li>
            <li> very well made.</li>
            <li> Really like it.  </li>
            <li> Not as much room as I was led to believe in the description.</li>
            <li> Each compartment didn&#x27;t hold that much stuff.</li>
            <li> I ultimately went with a different organizer that cost about the same but was more rugged and held more stuff.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> Holds a lot more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit standard size shampoo or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Yes it is small, but for a frequent single traveler this is the best case!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for cosmetics, but not for other toiletries such as shampoo, hairspray, etc.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you are aware that a large bottle will not fit in this organizer.</li>
            <li> so I can have more room in my suitcase for other items.</li>
            <li> You could fit a couple travel size products in each pocket but a full size shampoo type bottle would not fit.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, but great for all of my smaller items.</li>
            <li> This will not hold multiple full sized bottles (like shampoo).</li>
            <li> Soooo spacious I use it for my makeup only and there&#x27;s so much room left for more makeup.</li>
            <li> In addition the zippers are very cheap, one of them splits open through the middle at any given point.</li>
            <li> Would love to see them make a bigger version for larger items.  </li>
            <li> Each pocket can fit a full can of shaving cream, and not much more.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are looking for a travel organizer that can hold lots of stuff</li>
            <li> only down fall of this is the strong plastic smell, but airing it out for a couple hours helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> didnt really seem to be high quality or big enough to fit a lot of things for my needs.</li>
            <li> but i used it more as an organizer for small toiletries and didn&#x27;t really need it to be rolled up anyway.</li>
            <li> A normal sized shampoo bottle would probably take up one of the sections fully.</li>
            <li> This case may be good for airline restrictions but is poor for what I wanted it for (example</li>
            <li> And also when I tried to unzip one pocket, my zip was broken because it is made not with a good quality.</li>
            <li> the stretchy tie is very long, but handy if you need to roll up the bag and wrap the cord around it (looping it around the button) to keep it closed.</li>
            <li> zippers all brake easy, not worth a dime.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected &amp; very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t roll up super tight, and is definitely not going to fit your shampoo/conditioner/bodywash (unless you have those teensy TSA approved travel containers).</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger and would roll up nicely.</li>
            <li> Good tough clear plastic.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll have to either get new products or new bottles.</li>
            <li> The plastic feels very soft but it has held up well.</li>
            <li> There is very little counter/cabinet space in my bathroom and most makeup bags are too unorganized for my taste, so I bought this organizer.</li>
            <li> I bought two of them and after loading them up, I place one on top of the other and I loop the elastic over the button of the opposite unit.  </li>
            <li> If you have small odds and ends or travel sizes this would be ok.</li>
            <li> This is a small bag, make sure you look at the specifications about it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> First of all, this organizer is not the same as at the photo.</li>
            <li> Stylish sleek and durable... for those who complain it&#x27;s too small</li>
            <li> I would love to have a larger version, something that would accomodate larger containers such as shampoo, deodorant, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way smaller than I expected and doesn&#x27;t fit much at all.</li>
            <li> When packed, even partially, it barely rolls up, not to mention the elastic band and button catch combo for keeping it shut doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li> didnt see it being too useful on a week long trip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holds quite a bit, not long enough for regular hair styling spray or large enough to fit an average shaving cream can - but will hold more than you would expect.  </li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t  be useful to hold hardly any full size products-</li>
            <li> As soon as i opened it, I knew this was FAR too small for most people to carry some items you want to take with you.</li>
            <li> No full size products could fit in it.</li>
            <li> I can fit my moisturizer, small makeup collection, deoderant, toothbrush/paste, and other assorted things in here just fine.</li>
            <li> I wish it was jut a little bigger since it won&#x27;t hold many of my lotions and hair products.</li>
            <li> ok hard geting in an out off</li>
            <li> I love it, just don&#x27;t over fill it ,because it&#x27;s to hard to close.</li>
            <li> The clear pockets make it so you don&#x27;t have to unpack</li>
            <li> old received this for her B-day.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like it</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and very small</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as nice as my other hanging organizer, which is old and dirty, but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if the latch that holds it closed was a little tighter!</li>
            <li> Cute for travel but very small.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup hoarder, even though I have no idea what the function is for more than half of my cosmetics - and this little guy really helped me with that process.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve bought other brands but MUCH prefer this particular one for durability and rollability</li>
            <li> I received an organizer with black material outside (the cheap one) not like leather.</li>
            <li> I like that the elastic cord isn&#x27;t super tight, doesn&#x27;t crush what&#x27;s inside the bag.</li>
            <li> but the pockets barely fit my makeup and deoterant, those are small items.</li>
            <li> It was too small to fit my stuff .</li>
            <li> This would easily hold toothbrush/paste, small lotions, hair ties, tinkerbell, razors, tiny ponies....</li>
            <li> It generally hangs from one of my shower curtain hooks -</li>
            <li> I know, it&#x27;s a simple clear bathroom organizer.</li>
            <li> This roll up version holds a lot and has clear pockets so you can see what you actually packed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those that are looking for a bag that will fit shampoos, lotion and a plethora of larger items - I&#x27;m not sure this is for you.</li>
            <li> It barely sufficed.</li>
            <li> I fit: travel shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, shaving cream (travel size), razor, facewash in travel bottle, makeup remover + makeup remover pads, toothbrush in long toothbrush travel tube, travel toothpaste, floss, small listerine (not travel bottle</li>
            <li> It is a decent quality product but not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not good quality but fantastic for the money and the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s ok for an overnight stay, but not ideal for longer trips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and black when rolled up, and transparent when unrolled so that you can east see the contents without riffling through the whole bag.</li>
            <li> Small, but ok for those little items like makeup and such.</li>
            <li> It definitely eliminated having to constantly pick little things off the floor that she dropped and having to get into her bag for new entertainment every 30 min.</li>
            <li> This bag is made with a funky material on the outside and the pockets on the inside are too small to hold much of anything.</li>
            <li> When I first received it I was a little surprised to see how small it looked.  </li>
            <li> when not able to, this works really well for almost everything.</li>
            <li> Packs well flat.</li>
            <li> I do NOT use it for its intended use and can&#x27;t imagine that it would last very long for toiletries.  </li>
            <li> Much smaller tan expected.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as big as I expected</li>
            <li> Bought this for a long flight to hang on the chair in front of me so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep going into my bag.</li>
            <li> I received measured 7&amp;#34; across (just wide enough for my toothbrush).</li>
            <li> The compartments are a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit smaller than pictured and expected.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected but I still like the functionality of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smaller pockets than what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tiny, but it&#x27;s also not large.  </li>
            <li> However it will hold toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant, perfume and other smaller item toiletries.</li>
            <li> Poor quality,plastic is easy folded and  too small to hold items</li>
            <li> Even after reading all of the reviews that said it was small, I was still surprised at the size when I opened the box.  </li>
            <li> , I was just surprised with how small it was.</li>
            <li> The bag is difficult to roll up when all the pouches are partially full..</li>
            <li> When I pack travel size shampoo and conditioner (3 oz size), it is a tight squeeze when I add my 3 oz contact solution to the same pouch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little larger than I&#x27;d like, but I like the product a lot.</li>
            <li> I had envisioned it a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Its a little smaller</li>
            <li> I expected something a little bigger.  </li>
            <li> I think it took up less room flat than rolled up, but it held everything we needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought or expected, but will give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I put a few similar items into each compartment.</li>
            <li> then i expected.  </li>
            <li> Keeps things organized with minimal space.</li>
            <li> The bad thing is that the pockets are very small so you cannot fit much in it.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned when reading some of the initial reviews stating it was small.</li>
            <li> Used one for my hair products and the other for my makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small can&#x27;t even put basic make-up (mascara, eye curler, eye liner, and power) in 1 pouch.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s like the small bonus size you get when you buy a big bottle)...</li>
            <li> Not sure why the zippers are in the middle of the pouches?</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> all the other stuff that isn&#x27;t makeup.</li>
            <li> I use it for small craft stuff (scissors, crochet hooks, double pointed knitting needles, plastic safety eyes, etc).</li>
            <li> I usually use one for my brushes, one for my face makeup, and one for lipsticks and other makeup, and the last one for jewelry or skin care.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look for it to last long, but seriously doubt I use it again, so I won&#x27;t be finding that out.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think I overfilled it, yet when closed and wrapped up it looks like a lumpy mess.</li>
            <li> Sounds odd, but think of it like this; The end with the button is &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; and the other end is &amp;#34;B.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Average zippers</li>
            <li> other than that it kept me organized!</li>
            <li> However it works well for very small items such as pill bottles , toothbrush, etc.</li>
            <li> This does not fit bottles bigger than a Garnier Fructis, it hardly fits those even.</li>
            <li> It has 4 zippered pockets but they are an odd size.</li>
            <li> You can find this for less money on eBay, but I think it will suit all the bug sprays/lotions/sunscreens that I will be bringing on an upcoming trip.  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last weekend, and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This pouch looks awkward but it folds up to be pretty compact.</li>
            <li> but what I&#x27;ve created a little workaround to make these work for me.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was SICK of having to dump out the large single toiletry bags in order to find the little items.  </li>
            <li> Had trouble filling it up...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble closing up the zippers</li>
            <li> The place where I ordered it from has a no-return policy - a waste of 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i should have returned it as it is a little small</li>
            <li> Not a full size brush; even toothbrush was a struggle to slip in!  </li>
            <li> The organizer comes folded flat, so the compartments are smushed down and folded weird, but after pulling them apart and playing with the zipper, they took shape.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t need to pull ALL my cosmetics from a small bag whenever I want to get something.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too small.</li>
            <li> Ripped after a few days!</li>
            <li> Way to small</li>
            <li> Too small, but still work...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> This is small</li>
            <li> Keeps small items together in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> Awful!so small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t hold everything of course, but holds all the small stuff in one place.  </li>
            <li> Usually we travel with a small suitcase for all toiletries, but</li>
            <li> I hope I am wrong and that the zippers last.</li>
            <li> way too small and elastic hanger is too flimsy before loading it.</li>
            <li> and it broke :/</li>
            <li> Too small to be listed as a bathroom organizer.</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> The pockets are small for bathroom sundries.</li>
            <li> It is the size of a small balloon rolled up-</li>
            <li> It is too small to put anything into it.</li>
            <li> Too small for what I intended it to be.</li>
            <li> I like this and wanted to use it for make up, but it&#x27;s just too small.</li>
            <li> I bought it and it&#x27;s not very good at all.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality.</li>
            <li> This is very stiff and hard to roll up.</li>
            <li> Zippers a bit hard to close, but still fully functional.</li>
            <li> Plastic is a bit hard, but I think will stretch on use.</li>
            <li> The zippers for the little pockets are all broken.</li>
            <li> item arrived odorless &amp; the plastic is thick, yet flexible - does not leave hard creases, etc.  </li>
            <li> not for a weekend away (for a woman at least)</li>
            <li> meaning I needed to ruthlessly reduce what I packed so as to fit in one carryon bag.  </li>
            <li> So small it&#x27;s unusable for my family!</li>
            <li> I was like woah this is so small!</li>
            <li> Very small compartments</li>
            <li> Do not waste you money, guys :(</li>
            <li> Very small.  </li>
            <li> I was not please it was very small</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> The leather or fake leather looks a little ting.  </li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> But the quality of the zip is not good</li>
            <li> Clear plastic come apart at seam sad sad sad</li>
            <li> so I needed somewhere to put all of the little things that a woman carries in one place without them getting broken or put in a different bag, or worst just in the suitcase.  </li>
            <li> It is awful, really.</li>
            <li> not great item  </li>
            <li> Nothing broken, it held up</li>
            <li> Useless for me.</li>
            <li> somewhat awkward pockets, difficult to get things out of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always hated having to take ALL of my makeup out of my bags to find a small eyeliner or lipstick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid the stretchy loop will get wrecked if I use that to hang it from anything.</li>
            <li> Nobody likes you, weird eyeshadow the color of pea soup!</li>
            <li> , it is just VERY SMALL!!!</li>
            <li> do wish there was a hook on this bad</li>
            <li> Organizer not to bad.</li>
            <li> This is crap.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived today and it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Much smaller tan expected. Only good for holding travel-size toiletries.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected..it&#x27;s a bit flimzy.if you place large items inside it&#x27;s bulky looking and you can&#x27;t use all compartments either if you have hairspray or whatever you place inside.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Good price. I use it for my makeup! I love keeping everything separate and the roll up fashion makes this so easy to carry and take anywhere.</li>
            <li> The quality is great, I just think the picture is really misleading.</li>
            <li> The best thing I ever got. I use it for my cosmetics. I put a few similar items into each compartment. Now I don&#x27;t need to pull ALL my cosmetics from a small bag whenever I want to get something. Rather I open the compartment in which the product I want is in, and can easily access it. Makes my mornings hassle free!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too small. Good for all the small items but not for a brush shampoo etc</li>
            <li> The button for the closure was sown on with 2 threads. I had to sew it so it would not fall off. Seems like a return. Hope it was not used.</li>
            <li> When filled with product, the Roll-up Organizer does not roll up!  But it does lay nicely in a suitcase and other items can be packed between the compartments.  It wasn&#x27;t as nice as my other hanging organizer, which is old and dirty, but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Keeps all my smaller bathroom items in pouches that roll up and fit nicely into my suitcase.  Have used it for every trip I&#x27;ve taken since I got it, and its now a regular item to bring along.</li>
            <li> Awesome way to organize your toiletries for a trip.  When I first received it I was a little surprised to see how small it looked.  I expected something a little bigger.  But when I started loading it up with stuff, the little pockets fit a fair amount of stuff.  These don&#x27;t roll up so well if you have loaded them up but what I&#x27;ve created a little workaround to make these work for me. I bought two of them and after loading them up, I place one on top of the other and I loop the elastic over the button of the opposite unit.  Sounds odd, but think of it like this; The end with the button is &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; and the other end is &amp;#34;B.&amp;#34;  Place them A to B and B to A and then stretch the elastic to loop across the units to the opposite unit&#x27;s button.  It&#x27;s not real tight but they stay put really nicely in your suitcase and when you arrive at your hotel you can lay them out in the bathroom and stay organized during your whole trip.  The clear pockets make it so you don&#x27;t have to unpack everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this arrangement.  It works for me and two of these is all I need for toiletries and makeup.  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed........</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works as expected. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really fit as many things as shown on the picture.  Pretty handy for smaller things... not for big shampoo bottles.</li>
            <li> i should have returned it as it is a little small and I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the hook, it&#x27;s not on this item in the picture so no way to hang ;0(</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  Hold SO much stuff</li>
            <li> Bought one for my sister-law &amp; myself. Both well pleased</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for small things.</li>
            <li> Holds a ton of stuff, but then doesn&#x27;t roll up that well. I took this internationally and it worked fine, but had to unload the liquids for the gallon sized bag. I ended up buying a Vera Bradley jewelry organizer when I got home and I like it a lot better. It actually rolls up nicely and is more easy to use. The zippers and plastic on this organizer feel very cheap.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and very small don&#x27;t waist your time zippers all brake easy, not worth a dime.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Ripped after a few days! Not good quality.</li>
            <li> Great grab bag gift. good quality.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great price.</li>
            <li> Very convenient,  travel bag</li>
            <li> I bought it and it&#x27;s not very good at all. It has 4 zippered pockets but they are an odd size. I couldn&#x27;t fit a bottle of shampoo for a week vacation in one of the sections. If you have small odds and ends or travel sizes this would be ok. It would be good for a woman who wants to pack some big chunky type jewelry because you can see through the clear plastic. A tube of toothpaste, a toothbrush and a stick of antiperspirant might fit in one section. The picture of it is misleading. I don&#x27;t know what I will do with it. Not taking it on vacation!</li>
            <li> It is good if u do not have much makeup to store</li>
            <li> This will be perfect for traveling light!</li>
            <li> Way to small and it doesn&#x27;t fit anything in it!!!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than it looks.  I like to be organized so I will utilize it, but the picture makes it seem like it can hold a lot of items.  It will only be able to hold 2-3 mini size bottles per section.  You definitely wouldnt be able to fit body wash or anything at regular size.  But for the price I cant complain.</li>
            <li> somewhat awkward pockets, difficult to get things out of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little larger than I&#x27;d like, but I like the product a lot. It&#x27;s sleek and black when rolled up, and transparent when unrolled so that you can east see the contents without riffling through the whole bag. Zipper work well.</li>
            <li> The product is great, the price is even better!</li>
            <li> organizes well but bulky</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and as pictured. Zippers a bit hard to close, but still fully functional.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I was concerned when reading some of the initial reviews stating it was small. Yes, it is; but it is also PERFECT for travel-size products. I was able to fit medicines, hair products, deodorant, contact solution, and face care all into this small travel bag... for TWO PEOPLE. I travel frequently for work, and this is proven to be a great asset on my last three trips. The rubber band closure allows you to fit more things and still be able to securely fasten the bag closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a product exploded and the zippers kept the liquid inside without ruining anything else in the bag or suitcase.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon after falling in love with the one I seen a Target by Sonia Kashuk for double the price! I haven&#x27;t gotten around to putting my items in it yet, however I&#x27;m pretty positive it&#x27;ll hold a lot of items. The organizer comes folded flat, so the compartments are smushed down and folded weird, but after pulling them apart and playing with the zipper, they took shape. Overrall, I think it&#x27;s a good item and will last long, as well as hold a lot of stuff (makeup, hair and hygiene things, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Rated four stars because I haven&#x27;t used it yet, planning to for my vacation in February.</li>
            <li> I never had my makeup so organized till I bought this product!</li>
            <li> I love this bag. It holds all my makeup including brushes. This will not hold multiple full sized bottles (like shampoo). Perfect as a makeup bag to keep things separated and organized. Rolls up nice. Zippers worked great. I like that the elastic cord isn&#x27;t super tight, doesn&#x27;t crush what&#x27;s inside the bag. This cord isn&#x27;t meant for hanging the bag. I recommend this bag. Quick delivery and excellent price. I ordered one for myself and one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Soooo spacious I use it for my makeup only and there&#x27;s so much room left for more makeup. Each zipper could hold about two bottles of febreeze!!! That&#x27;s how much space there is</li>
            <li> The item is good and useful too.... But the quality of the zip is not good</li>
            <li> Item is as stated, shipping was on time. I had envisioned it a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I can fit my moisturizer, small makeup collection, deoderant, toothbrush/paste, and other assorted things in here just fine. It doesn&#x27;t roll up super tight, and is definitely not going to fit your shampoo/conditioner/bodywash (unless you have those teensy TSA approved travel containers). Really nice to keep smaller toiletries in one place!</li>
            <li> Clear plastic come apart at seam sad sad sad</li>
            <li> Too small, but still work...</li>
            <li> Could be larger but I like the separate compartments</li>
            <li> I loved it everything fit. It was easy using it at the airport no problems.</li>
            <li> You can find this for less money on eBay, but I think it will suit all the bug sprays/lotions/sunscreens that I will be bringing on an upcoming trip.  It&#x27;s not tiny, but it&#x27;s also not large.  This would also be appropriate for jewelry, or for basic bathroom toiletries.</li>
            <li> It is a lot smaller then i expected.  it is convenient though and travels well.</li>
            <li> Amazing bathroom organizer! Used one for my hair products and the other for my makeup. Makes getting ready so much simpler!</li>
            <li> Seems as though they hire writers to give good reviews...&lt;br /&gt;Quality of bag is alright, it is just VERY SMALL!!! Each bag only can hold about one regular waterbottle to give an estimate. Product is different than picture. I would reccomend the lewis and clark hanging toiletry bag also on amazon, holds more and is only a dollor or two more. I was wanting to use this bag for toiletries so I wouldnt need to get travel size everything because I am going on a three week trip. This wouldn&#x27;t  be useful to hold hardly any full size products-</li>
            <li> Even after reading all of the reviews that said it was small, I was still surprised at the size when I opened the box.  It&#x27;s good for cosmetics, but not for other toiletries such as shampoo, hairspray, etc.  Would love to see them make a bigger version for larger items.  I really liked the simplicity of design and that everything in the organizer is easy to find due to the transparent compartments.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be bigger. It&#x27;s too small. Could possibly fit small travel items better.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> My son travels a lot &amp; uses this as his bathroom kit.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> This carrier is only good for travel size products. No full size products could fit in it. It is durable and good for travel but can&#x27;t fit but two travel size in each compartment</li>
            <li> Great tool for traveling!</li>
            <li> I am on the road (driving) a lot and need a bathroom organizer I can carry the things I use a lot of.  This case may be good for airline restrictions but is poor for what I wanted it for (example: I carry a full size can of aerosol deodorant.  It doesn&#x27;t come close to trying to fit in any of the compartments.)</li>
            <li> Fast service, love it!</li>
            <li> this is a bit smaller then what I had in mind- but it does the job a keeping my things organized</li>
            <li> Very small compartments, you can not fit much it it.</li>
            <li> The leather or fake leather looks a little ting.  However, I bought this for my grandson for a trip.  It really did hold everything he needed and more.  Had trouble filling it up... but if he shaved, it would probably  have been just right.  It has a very nice design and wraps really nicely.  For all the room in the thing, it folds up into a nice container...  Would recommend it...</li>
            <li> I am thinking that this will be perfect for all the larger items that are a must when we are on the road. thank you</li>
            <li> Bought it for a vacation trip. It&#x27;s too small can&#x27;t even put basic make-up (mascara, eye curler, eye liner, and power) in 1 pouch. The only way I would be able to use this is if I placed 1 item in each pouch. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> This is a small bag, make sure you look at the specifications about it&#x27;s size. It makes a great makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;You can see all the contents at once and have it perfectly organized. It will fit my longest eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Super cheap and works just like it should. I love having my make up organized! Would be nice if the latch that holds it closed was a little tighter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one everywhere but, in the catalogs are too pricey... found it at Amazon (as usual) ♥</li>
            <li> I would recommend - husband does need to have a place to put all his shave cream and razors in something while traveling. And then can find them things without your help. Great service.</li>
            <li> Cute for travel but very small. You could fit a couple travel size products in each pocket but a full size shampoo type bottle would not fit.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it. Came in handy. Didn&#x27;t know that it was such the perfect size. Thank you very very much</li>
            <li> This looks a lot bigger than it is in the photo, and if the compartments are actually full or mostly full it will not roll in a neat square like it shows. The elastic strap will keep it together regardless. I&#x27;m using this for my bathroom toiletries and products and it does pretty well with my travel bottles. The most I can squeeze in one pocket is 3 travel sized bottles, and depending on the shape of your bottles you may not be able to do that. I fit: travel shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, shaving cream (travel size), razor, facewash in travel bottle, makeup remover + makeup remover pads, toothbrush in long toothbrush travel tube, travel toothpaste, floss, small listerine (not travel bottle - it&#x27;s like the small bonus size you get when you buy a big bottle)...and maybe even another item or two. It&#x27;s a bit snug but that&#x27;s all I need so I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;I do wish there was a hook on this bad so you could hang it on towel rack or over doorknob, but overall pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would be even better if it was waterproof.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived today and it&#x27;s horrible. The zippers for the little pockets are all broken. The place where the chord that holds the entire thing together is has been ripped open. I&#x27;ve never had so much buyers regret in my life.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it would be.  However it works well for very small items such as pill bottles , toothbrush, etc.</li>
            <li> So small it&#x27;s unusable for my family! I would not buy this agin. I need some thiing bigger!! I can&#x27;t see this being big enough for 1 person.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for to take on an upcoming trip to keep all my personal items in one place.  This organizer is well-designed with roomy zip o&#x3D;pockets to comfortably store all of my personal bath items!</li>
            <li> This is just the thing to store some of my art supplies.  The separate compartments are really handy, and the bag is well-made.</li>
            <li> I think it took up less room flat than rolled up, but it held everything we needed.</li>
            <li> Very convent for traveling</li>
            <li> pretty good, no way to hang though.</li>
            <li> Works as described. photos are accurate.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Decent quality and a great for easy access while traveling. It would be nice of the pockets were a bit bigger, but it&#x27;s still a good product. It smelled like plastic/chemicals but it seems to have gotten better over time.</li>
            <li> I love how it can hold the Neutrogena sunblock spray I have! That spray is so bulky and yet, one compartment of this organizer zips right up with it inside. Of course, don&#x27;t try stuffing the entire thing with sunblock spray although I don&#x27;t think it would matter so much since the elastic is nice and stretchy. The organizer looks pretty durable and is perfect for saving some space in your bag or luggage.</li>
            <li> This is small but I found it forces me to choose the makeup I wear thats important and necessary instead of a makeup bag full of nonsense.  Its okay</li>
            <li> you can put anything in here, crafts, supplies, skin care, make-up, snacks on the go for personal training, list is endless, the size is perfect and it&#x27;s light and hangs anywhere!!!!</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT WE WANTED FOR TRAVELING.  FITS NICELY IN OUR LUGGAGE AND CAN FIT ALOT OF OUR STUFF INTO IT.</li>
            <li> Compared to other roll up organizers I have seen, I was very happy with this product. It was perfect for just me, and fit all my travel tolietries. Well priced, as some I have come across can be upwards for $50+</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Smaller than expected &amp; very cheaply made. None of the zippers worked right &amp; one completely broke when trying to unzip the first time.</li>
            <li> Keeps small items together in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> This product was great to use while traveling. I used it to pack all my jewelry. Plenty of room for that purpose. I would recommend this product and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Just what I thought it was. Very usable.</li>
            <li> I like this. I know, it&#x27;s a simple clear bathroom organizer. But I take it when I travel and I can see what I am searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> I use this for my makeup.  Its a little smaller that I thought and doesn&#x27;t take very much to fill it to the point where it doesn&#x27;t roll very well.  However, its fine for what I use it for.  A makeup travel kit..</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold a lot.  used it for my kid&#x27;s dop kit for camp but it really just holds the basics.  not for a weekend away (for a woman at least)</li>
            <li> It is awful, really. First of all, this organizer is not the same as at the photo. I received an organizer with black material outside (the cheap one) not like leather. And also when I tried to unzip one pocket, my zip was broken because it is made not with a good quality. I am very dissappointed. Do not waste you money, guys :(</li>
            <li> Keeps things organized with minimal space.</li>
            <li> Awful!so small I want to return it. Couldn&#x27;t possible fit anything</li>
            <li> Great organizer, but only holds smaller bottles, so be sure you have the right size containers or you&#x27;ll have to either get new products or new bottles.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as big as I expected but otherwise did the job</li>
            <li> this piece holds a lot of stuff.  Great organizer for traveling and the fact that you can see everything in this bag is a must have feature.  Fantastic piece.</li>
            <li> We used it for a weekend getaway and again on  our vacation,  I really appreciated  the convenience and  durability.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my niece; will be ordering one for myself next</li>
            <li> Organizer not to bad. I&#x27;d say 1 to 2 day max if you carry travel size items.</li>
            <li> Can barely fit anything in it if you want to roll it up.</li>
            <li> This is crap. cheap material.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t actually really hang this on anything, and if you could, the zippers are arranged so that everything would fall out. Not sure why the zippers are in the middle of the pouches?</li>
            <li> ok hard geting in an out off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small. Smaller than it looks. Each pocket can fit a full can of shaving cream, and not much more. And i agree that it doesn&#x27;t have an adequate hook to hand in the bathroom or a good placement of the zipper for a vertical use... BUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits my makeup perfectly! Brushes, eye shadows, pencils and foundations now travel all separately and it&#x27;s so easy to find  what i need. And i just open it up on a hotel vanity table and roll it up when I&#x27;m done. No hanging needed. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great makeup case! Stylish sleek and durable... for those who complain it&#x27;s too small maybe you should have read all of the reviews. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I love it. Perfectly fits my vacation when I travel</li>
            <li> Great little bag, perfect for Make-up. I would love to have a larger version, something that would accomodate larger containers such as shampoo, deodorant, etc.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing one in a catalog from a makeup company. It is a decent quality product but not quite what I expected. The plastic feels very soft but it has held up well. Last trip a bottle of baby soap leaked and it was contained in the compartment which was nice. Individual sections are pretty good sized.</li>
            <li> I actually love it so far! It fits a lot of things! When I first saw it I was like woah this is so small! but it&#x27;s actually pretty spacious!</li>
            <li> Small, but ok for those little items like makeup and such. Plastic is a bit hard, but I think will stretch on use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pack.  Good buy. Highly recommend if you are looking for a travel organizer that can hold lots of stuff</li>
            <li> This works great.  Can&#x27;t hold everything of course, but holds all the small stuff in one place.  Usually we travel with a small suitcase for all toiletries, but when not able to, this works really well for almost everything.</li>
            <li> very nice organizer. collegiate art student uses these for storing supplies - sharpies, scissors, prismas, pastels - then rolls them up into a bin for storage. easy to unroll when working on a project and have everything you need in four nice zip pouches on your desk. we&#x27;ve bought other brands but MUCH prefer this particular one for durability and rollability</li>
            <li> I used this for my Scentsy mini testers. I got 2 and that was perfect for organizing them all for my basket party bag.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a weekend trip to Vegas. Fit everything I needed and some. Great size and style. A liquid I packed had leaked a litte, but kept everything inside the zipped compartment. Easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be.  Be sure to read the dimensions and use a ruler to confirm the size.  Other than that it seems to be perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> For light duty travel use, this is a great roll-up.  I do NOT use it for its intended use and can&#x27;t imagine that it would last very long for toiletries.  I would not be the easiest organizer to clean.  The see-thru plastic compartments would likely get messy and not look very good for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m using it for all my electronic gadgets and cords that I need while traveling.  For that purpose, it has worked very well.  Storing all dry goods and rolling them up works like magic.  Great purchase for that purpose.  Virtually the same as a similar item sold by the Container Store and about 30 to 40% cheaper.  Just as good, I think.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy!! lasted one trip.... all zippers broke</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. The goods as described.</li>
            <li> Love it, testing it this weekend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought or expected, but will give it a try.  It will work for my husband but it would never work for me as a woman - I have way too much stuff!!</li>
            <li> Perfect organizer for storing toiletries in suitcase.  High quality, flexible compartments with good stitching.  Used it on multiple trips and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Smaller then I thought, would not buy again</li>
            <li> GREAT not just for travel but keeping bathroom supplies neat and organized in a bathroom which is shared!</li>
            <li> Much smaller compartments that I was expecting. It seems in the photograph that it holds full size bottles but it really doesnt. It will have to suffice given that we leave on our cruise soon.</li>
            <li> all I can really say  is it works not bad not great item  lol..once you pack it you cant roll it up  as nice as it seems in the  photo though</li>
            <li> Fits all my makeup brushes, makeup palettes, etc.</li>
            <li> I wish the top had a hook or something, rather than a non elastic, non adjustable loop. The zippers seem like they might break very easily. I hope I am wrong and that the zippers last. I like the size and shape of the rest of the design a lot. the non-flat pockets, with room to put stuff is good. I need see-through things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dubbed this my make up roly poly. I&#x27;ve recently begun the process of purging my room - I am a makeup hoarder, even though I have no idea what the function is for more than half of my cosmetics - and this little guy really helped me with that process. It&#x27;s so cute and clean, it encouraged me to keep what I thought was necessary so I could tell the rejects to go kick rocks. Nobody likes you, weird eyeshadow the color of pea soup! This would easily hold toothbrush/paste, small lotions, hair ties, tinkerbell, razors, tiny ponies....all the other stuff that isn&#x27;t makeup. When the compartments are filled, it doesn&#x27;t close like a Kinect toy, but it will roll up and the stretchy band is long and sturdy, and easily portable.</li>
            <li> Good tough clear plastic. Seems to have durable hardware and construction. I&#x27;m ordering more. Recommended</li>
            <li> I love it, just don&#x27;t over fill it ,because it&#x27;s to hard to close.</li>
            <li> Our now 9 yr. old received this for her B-day.  She loves it, and it is holding up well, as we hoped!</li>
            <li> When full and wrapped up, this bag does not look anything like the picture. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble closing up the zippers so I don&#x27;t think I overfilled it, yet when closed and wrapped up it looks like a lumpy mess. Not maintaining the shape in the picture at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome organizer. Used it to take my jewelry,  makeup, perfumes, creams and more on my trip. Everything fit nicely. very well made.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a long flight to hang on the chair in front of me so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep going into my bag. Everything I needed (for the most part) was sorted right there at arms reach.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought one for my daughter to put crayons and toys and stuff in. It definitely eliminated having to constantly pick little things off the floor that she dropped and having to get into her bag for new entertainment every 30 min.</li>
            <li> way too small and elastic hanger is too flimsy before loading it.</li>
            <li> It was much smaller than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Worked well for my traveling.</li>
            <li> i think i over stuffed it and it broke :/ other than that it kept me organized! lasted a good year or two.</li>
            <li> Really like it.  Holds everything including my pill box and fits easily on the bathroom counter in a hotel room.</li>
            <li> Not as much room as I was led to believe in the description.</li>
            <li> I haved looked for a toiletry bag for quite some time.  This roll up version holds a lot and has clear pockets so you can see what you actually packed. I wish it was jut a little bigger since it won&#x27;t hold many of my lotions and hair products.</li>
            <li> Great help for a traveler. Keeps all those bottles and etc. where you can see them and get to them easily.</li>
            <li> Too small to be listed as a bathroom organizer. dimensions listed with product are inaccurate. Product I received measured 7&amp;#34; across (just wide enough for my toothbrush). Will not hold standard size shampoo, shaving cream, hairspray, lotion, moose, ect. However it will hold toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant, perfume and other smaller item toiletries. This product could stand to improve itself by making them longer to actually accommodate the items people actual use in the bathroom to call it a bathroom organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To adequately advertise this product, it should be listed as a Roll Up Travel size bathroom organizer. Travel bottles will fit nicely. Product with inaccurate sizing and shown as holding full bottle sized items is very misleading.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold anything significant.  What a waste!</li>
            <li> I finally was going to use the bathroom organizer on my trip, and one of the zippers broke off. I missed the cutoff time to return it.</li>
            <li> This roll up organizer is perfect for everything. I use it for small craft stuff (scissors, crochet hooks, double pointed knitting needles, plastic safety eyes, etc). However this is also fantastic for make up, sewing supplies, whatever you can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down fall of this is the strong plastic smell, but airing it out for a couple hours helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> The compartments are a lot smaller than I expected. When I pack travel size shampoo and conditioner (3 oz size), it is a tight squeeze when I add my 3 oz contact solution to the same pouch. If you fill all compartments full then the over all travel organizer doesn&#x27;t roll together nicely. Overall, I really like it, I was just surprised with how small it was.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than expected. The pictures make it look like hair spray can fit but the pockets barely fit my makeup and deoterant, those are small items.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger and would roll up nicely. I like it for organizing my makeup while traveling and it is secure even if it doesn&#x27;t roll perfectly together. Still a good product for the price!</li>
            <li> I travel a lot so I needed somewhere to put all of the little things that a woman carries in one place without them getting broken or put in a different bag, or worst just in the suitcase.  This worked out wonderfully for me.  Make sure you are aware that a large bottle will not fit in this organizer.</li>
            <li> I love being organized</li>
            <li> Very nice size.  I have a ton of stuff in here and it&#x27;s not struggling.</li>
            <li> Bought two! Quick ship and great price! They did the job!</li>
            <li> This bag is made with a funky material on the outside and the pockets on the inside are too small to hold much of anything.</li>
            <li> Each compartment didn&#x27;t hold that much stuff. I ultimately went with a different organizer that cost about the same but was more rugged and held more stuff.</li>
            <li> useful for organizing or going on trips but cheaply made, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I would have hoped. It&#x27;s a good size for a man.</li>
            <li> Bought it for vacation for my shampoo, hair products, toothpaste/brush, etc... Liked the idea you could hang it up. It&#x27;s way smaller than I expected and doesn&#x27;t fit much at all. It basically fits sample size products. Would make a great make-up bag...</li>
            <li> I want to return, but no package return slip...Much much smaller than looked when ordered</li>
            <li> The pockets are small for bathroom sundries.</li>
            <li> Used this a handful of times and it has already started to come apart. Not very good quality.</li>
            <li> It works as a good portable office, but you cannot roll it up though. It is the size of a small balloon rolled up- and that doesn&#x27;t work too well in a laptop bag. I still think its pretty awesome though!</li>
            <li> While this is for toiletries.  I used to store meds for a vacation.  With clear pouches it was easy to see and access what ever we needed.</li>
            <li> Holds a lot more than I expected.  It held 2 mini bottles of shampoo 2 tubes of toothpaste, 5 toothbrushes, a large container of face wash, Neosporen and bandages, and a couple bottles of nail polish. Nothing broken, it held up and I was able to hang it up.</li>
            <li> When packed, even partially, it barely rolls up, not to mention the elastic band and button catch combo for keeping it shut doesn&#x27;t hold very well. Used it for an overnight trip and packed it with sample sizes of everything I used. It barely sufficed. I suppose it&#x27;s ok for an overnight stay, but not ideal for longer trips.</li>
            <li> It was too small to fit my stuff .</li>
            <li> I just got back from 3 week trip to the Middle East and this worked well for me.  I thought I would use its &amp;#34;hanging feature&amp;#34; but I ended up never using it.  I bought it because I was SICK of having to dump out the large single toiletry bags in order to find the little items.  I also needed to be an &amp;#34;extreme packer&amp;#34; meaning I needed to ruthlessly reduce what I packed so as to fit in one carryon bag.  Therefore everything I brought had to be mini-size which is what this organizer is suitable for. It is ONLY good for mini-EVERYTHING.  Not a full size brush; even toothbrush was a struggle to slip in!  Seriously.  I LOVED that I could see everything thru the clear case.  Price made this a no-brainer.  Not good quality but fantastic for the money and the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling! I use it everywhere I go! Great quality, not made cheap. I love that it rolls up so I can have more room in my suitcase for other items.</li>
            <li> The roll-up organizer is not of any use. It is too small to put anything into it. It was defective, when I received it. The upper most pocket has not chain. Since I had to travel just after I received it, I could not even return it back or get a refund. I am not at all happy with this purchase, it is waste of money.</li>
            <li> Too small for what I intended it to be. The picture is deceiving. I wanted to be able to fit all my travel toiletries and it didn&#x27;t even fit half of them. Useless for me. The place where I ordered it from has a no-return policy - a waste of 10 dollars. Maybe I could find some use for it or give it to a friend.</li>
            <li> If you travel a lot and have a lot of makeup, this is A MUST! I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s advertised as a bathroom organizer, but it is the BEST travel makeup case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the different compartments and how much you can fit into each one. I usually use one for my brushes, one for my face makeup, and one for lipsticks and other makeup, and the last one for jewelry or skin care.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it fit a TON of makeup, it&#x27;s SO easy to close up and just stick in your suitcase since it conforms to whatever is inside. Also, since it&#x27;s clear you can easily see where all your makeup is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always hated having to take ALL of my makeup out of my bags to find a small eyeliner or lipstick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The string to hang it at the gym broke on the 3rd use</li>
            <li> Works great for the bathroom when traveling. Should have a hook instead of a loop so it can hang from a hook or hangar. I&#x27;m afraid the stretchy loop will get wrecked if I use that to hang it from anything.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person I gave it to loved it. She can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Very small.  Button already feel off which you obviously need for it to work properly. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be bigger</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This pouch looks awkward but it folds up to be pretty compact. What I like most is that it fits all of my longer items: toothbrush, makeup brushes, etc. Even liquids are in good standing, because they aren&#x27;t able to shift about in the tight sections.</li>
            <li> This did meet my expectations, but when you do fill it to capacity it becomes a bit bulky when rolled up. I need to experiment more with the placement of it in my luggage.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service! I&#x27;m buying another one!</li>
            <li> Fit travel sizes and make-up perfectly.  Helps control what you pack!</li>
            <li> This item is good in concept and I like it but it is a bit smaller than pictured and expected. However, it is functional.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be bigger.</li>
            <li> After having this bathroom organizer for a while (almost 3 months now) I figured I&#x27;d update my review. There is very little counter/cabinet space in my bathroom and most makeup bags are too unorganized for my taste, so I bought this organizer. It generally hangs from one of my shower curtain hooks - the stretchy tie is very long, but handy if you need to roll up the bag and wrap the cord around it (looping it around the button) to keep it closed. I took a trip recently, and it was awesome to simply unhook this bag, roll it up and have all my essential makeup good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are looking for a bag that will fit shampoos, lotion and a plethora of larger items - I&#x27;m not sure this is for you. I purchased this to use as a makeup organizer, however, and I am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was not please it was very small</li>
            <li> Tie will not support full use of storage compartments. Still useful as organizer though.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last weekend, and was disappointed.  Once I put my toiletries into the different compartments, this Roll-up Bathroom Organizer did NOT roll -- not even close.  So you better have a large space for it in your suitcase.  I also didn&#x27;t find the compartments easy to access .. to get my toiletries or my makeup in and out of.  I don&#x27;t look for it to last long, but seriously doubt I use it again, so I won&#x27;t be finding that out.  It&#x27;s likely going in the donation box.</li>
            <li> Not at big as what the pic looks like</li>
            <li> The bad thing is that the pockets are very small so you cannot fit much in it.  The good thing is that the pockets zip so if something explodes it won&#x27;t get all over everything else.</li>
            <li> great for carrying jewelry or cosmetics, glad I brought this item</li>
            <li> I like this and wanted to use it for make up, but it&#x27;s just too small.</li>
            <li> Poor quality,plastic is easy folded and  too small to hold items</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge help! Now I know what all I have so I can find it and use it</li>
            <li> Really smaller than the description and the pic. Doesn&#x27;t fit standard size shampoo or moisturizer. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This does not fit bottles bigger than a Garnier Fructis, it hardly fits those even. Other than that this is a good product and has been delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this to those who use smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> This item not only works for my husband&#x27;s shaving gear, but also medications as he is diabetic and it keeps all the needles together when traveling.  Also works good for jewelry accessories keeps things organized and all together.</li>
            <li> Holds a lot, too much to roll up if full.  Packs well flat.</li>
            <li> I really liked this at first but the more I use it, the more I don&#x27;t like the way it looks when it is rolled up while the pockets are full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds quite a bit, not long enough for regular hair styling spray or large enough to fit an average shaving cream can - but will hold more than you would expect.  I ended up using this to keep electronic accessories organized and it does this quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item arrived odorless &amp; the plastic is thick, yet flexible - does not leave hard creases, etc.  Average zippers</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected but I still like the functionality of it.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for backpacking traveling. The bag is difficult to roll up when all the pouches are partially full.. but i used it more as an organizer for small toiletries and didn&#x27;t really need it to be rolled up anyway. A normal sized shampoo bottle would probably take up one of the sections fully. Its for smaller toiletries.</li>
            <li> Easy to store make up in, with enough space. Such a space saver.</li>
            <li> Though the concept of this is good, I find it to be too small. In addition the zippers are very cheap, one of them splits open through the middle at any given point.</li>
            <li> Very Handy and compact</li>
            <li> Beautiful&lt;br /&gt;You can process and Daalchampo and dental putty, mattresses and other concealed its own plastic and it clouds your own rubber</li>
            <li> Nice item.. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is very stiff and hard to roll up.</li>
            <li> Smaller pockets than what I expected.</li>
            <li> didnt really seem to be high quality or big enough to fit a lot of things for my needs. didnt see it being too useful on a week long trip. returned the item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says! So happy I got it!</li>
            <li> just as described ;-)</li>
            <li> This organizer holds all of my  travel accessories perfectly!  It gives easy access to everything that I need.</li>
            <li> Works for a jewelry organizer when traveling...I leave for months at a time in winter and needed something see thru and easy to stash in carryon bag...it does the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a bit smaller than I was expecting, but I still love it.  I used it for makeup items.  Rolls up nicely and securely closes.</li>
            <li> As soon as i opened it, I knew this was FAR too small for most people to carry some items you want to take with you. Sent it back</li>
            <li> Yes it is small, but for a frequent single traveler this is the best case! I have used it for almost a year, and it has been perfect- can roll or lay flat depending on how you need it to pack. I leave it stocked, then just throw in my suitcase and go. It sits on a hotel countertop nicely unrolled so I can leave the zippers open and keep my items organized but easy to get to. If you have been looking for a good organizer, I highly recommend this one</li>
            <li> nice for my husband that travels</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, but great for all of my smaller items. I was hoping to be able to fit shampoo and conditioner bottles, but that doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> This is the best organizer ever.</li>
