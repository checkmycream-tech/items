            <li>Great!  </li>
            <li>Best shampoo.</li>
            <li>With the GK Conditioner, a perfect pair!</li>
            <li>Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful !</li>
            <li>I use it with the conditioner and have very good results.  </li>
            <li>Best shampoo for color treated and keratin treated hair, smells great too</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product.</li>
            <li>However, not as happy with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This smells great</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is great, very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>This shampoo made my hair feel better.</li>
            <li>Love the price and quality of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find it for sale in a store anywhere around my area, therefore, I purchase it here, but I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>excellent product - same as used in salons</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo on the recommendation of a friend because its sulfate free and non drying.  </li>
            <li>Ive tried so many different brands and this keratin shampoo and conditioner is by far the best yet....</li>
            <li>And it smells good and leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and leaves my hair soft, clean and lightly fragrant.  </li>
            <li>Since its the sulfites in shampoo that get the oils out of your hair you have to use a bit more than you&#x27;d normally use to get your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>I love most Global Keratin products.  </li>
            <li>Global Keratin Leave-In Conditioning Cream 4.4oz]] and am very satisfied with the results on my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser told me I had to use this after my Keratin treatment to keep the treatment effective for straightening longer, and I love how little you have to use to clean the hair.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>It makes hair soft and prolongs your keratin treatment for about 1-2 more months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably because my hair is too fine or porous for the product and is overwhelmed, absorbing too much of the conditioning agent.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this prouct before and received it nicely package and dry.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it is not a fake stuff.</li>
            <li>I really love using this shampoo; however, the product was not properly packaged.  </li>
            <li>It still lasts a long time and better deal than in the salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This shampoo clearly says right on the bottle:</li>
            <li>Highly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you had a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>And I want the hair color that I pay so much for to last</li>
            <li>Works well for keeping hair straight and anti-friz after you have had the Global Keritin process completed on your hair</li>
            <li>For some reason, this shampoo does not leave my hair feeling clean and light, but rather with a slightly heavy, slightly greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling silky soft.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a different in my dry scalp from the first use.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Just like the conditioner this shampoo goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and I no longer have splits ends or dry \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; ends.</li>

            <li> The way it was packaged, it doesn&#x27;t really make sense why the seal would have broken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these products on the market because they&#x27;re supposed to be sold only to salon professionals, and there&#x27;s a lot of people exploiting that.</li>
            <li> This shampoo tames it so it calms down without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> When I have used other shampoos the lather isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will help regrowth yet.</li>
            <li> I -1 star because the bottle is so small compared to the conditioner I bought.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is changing with age its hard for me to judge</li>
            <li> I am a little confused now.</li>
            <li> I have thick, semi frizzy hair that gets &amp;#34;big&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real stuff. Like another reviewer, my seal came broken, and it looked like someone had punched a hole in it and syphoned the real stuff out and replaced it. Seems pretty shady. The way it was packaged, it doesn&#x27;t really make sense why the seal would have broken. It&#x27;s hard to find these products on the market because they&#x27;re supposed to be sold only to salon professionals, and there&#x27;s a lot of people exploiting that.</li>
            <li> Great product. This shampoo made my hair feel better. Not sure how it will help regrowth yet. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than promised. Happy with the product. However, not as happy with the conditioner. Had bad smell and damaged bottle.</li>
            <li> I have an allergic reaction to wheat.  And I want the hair color that I pay so much for to last so I also want a shampoo without sulfates and parabens.  This shampoo clearly says right on the bottle: no sulfates, no parabens, no gluten, no phthalates, no dea, no tea, no petrolatum, no paraffin.  And it smells good and leaves my hair feeling soft.  Love it!</li>
            <li> A wonderful shampoo (conditioner as well). Great product. Love the price and quality of this shampoo.  I can&#x27;t seem to find it for sale in a store anywhere around my area, therefore, I purchase it here, but I love this shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my hair feeling silky and nourished.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo on the recommendation of a friend because its sulfate free and non drying.  Since its the sulfites in shampoo that get the oils out of your hair you have to use a bit more than you&#x27;d normally use to get your hair clean.  After two shampoos it does the job.  Since my hair is changing with age its hard for me to judge but it might be a bit drying.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I got this in a sample in my Glossybox along with the conditioner. I noticed a different in my dry scalp from the first use. Also, I noticed that the lather is a lot thicker and richer. When I have used other shampoos the lather isn&#x27;t as thick. This smells great and I no longer have splits ends or dry \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; ends. I -1 star because the bottle is so small compared to the conditioner I bought. Wish it would come in a bigger size. It still lasts a long time and better deal than in the salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> excellent product - same as used in salons</li>
            <li> I recieved the Global Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner but the bottles I got look different from the ones on the picture and the GK website...I am a little confused now. Didn&#x27;t try the product I got from Amazon but tried one before and the bottles were different. Hopefully it is not a fake stuff.</li>
            <li> Great!  only need one shampoo and can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I had the global keratin process done on my hair but the salon was out of the product. Works well for keeping hair straight and anti-friz after you have had the Global Keritin process completed on your hair</li>
            <li> The shampoo bottle had a label on it. I peeled it off and the bottle is a conditioner bottle. Didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> i have a slit problem that the bottle came conditioner shows from the bottle but please next time dont send it conditioner liquid apperars in the bottle</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes your hair feel like silk.  Ive tried so many different brands and this keratin shampoo and conditioner is by far the best yet....</li>
            <li> Purchased at salon after keratin treatment. Tames my frizzy color-treated, unmanageable hair. Use it with the gk conditioner. Love it.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo. Smells amazing and leaves my hair soft, clean and lightly fragrant.  You don&#x27;t need to have had a keratin treatment to use it. Highly moisturizing.  My entire family uses this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love most Global Keratin products.  I use [[ASIN:B0041R7C4A Global Keratin Serum 1.69oz]] and [[ASIN:B003ZXMXCC Global Keratin Leave-In Conditioning Cream 4.4oz]] and am very satisfied with the results on my hair.  For some reason, this shampoo does not leave my hair feeling clean and light, but rather with a slightly heavy, slightly greasy feel.  It&#x27;s probably because my hair is too fine or porous for the product and is overwhelmed, absorbing too much of the conditioning agent.  I&#x27;ve gone back to my regular shampoos and am continuing the use of the leave-in conditioning products by Global Keratin.</li>
            <li> Just like the conditioner this shampoo goes a long way.  It makes hair soft and prolongs your keratin treatment for about 1-2 more months.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me I had to use this after my Keratin treatment to keep the treatment effective for straightening longer, and I love how little you have to use to clean the hair.  With the GK Conditioner, a perfect pair!</li>
            <li> This product is the same product that is sold in salons and you save about 15%.  I highly recommend it if you had a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> I have thick, semi frizzy hair that gets &amp;#34;big&amp;#34;.  This shampoo tames it so it calms down without weighing it down.  I use it with the conditioner and have very good results.  I would recomend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling silky soft.  I have been using this for 2 years now! Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful !</li>
            <li> I really love using this shampoo; however, the product was not properly packaged.  I ordered this prouct before and received it nicely package and dry.  This time, I had to retrieve the product out of a bag where the container was surmerged in shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this shampoo and conditioner for my dry, brittle, color treated hair. It is great, very moisturizing! The bottle(s) themselves need a larger hole for the liquid to pour out easier.</li>
            <li> No concerns, everything works</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for color treated and keratin treated hair, smells great too</li>
    </ol>
