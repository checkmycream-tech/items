            <li>Best darn nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used - period!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best selling point is its compact size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and performance, and it fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>

            <li>Yes, it does a good job unlike many others I have tried.</li>
            <li>way better, and the blades have additional angle, trully exceptional.</li>
            <li>I expected very good quality, and I got very good quality.  </li>
            <li>lol I got the $14 Panasonic one, and although still slightly cheap, it is much better than this one.</li>

            <li>So far this is the best nose trimmer I have had to date.  </li>
            <li>I am impressed with the apparent quality and design of this Trimmer.</li>
            <li>and though i don&#x27;t get the light i am very pleased with the item.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say any more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to break it soon.</li>
            <li>This is the best personal trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get every hair but it gets most of them.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>but it works ok</li>
            <li>I think this is the most pwerful trimmer i have purchased</li>
            <li>However, this trimmer seems a lot better designed and ergonomic.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily I was able to figure out how to get it working again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many of these over the years</li>
            <li>very nice for removing those pesky hairs in your nose....works very well....</li>
            <li>I am impressed with how fast I was able to get all the mowing done and how it trims very close to the skin without any discomfort or loss of blood</li>
            <li>The head and blade detach for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>Not fancy, but gets the job done just fine.  </li>
            <li>Its fairly quiet and cuts great.  </li>
            <li>Easy to operate, clean and change heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and handy</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Its a bit upscale from cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Oh, as an added extra bonus, it worked great in my ears too.</li>
            <li>It is like a cheap toy from a gumball machine.</li>
            <li>Andis should be ashamed they put their name on this piece of cheap junk nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>The Andis name has been around in North America for decades and makes professional hair styling tools and are considered to have a good reputation.    </li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t very bright so don&#x27;t expect to be using this in the dark.  </li>
            <li>ITs fast, painless, and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>many thanks....</li>
            <li>If the fit isn&#x27;t exactly at that spot, it literally does not turn on.</li>
            <li>over all it works very good, but the light is too weak.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little groomer, and is copied by many ---you</li>
            <li>This piece of junk isn&#x27;t even worth 1/3 the posted price.</li>
            <li>Nice enough.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to avoid this cheaply made, joke toy trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal and is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I would gladly pay double for a quality manufactured unit.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does,  Alos, feels &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; in your hand</li>
            <li>threw it away, bought myself Panasonic for higher price.  </li>
            <li>On first use, it was hurting a lot from pulling hairs.</li>
            <li>I just used my trimmer for the first time</li>
            <li>I like it has a light to see better, and comes with a stand for your counter and a little cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts nose hairs very well...works well for me</li>
            <li>very goood compared to remington or philips.</li>
            <li>cleans the hair very neatly and gives close trimming</li>
            <li>but it really happened.</li>
            <li>This clipper worked very well for about a week.</li>
            <li>and it is sturdy and very powerfull.</li>
            <li>And at just $11.99 it&#x60;s a real bargain.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very pocket like as well</li>
            <li>I don&#x60;t ever want to be without this particular trimmer.</li>
            <li>A cheap plastic piece inside the nose trimmer attachment broke out during the first use when it fell down in the sink.</li>
            <li>I have a real Professional-grade Andis hair trimmer (like the ones used at barbershops), and it is 16 years old and still works like a champion.</li>
            <li>, Andis has a great reputation     Cons: Seems fragile (time will tell), poorly made in China</li>
            <li>Beard trimmer had about 2 degrees out of 360 possible degrees of an adjusting circular fit where it would actually work.</li>
            <li>Only time will confirm my first impressions.</li>
            <li>Amazing little gem for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Its cheap, but expect to replace this every few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this trimmer once a week and so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Small and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not sure why it has a light ...</li>
            <li>It requires an AA battery, and that battery will last months with normal --5 minute use here an there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have enough power even with new batteries.</li>
            <li>Blades of the beard trimmer were not sharp at all, pulled hair.</li>
            <li>It is the most worse thing ever I got from Amazone.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to see good reviews from others, perhaps I got a bad piece.</li>
            <li>I guess I should not have expected much for this low price.</li>
            <li>Works Great, trims both thick and thin hairs, low cost, removable blade/head for cleaning,</li>
            <li>havn&#x60;t been this excited about ANY product for years, seriously.</li>

            <li> havn&#x60;t been this excited about ANY product for years, seriously.</li>
            <li> It works VERY well, cutting cleanly with none of the pulling I had feared.</li>
            <li> Dont use the wrong tools to get that ugly nose hair out use this to make it quick n easy and clean</li>
            <li> This device is grossly underpowered by only 1 single AA battery.</li>
            <li> Aging does strange things to the human body and this helps handle that.</li>
            <li> Its not very loud either if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I hasnt failed me yet and is very simple to clean and use.  </li>
            <li> It is so thin and cheap, little slivers of the metal were coming off and getting onto my face and acting as splinters on my fingers.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but I&#x27;ve replaced the battery twice so far and only use it once every two weeks or so for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just cut long hairs.</li>
            <li> I looked for one of these for a long time .</li>
            <li> Motor is pretty weak too.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed it was leaving a dark fluid on my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought I had broken it within first 5 minutes of having it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected</li>
            <li> It is made from the toughest materials, so be careful when cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The result is weak and sporadic power even on a brand new battery.</li>
            <li> Low quality, little cluber-some cap to put on and take off, also seems to be weak, has a week feealing that battery is barely pulling it..  </li>
            <li> Now for the bad, the trimmer does feel cheaply built.  </li>
            <li> The motor barely runs 30 seconds at a draggingly slow pace; then Stops running altogether!</li>
            <li> It is not worthy with Black Friday offer.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend, and the storage base is useful.</li>
            <li> Also inspected the little metal piece that acts as a blade.</li>
            <li> Just Watch out it can cut you a little if your trimming the nose</li>
            <li> I did have some trouble trying to figure out the attachments but that may have been just me.  </li>
            <li> Upon taking the nose trimmer off to try out the straight clippers the nose trimmer head managed to come apart and had an impossible time getting it together and working again.</li>
            <li> plus side though is that its small and can be thrown in a travel bag for a vacation or road trip or whatever.  </li>
            <li> It is so slow, do nothing.</li>
            <li> I can cut down my little ugly hairs w/o any tugging or pulling and it gets the thickest to the thinest hairs alike.  </li>
            <li> The build quality is pretty awful.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is very small and almost impossible for me to use, even just to trim my mustache.</li>
            <li> It may seem silly but it works so well</li>
            <li> Changing the trimmers is awkward.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a bunch of trimmers in my time, and I&#x27;ve been disappointed each time.  </li>

            <li> Best darn nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used - period!  I can&#x27;t say any more.  ;o)</li>
            <li> As with all Andis products, (clippers specifically) I expected very good quality, and I got very good quality.  This is a handy little groomer, and is copied by many ---you will see similar looking things in Walmart etc, but dont be fooled, they are not the same as Andis.  Basically, you use it as it appears in photos for ear and nose hair, and snap on the attchements for sideburns, mustache, beard, or whatever.  You can also use this to trim neck hair, eyebrows, or ?  ITs fast, painless, and very easy to use.  It requires an AA battery, and that battery will last months with normal --5 minute use here an there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get a copy---each time I have, they break or pull the hair.  This is the real deal and is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Finally, a noise/ear trimmer that works!  I have gone through a bunch of trimmers in my time, and I&#x27;ve been disappointed each time.  I&#x27;ve tried both electric and manual trimmers but they all seem to either not work or stop working shortly after I purchase them.      This unit has a nice rubberized coating on it for good grip, kinda like a softball bat handle.  Its fairly quiet and cuts great.  I can cut down my little ugly hairs w/o any tugging or pulling and it gets the thickest to the thinest hairs alike.  Maybe its the blade design, it is different from any of the others I&#x27;ve used.  The head and blade detach for easy cleaning. The Andis name has been around in North America for decades and makes professional hair styling tools and are considered to have a good reputation.    Now for the bad, the trimmer does feel cheaply built.  I would gladly pay double for a quality manufactured unit.  Time will tell, and I will update the review if the trimmer succumbs to an untimely death.    Pros: Works Great, trims both thick and thin hairs, low cost, removable blade/head for cleaning, supposedly rust-proof (time will tell), Andis has a great reputation     Cons: Seems fragile (time will tell), poorly made in China</li>
            <li> A cheap plastic piece inside the nose trimmer attachment broke out during the first use when it fell down in the sink. Blades of the beard trimmer were not sharp at all, pulled hair. I am surprised to see good reviews from others, perhaps I got a bad piece. This piece of junk isn&#x27;t even worth 1/3 the posted price. I ended up buying another trimmer set manufactured by another reputed company.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the apparent quality and design of this Trimmer. Only time will confirm my first impressions. It works VERY well, cutting cleanly with none of the pulling I had feared. Easy to operate, clean and change heads.</li>
            <li> It is so slow, do nothing.Just cut long hairs. It is the most worse thing ever I got from Amazone. It is not worthy with Black Friday offer.</li>
            <li> THese things work great for about 2-3 years and then they crap out and only turn on with lots of shaking/hitting.  Its cheap, but expect to replace this every few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts nose hairs very well...works well for me</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does,  Alos, feels &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; in your hand</li>
            <li> Hi....I saw these trimmers at the barber shop where I get my hair cut....very nice for removing those pesky hairs in your nose....works very well....many thanks....Jim</li>
            <li> I guess I should not have expected much for this low price. The beard trimmer is very small and almost impossible for me to use, even just to trim my mustache. Changing the trimmers is awkward. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to break it soon. I think I&#x27;ll just put it in my travel kit. It&#x27;s best selling point is its compact size.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best nose trimmer I have had to date.  I hasnt failed me yet and is very simple to clean and use.  I like it has a light to see better, and comes with a stand for your counter and a little cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best one out there IMHO.</li>
            <li> It make a noise, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> This works well.  I did have some trouble trying to figure out the attachments but that may have been just me.  Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does a good job unlike many others I have tried.</li>
            <li> very goood compared to remington or philips. cleans the hair very neatly and gives close trimming&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it</li>
            <li> This is the best personal trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and performance, and it fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li> This works well for what it does.  It doesn&#x27;t get every hair but it gets most of them.  It&#x27;s fast and handy so I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  Aging does strange things to the human body and this helps handle that.</li>
            <li> Low quality, little cluber-some cap to put on and take off, also seems to be weak, has a week feealing that battery is barely pulling it..  threw it away, bought myself Panasonic for higher price.  way better, and the blades have additional angle, trully exceptional.</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected but it works ok</li>
            <li> Works great.  Not sure why it has a light ... but gets the hairs cut ...</li>
            <li> I think this is the most pwerful trimmer i have purchased and though i don&#x27;t get the light i am very pleased with the item.</li>
            <li> I have had it about 2 weeks and it has worked great without any issues, as it should. I would definitely recommend, and the storage base is useful.</li>
            <li> I usually only buy Wahl products because it&#x27;s well known.  However, this trimmer seems a lot better designed and ergonomic.    Had it a while and works great.  Will consider Andis products in the future.</li>
            <li> Alright product.  Does what it says.  The light isn&#x27;t very bright so don&#x27;t expect to be using this in the dark.  Motor is pretty weak too.  It gets the job done, but I&#x27;ve replaced the battery twice so far and only use it once every two weeks or so for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus side though is that its small and can be thrown in a travel bag for a vacation or road trip or whatever.  You can probably even carry one in your car, backpack, briefcase or whatever.  Its not very loud either if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Upon taking the nose trimmer off to try out the straight clippers the nose trimmer head managed to come apart and had an impossible time getting it together and working again. I thought I had broken it within first 5 minutes of having it.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I was able to figure out how to get it working again. However I won&#x27;t be taking off the head anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many of these over the years but this gets the closest cut than any of them. I&#x27;ve had the Sharper Image C cell unit and this beats them all. Amazing little gem for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I looked for one of these for a long time . I&#x27;m very pleased with this trimmer . I should have bought two of them.</li>
            <li> I know people think the Panasonic entry level one is cheap, but trust me, this one is much worse. The build quality is pretty awful. The conducting surface in the battery compartment looks like a piece of bent tin foil. The result is weak and sporadic power even on a brand new battery. On first use, it was hurting a lot from pulling hairs. I also noticed it was leaving a dark fluid on my skin. I took it apart and found that is was a lubricating oil that was leaking all over. Also inspected the little metal piece that acts as a blade. It is so thin and cheap, little slivers of the metal were coming off and getting onto my face and acting as splinters on my fingers. Beard trimmer had about 2 degrees out of 360 possible degrees of an adjusting circular fit where it would actually work. If the fit isn&#x27;t exactly at that spot, it literally does not turn on. I know this sounds like a made up horror story but it really happened. lol I got the $14 Panasonic one, and although still slightly cheap, it is much better than this one.</li>
            <li> Solid built, fits well in hand. Cuts close and without any pain. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone. Very nice.</li>
            <li> over all it works very good, but the light is too weak. it will not make it easier for trimming</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised; good buy!</li>
            <li> For you guys with hairy ears or nose, this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;A reccommended plus for those guys who want to keep everything trimmed.</li>
            <li> This clipper worked very well for about a week. After that, it would not work at all with the clipper head attached. The clipper works now without the clipper head, but what good is that? Cheaply made. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> shipment on time, product as described.</li>
            <li> Nice enough.  Not fancy, but gets the job done just fine.  It is made from the toughest materials, so be careful when cleaning.  It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done every time.</li>
            <li> was expecting cheaper plastic.  Its a bit upscale from cheap plastic.  Cuts well for a guy with a hairy nose!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have enough power even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> I just used my trimmer for the first time and I havn&#x60;t been this excited about ANY product for years, seriously. It may seem silly but it works so well and it is sturdy and very powerfull. I am impressed with how fast I was able to get all the mowing done and how it trims very close to the skin without any discomfort or loss of blood aaand it reaches every nook and cranny. I just ordered another one for back up. I don&#x60;t ever want to be without this particular trimmer. And at just $11.99 it&#x60;s a real bargain. Oh, as an added extra bonus, it worked great in my ears too. It&#x60;s a good day. Haaa</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer once a week and so far I have no complaints. A like it cuts my hairs and not pull them.</li>
            <li> Dont use the wrong tools to get that ugly nose hair out use this to make it quick n easy and clean it&#x27;s very pocket like as well</li>
            <li> This device is grossly underpowered by only 1 single AA battery. The motor barely runs 30 seconds at a draggingly slow pace; then Stops running altogether! It is like a cheap toy from a gumball machine. I have a real Professional-grade Andis hair trimmer (like the ones used at barbershops), and it is 16 years old and still works like a champion. Andis should be ashamed they put their name on this piece of cheap junk nose hair trimmer. Highly recommend to avoid this cheaply made, joke toy trimmer.</li>
            <li> My hubby says it&#x27;s ok but doesn&#x27;t get the hair inside his ears very good.</li>
            <li> it fell apart in about a week, save your money and buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Does just what it is intended to do. Small and easy to use. Would buy again and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just Watch out it can cut you a little if your trimming the nose and you push it too close to your skin.</li>
