            <li>B00GJG9JBA Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Even-Tone Moisturizing Cream, 1.8 Ounces]] and it works wonderful, but it&#x27;s super-lightweight.</li>

            <li>Wife was very happy to receive this.</li>
            <li>She said it is an excellent night cream</li>
            <li>Skin feels wonderful in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they make wonderful stuff, and this Renewal night cream is legit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate, it moisturizes perfectly,</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>use the men&#x27;s body wash (great stuff) and the bar</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This night cream is ridiculously great...</li>
            <li>but I was happy with the result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy just using a day cream with SPF and then spraying some Dr. Hauschka toner on after washing my face at night.</li>
            <li>I might be having uncommon results, but this one&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - we are impressed with this product which works as well or even better than &amp;#34;anchor store cosmetic&amp;#34; products three times its price</li>
            <li>Wonderful light scent.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d eventually start to see some good results.  </li>
            <li>Feels good going on</li>
            <li>Bees Renewal Night Cream has been really good though.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks, and we&#x27;re really very pleased with this night cream.</li>
            <li>see that a good amount of people really like this, and that&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li>The scent of this cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>the cream was nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greasy and kind of heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Renewal Night Cream is a nice addition to their line, and it leaves your skin plump and nicely moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good news is, this does lend the skin some moisture (for awhile; more on that below).  </li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>but, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the fragrance.</li>
            <li>product is nice, but it seems like all the others.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency to cream.  </li>
            <li>While the packaging says the best results are obtained in 4-8 weeks (about the amount of product included in this jar judging by my current usage ), I&#x27;m happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen in about 2.5 weeks.</li>
            <li>Also note the cream absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you oily or sticky.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll look into using more of their products if they&#x27;re all as good as this cream.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light, but nice.</li>
            <li>The cream itself has a nice consistency, but I think the smell is more cloying than anything.</li>
            <li>So far, it works great!</li>
            <li>It gives the skin a very smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li>As a night cream it is very nice: not too greasy, pleasant herbal scent that&#x27;s not too strong and with a natural feel to it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product also; very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They could do better, and so could you.</li>
            <li>looks healthy and moisturized in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>It is the most watery night cream I have ever used, it had the consistency of lotion more than cream.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an okay night cream.</li>
            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not going to magically fix wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how many lotions I&#x27;ve tried in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and I love the jar it comes in.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s inexpensive and seems to work just as well as products many times the price.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try their night cream.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes perfectly for my dry, thirsty skin.</li>
            <li>It is so strong, in fact, that it would more often than not give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;We haven&#x27;t used many Burt&#x27;s Bees products better except for the lip balm, which is excellent (if a little bit pricey).</li>
            <li>The price is right and the scent and consitency are nice.</li>
            <li>It was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>It can be kind of greasy at first but eventually soaks into your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was fine.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling and very creamy.</li>
            <li>It is however really great for nights when you actually need a lighter cream.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time wrapped in a secure fashion.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and creamy to put on.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasing light citrus/floral scent out of the jar</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to deal with it for three weeks to see if the results outweighed the odor, but honestly I haven&#x27;t seen much.  </li>
            <li>immediately noticed the label indicating the contents are 98.9% natural which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t much information about what makes this a good night cream, and I found the consistency off putting so this wouldn&#x27;t be my first pick in night cream.</li>
            <li>I still rated the product high because I really  liked the texture and scent.</li>
            <li>scent is also lovely, but it dissipates pretty quickly if you don&#x27;t like strong scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to try this Burt&#x27;s Bees night cream-</li>
            <li>I found it refreshing to use on a hot night instead of my heavier creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not overly excited about it, but it did keep my face moisturized.</li>
            <li>First of all, I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The way my wife uses this is to clean the skin and apply the product to the face at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is best for dry to normal skin; oily skin would probably be overwhelmed with this product.  </li>
            <li>jar itself was in good condition and the inner seal was intact.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that to be true.</li>
            <li>However, is it true for any of them?</li>
            <li>I want to love Burt&#x27;s Bees skin creams, but have been unimpressed with how greasy they end up being (clog pores) and have too much scent.</li>
            <li>What I did get if for, and what is does very well, is moisturize, moisturize and more moisturize.  </li>
            <li>But in the case of Burt&#x27;s Bees Renewal Night Cream, the price is economical, and the cream is rich and hydrating without being overly</li>
            <li>I have found myself using more and more of it every day simply because it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look nice and fresh and feels soft.</li>
            <li>The cream glides onto the skin and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>the scent dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good night cream after using Avon for so long.  </li>
            <li>super hydrating, smells great, and not full of chemicals</li>
            <li>usually night creams are much thicker than day creams, and I thought it would be the perfect cream to add to the lightweight lotion I use every day.</li>
            <li>This cream must be the exception that proves the rule.</li>
            <li>It was when those started showing up that I had to throw in the towel with this product, because it was causing far more harm then good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are looking for a thick, rich, soothing cream that isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, and a cream that does a great job of moisturizing even the driest parts of your skin without leaving it</li>
            <li>This is just right for a night cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for years and have generally been satisfied with their product line and decided to give the night cream a try.</li>
            <li>This actually balanced most of that out.</li>
            <li>product represents the first Hibiscus and Apply cream product we&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>She will be ordering more when this supply gets low.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;grassy&amp;#34; smelling when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>most Burt&#x27;s Bees night creams are such a steal.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It also seems to make my skin look a bit firmer with consistent use.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I was super excited to try this night cream.</li>
            <li>But for a serious shot of moisturizing, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you are looking for a new night cream that both hydrates and firms.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used a number of Burts Bees products over the last year and had good results with all of them (except the shampoo, strangely).</li>
            <li>the appearance of some fine lines that I&#x27;ve recently started noticing on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lasted all night and my skin was smooth and hydrated the following morning.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t put much stock in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product after reading the 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I smooths wrinkle as much as any cream.</li>
            <li>I really like this night cream.  </li>
            <li>The real problem for me is the scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees products for at least twenty years, and have loved everything I&#x27;ve used from them (except for their lip balms that contain peppermint oil, since those irritate my lips).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read a lot recently about how using moisturizer constantly, day and night, makes your body stop producing its own moisturizing oils which leads to even drier skin, ironically.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The list of ingredients seem lengthy, but upon further review, most of the ingredients have natural elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I was rich, I would rub this everywhere especially on the cracked and callous ridges of my hobbit like feet.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other night cream we&#x27;ve used, and we&#x27;re talking skin that&#x27;s over 50 years</li>
            <li>There is a slight fragrance to the product, but I found it to be very light, and it fades quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone who has sensitive skin and/or can&#x27;t tolerate intense fragrances will really need to exercise some caution when it comes to this cream, though, because it can really cause a lot of problems.</li>
            <li>used it nightly for about 2.5 weeks (far longer than I should have, in fact, but I wanted to use this long enough that I could give it as fair a review as possible), and I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference at all in the aforementioned fine lines issue.  </li>
            <li>But the main thing is that it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very thick, which is nice, but when applying it, it leaves a pretty greasy residue on my face that feels (and even looks)</li>
            <li>It really leaves my skin soft and</li>
            <li>It was okay in that regard for a few days, but then the bumps started showing up.  </li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;5 and normally 125lbs athletic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34, and the laugh lines and eye crinkles are starting to pop</li>
            <li>in all, the price is good, the ingredients are mostly natural, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It is such an overpowering, cloying, chemically floral fragrance that really sticks around and doesn&#x27;t dissipate all that much.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no slick or greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>cream is pretty different from the others I&#x27;ve used (L&#x27;Oreal, Clinique, Neutrogena).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich cream but not so much that it feels heavy on the skin</li>
            <li>Thick, rich night creams can be very pricey, along with being very greasy.</li>
            <li>Renewal Night Cream is lovely- even though it&#x27;s rich and thick and very moisturizing, it&#x27;s very fluffy and \\&quot;light\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>are no signs of irritation of rejection - the product clearly does its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried just using this around my forehead and cheeks, steering clear of my nose, but I can still smell it for over an hour.  </li>
            <li>There is a \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; scent, but it doesn&#x27;t longer on the skin or irritate sensitive areas (your mileage may vary on this aspect, though...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my sensitive skin rebelled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Burts Bees, and several of their products, but this doesn&#x27;t really seem like their others, and it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>The Burt&#x27;s Bee renewal cream moisturizes well, relatively natural, and smooths out</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell, like some creams, and so far, hasn&#x27;t caused break outs.</li>
            <li>, however, the skin is saggy like an 80 year old (I&#x27;m 30).</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely but not overpowering, and the cream is thick and substantial without feeling waxy or oily.</li>
            <li>This night cream is very rich and thick, and it moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin on my face, and I am also very sensitive to certain ingredients (and I don&#x27;t have a complete list of those</li>
            <li>I tried this every night for a few days and it really does have an immediate refreshing and softening effect but being a guy I typically forget to apply it every day.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a light odor and it dissipates quickly (usually by the time I get into bed</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I have used, might be considered expensive but remember a little bit goes a long was</li>
            <li>Because of muscle memory and breastfeeding, I bounced back and my stomach shrunk back to normal by week 4</li>
            <li>I normally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use their lip balm all summer long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more thin and greasy in texture than anything I&#x27;ve used, which I found a bit off-putting.  </li>
            <li>I wanted very much for this cream to be something that I could use on my sensitive skin as a moisturizer and something that could possibly diminish (even just a little)</li>
            <li>I live in an arid climate, and I&#x27;ve always tended to have fairly dry skin.  </li>
            <li>wish this had fewer artificial ingredients, but, for a mostly natural product, it works great to temporarily firm and hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li>I mentioned that it moisturizes a little bit, but that only holds true until the face is washed, and then all of the moisture goes away, and dry patches rear their heads</li>
            <li>I use a little bit on the backs of my hands too and you can really tell what a difference it makes.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s inexpensive and seems to work just as well as products many times the price.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try their night cream.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes perfectly for my dry, thirsty skin.</li>
            <li> It is so strong, in fact, that it would more often than not give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;We haven&#x27;t used many Burt&#x27;s Bees products better except for the lip balm, which is excellent (if a little bit pricey).</li>
            <li> The price is right and the scent and consitency are nice.</li>
            <li> It was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It can be kind of greasy at first but eventually soaks into your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was fine.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and very creamy.</li>
            <li> It is however really great for nights when you actually need a lighter cream.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time wrapped in a secure fashion.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin feel smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and creamy to put on.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasing light citrus/floral scent out of the jar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to deal with it for three weeks to see if the results outweighed the odor, but honestly I haven&#x27;t seen much.  </li>
            <li> immediately noticed the label indicating the contents are 98.9% natural which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t much information about what makes this a good night cream, and I found the consistency off putting so this wouldn&#x27;t be my first pick in night cream.</li>
            <li> I still rated the product high because I really  liked the texture and scent.</li>
            <li> scent is also lovely, but it dissipates pretty quickly if you don&#x27;t like strong scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to try this Burt&#x27;s Bees night cream-</li>
            <li> I found it refreshing to use on a hot night instead of my heavier creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overly excited about it, but it did keep my face moisturized.</li>
            <li> First of all, I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The way my wife uses this is to clean the skin and apply the product to the face at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is best for dry to normal skin; oily skin would probably be overwhelmed with this product.  </li>
            <li> jar itself was in good condition and the inner seal was intact.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that to be true.</li>
            <li> However, is it true for any of them?</li>
            <li> I want to love Burt&#x27;s Bees skin creams, but have been unimpressed with how greasy they end up being (clog pores) and have too much scent.</li>
            <li> What I did get if for, and what is does very well, is moisturize, moisturize and more moisturize.  </li>
            <li> But in the case of Burt&#x27;s Bees Renewal Night Cream, the price is economical, and the cream is rich and hydrating without being overly</li>
            <li> I have found myself using more and more of it every day simply because it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look nice and fresh and feels soft.</li>
            <li> The cream glides onto the skin and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> the scent dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good night cream after using Avon for so long.  </li>
            <li> super hydrating, smells great, and not full of chemicals</li>
            <li> usually night creams are much thicker than day creams, and I thought it would be the perfect cream to add to the lightweight lotion I use every day.</li>
            <li> This cream must be the exception that proves the rule.</li>
            <li> It was when those started showing up that I had to throw in the towel with this product, because it was causing far more harm then good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are looking for a thick, rich, soothing cream that isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, and a cream that does a great job of moisturizing even the driest parts of your skin without leaving it</li>
            <li> This is just right for a night cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for years and have generally been satisfied with their product line and decided to give the night cream a try.</li>
            <li> This actually balanced most of that out.</li>
            <li> product represents the first Hibiscus and Apply cream product we&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> She will be ordering more when this supply gets low.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;grassy&amp;#34; smelling when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> most Burt&#x27;s Bees night creams are such a steal.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It also seems to make my skin look a bit firmer with consistent use.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I was super excited to try this night cream.</li>
            <li> But for a serious shot of moisturizing, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you are looking for a new night cream that both hydrates and firms.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used a number of Burts Bees products over the last year and had good results with all of them (except the shampoo, strangely).</li>
            <li> the appearance of some fine lines that I&#x27;ve recently started noticing on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasted all night and my skin was smooth and hydrated the following morning.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t put much stock in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product after reading the 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I smooths wrinkle as much as any cream.</li>
            <li> I really like this night cream.  </li>
            <li> The real problem for me is the scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees products for at least twenty years, and have loved everything I&#x27;ve used from them (except for their lip balms that contain peppermint oil, since those irritate my lips).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read a lot recently about how using moisturizer constantly, day and night, makes your body stop producing its own moisturizing oils which leads to even drier skin, ironically.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The list of ingredients seem lengthy, but upon further review, most of the ingredients have natural elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I was rich, I would rub this everywhere especially on the cracked and callous ridges of my hobbit like feet.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other night cream we&#x27;ve used, and we&#x27;re talking skin that&#x27;s over 50 years</li>
            <li> There is a slight fragrance to the product, but I found it to be very light, and it fades quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone who has sensitive skin and/or can&#x27;t tolerate intense fragrances will really need to exercise some caution when it comes to this cream, though, because it can really cause a lot of problems.</li>
            <li> used it nightly for about 2.5 weeks (far longer than I should have, in fact, but I wanted to use this long enough that I could give it as fair a review as possible), and I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference at all in the aforementioned fine lines issue.  </li>
            <li> But the main thing is that it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very thick, which is nice, but when applying it, it leaves a pretty greasy residue on my face that feels (and even looks)</li>
            <li> It really leaves my skin soft and</li>
            <li> It was okay in that regard for a few days, but then the bumps started showing up.  </li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;5 and normally 125lbs athletic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34, and the laugh lines and eye crinkles are starting to pop</li>
            <li> in all, the price is good, the ingredients are mostly natural, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is such an overpowering, cloying, chemically floral fragrance that really sticks around and doesn&#x27;t dissipate all that much.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no slick or greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> cream is pretty different from the others I&#x27;ve used (L&#x27;Oreal, Clinique, Neutrogena).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich cream but not so much that it feels heavy on the skin</li>
            <li> Thick, rich night creams can be very pricey, along with being very greasy.</li>
            <li> Renewal Night Cream is lovely- even though it&#x27;s rich and thick and very moisturizing, it&#x27;s very fluffy and \\&quot;light\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> are no signs of irritation of rejection - the product clearly does its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried just using this around my forehead and cheeks, steering clear of my nose, but I can still smell it for over an hour.  </li>
            <li> There is a \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; scent, but it doesn&#x27;t longer on the skin or irritate sensitive areas (your mileage may vary on this aspect, though...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my sensitive skin rebelled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Burts Bees, and several of their products, but this doesn&#x27;t really seem like their others, and it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bee renewal cream moisturizes well, relatively natural, and smooths out</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell, like some creams, and so far, hasn&#x27;t caused break outs.</li>
            <li> , however, the skin is saggy like an 80 year old (I&#x27;m 30).</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely but not overpowering, and the cream is thick and substantial without feeling waxy or oily.</li>
            <li> This night cream is very rich and thick, and it moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my face, and I am also very sensitive to certain ingredients (and I don&#x27;t have a complete list of those</li>
            <li> I tried this every night for a few days and it really does have an immediate refreshing and softening effect but being a guy I typically forget to apply it every day.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a light odor and it dissipates quickly (usually by the time I get into bed</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have used, might be considered expensive but remember a little bit goes a long was</li>
            <li> Because of muscle memory and breastfeeding, I bounced back and my stomach shrunk back to normal by week 4</li>
            <li> I normally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use their lip balm all summer long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more thin and greasy in texture than anything I&#x27;ve used, which I found a bit off-putting.  </li>
            <li> I wanted very much for this cream to be something that I could use on my sensitive skin as a moisturizer and something that could possibly diminish (even just a little)</li>
            <li> I live in an arid climate, and I&#x27;ve always tended to have fairly dry skin.  </li>
            <li> wish this had fewer artificial ingredients, but, for a mostly natural product, it works great to temporarily firm and hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li> I mentioned that it moisturizes a little bit, but that only holds true until the face is washed, and then all of the moisture goes away, and dry patches rear their heads</li>
            <li> I use a little bit on the backs of my hands too and you can really tell what a difference it makes.</li>
            <li> My one complaint about this is that it has an odd sent: a strong floral component.</li>
            <li> Like the other products in the line, it&#x27;s mostly a natural recipe</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough yet to comment on whether or not this has firming capabilities as the name suggests, but at the same time, I&#x27;m dubious products can provide such benefits</li>
            <li> It has a cheap floral scent, among others, that is very cloying, unpleasant, and lingering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and often reacts to creams with a lot of active ingredients, but I have not noticed any adverse reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using a lot of heavy moisturizers, though, as those seem to invariably lead to acne issues on my chin in particular.  </li>
            <li> Sadly for me, my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> should really be shipped in a small box with some air packets or bubble</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, even when I put it on the backs of my hands, so this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this night cream with only 1 minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not going to try to claim that it&#x27;s going to stop my face from aging, but I do know that it is keeping my skin from looking dry and taut, and I do think that keeping one&#x27;s face properly moisturized helps reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and this cream slightly irritated my face.  </li>
            <li> So every other day I need to sort of \\&quot;supplement\\&quot; it with a few dabs of something much richer, just to give my skin the moisture it needs.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, so it&#x27;s always humid and muggy and even if my skin is super dry, anything thicker than a lightweight cream feels like it&#x27;s just sort of sliding off my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cream is intensely moisturizing, and there does seem to be a SLIGHT firming effect after a few nights of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>

            <li> At first, they were mostly of the small variety, which was annoying but not a deal-breaker, and again, I didn&#x27;t want to stop using this prematurely on the off-chance that the bumps were an aberration</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is just right for a night cream. The scent is lovely but not overpowering, and the cream is thick and substantial without feeling waxy or oily. It is definitely too much for a day cream, as my face feels heavy when I use it. But for a serious shot of moisturizing, this is a great product. This is best for dry to normal skin; oily skin would probably be overwhelmed with this product.  I&#x27;m not going to try to claim that it&#x27;s going to stop my face from aging, but I do know that it is keeping my skin from looking dry and taut, and I do think that keeping one&#x27;s face properly moisturized helps reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and very creamy. Lasted all night and my skin was smooth and hydrated the following morning. It did feel a little suffocating the first night or two using it as it is a thicker cream than I am used to. My skin is combination skin. Oily on the TZone area, but dry on the cheeks, neck, etc. This actually balanced most of that out.</li>
            <li> I generally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products because they aren&#x27;t heavily fragranced. This cream must be the exception that proves the rule. It has a cheap floral scent, among others, that is very cloying, unpleasant, and lingering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the cream was nice this possibly might have been overcome but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s greasy and kind of heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They could do better, and so could you.</li>
            <li> so creamy and delicious feeling.  Wonderful light scent. Moisturizes perfectly for my dry, thirsty skin.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, so it&#x27;s always humid and muggy and even if my skin is super dry, anything thicker than a lightweight cream feels like it&#x27;s just sort of sliding off my skin. My everyday lotion is [[ASIN:B00GJG9JBA Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Even-Tone Moisturizing Cream, 1.8 Ounces]] and it works wonderful, but it&#x27;s super-lightweight. So every other day I need to sort of \\&quot;supplement\\&quot; it with a few dabs of something much richer, just to give my skin the moisture it needs. I had been using Adovia, but there&#x27;s something a little \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; about it that leaves a shine on my skin and feels sticky. I wanted something with a similar weight, but a dryer finish, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to try this Burt&#x27;s Bees night cream- usually night creams are much thicker than day creams, and I thought it would be the perfect cream to add to the lightweight lotion I use every day. \\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Renewal Night Cream is lovely- even though it&#x27;s rich and thick and very moisturizing, it&#x27;s very fluffy and \\&quot;light\\&quot;. There&#x27;s no slick or greasy feeling at all. It absorbs almost instantly into my skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave any shine. I have found myself using more and more of it every day simply because it&#x27;s working so well, even in the humid Florida summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakouts or my skin reacting negatively to the product. There is a \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; scent, but it doesn&#x27;t longer on the skin or irritate sensitive areas (your mileage may vary on this aspect, though...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s a night cream, it doesn&#x27;t have an SPF, but I prefer to add a layer of that when I go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a thick, rich, soothing cream that isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, and a cream that does a great job of moisturizing even the driest parts of your skin without leaving it feel like an oil slick, this is your cream.

            <li> I like this face cream because it is moisturizing without being greasy. A lot if times night creams are really heavy and you wake up in the morning with a greasy looking face. This one is not like that. My skin is moisturized, but not greasy or shiny when I wake up. It makes my skin look nice and fresh and feels soft. It gives the skin a very smooth look and feel. I use a little bit on the backs of my hands too and you can really tell what a difference it makes. The scent is very light, but nice. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, even when I put it on the backs of my hands, so this jar will last a long time. It is really an excellent value. The performance and size of the jar for the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees products for at least twenty years, and have loved everything I&#x27;ve used from them (except for their lip balms that contain peppermint oil, since those irritate my lips).  This Renewal Night Cream is a nice addition to their line, and it leaves your skin plump and nicely moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin is the second ingredient in this product, and glycerin draws moisture into the skin, which this does quite well.  The beeswax also doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling waxy or greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a night cream, it&#x27;s meant to be heavier than a day cream so it can lock in moisture.  Since it&#x27;s so heavy, you only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Retin-A every evening, and I&#x27;ve been applying this over it.  It helps me avoid those dry flakes that Retin-A can sometimes leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is also lovely, but it dissipates pretty quickly if you don&#x27;t like strong scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this had fewer artificial ingredients, but, for a mostly natural product, it works great to temporarily firm and hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is a line of products my family has been using for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I use the men&#x27;s body wash (great stuff) and the bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses the Honey &amp; Bilberry foot cream, Day Lotion, Lip Balm and a Citrus &amp; Ginger wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product represents the first Hibiscus and Apply cream product we&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;This review will focus on the Renewal Firming Night Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get is a 1/8 oz. (51g) jar of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;We immediately noticed the label indicating the contents are 98.9% natural which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greatly simplifying, the apple component locks in moisture.  This plumps cells which makes the skin look tighter.&lt;br /&gt;The hibiscus smoothes wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way my wife uses this is to clean the skin and apply the product to the face at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks healthy and moisturized in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no signs of irritation of rejection - the product clearly does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit annoyed at how this was delivered.  It came in a padded bubble mailer but the product box had been crumpled and the outer box seal broken.&lt;br /&gt;The jar itself was in good condition and the inner seal was intact.&lt;br /&gt;This should really be shipped in a small box with some air packets or bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - we are impressed with this product which works as well or even better than &amp;#34;anchor store cosmetic&amp;#34; products three times its price point.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that we will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> The scent of this cream is amazing. I sat sniffing it for the longest time. It is the most watery night cream I have ever used, it had the consistency of lotion more than cream. For that reason I felt like it was somewhat overpriced. There wasn&#x27;t much information about what makes this a good night cream, and I found the consistency off putting so this wouldn&#x27;t be my first pick in night cream. It is however really great for nights when you actually need a lighter cream. I found it refreshing to use on a hot night instead of my heavier creams. The smell though... You just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Great product. heavy and still is lighter feeling that the day lotion. Love it</li>
            <li> I wanted very much for this cream to be something that I could use on my sensitive skin as a moisturizer and something that could possibly diminish (even just a little) the appearance of some fine lines that I&#x27;ve recently started noticing on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, this does lend the skin some moisture (for awhile; more on that below).  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s about it for the &amp;#34;pros&amp;#34; of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick, which is nice, but when applying it, it leaves a pretty greasy residue on my face that feels (and even looks) unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, there&#x27;s the fragrance.  It is....awful.  It is such an overpowering, cloying, chemically floral fragrance that really sticks around and doesn&#x27;t dissipate all that much.  It is so strong, in fact, that it would more often than not give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it nightly for about 2.5 weeks (far longer than I should have, in fact, but I wanted to use this long enough that I could give it as fair a review as possible), and I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference at all in the aforementioned fine lines issue.  I mentioned that it moisturizes a little bit, but that only holds true until the face is washed, and then all of the moisture goes away, and dry patches rear their heads again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this did make me break out pretty badly.  It was okay in that regard for a few days, but then the bumps started showing up.  At first, they were mostly of the small variety, which was annoying but not a deal-breaker, and again, I didn&#x27;t want to stop using this prematurely on the off-chance that the bumps were an aberration and I&#x27;d eventually start to see some good results.  Then, though, I started getting some cystic acne, the likes of which I normally only get as the result of hormonal breakouts.  It was when those started showing up that I had to throw in the towel with this product, because it was causing far more harm then good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that a good amount of people really like this, and that&#x27;s wonderful.  Anyone who has sensitive skin and/or can&#x27;t tolerate intense fragrances will really need to exercise some caution when it comes to this cream, though, because it can really cause a lot of problems.</li>
            <li> Wife was very happy to receive this. She said it is an excellent night cream and she has noticed that wrinkles and lines seem softened and less defined. That is only after a week of using it. She will be ordering more when this supply gets low.</li>
            <li> I liked it but, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the fragrance. It wasn&#x27;t overpowering, it just smelled off to me. It was a weird combination of items. I actually wore it during the day and night, even though this is a night cream. It is very thick, but I just thinned it out and I was fine. It says that after you use it for 4 weeks that your wrinkles will start to improve. I didn&#x27;t find that to be true. However, is it true for any of them? So I don&#x27;t put much stock in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an okay night cream. I&#x27;m not overly excited about it, but it did keep my face moisturized. I would however argue that it firmed my face, for I don&#x27;t believe that to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is nice, but it seems like all the others.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I was super excited to try this night cream. First of all, I absolutely love the smell. The floral/apple scent is heavenly, but not overpowering. Since it&#x27;s a night cream, the consistency is a little thick. The cream glides onto the skin and quickly absorbs. Unfortunately, my sensitive skin rebelled. My skin broke out. Darn! I wish I could use this product. I still rated the product high because I really  liked the texture and scent. Sadly for me, my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I like this night cream with only 1 minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Feels good going on&lt;br /&gt;- Skin feels refreshed &amp; moisturized immediately&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s gotten rid of some tiny lines around my eyes (I&#x27;m 49)&lt;br /&gt;- Skin feels wonderful in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;- The only thing that&#x27;s iffy about this cream is the scent. It&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;grassy&amp;#34; smelling when you first put it on. However, it&#x27;s a light odor and it dissipates quickly (usually by the time I get into bed it&#x27;s gone)</li>
            <li> This face cream is very thick looking and feeling.  It can be kind of greasy at first but eventually soaks into your skin.  I was not a fan of the fragrance.  It was too strong for me. I also don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and this cream slightly irritated my face.  Not enough to stop use but I did feel a little itchy using it.  Although my face felt softer and moisturized I did not notice any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; of my skin.  It was ok.  It did moisturize my face but b/c of the other issues (irritated skin and fragrance) I would not buy it or use it again.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency to cream.  Makes skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells are very personal, but for me, I don&#x27;t like the fruity scent. The cream itself has a nice consistency, but I think the smell is more cloying than anything. Also, it&#x27;s just cream, it&#x27;s not going to magically fix wrinkles. Shame on Burts Bees for misleading and unsubstantiated cosmetic claims about wrinkles. I&#x27;m a fan of Burts Bees, and several of their products, but this doesn&#x27;t really seem like their others, and it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> This night cream is ridiculously great...super hydrating, smells great, and not full of chemicals you cannot pronounce.  For the price, this night cream, and most Burt&#x27;s Bees night creams are such a steal.  I continue to be a Burts Bees fan...they make wonderful stuff, and this Renewal night cream is legit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for years and have generally been satisfied with their product line and decided to give the night cream a try. While the packaging says the best results are obtained in 4-8 weeks (about the amount of product included in this jar judging by my current usage ), I&#x27;m happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen in about 2.5 weeks. Used after cleaning your face, there is a slight tingling in the sensitive skin around your eyes, but nothing uncomfortable. Whether it actually reduces the wrinkles or simply plumps the skin is up for debate but I was happy with the result. A slight fruity smell which doesn&#x27;t linger and no allergic reaction. A keeper.</li>
            <li> I live in an arid climate, and I&#x27;ve always tended to have fairly dry skin.  I don&#x27;t like using a lot of heavy moisturizers, though, as those seem to invariably lead to acne issues on my chin in particular.  Frustrating, as everything just seems to be such a contradiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees Renewal Night Cream has been really good though.  It feels fairly thick going on, but it absorbs pretty well.  It has a fruity scent, which I notice as I put it on, but I don&#x27;t continue to smell it for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for a couple of weeks, and I have not ended up with acne issues, and my skin is noticeably smoother</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product after reading the 5 star reviews.  I was looking for a good night cream after using Avon for so long.  I don&#x27;t like it at all.  Smells weird and does not soak into face.  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Arrived on time wrapped in a secure fashion. This is one of the best products I have used, might be considered expensive but remember a little bit goes a long was</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how many lotions I&#x27;ve tried in my lifetime. I have very dry skin on my face, and I am also very sensitive to certain ingredients (and I don&#x27;t have a complete list of those so I&#x27;m still discovering).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing was working. I&#x27;d get a face rash, or my face would look shiny, or I&#x27;d have to reapply the lotion over and over and over. Until I found Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate, it moisturizes perfectly, I love the smell, and I love the jar it comes in. I am a fan for life.</li>
            <li> As a night cream it is very nice: not too greasy, pleasant herbal scent that&#x27;s not too strong and with a natural feel to it. It makes the skin feel smooth and supple. But the firming properties were not evident after about two weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s smooth and creamy to put on.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of firming, but I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week.  I do think my face looks brighter.  I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> I want to love Burt&#x27;s Bees skin creams, but have been unimpressed with how greasy they end up being (clog pores) and have too much scent. I&#x27;ve also read a lot recently about how using moisturizer constantly, day and night, makes your body stop producing its own moisturizing oils which leads to even drier skin, ironically. I&#x27;ve been happy just using a day cream with SPF and then spraying some Dr. Hauschka toner on after washing my face at night.</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bee renewal cream moisturizes well, relatively natural, and smooths out skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients seem lengthy, but upon further review, most of the ingredients have natural elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes well. I can&#x27;t say it will guarantee less wrinkles, but skin is definitely smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough yet to comment on whether or not this has firming capabilities as the name suggests, but at the same time, I&#x27;m dubious products can provide such benefits and it&#x27;s not why I got it.  What I did get if for, and what is does very well, is moisturize, moisturize and more moisturize.  The cream is very thick and a little goes a long way.  It really leaves my skin soft and oh, did I mentioned moisturize.  If I was rich, I would rub this everywhere especially on the cracked and callous ridges of my hobbit like feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comparing this to Avon night cream. So far, it works great! My skin is soft and smooth. This doesn&#x27;t smell, like some creams, and so far, hasn&#x27;t caused break outs. I smooths wrinkle as much as any cream.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;5 and normally 125lbs athletic. I got up to 170 and got massive stretch marks. Because of muscle memory and breastfeeding, I bounced back and my stomach shrunk back to normal by week 4, however, the skin is saggy like an 80 year old (I&#x27;m 30). I decided to use this cream on it, heck why not?? After 2 weeks of use just at night, in liberal amounts all over my belly, I have totally noticed a difference. Mind you they do NOT improve stretch marks, but they have visibly improved the elasticity of all that droopy skin and after another container, I can start to tackle the stretch marks themselves after I research. I love the smell of this product also; very light and refreshing. Also note the cream absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you oily or sticky. GREAT PRODUCT! Buying again and again,</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks, and we&#x27;re really very pleased with this night cream. The price is right and the scent and consitency are nice. But the main thing is that it works. It works better than any other night cream we&#x27;ve used, and we&#x27;re talking skin that&#x27;s over 50 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t used many Burt&#x27;s Bees products better except for the lip balm, which is excellent (if a little bit pricey). We&#x27;ll look into using more of their products if they&#x27;re all as good as this cream.</li>
            <li> This night cream is very rich and thick, and it moisturizes well. A little goes a very long way. My skin is sensitive and often reacts to creams with a lot of active ingredients, but I have not noticed any adverse reactions to this cream. It also seems to make my skin look a bit firmer with consistent use. My one complaint about this is that it has an odd sent: a strong floral component.</li>
            <li> I really like this night cream.  It&#x27;s a rich cream but not so much that it feels heavy on the skin and you don&#x27;t need much of it as a little goes a long way.  It has a pleasing light citrus/floral scent out of the jar but it&#x27;s not a really bold fragrance that makes you feel like your putting perfume on your face and the scent dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Thick, rich night creams can be very pricey, along with being very greasy. But in the case of Burt&#x27;s Bees Renewal Night Cream, the price is economical, and the cream is rich and hydrating without being overly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use a lot (about a nickel size dollop for your face and neck), so the jar should last some time. There is a slight fragrance to the product, but I found it to be very light, and it fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is intensely moisturizing, and there does seem to be a SLIGHT firming effect after a few nights of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the price is good, the ingredients are mostly natural, and a little goes a long way. Definitely worth a try if you are looking for a new night cream that both hydrates and firms.</li>
            <li> So my wife and I have tested this and she&#x27;s over the moon with this product. I lack the depth of experience that she has with such products but she ranked this in a &amp;#34;top 3 ever&amp;#34; category and was shocked to hear it&#x27;s under $20 a pot. I tried this every night for a few days and it really does have an immediate refreshing and softening effect but being a guy I typically forget to apply it every day. We&#x27;ve used a number of Burts Bees products over the last year and had good results with all of them (except the shampoo, strangely). Like the other products in the line, it&#x27;s mostly a natural recipe, it&#x27;s inexpensive and seems to work just as well as products many times the price.</li>
            <li> I normally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and use their lip balm all summer long.  I was very excited to try their night cream.  I&#x27;m 34, and the laugh lines and eye crinkles are starting to pop up.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is pretty different from the others I&#x27;ve used (L&#x27;Oreal, Clinique, Neutrogena).  It&#x27;s more thin and greasy in texture than anything I&#x27;ve used, which I found a bit off-putting.  The real problem for me is the scent.  It&#x27;s heavily floral, but not a pretty floral, and it lingers.  I tried just using this around my forehead and cheeks, steering clear of my nose, but I can still smell it for over an hour.  I&#x27;ve been trying to deal with it for three weeks to see if the results outweighed the odor, but honestly I haven&#x27;t seen much.  I might be having uncommon results, but this one&#x27;s not for me.  I&#x27;ll be sticking to their lip balm and going back to my L&#x27;Oreal for face cream.</li>
