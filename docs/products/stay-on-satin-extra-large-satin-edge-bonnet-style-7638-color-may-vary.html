            <li> Nice little secret.  </li>
            <li> The band is not too tight at all, for a normal size head.</li>
            <li> In the winter when I have to wear a beanie hat in the freezing cold, I tuck my hair in this and then put on my winter hat so that it does not dry out my hair.  :-)</li>
            <li> They send you ugly colors like brown (when they show you nice colors online, like purple).</li>
            <li> My hair is sooooooooo freggin&#x27; long, it is unreal!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wake up with a headache when I wear this to bed...or any long than 2 hours....</li>
            <li> Not as big as I expected.</li>
            <li> this really does not work, is just so small for my head!</li>
            <li> It has a faint odor (not unpleasant) that eventually wears off, then you throw it out.  </li>
            <li> If you have a big head, the band will be too tight.</li>
            <li> and I just simply pull it a little so that it sits on my forehead</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do - total waste of money</li>
            <li> I awoke the next day to what looked like small burn marks on my forehead about a half and inch long.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t deprive other long-hair lovers of this secret.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m writing this review is because people who see me everyday are commenting on how LONG my hair is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have other satin caps that I wear, and I must admit, satin caps change the texture of your hair exponentially.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The other one I slept in for a week, no problem.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and natural (about bra strap length when flat-ironed) and this bonnet hold all my curls.</li>
            <li> Supposedly, you shouldn&#x27;t wash it because it&#x27;s coated with a &amp;#34;anti-breakage conditioner&amp;#34; but after I used it to sleep in a few nights, I did through it in the washing machine with other delicates, and it handled the washing</li>
            <li> Mine came in black.  </li>
            <li> I also need to move it around because it will begin to feel tight.</li>
            <li> It does not leave tight band marks on the forehead.</li>
            <li> This bonnet does not slide off during sleeping, yet it is not too tight.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I usually have an issue with the silk bonnets staying on but this hugs your head so tight that my daughter couldn&#x27;t dislodge it</li>
            <li> It has a thicker band than typical elastic bonnets that I&#x27;ve purchased in the stores, WHICH IS A PLUS!!  </li>
            <li> The hat was not tight, yet it left these terrible marks on my forehead.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too thin.</li>
            <li> weird as it seems</li>
            <li> I was wrong.   </li>
            <li> Sorry, bad product.</li>
            <li> terrible decision.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have only been using this product a week, i wake  up with soft hair, the smell is not bad at all..i keep reading good reviews, and i got two caps for only 2$ so why not? i will be back with another review in a month :)</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t deprive other long-hair lovers of this secret.&lt;br /&gt;This cap is UNBELIEVABLE!&lt;br /&gt;As weird as it seems, this cap DOES make your hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m writing this review is because people who see me everyday are commenting on how LONG my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone wants to \\&quot;touch\\&quot; my hair (which is getting kind of irritating).&lt;br /&gt;Six weeks of cap wearing, and I&#x27;m looking like Rapunzel.&lt;br /&gt;LOL!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, folks.  My hair is sooooooooo freggin&#x27; long, it is unreal!&lt;br /&gt;I have other satin caps that I wear, and I must admit, satin caps change the texture of your hair exponentially.&lt;br /&gt;This one GROWS your hair! Exponentially!</li>
            <li> Not an extra large at all. I couldn&#x27;t even stretch the band to attempt to even put it on. I couldn&#x27;t put it on at all. Returning asap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years.  They used to sell them in Walmart, but now they&#x27;re always gone because they work so well.  They really do make your hair grow.  Actually, they keep your hair from producing split ends and breaking off so it CAN grow longer.  It has a faint odor (not unpleasant) that eventually wears off, then you throw it out.  (You don&#x27;t wash them becaue they are sprayed with a conditioner that is transferred by the heat of your head and the rubbing of it on your hair while you sleep).  The price is great if you can find them in the store.  I wanted to order 5 from Amazon and the price of shipping and handling made it come to $37.00!  Try to find them at an African-American Beauty Supply Store if you can. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I picked up this satin bonnet at my local Sally&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve been using it to sleep and to lounge around the house and so far so good.  Supposedly, you shouldn&#x27;t wash it because it&#x27;s coated with a &amp;#34;anti-breakage conditioner&amp;#34; but after I used it to sleep in a few nights, I did through it in the washing machine with other delicates, and it handled the washing just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, swavy/curly hair, medium length and what I do is nighttime, I gather my hair up in a &amp;#34;pineapple&amp;#34; and I put this bonnet over it and  I tighten it enough so that if feels snug but not tight and I do let my ears out and it stays on through the night without any problems.  At times I have felt it creeping up my head and I just simply pull it a little so that it sits on my forehead and it stays on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this working out for me just fine.  Keeps my curls in tact.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am letting my hair grow out, and currently have extensions.  I ordered two products which were both satin bonnets.  The other one I slept in for a week, no problem.  I then decided to try this one as it states hair growth.....terrible decision.  I awoke the next day to what looked like small burn marks on my forehead about a half and inch long.  I thought maybe the hat being a Large/XL, there would be no problems with the elastic, etc.  I was wrong.   The hat was not tight, yet it left these terrible marks on my forehead. The area which first appeared to be just a mark left by the hat, has turned into some type of acne now on my forehead.  I am unsure of what is really going on with the bonnet, but I would tell everyone it is not a product to choose.   I am having to cover the marks on my forehead with make upto go out in Public.  Sorry, bad product.</li>
            <li> Well I Just only have one week so, can&#x27;t really tell if its working. Well Thank You so Much for providing this product.</li>
            <li> this really does not work, is just so small for my head! and has a funny smell so if you want to wear something weird cool you can try it!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do - total waste of money - do not spend your money on it.</li>
            <li> This is not extra large. It is a regular sized bonnet. I just added it to my collection of regular sized bonnets. If you are looking for something for bigger hair...this is not it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has a massive amount of curly natural hair and it fit perfectly. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I wake up with a headache when I wear this to bed...or any long than 2 hours....it now sits in my throw away pile. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Stays on.  I recommend to anyone.  A bit roomy too if you have fuller hair.  Mine came in black.  Price was good.</li>
            <li> Nice little secret.  In the winter when I have to wear a beanie hat in the freezing cold, I tuck my hair in this and then put on my winter hat so that it does not dry out my hair.  :-)</li>
            <li> I am not a stranger to this product. I have used it for years and it lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Was very tight at first around the band but stays on pretty well&lt;br /&gt;probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Not as big as I expected.</li>
            <li> This product seemed good enough but was useless due to a total lack of any kind of elastic or band to keep it on. It simply slid off.</li>
            <li> This product came in purple, which was really cute. It stays on my head during the night. The band is not too tight at all, for a normal size head. The smell is good and its roomy for managing a lot of hair. The size states XL, but its really a Large. If you have a big head, the band will be too tight. I will be purchasing more. Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> But it makes my hairline itch, especially above the forehead. I also need to move it around because it will begin to feel tight. Still, it stays in place thru the night, when I wear it over jojoba oil or conditioner. And it doesn&#x27;t get too hot overnight.</li>
            <li> It fits, and my hair has grown about 5 inches since I first began wearing them.  It really works... Thank you.</li>
            <li> This bonnet is quite spacious and does not slide off at night. It has a thicker band than typical elastic bonnets that I&#x27;ve purchased in the stores, WHICH IS A PLUS!!  My hair is very thick and natural (about bra strap length when flat-ironed) and this bonnet hold all my curls. I didn&#x27;t buy this for the conditioning ingredient, so I can&#x27;t speak for that, but otherwise, this is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. They send you ugly colors like brown (when they show you nice colors online, like purple). Plus, the seams start to come apart after a while</li>
            <li> I have a normal head size, but it will not stay on my head through the night.  It could also be the material, it&#x27;s too thin.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these for myself and my daughter. I usually have an issue with the silk bonnets staying on but this hugs your head so tight that my daughter couldn&#x27;t dislodge it and her head is smaller than mine! I am impressed with how it locks the moisture in. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Cap working very well, it does not fall off durning sleep. It does not leave tight band marks on the forehead. I have purchased additional caps. The smell very nice, so good the dog ate one!</li>
            <li> The bonnet I received was used. I could smell the hair products on the bonnet. Also, it didn&#x27;t look new. The material is not 100% satin. I don&#x27;t know what kind of material it is. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> I really love this. It worked perfectly on my natural hair. I am black and my hair is natural has to be done and this product is perfect. If you want to see how i use the product watch my youtube video and subscribe, if you have any question ask me on the comment section. Youtube flexi rods on natural hair. I am Pearl Gold on Youtube. I was trying to put up the link but it didnt let me.</li>
            <li> This bonnet does not slide off during sleeping, yet it is not too tight. I love it and will probably get more.</li>
            <li> The band is pretty tight which helps it stay on all night. I love that it&#x27;s not elastic so it won&#x27;t stretch out over time!</li>
