            <li>I will be happy to provide whatever information I can to help skeptics understand that this review is genuine.  </li>
            <li>Once again I am happy but I&#x27;d like to know why Norelco sells shavers with the cheap heads.</li>
            <li>fit great to my electric shaver norelco.</li>
            <li>I liked the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that some people in the world still take pride in their products.</li>
            <li>The heads were protected by their own sturdy container.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>and I did it from my own home.</li>
            <li>product arrived in a timly manor, good construction, enjoying close shaves.</li>
            <li>Now that they own Drugstore.com</li>
            <li>Ahhh, it&#x27;s nice to have my shaver working at peak performance again.</li>
            <li>I have owned Norelco products for many years and found them to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>My husband was thrilled with the Norelco replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s electric razor is still running nicely and somehow the quality is not always there when it&#x27;s time to replace something.  </li>
            <li>Kind of pricey for what they are</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a nice close shave again</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver I own specifies HQ55 shaving heads.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, happy customer!</li>
            <li>The HQ55 blades fit my razor perfectly, and give me a nice clean shave every time, and I saved $10 because I bought them online.  </li>
            <li>It is Worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied to get genuine Norelco blades at a good price.</li>
            <li>I have an older electric norelco, one of the best razers I have invested in, it used to be my husbands</li>
            <li>exactly what was offered.price was very fair</li>
            <li>This was a wonderful &amp; economical solution and works just fine.  </li>
            <li>works good, my old one was making a lot of noise and wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d forgotten how wonderful new razor heads are.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my shaving routine now with the new heads.</li>
            <li>Also, I really liked the low-end, powerful Norelco 6423LC model that Norelco had discontinued (it is not rechargeable but is great for travel because it is 120/240 volt).  </li>
            <li>Great company, quick service.</li>
            <li>It is good for many more years of use.</li>
            <li>Great product, reasonable price and good quality.  </li>
            <li>Replacement heads are very easy to change.  </li>
            <li>VERY easy to change the blades.</li>
            <li>VERY easy to install.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!  :-)</li>
            <li>I know Norelco has a Good reputation and they have proven it to me by providing me with a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li>Good news is the heads do fit in my shaver.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to find replacement heads</li>

            <li>These arrived quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT  QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t available in stores any more - who knows!</li>
            <li>New heads work and fit great!</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly and now shaves like a new shaver.</li>
            <li>It was easy to order, came in three days, and works perfectly on my 9-year old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for probably 20 years, have to replace blades periodically, which is ok, glad to be able to find them.</li>
            <li>and I have not been able to find replacement heads for it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Be sure that the heads you buy will work with your shaver.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s probably better stuff out there, but you&#x27;ll pay dearly for it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>We purchased the Norelco shaver replacement heads for my father and he is extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>He struggled for several months getting a close shave, and this product worked perfectly for him.</li>
            <li>So make sure you stock up on replacement heads as well as maintain your razors.  </li>
            <li>Made my shaving experience much better.</li>
            <li>used the option to have periodic deliveries and saved even more.</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased to find replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco electric razor at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I started using an Electric Razor at around the beginning of the year and Love it.</li>
            <li>Bought the NORELCO brand as I assumed these would be better than another replacement mfg.  </li>
            <li>WOULD RECOMMEND AND AM SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>I have replaced the heads many times and always have been pleased.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy and would order again.</li>
            <li>Norelco will remain at the top of our shaver purchases.</li>
            <li>I saved more than $[...] by ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and we are happy with the whole experience.</li>
            <li>as advertised,  Great,  Buy hew real Philips Norelcol and not knock off brands.</li>
            <li>As my parents age, I am having to manage more of their needs.  </li>
            <li>What more could I want?</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with my purchase of the HQ55 replacement cutters for my Norelco Shaver.</li>
            <li>so says the wife :).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s OK, you can thank me</li>
            <li>Well, it doesn&#x27;t even come close to fitting.</li>
            <li>I went out and bought a Braun Electric Razor which I know is better.</li>
            <li>These go for a lot more in the Store.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>They have been replaced by the HQ 56 , 55&#x27;s not made any more</li>
            <li>the price was better than buying it at the stores.</li>
            <li>I installed the HQ 56 heads and found them to be not at all much better than my existing worn 3 Year</li>
            <li>Norelco corded/cordless shaver for many years,</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>More if you shave twice a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many many years.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>They cut the beard much better.  </li>
            <li>HQ55&#x27;s I want the HQ55&#x27;s and not the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\</li>
            <li>Great product, seller not so much.</li>
            <li>The heads that I bought (HQ 55) were perfect and simple to replace in the razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Philips Norelco Triple Header Shavers with HQ55 or HQ56 blades for more than fifteen years</li>
            <li>Sure it took some getting used too some twenty years ago</li>
            <li>Shaving is much better now.</li>
            <li>What more could one ask for?  </li>
            <li>What more could any one ask for?</li>
            <li>I think this is the third replacement head I&#x27;ve gotten for this razor and the best price</li>
            <li>Make sure this fits your razor before you purchase it.</li>
            <li>you can also buy replacement batteries on Amazon that restore the ability to hold a charge for a week or more.</li>
            <li>I should do this more often.</li>
            <li>My dad was so pleased to be able to find the replacement head to his razor.  </li>
            <li>boy can;t trust anybody any more</li>
            <li>Am so glad I saw these.</li>
            <li>well satisfied.</li>
            <li>Replaceing heads just makes good economical sense.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more, can I?  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find replacement heads for a Norelco 4601X, purchased in 2000, and no longer made.</li>
            <li>In reality, while these heads do a good job (and way better than the old ones), I don&#x27;t feel they are quite as good as they are described.</li>
            <li>Perfect Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to be able to find them and at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>any more and there not made as well.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought replacement</li>
            <li>and I would surely order again when it comes time to buy more of them</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find these heads anywhere.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the one I bought a year ago.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and will re-order when needed.</li>
            <li>but it is not; the item isn&#x27;t as it looks or is listed and the packaging could be be better.</li>
            <li>My husband was glad to be able to get these replacements</li>
            <li>I vowed to replace them more often</li>
            <li>These cost much more in my hometown stores.</li>
            <li>so my blade head lasts longer than most.  </li>
            <li>Even better with Williams Lectric Shave.</li>
            <li>I need to change blades more often.</li>
            <li>Three more words required.</li>
            <li>, I love to use it on my legs, and I don&#x27;t have any worry about razer burn or bumps....</li>
            <li>These work perfectly on my razor even though it says HQ55+ only.</li>
            <li>ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok</li>
            <li>It was very easy to click into place, the longest part was researching which model heads to get that fit my razor :)</li>
            <li>Electric razors are not as good as a hand razor but he is very happy using the new electric razor head since a friend gave him an old razor.</li>
            <li>These blades work great as the replacements for the older blades.</li>
            <li>Every morning I look forward to a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an older razor that works great still.</li>
            <li>so this were a particular joy ...</li>
            <li>Norelco works great and with new heads greater.</li>
            <li>Popped these in easily and hope to get many more years use...</li>
            <li>This is the first one that didn&#x27;t give a good shave.</li>
            <li>some money try a good cleaning first.  </li>
            <li>New blades are great.  </li>
            <li>He says they are great; it&#x27;s like having a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the razor for 10+ years, and its great to replace just the heads every 1-2 years instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the electric razor and now it shaves like new without having to buy another one.</li>
            <li>The new blades have been great.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe what a difference these new blades were, shaved me with no problems and no pulling out hairs any more!!</li>
            <li>While it shaves better than the original, I had hoped for more of an improvement.  </li>
            <li>, I figured it was worth it since he likes the original razor, and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to throw away a perfectly good product.</li>
            <li>These new ones were easy to install and the difference is great.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was able to purchase mine at 50% off.  </li>
            <li>This product fit my husband&#x27;s Norelco razor that he has had for many years.  </li>
            <li>Glad they&#x27;re still available.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad they have them available</li>
            <li>It fit my HQ55+ that I bought many years ago</li>
            <li>Good fast shipping.</li>
            <li>good replacement, thanks</li>
            <li>Was a good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is a good price and the blades work very well.  </li>
            <li>Husband thought he would have to buy a whole new electric razor, I suggested we try replacing the heads, they work great!</li>
            <li>I would have liked them to be a pinch sharper if that is the right word to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the correct head, works fine, the price was good, the shipment fast</li>
            <li>Everything was fast and easy!!</li>
            <li>I repleced the original cutters and the razor now cuts better than when I bought it.</li>
            <li>I think they were better then the original ones.  </li>
            <li>Buying them at Amazon.com is a great deal because their prices are so low and the shipping is free!  </li>
            <li>Easy to change and what a difference.  </li>
            <li>I got just what I needed,and just what I ordered,as easy as falling off a log.</li>
            <li>They fit my old shaver and cut great.</li>
            <li>Close shave and easy to install.</li>
            <li>You made it easy to order my blades online</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>but I could tell it wasn&#x27;t easy to shave anymore.  </li>
            <li>The heads are easily replaced.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads (Purchased on September 4, 2012)were easy to install.</li>
            <li>They were easy to replace and work</li>
            <li>Easy to install and order was received promptly.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.  </li>
            <li>easy to replace.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend these replacement heads to anyone with a Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>If you liked them the first time around, the replacements work fine--but they&#x27;re really easy to \\&quot;install!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My son and I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any store in our area so finding it on Amazon.com was perfect since my son wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use his present shaver any more without new replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to install and the razor shaves as good as new.</li>
            <li>Good deal if you are like me and don&#x27;t see any reason to buy a new electric razor every year or two.</li>
            <li>The heads are not as good as what you get with the new shaver.</li>
            <li>I will most certainly purchace these again..!!</li>
            <li>The replacement heads easily installed into my razor and made a huge difference in the quality and closeness of my shaves.</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy order.</li>
            <li>+, they work just fine in my electric razor.  </li>
            <li>These are working fine.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT IS FINE AND SHIPPMENT CAME IN ON TIME</li>
            <li>I shopped them online to find the best price and found them for a bit less than $30 with a shop I didn&#x27;t recognize.</li>
            <li>just fine.  </li>
            <li>Product works fine.</li>
            <li>Norelco has always made a fine product.</li>
            <li>The blades work fine  </li>
            <li>The product works fine.  </li>
            <li>The replacement works fine.</li>
            <li>they are as pictured and work fine</li>
            <li>I replaced the blades with this replacement set, and it works fine.</li>
            <li>The HQ56 heads are fine.  </li>
            <li>these will work fine.</li>
            <li>Flex heads are super &amp; give a close shave !</li>
            <li>usual, Amazon had the best price on these, and the free shipping made the deal even better.</li>
            <li>They fit the Norelco shaver and work good as new</li>
            <li>I also bought and tried \\&quot;Vollco Sharpening Heads\\&quot;, which are designed to hone the edges of worn-down Norelco reflex razor heads, but these did not succeed at all in getting me back to a great, easy shave.    </li>
            <li>They fit and worked just fine with no issues or problems to report.</li>
            <li>But with three new facts in hand (changed sound, more whisker material, and really great, fast shave again),</li>
            <li>The heads fit fine, but don&#x27;t give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The replacement parts worked perfectly and I expect to get years of trouble free service, thank you.</li>
            <li>It makes a HUGE difference with the end result........</li>
            <li>I bought these for a Norelco Reflex Plus 6615x razor and they fit correctly.</li>
            <li>Amazon was giving me free shipping and lower price.</li>
            <li>Now, I have a smooth shave again after replacing the head.  </li>
            <li>Prolonged the life of a shaver and is smooth and durable.</li>
            <li>No Tax and Free Shipping always helps</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for several years and it gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t remember how smooth this razor shaved until I replaced the heads!&lt;br</li>
            <li>One word: smooth.</li>
            <li>I get a smooth shave once again.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to mention that my shaver is \\&quot;6844 XL\\&quot; and these heads fit.  </li>
            <li>The box says they are a replacement for the HQ55, but they don&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li>They fit into the razor.  </li>
            <li>know if they were available any longer</li>
            <li>They fit, and they work.  </li>
            <li>These blades fit a razor I have used for decades.  </li>
            <li>yes they fit my razorand</li>
            <li>Product gave a comfortable and close shave and would recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li>Not some fit all..</li>
            <li>The heads don&#x27;t fit the razor.  </li>
            <li>They fit and were just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>did fit my razor</li>
            <li>These precision made replacement heads maintain a smooth cut</li>
            <li>Goiod fit.</li>
            <li>and they still fit perfectily.  </li>
            <li>There was a note on the package that said the 56&#x27;s will fit on the 55&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The head fit on my shaver</li>
            <li>The price was great to what I had paid last year at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>Now I can enjoy my electric shaver again.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased this item I determined the correct fit by going to the merchant site.</li>
            <li>WHY the merchant who should have known what razor I was buying this for, and know it would fit should have notified me.</li>
            <li>Replacing the heads made my shaver good asnew at a considerable savings.</li>
            <li>and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>And I was even more pleased because the package arrived much sooner that the date I was given.</li>
            <li>nice and sharp, a perfect fit for the old shaver.  </li>
            <li>Glad I read this and kept the motor, my new blades work great as does the old motor which is strong.  </li>
            <li>This was a very worth while purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very happy I bought these, a great little investment, it feels like a whole new razor again.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and clean shaven again.</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy.                        </li>
            <li>They were easy and quick to install.</li>
            <li>super easy to install</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and were easy to install.</li>
            <li>This was an excellent replacement for my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to improve the shaver back to new condition.&lt;br /&gt;Was very easy to replace old shaver</li>
            <li>These new heads made my shaver better than when I bought it!</li>
            <li>Norelco excellent quality however over priced,  the shaver heads which need replaced yearly now days approaches the cost of an entire new raiser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the HQ55 was &#x27;state of the art&#x27; when I first got the shaver, but I&#x27;ve never been convinced it shaves \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>I need to be sure that the credit for the first order was made.  </li>
            <li>&quot; the razor to its original quality.   </li>
            <li>Also the packaging was original.  </li>
            <li>Got them in time, and placing them on the razor is fairly straightforward.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to get such a clean cut after using the original parts which have been in use for MANY years.</li>
            <li>After using the razor for many years, the new blades made it as good as new.</li>
            <li>He thinks he has a new shaver and is thrilled with them.</li>
            <li>Nice clean shave the way it did when it was new.</li>
            <li>It works great and fit his razor, we will continue to order the replacement heads from you as long as razor continues to work!!!</li>
            <li>I was not getting a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>These heads work as advertised and provide a clean shave every time.  </li>
            <li>Clean close shave.</li>
            <li>a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I get about 2 years out of the blades before it takes 10 minutes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I clean the shaving head often and spray Norelco HQ110.</li>
            <li>Service was great, as stated, securely wrapped and recieved sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>These are priced much better than their own site, and the quality is the same.</li>
            <li>I clean the head 3 to 4 time a week</li>
            <li>Product was priced right and has worked effectively to give me a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>, It is nice to have nice sharp razor blades for my electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The so-called \\&quot;Lift and Cut\\&quot; configuration has two sets of angled, stacked blades in the rotating shaver head, and I have every reason to believe that Norelco&#x27;s illustrations and claims of their special effectiveness are correct.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;There you are, shaving for that special evening out when you realize your face isn&#x27;t getting any smoother.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just very pleased indeed with the outcome and grateful to Norelco for putting out a fine product for several decades now.    </li>
            <li>It gets the job done, which I guess you really can&#x27;t ask for any more-</li>
            <li>If you have, as I do, a rechargeable model (and the batteries are still good), you might want to buy the cheapest corded model using the same head assembly and scavenger it for parts.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, a Satisfied Customer  Chuck Gmurek</li>
            <li>I have no complaints, but be warned that this is just the three razor discs, not the full plastic head assembly.</li>
            <li>The blades (HQ4+) that this model replaced worked a whole lot better and were reliable and never broke like the HQ55.</li>
            <li>My boss doesn&#x27;t have an Amazon account, and since we&#x27;re good friends, sometimes I order things for him and he pays me back.  </li>
            <li>Nothing but good things overall for this transaction.</li>
            <li>makes my shave a lot better thanks</li>
            <li>I gave them a closer look and more thorough intense cleaning.  </li>
            <li>remember put the blade each same with the place, and its good to go</li>
            <li>This is the second time to purchase replacement heads which extend the life of a good razor.</li>
            <li>Installation was a snap, and my morning shave is much faster and more</li>
            <li>Finally, a quick clean shave.</li>
            <li>It was very clear that one replaces all three heads, and that job was very easy.    </li>
            <li>(I still miss my corded 1967 Tripleheader, a Christmas present from Mom &amp; Dad, which provided a smooth shave for more than 30 years!)</li>
            <li>In getting new blades every 6 months was the best thing to happens, keeps the razor sharp amd</li>
            <li>These are genuine Norelco heads and replacing them is as easy as cleaning the old ones and they work better the first time you use them.</li>
            <li>No matter how many passes you make with your Norelco Reflex Plus shaver, you just can&#x27;t seem to get that clean, close shave you remember from when it was new (when was that?  </li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find it but think it might have been open before.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery of product and performance</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.  </li>
            <li>One quick trip on the Internet and Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I received the replacement blades quickly and they were as described.  </li>
            <li>Replacement heads arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;very quickly.</li>
            <li>and I got lucky</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>The item was received quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon.com&#x27;s packaging was tremendously wasteful.</li>
            <li>My husband is so grateful that we are still able to find replacement heads for his older Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Instead of spending a lot of money on repalcement heads at the store, these are just as good and should prolong my razor for a few more years.</li>
            <li>I find this deceptive, and even am more concerned AMAZON doesn&#x27;t see to be concerned about the merchants, what I consider at best a very poor way of dealing with customers.</li>
            <li>This is an exact fit replacement for my shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shave I get with these heads are far better than the original set that came with the electric shaver</li>
            <li>They were received quickly and they work a lot better than the old ones!  </li>
            <li>but I think the shaver works better now than when new.</li>
            <li>In fact, the shaver works like new, and I am glad I went the route I did.</li>
            <li>This is better than buying a new razor,it&#x27;s cheaper and you will feel  </li>
            <li>Not 5 star review since two of them at $24 cost more than a new razor at $40 to $50.</li>
            <li>I replaced the heads on my shaver with these and it works better now than it did when it was brand new.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better to buy a pack of replacement heads than spending $$$ on a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The new blades give a much better shave.</li>
            <li>Better to replace a portion instead of buying new razor.</li>
            <li>you can buy a new razor for about $10-$15 dollars more.</li>
            <li>They quickly aimed me in the right direction, and the blades were delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and blades are easy to replace.</li>
            <li>My beard is once again easy to clean and stays smoother with the new blades.</li>
            <li>My shaver is over 19 years old, and the replacement blades fit and work fine.  </li>
            <li>My Norelco electric razor was in good working order, but the blades were dull and refused to cut any more.  </li>
            <li>fit good and have had to trouble with it.</li>
            <li>I needed a replacement and this was the site that made it available and at a reasonable price..  </li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The blades are not inexpensive and my expendeture, so far, is greater than I would pay for a newer model.  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly, it came on a different  package as shown on the picture, but the heads fit&#x27;s on HG55, so I didnt have any trouble.</li>
            <li>Glad I found a source of replacement blades for my old razor.</li>
            <li>We cannot purchase them at our local bigbox store anymore, and he&#x27;s been using these replacement heads for years, so we were thrilled when we found them online.  </li>
            <li>sent them back...no better than the old ones.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Now if they could only cut the price as well that would be nice.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and recommend this replacement head to anyone seeking to make their old razor just like new.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure this is good quality product, I found it was less costly to purchase a new Norelco 6940 shaver set from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The blades give me a regular clean, close shave that I am satisfied with.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, I do not understand the high prices.sometimes</li>
            <li>After installing I&#x27;m wondering if the blades are as sharp as they should be... seems the razor doesn&#x27;t cut quite as good as it used to??</li>
            <li>original heads lasted 6 years, these cut really well now.</li>
            <li>These came in a different package than I am used to, so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if they were going to fit my razor (a 6843XL), but they did.</li>
            <li>What are the odds, right?  </li>
            <li>My shave quality improved right away.</li>
            <li>received right away.</li>
            <li>And the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Hope it was the right thing to do.</li>
            <li>If this falls into the right hands,,,I would like to use the $30 deduction  for another Philips Norelco HQ55 Reflex Replacement Head..  </li>
            <li>and they were right.</li>
            <li>They are what was needed, at the right price.</li>
            <li>Just the right replacement.</li>
            <li>Check you model number to ensure you get the right blades.</li>
            <li>Just the right replacement heads my Father In Law needed.  </li>
            <li>Price is right..............................</li>
            <li>My brother has a new motor which isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>My Norelco Shaver was not cutting properly and by replacing the shaver head it works as good as new.</li>
            <li>At a good price, this beats buying a new shaver, and replacing them is quite easy, even if you normally wouldn&#x27;t attempt such a thing.</li>
            <li>All things considered, my best guess is that these replacement heads sold on Amazon actually do come from the same factory in China where the good ones from Norelco are made, but are somehow being diverted and stolen from the production line at a point before some sort of final, critical manufacturing step(s) is carried out.    </li>
            <li>What was substituted was Norelco HQ 56 heads, claiming they will fit my particular Norelco razor.</li>
            <li>and although each shavers has less life than its predecessor; the original blades and cutters are in a class by themselves and are far superior to any aftermarket ordered and available at any discounted price.</li>
            <li>Ok product the blades were not sharp.</li>
            <li>The head is very good, but after I bought it I found the complete razor on sale at Longs Drug Store for less money than just buying the head  </li>
            <li>Nice clean heads with sharp blades.</li>
            <li>I have a Norelco shaver and had the same experience, after replacing the shaver heads, my shaver was as good as new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with these new OEM blades, and wish I had not wasted the money on the other razor.</li>
            <li>I decided since the razors are doing a fine job, I would just get the new heads.  </li>
            <li>the new one works fine.</li>
            <li>And the shave was, finally, terrific and easy again!  </li>
            <li>Great to have sharp new Blades.  </li>
            <li>I already had one and noticed the new one did not seem to work as well or shave as smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly the right set.</li>
            <li>So far the return process has been easy though.</li>
            <li>It is easy to remove the old and put on the replacement.  </li>
            <li>And while I was at it, I ordered replacement blades for my old antique Schick injector razors, which had provided me with many a good shave in the past.</li>
            <li>I bought this lower end to use while on coumadin, but must admit it gives a pretty darn good shave in less the time and hassle with foam and Mach 3 razors.</li>
            <li>These heads came very fast from the vender.  </li>
            <li>Thankyou very much for the business.</li>
            <li>Now I know and thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I gave him the new heads, and he swears his Norelco is better than new.</li>
            <li>No gripes concerning the new cutter heads and am quite satisfied with the performance of the new heads.</li>
            <li>Good product but a little pricey.</li>
            <li>Good, could be a little sharper.</li>
            <li>great product was a hard to find.</li>
            <li>do a great job on those neck hairs that are so hard to get.</li>
            <li>In these \\&quot;greening of America\\&quot; days, it&#x27;s good to extend the useful life of electronic devices instead of putting them in the landfill, &amp; buying new foreign products.</li>
            <li>So, more recently I bought</li>
            <li>Fit my old Norelco shaver as stated.  </li>
            <li>Delivered on time, and cuts much better that what I had (which were exactly the same) because they were blunt.</li>
            <li>Why pay more for the exact same product?</li>
            <li>This product restores the performance of the shaver; and the price on Amazon is better than the price at local retailers.</li>
            <li>This is the first replacement head I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>It was exactly what we were looking for &amp; worked well on my Norelco Reflex Plus razor.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Price is better than the local stores.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s service was first rate.</li>
            <li>I had ordered, and I have found them to be exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I find it to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>So now, thanks to the diversity of Amazon.com, I am a clean-shaven man!</li>
            <li>I received my purchase in three days and the item was the exact replacement I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I find that these heads and cutters have the same problem as most Norelco blades they do not cut all that well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I first purchased my Norelco Razor in 1988.</li>
            <li>The first one  works like a dream...</li>
            <li>Will need more in future.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was going to order these for my Norelco 6940 but decided to give the heads another cleaning first.  </li>
            <li>We only buy Norelco :)</li>
            <li>A couple more passes over the same spot does result in a shave as the commercials claim.</li>
            <li>These Norelco Heads do exactly what they were purchased for, shaving with a close blade.  </li>
            <li>He replaced them with the old ones and his electric razor is working fabulously.</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast!</li>
            <li>Not difficult at all.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Amazon came through with the product delivered very promptly!</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads were exactly the product that I wanted.</li>
            <li>Why Norelco needs so many different models</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I shopped local stores that were priced a lot more than on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>My first shave (face and head) after replacing the heads in my electric razor was so close</li>
            <li>treat yourself-you don&#x27;t really have to rub the whiskers off!</li>
            <li>Would purchase more in the future.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>this was correct the first time</li>
            <li>Got this set of blades for my old electric razor and they perform better than the ones that came with the razor when it was new.</li>
            <li>A quick trip to the BBB site revealed this unknown vendor had an \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating with BBB and many unresolved complaints.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for the original head on a shaver that was over 5 years old.  </li>
            <li>The head on my shaver was the original, so it was about 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>I know you could purchase this product new for just a few more dollars, BUT we&#x27;ve saved the environment from one more electric razor being thrown away.  </li>
            <li>Really was surprised at how important a periodic change of blades for an electric razor was.</li>
            <li>My husband says the heads don&#x27;t seem to rotate fast enough but it does an OK job for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s first whisker all within a half hour----The nice thing</li>
            <li>I do not know the interval recommended, but if the shave is not as good as you remember when you bought the new product, you are due!</li>
            <li>It worked as well as the first time which is to say very well.</li>
            <li>Be careful that the vendor supplies Original Genuine Philips/Norelco Replacement Heads with the designation that you order and not a substitute.</li>
            <li>The product is precisely what I needed; service was what I hoped for; experience is far better than having to go to W-M or some other store.</li>
            <li>My razor is sharp again and good to go for a few more years.  </li>
            <li>It does not remove facial hairs easily.  </li>
            <li>This technology immediately proved to give a terrific, easy shave, and I have stayed with the Norelco shaver line ever since.  </li>
            <li>This web site made it easy to find the correct replacement part and order same.</li>
            <li>the U.S. website did not make finding the proper model number easy</li>
            <li>Item was priced lower than at my local drugstore, arrived promptly, was easy to install.</li>
            <li>This was a good value, and I won&#x27;t wait as long to replace the blades next time.</li>
            <li>The job my razor did certainly improved once I replaced the heads.  </li>
            <li>My husband has an older model electric shaver that he likes very much.  </li>
            <li>Now my razor works like new..!!  </li>
            <li>Will probably move to a better overall razor once this new head needs replacement.</li>
            <li>There is no reason to buy a new shaver when the blades are right here.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp blades and back to a clean shave once again.  </li>
            <li>I tried to find them locally but they want as much or more than a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>They work and my Norelco razor perfectly and only took a few minutes to swap out the old with the new ones.</li>
            <li>I needed blades for 2 different razors and both sets came quickly and were the right ones.</li>
            <li>This is a great product but if your man has tough beards, doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>Price seemed pretty high as well.</li>
            <li>Ordered these new heads, put &#x27;em in the day they arrived, had a clean baby-smooth face in one-fourth of the time of the old heads.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery also.</li>
            <li>They were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Shaves are much closer and much faster.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is easier on my face; but getting a really close shave can take a while...especially in the neck area.  </li>
            <li>product as advertised, fast delivery</li>
            <li>and they work very well.  </li>
            <li>The price at amazon is much lower than Philips was selling on there site.</li>
            <li>I recommend replacing the heads every year, no matter how much the use.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks for the item.  </li>
            <li>My shave his so much faster and smoother.  </li>
            <li>The Replacement Heads for the Philips Norelco shaver came in a very timely manner and were packed so well</li>
            <li>Thanks, Joanne F. Welch</li>
            <li>He says it shaves much closer and much faster.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads fit well and make a big difference in the razor performance.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>In two years the blades cost as much as the electric razor does.</li>
            <li>Thanks you Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave now.</li>
            <li>husband got a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I think Phillips wants you to upgrade instead of continuing to change blades, so they change the numbers.</li>
            <li>I would say much longer than a year.</li>
            <li>and I know I could do it on amazon hahaha</li>
            <li>He would highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thanks for asking.&lt;br /&gt;mee</li>
            <li>He really likes the Philips Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads were very dull,like they have been used before.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a job well done.    </li>
            <li>All went very well with no problems what so ever.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for your help and service.</li>
            <li>I was going to replace the whole razor but read on the reviews that they don&#x27;t make these in the Netherlands</li>
            <li>The HZ56 is a much poorer performance compared to the HZ55.</li>
            <li>They shave really close with no irritation.</li>
            <li>They are very durable.</li>
            <li>Much sharper, producing a smoother cut, and no rash.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these before and they work very well.</li>
            <li>and it cuts very well.</li>
            <li>They Work very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>When I got the item it was packaged in such a way that you could not determine if it would fit your razor without removing from package, the problem there is no RETURN once package opened.</li>
            <li>I did a search, and found that Amazon had the replacement parts at a much smarter price than Norelco, so I ordered them here.  </li>
            <li>They also perform nicely, once you have used them for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find these replacement heads could not find them anywhere and the razor was only two years old.</li>
            <li>What an asset Amazon is, especially at a time when gas prices are so high!!!!</li>
            <li>My old blades were about 18 months old, and I&#x27;d forgotten how good an electric shaver can be with sharp blades.</li>
            <li>Just looking at the blades you can see that they are of much higher quality than the ones that came with the new shaver.</li>
            <li>Works ok, but not as sharp as orignal.</li>
            <li>The heads are just fine and work fine in two of my razors, the only drawback is the price which is more than half the price of a new razor at local stores.</li>
            <li>Even if your shaver is brand new, why not order the new heads right now?  </li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Saved money buying replacement heads (as opposed to buying a whole new razor!)</li>
            <li>Very sharp and do a better job than the new razor we bought!!</li>
            <li>I would clean the blades on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>You can get two + years out of the heads if you clean and oil them regularly.</li>
            <li>I have been using Philips electric razors for a number of years now and as long as I can continue to get the shaving heads, everything will be fine.</li>
            <li>When you just buy replacement shaver blades, you can&#x27;t give an honest opinion because I don&#x27;t know how long they will last.</li>
            <li>The blades inside the small covers were fine, but I had to use the original covers on the shaver because the covers I received were bent up and would not allow the blades to turn.</li>
            <li>None of the previous happened ,instead the product  was received in good order,installed in short order and cut</li>
            <li>Replacement blades for my shaver are becoming harder to find.</li>
            <li>This is a reliable no-fuss product and I am happy enough to continue using it for a long long time.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to return the item to the seller and didn&#x27;t get the full credit back that I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I ordered that exact number and was surprised to see that HQ56 was sent, with a sticker on the box that stated the substitution was made - not by the shipper but by Philps Norelco.  </li>
            <li>The degradation in shaving experience was kind of subtle at first</li>
            <li>These  replacement blades has given my Norelco new life!  </li>
            <li>There is no way these were new when I received them!</li>
            <li>it was brand new!  </li>
            <li>The shaver works like new again!  </li>
            <li>Hubby has replaced the heads on his Norelco a number of times and it works like brand new!</li>
            <li>What a difference new heads make!  </li>
            <li>The shaver works like new again!</li>
            <li>Made my razor seem new!</li>
            <li>What a difference these new heads made in the shave!  </li>
            <li>You saved him from buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>I was ready to buy a new shaver (not Norelco)</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t need to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>I was getting a whole new head, not just the blades.  </li>
            <li>Got these replacement blades instead of buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>but i didnt want to buy a whole new electirc razer</li>
            <li>It is amazing every time I change them-I can shave in at least 1/2 the time and the cut is much smoother.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively easy to change the heads, but some parts can fall out, so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li>a set of heads costs more than half of what the lowest-priced razor model costs).  </li>
            <li>They works as replacement heads for this particular shaver.</li>
            <li>Daily use of the shaver does require a head cleaning every week but it makes the heads last for a year or more.</li>
            <li>I have an older Norelco shaver which requires replacement heads about every 1 to 1-1/2 years.</li>
            <li>My husband has bought more expensive ones and has not been satisfied with their performance</li>
            <li>Since this razor is an older model, I went to the Norelco websit and looked up its compatible razor heads</li>
            <li>If you razor is older</li>
            <li>Bottom line, my aging shaver is still in service, and continues to provide a decent shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an older shaver and no one carries the parts anymore.</li>
            <li>Replacement for older Norelco heads.</li>
            <li>I was looking for replacement shaver heads for my older Noreclo model 6613X electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>No where in the product description does the seller indicate this is actually an HQ56 rather than an HQ55, which is deceptive and will cost more for the same product.  </li>
            <li>Impossible to find these older replacement models any where, after installation they worked perfectly in two of my older Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Price was competitive with newer model heads.</li>
            <li>These heads were exactly like the original ones, except that they were amazingly sharp.</li>
            <li>Since this is for an older Norelco shaver, these cannot always be found in the store -</li>
            <li>They cost about 50% of a new corded razor though, so if you need any other part - like a the plastic head cover or a cord - you might be better off buying a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find these on Amazon- for some reason Norelco has a number of different replacement blades for their electric shavers and they&#x27;re not easy to find.  </li>
            <li>These techniques can create highly specialized alloy surfaces or whatever.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It was mailed in a 12\\&quot;x9\\&quot;x4\\&quot; box, and the postage was quite high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these heads.</li>
            <li>Product came quick enough, fits my razor and makes my razor work just like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>I bought the norelco razor and when i went to clean it for the first time, the blades fell out into the sink, down the drain.  </li>
            <li>These Norelco replacement shaver heads made two older units perform like new.</li>
            <li>Appear to be genuine Norelco and work as expected.</li>
            <li>The order was filled in minimal time.</li>
            <li>I then went to Amazon, found the item for a few bucks more, and clicked away.</li>
            <li>The employees poppped the replacements in with ease and were back to shaving my father with a fresh set of blades.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost if you have been using your current head for a year.</li>
            <li>We have purchased this item in the past and the shaver heads, as my husband says, are really giving him a better shave.  </li>
            <li>The cost is reasonable and they return your razor to near new condition.</li>
            <li>I installed the new head a few weeks ago and seem to be working OK.  </li>
            <li>The heads are still top quality even though recent Norelco shaver bodies are a lot lower quality than they were when they were made in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;However, the battery in my newest Norelco shaver lasts a very long time between charges.</li>
            <li>They were at a reasonable price, and delivered quickly and at a bargain shipping price, and they perform as expected.</li>
            <li>The replacement hq56 for hq55 doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as the original hq55 - put my old blades back into razor!!!</li>
            <li>, Amazon.com is going to pay for Super Saver shipping anyway, so there goes one excuse.  </li>
            <li>New blades are certainly an improvement over year-old blades; and much cheaper than replacing the entire shaver.</li>
            <li>Its just absolutely incredible how expensive replacement blades are!</li>
            <li>I forgot how smooth shaving could be with sharp blades.</li>
            <li>They were new and delivered in</li>
            <li>The new heads installed in my shaver in record time.  </li>
            <li>The shaver now works like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>A lot cheaper that buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>It just needed new blades.</li>
            <li>It is a lot cheaper that buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>According to my husband, the replacement heads make the razor seem brand new.  </li>
            <li>Turns out I saved time and money by replacing the blades on my electric shaver, rather than buying a new one.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying new razors, I began saving some money by buying sets of new replacement heads on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Also, the replacement heads from Amazon look excatly like those in a new razor, even under magnification.    </li>
            <li>Two days ago I loaded in a new set and turned on the razor.    </li>
            <li>The new heads restored shaving results to like new.</li>
            <li>We also signed up for the automatic delivery of new blades every six months</li>
            <li>I needed the new Shaving Heads and found out that Amazon was the place to go to get them.</li>
            <li>but it needed new blades.</li>
            <li>My husband said you don&#x27;t sharpen them, you get new blades.  </li>
            <li>it was when it was new.  </li>
            <li>like you have a new razor.</li>
            <li>I went out and bought a new razor (Remington).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li>New heads:</li>
            <li>New shaver:</li>
            <li>His razor hadn&#x27;t had new blades in a couple of years or longer, so when he couldn&#x27;t find them in a store, I found them on Amazone for him.  </li>
            <li>I tried these replacement blades in my new razor.  </li>
            <li>Made my razor just like new.</li>
            <li>Met my needs of new blades for the Norelco shaver I had.  </li>
            <li>Now my razor cuts like when I got it new 7 years ago.</li>
            <li>With these replacement shaver heads, it&#x27;s just like new again.</li>
            <li>I do believe you should compare the cost, and also if you should buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li>These blades made my electric razor shave like a new razor.  </li>
            <li>Nope, just get a set of new shaving heads and you can save some money.  </li>
            <li>These new heads give  you a close shave.  </li>
            <li>but it does make the shaver feel like brand new again.</li>
            <li>Every year I think that I could buy a new cordless razor every two years rather than spend $32 on replacements heads annually.  </li>
            <li>I equate this to the self-propelled lawn mower syndrome: I could buy a new mower every two years for what it costs for two years of annual service and mulching blade sharpening.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I bought a new razor, at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>With the new models that Norelco has introduced, the retail stores (Walmart, Target, etc.) have discontinued carrying the replacement razors for the Reflex Plus in favor of those for the newer brands.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>New blades is 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Razor works like new.</li>
            <li>Works just like brand new razor.  </li>
            <li>Makes the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li>Bought him a new one..</li>
            <li>It was returned and decided to order new heads.  </li>
            <li>My razor is now restored to brand new blade sharpness.</li>
            <li>Made a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li>I almost considered getting a new razon but decided to try the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads provide a like new close shave.</li>
            <li>but it beats buying a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>and it is now like new.</li>
            <li>Made my razor run like new.  </li>
            <li>the product was new and the correct item for the razor</li>
            <li>Ended up buying  a new razor.</li>
            <li>I was temped to buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>When I got the new replacement heads the problem was solved.  </li>
            <li>It was like having a brand new electric razor.</li>
            <li>I always am amazed the difference with a new set of cutters in the shaver.  </li>
            <li>it is like new again.</li>
            <li>Shaves like new, and for a lot cheaper then purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li>and they of course made my razor feel like a brand new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;with-out paying the price for a new one.</li>
            <li>With the new blades, the shave is quicker and smoother</li>
            <li>Not only does the new head cut much closer, it&#x27;s also much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty much exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>back of the box indicates these HQ 55 heads fit the following razor types: 34--, 36--, 38--, 44--, 46--, 48--, 66--, 69--, 5413, 5426, 5430, 5625, 5812, 5813, 5817, 5820, 5823, 5824, 6405, 6415, 6423, 6424, 6445, 6831, 6842, 6843, 6844, 6849, 6853, 6854, 6855, 6856, 6857, 6859, 6861, 6863, 6868, 6874, 6879.</li>
            <li>The only way you find that out is when you do the first shave with a new head.  </li>
            <li>received exactly what I needed in a short time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t have to be as lazy as me to notice the difference.</li>
            <li>So since the first set lasted 12 months, I decided to by a third set.</li>
            <li>Other sites had a blue box specifically for HQ55 Plus for more $$.</li>
            <li>I feel this is a cheaply made product that is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Norelco electric razor way back in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Other shavers such as Braun do a better job.</li>
            <li>I first ordered this product in Oct 2008, along with a apply for a credit  card that would give me $30 reduction on my next order..</li>
            <li>On the first order of this product last year..P &amp; H   were also waived..</li>
            <li>I have an eleven year old Norelco shaver and the thing just won&#x27;t die!</li>
            <li>Better performance than  some of the Norelco&#x60;s that I have had in the past.</li>
            <li>my grandfather asked me to find replacement heads for his 25 year old shaver!</li>
            <li>so well , I would have gotten them first, instead of the ones I got locally.</li>
            <li>Nice at first, but within a month I was having trouble with razor burn on my neck and all sorts of missed hair; worse than my original heads.</li>
            <li>These new heads made my old razor cut like a new one.  </li>
            <li>I bought one set of replacement heads (from another source) in the past and was completely unimpressed, but the replacement set purchased through Amazon seem to be of a much higher quality, and restored the shaver to its original \\&quot;new\\&quot; level of performance.</li>
            <li>The old shaver has a new lease on life.</li>
            <li>made my old razor liike new...</li>
            <li>Makes your old shaver feel brand new.</li>
            <li>My old razor works like new.  </li>
            <li>I received the box of razor heads for my Norelco electric razor in the mail promptly, immediately popped the old ones out, the new ones in, and shaved before 15 minutes had gone by.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about new heads making my razor as good as new.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, it was like getting a whole new electric razor at half the cost.  </li>
            <li>Everything was so easy compared to returning the two that did not fit.</li>
            <li>After a few years of using replacement heads from Amazon, it gradually dawned on me that shaving had become a lot harder -- it took a lot more time, more passes, and harder pressure to complete a shave.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, and item is exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li>On the face of it this seems pretty improbable, because the head blades themselves are very intricate little devices with very close dimensional tolerances.  </li>
            <li>, I hope it lasts until my next trip to USA, down here in Brazil it costs too much, more than the shaver itself</li>
            <li>They arrived within a few business days and were exactly the right model #</li>
            <li>Easy to install &amp; Smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!  </li>
            <li>New shaving heads &#x3D; feel of a new razor for about a third of the cost of a new one.</li>
            <li>Shaves just like a new shaver again and  with the new Reflex Head holder almost restores it back to a complete new razor,</li>
            <li>My razor is 17 years old</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re debating whether you should spend the money then consider what a big difference these will make to the quality of your shave and how much time it will save you.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, about 9 months ago I decided to do a test by purchasing replacement heads directly from the Norelco website.  </li>
            <li>The soft envelop shipped did not protect the cardboard box holding the heads from being damaged.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco was not shaving well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 74 years young</li>
            <li>I noticed recently that I was no longer getting a very close shave, so I looked up the correct replacement blades on the Internet, and ordered them.</li>
            <li>It was much easier buying the replacement heads online than having to troop from one store to the next looking for them.</li>
            <li>Although, if your razor is really old, you MIGHT need to upgrade/replace the battery, if it is a cordless/battery shaver.</li>
            <li>wanted the HQ55 specifically because they work in my old razor.  </li>
            <li>Granted, my shaver is an old one, but when I specifically order</li>
            <li>They discontinued this and sent me another replacement head that was compatible with my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>I used to purchase these replacement heads directly from the Philips Employee Online Store.  </li>
            <li>I also do not see any need to switch to the newer models - the features that Norelco touts are marketing gimmicks as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I was sent a direct replacement, which is a newer model (HQ-56).  </li>
            <li>My 90 year old father did it himself, no problem.</li>
            <li>My 7+ years old Norelco shaver is still spinning.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;getting a close shave again, just like the old days</li>
            <li>For a while, it seemed as though I was out of luck finding replacement heads, and the last set I bought were wearing out, and not shaving very well.</li>
            <li>These replaced razor heads that were 2 years old.  </li>
            <li>The seller should completely remove the picture and sales offer.</li>
            <li>I replaced the heads on a 20 year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Husband has always used Norelco and it is very durable and only have to replace heads after years of use and</li>
            <li>Changing the heads at least yearly, is a practical practice to get the most out of a Norelco shaver</li>
            <li>It is so much easier checking on Amazon than trying to go to a lot of different stores to see if they have what you need in stock.  </li>
            <li>In expensive shaver and rated as good</li>
            <li>To my surprise on the first morning using the eBay razor, there was about twice as much whisker material down the wall of the sink bowl as I was accustomed to seeing after every shave.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t even find the right one at Walmart - and they were more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Online orders can be a real time-saver when you are looking for a specific part which will only work w/ a particular model.</li>
            <li>i) emails from Norelco&#x27;s website showing my failed purchase attempt much earlier this year and the successful purchase a week ago, plus</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco sells a multitude of very similar products, so getting a replacement head to match my exact shaver, that says &#x27;USE ONLY HEAD</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care what Norelco says, the HQ56 does not work the same in my older shaver as the HQ55 blades.  </li>
            <li>They arrived in due time, were the right item, and have worked out well.</li>
            <li>The high price of these replacement blades make me go buy the entire shaver at Walmart for $29!!!</li>
            <li>These blades last a long time if you clean them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I tend to replace the shave heads about every 9-10 months, so I will be back for a new set when it is time to replace the old ones.</li>
            <li>I actually debated whether to invest in a new razor than replace the blade heads that are now four years old.  </li>
            <li>I am also very pleased with the quality of the shaver overall, and how long it has lasted (at least for 5 years now).</li>
            <li>Price, through Amazon, was outstanding, and less than other razors I observed.</li>
            <li>I will diefinitly continue to re-order new blades as necessary.</li>
            <li>I came back and ordered replacement blades, and now my Norelco is like new.</li>
            <li>The quality of these replacements is  no different than a new razor.  </li>
            <li>Works to improve the shaver back to new condition.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I thought I would need a new razor as the replacement blades are not sold locally anymore.</li>
            <li>Always think they seem too expensive, when you can get a whole new razor for only $20 more.  </li>
            <li>It used to be you could buy a new shaver for a little more than new heads, but no more.</li>
            <li>After about 15 mins on the phone, the clerk finally confirmed they only had (1) item available and could only hold it behind the counter until end of business that same day.  </li>
            <li>The stores are much more expensive for the exact same product.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the razor that is why I purchased the replacement heads whoever the price is hard to swallow.</li>
            <li>No more long shaves to clean up the face!</li>
            <li>The heads, of course, work - and you&#x27;ll get a much improved shave after you pry them out of their theft resistant packaging and carefully install them.  </li>
            <li>I put my old blades back on.</li>
            <li>My Norelco razor, which is ten years old, said that it required HQ55+ blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a hand held shaver that is several years old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that they are less expensive than in 2011.  </li>
            <li>I have had my razors for quite a long time, and decided that they needed new heads.  </li>
            <li>If Norelco&#x27;s factory has high security for heads emerging from a final processing step but misses diversion and theft of heads from an earlier point in the production process, that would explain all the facts without having to invoke the idea of a totally separate counterfeiting plant.    </li>
            <li>My old blades were dull, and I was about to buy a whole new razor before I thought of getting replacements.</li>
            <li>The shipping container could have been a little more protective than just a plain brown envelope, but the heads were not damaged and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a New England Yankee who believes in keeping things running as long as possible.</li>
            <li>The price was less than I expected, shipping was fast and the replacement heads were just what was needed to get the Norelco razor up and running like new!</li>
            <li>These last at least a year and fit a lot of different razors.</li>
            <li>Apparently they are the same as the HQ 55 replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>So rather than buy a new razor, we just bought the heads which are not cheap, but are cheaper than a new razor.  </li>
            <li>New head after several years helped since it was starting to take a long time to shave.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this particular shaver again.</li>
            <li>and I have never had a set of cutters dull so quickly.  </li>
            <li>i can shave quickly without having to press hard on the razor.just what i ordered.</li>
            <li>The blades are fine but are not secure and tend to fall out if the razor is upside down.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, new quality and performance from your existing shaver.</li>
            <li>Not really being able to afford $35-$40 for the blades, I went on this site and it was less than half the price.......</li>
            <li>They are all going back, with a demand for full refund on shoddy material .</li>
            <li>Be aware it is only the round discs, so keep your snap on holder.</li>
            <li>-- it actually sounded noticeably different from what I had generally been hearing from various Norelco razors and head sets over the years.  </li>
            <li>Installing the new heads is incredibly simple with one twist of the center retainer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned my razor since high school and finally decided I need some sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>My old blades were probably at least 5 years old and I wasn&#x27;t getting a very complete shave.  </li>
            <li>My father had no idea that all his razor needed was a new head with sharp blades.</li>
            <li>I had been investigating the puchase of a new razor since the heads on my current one were no longer sharp enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>It takes me HALF the amount of time to shave, and my Norelco Shaver is like NEW again!</li>
            <li>Razor performance during this period of about 20 years was always great -- as the saying goes, they will have to pry these razors out of my cold, dead hands.    </li>

            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> There was some improvement after changing the heads, but not that impressive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  </li>

            <li> The Norelco razor replacement heads are very easy to install, work perfectly and give an electric shave unrivaled since I first purchased the Norelco razor about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> I will be happy to provide whatever information I can to help skeptics understand that this review is genuine.  </li>
            <li> Once again I am happy but I&#x27;d like to know why Norelco sells shavers with the cheap heads.</li>
            <li> fit great to my electric shaver norelco.</li>
            <li> I liked the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that some people in the world still take pride in their products.</li>
            <li> The heads were protected by their own sturdy container.  </li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> and I did it from my own home.</li>
            <li> product arrived in a timly manor, good construction, enjoying close shaves.</li>
            <li> Now that they own Drugstore.com</li>
            <li> Ahhh, it&#x27;s nice to have my shaver working at peak performance again.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco products for many years and found them to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> My husband was thrilled with the Norelco replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s electric razor is still running nicely and somehow the quality is not always there when it&#x27;s time to replace something.  </li>
            <li> Kind of pricey for what they are</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a nice close shave again</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver I own specifies HQ55 shaving heads.  </li>

            <li> The HQ55 blades fit my razor perfectly, and give me a nice clean shave every time, and I saved $10 because I bought them online.  </li>
            <li> It is Worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied to get genuine Norelco blades at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have an older electric norelco, one of the best razers I have invested in, it used to be my husbands</li>
            <li> exactly what was offered.price was very fair</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful &amp; economical solution and works just fine.  </li>
            <li> works good, my old one was making a lot of noise and wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d forgotten how wonderful new razor heads are.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my shaving routine now with the new heads.</li>
            <li> Also, I really liked the low-end, powerful Norelco 6423LC model that Norelco had discontinued (it is not rechargeable but is great for travel because it is 120/240 volt).  </li>
            <li> Great company, quick service.</li>
            <li> It is good for many more years of use.</li>
            <li> Great product, reasonable price and good quality.  </li>

            <li> I know Norelco has a Good reputation and they have proven it to me by providing me with a comfortable close shave.</li>

            <li> We received exactly what we ordered within 3-5 days and it fit into the shaver just perfect.!</li>

            <li> New heads work and fit great!</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and now shaves like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> It was easy to order, came in three days, and works perfectly on my 9-year old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for probably 20 years, have to replace blades periodically, which is ok, glad to be able to find them.</li>
            <li> and I have not been able to find replacement heads for it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Be sure that the heads you buy will work with your shaver.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s probably better stuff out there, but you&#x27;ll pay dearly for it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> We purchased the Norelco shaver replacement heads for my father and he is extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> He struggled for several months getting a close shave, and this product worked perfectly for him.</li>
            <li> So make sure you stock up on replacement heads as well as maintain your razors.  </li>
            <li> Made my shaving experience much better.</li>
            <li> used the option to have periodic deliveries and saved even more.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased to find replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco electric razor at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I started using an Electric Razor at around the beginning of the year and Love it.</li>
            <li> Bought the NORELCO brand as I assumed these would be better than another replacement mfg.  </li>
            <li> WOULD RECOMMEND AND AM SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> I have replaced the heads many times and always have been pleased.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy and would order again.</li>
            <li> Norelco will remain at the top of our shaver purchases.</li>
            <li> I saved more than $[...] by ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and we are happy with the whole experience.</li>
            <li> as advertised,  Great,  Buy hew real Philips Norelcol and not knock off brands.</li>
            <li> As my parents age, I am having to manage more of their needs.  </li>
            <li> What more could I want?</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with my purchase of the HQ55 replacement cutters for my Norelco Shaver.</li>
            <li> so says the wife :).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s OK, you can thank me</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t even come close to fitting.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought a Braun Electric Razor which I know is better.</li>
            <li> These go for a lot more in the Store.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> They have been replaced by the HQ 56 , 55&#x27;s not made any more</li>
            <li> the price was better than buying it at the stores.</li>
            <li> I installed the HQ 56 heads and found them to be not at all much better than my existing worn 3 Year</li>
            <li> Norelco corded/cordless shaver for many years,</li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> More if you shave twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many many years.  </li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> They cut the beard much better.  </li>
            <li> HQ55&#x27;s I want the HQ55&#x27;s and not the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\</li>
            <li> Great product, seller not so much.</li>
            <li> The heads that I bought (HQ 55) were perfect and simple to replace in the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips Norelco Triple Header Shavers with HQ55 or HQ56 blades for more than fifteen years</li>
            <li> Sure it took some getting used too some twenty years ago</li>
            <li> Shaving is much better now.</li>
            <li> What more could one ask for?  </li>
            <li> What more could any one ask for?</li>
            <li> I think this is the third replacement head I&#x27;ve gotten for this razor and the best price</li>
            <li> Make sure this fits your razor before you purchase it.</li>
            <li> you can also buy replacement batteries on Amazon that restore the ability to hold a charge for a week or more.</li>
            <li> I should do this more often.</li>
            <li> My dad was so pleased to be able to find the replacement head to his razor.  </li>
            <li> boy can;t trust anybody any more</li>
            <li> Am so glad I saw these.</li>
            <li> well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Replaceing heads just makes good economical sense.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more, can I?  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find replacement heads for a Norelco 4601X, purchased in 2000, and no longer made.</li>
            <li> In reality, while these heads do a good job (and way better than the old ones), I don&#x27;t feel they are quite as good as they are described.</li>
            <li> Perfect Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to be able to find them and at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> any more and there not made as well.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought replacement</li>
            <li> and I would surely order again when it comes time to buy more of them</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find these heads anywhere.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the one I bought a year ago.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and will re-order when needed.</li>
            <li> but it is not; the item isn&#x27;t as it looks or is listed and the packaging could be be better.</li>
            <li> My husband was glad to be able to get these replacements</li>
            <li> I vowed to replace them more often</li>
            <li> These cost much more in my hometown stores.</li>
            <li> so my blade head lasts longer than most.  </li>
            <li> Even better with Williams Lectric Shave.</li>
            <li> I need to change blades more often.</li>
            <li> Three more words required.</li>
            <li> , I love to use it on my legs, and I don&#x27;t have any worry about razer burn or bumps....</li>
            <li> These work perfectly on my razor even though it says HQ55+ only.</li>
            <li> ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok</li>
            <li> It was very easy to click into place, the longest part was researching which model heads to get that fit my razor :)</li>
            <li> Electric razors are not as good as a hand razor but he is very happy using the new electric razor head since a friend gave him an old razor.</li>
            <li> These blades work great as the replacements for the older blades.</li>
            <li> Every morning I look forward to a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an older razor that works great still.</li>
            <li> so this were a particular joy ...</li>
            <li> Norelco works great and with new heads greater.</li>
            <li> Popped these in easily and hope to get many more years use...</li>
            <li> This is the first one that didn&#x27;t give a good shave.</li>
            <li> some money try a good cleaning first.  </li>
            <li> New blades are great.  </li>
            <li> He says they are great; it&#x27;s like having a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for 10+ years, and its great to replace just the heads every 1-2 years instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the electric razor and now it shaves like new without having to buy another one.</li>
            <li> The new blades have been great.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe what a difference these new blades were, shaved me with no problems and no pulling out hairs any more!!</li>
            <li> While it shaves better than the original, I had hoped for more of an improvement.  </li>
            <li> , I figured it was worth it since he likes the original razor, and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to throw away a perfectly good product.</li>
            <li> These new ones were easy to install and the difference is great.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was able to purchase mine at 50% off.  </li>
            <li> This product fit my husband&#x27;s Norelco razor that he has had for many years.  </li>
            <li> Glad they&#x27;re still available.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad they have them available</li>
            <li> It fit my HQ55+ that I bought many years ago</li>
            <li> Good fast shipping.</li>
            <li> good replacement, thanks</li>
            <li> Was a good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is a good price and the blades work very well.  </li>
            <li> Husband thought he would have to buy a whole new electric razor, I suggested we try replacing the heads, they work great!</li>
            <li> I would have liked them to be a pinch sharper if that is the right word to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the correct head, works fine, the price was good, the shipment fast</li>
            <li> Everything was fast and easy!!</li>
            <li> I repleced the original cutters and the razor now cuts better than when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I think they were better then the original ones.  </li>
            <li> Buying them at Amazon.com is a great deal because their prices are so low and the shipping is free!  </li>
            <li> Easy to change and what a difference.  </li>
            <li> I got just what I needed,and just what I ordered,as easy as falling off a log.</li>
            <li> They fit my old shaver and cut great.</li>
            <li> Close shave and easy to install.</li>
            <li> You made it easy to order my blades online</li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> but I could tell it wasn&#x27;t easy to shave anymore.  </li>
            <li> The heads are easily replaced.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads (Purchased on September 4, 2012)were easy to install.</li>
            <li> They were easy to replace and work</li>
            <li> Easy to install and order was received promptly.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  </li>
            <li> easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend these replacement heads to anyone with a Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> If you liked them the first time around, the replacements work fine--but they&#x27;re really easy to \\&quot;install!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My son and I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any store in our area so finding it on Amazon.com was perfect since my son wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use his present shaver any more without new replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to install and the razor shaves as good as new.</li>
            <li> Good deal if you are like me and don&#x27;t see any reason to buy a new electric razor every year or two.</li>
            <li> The heads are not as good as what you get with the new shaver.</li>
            <li> I will most certainly purchace these again..!!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads easily installed into my razor and made a huge difference in the quality and closeness of my shaves.</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy order.</li>
            <li> +, they work just fine in my electric razor.  </li>
            <li> These are working fine.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS FINE AND SHIPPMENT CAME IN ON TIME</li>
            <li> I shopped them online to find the best price and found them for a bit less than $30 with a shop I didn&#x27;t recognize.</li>
            <li> just fine.  </li>
            <li> Product works fine.</li>
            <li> Norelco has always made a fine product.</li>
            <li> The blades work fine  </li>
            <li> The product works fine.  </li>
            <li> The replacement works fine.</li>
            <li> they are as pictured and work fine</li>
            <li> I replaced the blades with this replacement set, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> The HQ56 heads are fine.  </li>
            <li> these will work fine.</li>
            <li> Flex heads are super &amp; give a close shave !</li>
            <li> usual, Amazon had the best price on these, and the free shipping made the deal even better.</li>
            <li> They fit the Norelco shaver and work good as new</li>
            <li> I also bought and tried \\&quot;Vollco Sharpening Heads\\&quot;, which are designed to hone the edges of worn-down Norelco reflex razor heads, but these did not succeed at all in getting me back to a great, easy shave.    </li>
            <li> They fit and worked just fine with no issues or problems to report.</li>
            <li> But with three new facts in hand (changed sound, more whisker material, and really great, fast shave again),</li>
            <li> The heads fit fine, but don&#x27;t give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The replacement parts worked perfectly and I expect to get years of trouble free service, thank you.</li>
            <li> It makes a HUGE difference with the end result........</li>
            <li> I bought these for a Norelco Reflex Plus 6615x razor and they fit correctly.</li>
            <li> Amazon was giving me free shipping and lower price.</li>
            <li> Now, I have a smooth shave again after replacing the head.  </li>
            <li> Prolonged the life of a shaver and is smooth and durable.</li>
            <li> No Tax and Free Shipping always helps</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for several years and it gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t remember how smooth this razor shaved until I replaced the heads!&lt;br</li>
            <li> One word: smooth.</li>
            <li> I get a smooth shave once again.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to mention that my shaver is \\&quot;6844 XL\\&quot; and these heads fit.  </li>
            <li> The box says they are a replacement for the HQ55, but they don&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li> They fit into the razor.  </li>
            <li> know if they were available any longer</li>
            <li> They fit, and they work.  </li>
            <li> These blades fit a razor I have used for decades.  </li>
            <li> yes they fit my razorand</li>
            <li> Product gave a comfortable and close shave and would recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> Not some fit all..</li>
            <li> The heads don&#x27;t fit the razor.  </li>
            <li> They fit and were just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> did fit my razor</li>
            <li> These precision made replacement heads maintain a smooth cut</li>
            <li> Goiod fit.</li>
            <li> and they still fit perfectily.  </li>
            <li> There was a note on the package that said the 56&#x27;s will fit on the 55&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head fit on my shaver</li>
            <li> The price was great to what I had paid last year at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Now I can enjoy my electric shaver again.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased this item I determined the correct fit by going to the merchant site.</li>
            <li> WHY the merchant who should have known what razor I was buying this for, and know it would fit should have notified me.</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads made my shaver good asnew at a considerable savings.</li>
            <li> and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> And I was even more pleased because the package arrived much sooner that the date I was given.</li>
            <li> nice and sharp, a perfect fit for the old shaver.  </li>
            <li> Glad I read this and kept the motor, my new blades work great as does the old motor which is strong.  </li>
            <li> This was a very worth while purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I bought these, a great little investment, it feels like a whole new razor again.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and clean shaven again.</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy.                        </li>
            <li> They were easy and quick to install.</li>
            <li> super easy to install</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and were easy to install.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent replacement for my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to improve the shaver back to new condition.&lt;br /&gt;Was very easy to replace old shaver</li>
            <li> These new heads made my shaver better than when I bought it!</li>
            <li> Norelco excellent quality however over priced,  the shaver heads which need replaced yearly now days approaches the cost of an entire new raiser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the HQ55 was &#x27;state of the art&#x27; when I first got the shaver, but I&#x27;ve never been convinced it shaves \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> I need to be sure that the credit for the first order was made.  </li>
            <li> &quot; the razor to its original quality.   </li>
            <li> Also the packaging was original.  </li>
            <li> Got them in time, and placing them on the razor is fairly straightforward.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to get such a clean cut after using the original parts which have been in use for MANY years.</li>
            <li> After using the razor for many years, the new blades made it as good as new.</li>
            <li> He thinks he has a new shaver and is thrilled with them.</li>
            <li> Nice clean shave the way it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> It works great and fit his razor, we will continue to order the replacement heads from you as long as razor continues to work!!!</li>
            <li> I was not getting a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> These heads work as advertised and provide a clean shave every time.  </li>
            <li> Clean close shave.</li>
            <li> a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I get about 2 years out of the blades before it takes 10 minutes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I clean the shaving head often and spray Norelco HQ110.</li>
            <li> Service was great, as stated, securely wrapped and recieved sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> These are priced much better than their own site, and the quality is the same.</li>
            <li> I clean the head 3 to 4 time a week</li>
            <li> Product was priced right and has worked effectively to give me a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> , It is nice to have nice sharp razor blades for my electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The so-called \\&quot;Lift and Cut\\&quot; configuration has two sets of angled, stacked blades in the rotating shaver head, and I have every reason to believe that Norelco&#x27;s illustrations and claims of their special effectiveness are correct.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;There you are, shaving for that special evening out when you realize your face isn&#x27;t getting any smoother.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just very pleased indeed with the outcome and grateful to Norelco for putting out a fine product for several decades now.    </li>
            <li> It gets the job done, which I guess you really can&#x27;t ask for any more-</li>
            <li> If you have, as I do, a rechargeable model (and the batteries are still good), you might want to buy the cheapest corded model using the same head assembly and scavenger it for parts.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, a Satisfied Customer  Chuck Gmurek</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, but be warned that this is just the three razor discs, not the full plastic head assembly.</li>
            <li> The blades (HQ4+) that this model replaced worked a whole lot better and were reliable and never broke like the HQ55.</li>
            <li> My boss doesn&#x27;t have an Amazon account, and since we&#x27;re good friends, sometimes I order things for him and he pays me back.  </li>
            <li> Nothing but good things overall for this transaction.</li>
            <li> makes my shave a lot better thanks</li>
            <li> I gave them a closer look and more thorough intense cleaning.  </li>
            <li> remember put the blade each same with the place, and its good to go</li>
            <li> This is the second time to purchase replacement heads which extend the life of a good razor.</li>
            <li> Installation was a snap, and my morning shave is much faster and more</li>
            <li> Finally, a quick clean shave.</li>
            <li> It was very clear that one replaces all three heads, and that job was very easy.    </li>
            <li> (I still miss my corded 1967 Tripleheader, a Christmas present from Mom &amp; Dad, which provided a smooth shave for more than 30 years!)</li>
            <li> In getting new blades every 6 months was the best thing to happens, keeps the razor sharp amd</li>
            <li> These are genuine Norelco heads and replacing them is as easy as cleaning the old ones and they work better the first time you use them.</li>
            <li> No matter how many passes you make with your Norelco Reflex Plus shaver, you just can&#x27;t seem to get that clean, close shave you remember from when it was new (when was that?  </li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find it but think it might have been open before.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery of product and performance</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.  </li>
            <li> One quick trip on the Internet and Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I received the replacement blades quickly and they were as described.  </li>
            <li> Replacement heads arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;very quickly.</li>
            <li> and I got lucky</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> The item was received quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon.com&#x27;s packaging was tremendously wasteful.</li>
            <li> My husband is so grateful that we are still able to find replacement heads for his older Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Instead of spending a lot of money on repalcement heads at the store, these are just as good and should prolong my razor for a few more years.</li>
            <li> I find this deceptive, and even am more concerned AMAZON doesn&#x27;t see to be concerned about the merchants, what I consider at best a very poor way of dealing with customers.</li>
            <li> This is an exact fit replacement for my shaver.  </li>
            <li> The shave I get with these heads are far better than the original set that came with the electric shaver</li>
            <li> They were received quickly and they work a lot better than the old ones!  </li>
            <li> but I think the shaver works better now than when new.</li>
            <li> In fact, the shaver works like new, and I am glad I went the route I did.</li>
            <li> This is better than buying a new razor,it&#x27;s cheaper and you will feel  </li>
            <li> Not 5 star review since two of them at $24 cost more than a new razor at $40 to $50.</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads on my shaver with these and it works better now than it did when it was brand new.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better to buy a pack of replacement heads than spending $$$ on a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The new blades give a much better shave.</li>
            <li> Better to replace a portion instead of buying new razor.</li>
            <li> you can buy a new razor for about $10-$15 dollars more.</li>
            <li> They quickly aimed me in the right direction, and the blades were delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and blades are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> My beard is once again easy to clean and stays smoother with the new blades.</li>
            <li> My shaver is over 19 years old, and the replacement blades fit and work fine.  </li>
            <li> My Norelco electric razor was in good working order, but the blades were dull and refused to cut any more.  </li>
            <li> fit good and have had to trouble with it.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement and this was the site that made it available and at a reasonable price..  </li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The blades are not inexpensive and my expendeture, so far, is greater than I would pay for a newer model.  </li>
            <li> It works perfectly, it came on a different  package as shown on the picture, but the heads fit&#x27;s on HG55, so I didnt have any trouble.</li>
            <li> Glad I found a source of replacement blades for my old razor.</li>
            <li> We cannot purchase them at our local bigbox store anymore, and he&#x27;s been using these replacement heads for years, so we were thrilled when we found them online.  </li>
            <li> sent them back...no better than the old ones.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now if they could only cut the price as well that would be nice.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and recommend this replacement head to anyone seeking to make their old razor just like new.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure this is good quality product, I found it was less costly to purchase a new Norelco 6940 shaver set from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The blades give me a regular clean, close shave that I am satisfied with.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, I do not understand the high prices.sometimes</li>
            <li> After installing I&#x27;m wondering if the blades are as sharp as they should be... seems the razor doesn&#x27;t cut quite as good as it used to??</li>
            <li> original heads lasted 6 years, these cut really well now.</li>
            <li> These came in a different package than I am used to, so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if they were going to fit my razor (a 6843XL), but they did.</li>
            <li> What are the odds, right?  </li>
            <li> My shave quality improved right away.</li>
            <li> received right away.</li>
            <li> And the price is right.  </li>
            <li> Hope it was the right thing to do.</li>
            <li> If this falls into the right hands,,,I would like to use the $30 deduction  for another Philips Norelco HQ55 Reflex Replacement Head..  </li>
            <li> and they were right.</li>
            <li> They are what was needed, at the right price.</li>
            <li> Just the right replacement.</li>
            <li> Check you model number to ensure you get the right blades.</li>
            <li> Just the right replacement heads my Father In Law needed.  </li>
            <li> Price is right..............................</li>
            <li> My brother has a new motor which isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> My Norelco Shaver was not cutting properly and by replacing the shaver head it works as good as new.</li>
            <li> At a good price, this beats buying a new shaver, and replacing them is quite easy, even if you normally wouldn&#x27;t attempt such a thing.</li>
            <li> All things considered, my best guess is that these replacement heads sold on Amazon actually do come from the same factory in China where the good ones from Norelco are made, but are somehow being diverted and stolen from the production line at a point before some sort of final, critical manufacturing step(s) is carried out.    </li>
            <li> What was substituted was Norelco HQ 56 heads, claiming they will fit my particular Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> and although each shavers has less life than its predecessor; the original blades and cutters are in a class by themselves and are far superior to any aftermarket ordered and available at any discounted price.</li>
            <li> Ok product the blades were not sharp.</li>
            <li> The head is very good, but after I bought it I found the complete razor on sale at Longs Drug Store for less money than just buying the head  </li>
            <li> Nice clean heads with sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco shaver and had the same experience, after replacing the shaver heads, my shaver was as good as new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these new OEM blades, and wish I had not wasted the money on the other razor.</li>
            <li> I decided since the razors are doing a fine job, I would just get the new heads.  </li>
            <li> the new one works fine.</li>
            <li> And the shave was, finally, terrific and easy again!  </li>
            <li> Great to have sharp new Blades.  </li>
            <li> I already had one and noticed the new one did not seem to work as well or shave as smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly the right set.</li>
            <li> So far the return process has been easy though.</li>
            <li> It is easy to remove the old and put on the replacement.  </li>
            <li> And while I was at it, I ordered replacement blades for my old antique Schick injector razors, which had provided me with many a good shave in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this lower end to use while on coumadin, but must admit it gives a pretty darn good shave in less the time and hassle with foam and Mach 3 razors.</li>
            <li> These heads came very fast from the vender.  </li>
            <li> Thankyou very much for the business.</li>
            <li> Now I know and thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I gave him the new heads, and he swears his Norelco is better than new.</li>
            <li> No gripes concerning the new cutter heads and am quite satisfied with the performance of the new heads.</li>
            <li> Good product but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Good, could be a little sharper.</li>
            <li> great product was a hard to find.</li>
            <li> do a great job on those neck hairs that are so hard to get.</li>
            <li> In these \\&quot;greening of America\\&quot; days, it&#x27;s good to extend the useful life of electronic devices instead of putting them in the landfill, &amp; buying new foreign products.</li>
            <li> So, more recently I bought</li>
            <li> Fit my old Norelco shaver as stated.  </li>
            <li> Delivered on time, and cuts much better that what I had (which were exactly the same) because they were blunt.</li>
            <li> Why pay more for the exact same product?</li>
            <li> This product restores the performance of the shaver; and the price on Amazon is better than the price at local retailers.</li>
            <li> This is the first replacement head I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> It was exactly what we were looking for &amp; worked well on my Norelco Reflex Plus razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Price is better than the local stores.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s service was first rate.</li>
            <li> I had ordered, and I have found them to be exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I find it to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> So now, thanks to the diversity of Amazon.com, I am a clean-shaven man!</li>
            <li> I received my purchase in three days and the item was the exact replacement I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I find that these heads and cutters have the same problem as most Norelco blades they do not cut all that well.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I first purchased my Norelco Razor in 1988.</li>
            <li> The first one  works like a dream...</li>
            <li> Will need more in future.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was going to order these for my Norelco 6940 but decided to give the heads another cleaning first.  </li>
            <li> We only buy Norelco :)</li>
            <li> A couple more passes over the same spot does result in a shave as the commercials claim.</li>
            <li> These Norelco Heads do exactly what they were purchased for, shaving with a close blade.  </li>
            <li> He replaced them with the old ones and his electric razor is working fabulously.</li>
            <li> Shipped really fast!</li>
            <li> Not difficult at all.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Amazon came through with the product delivered very promptly!</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads were exactly the product that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Why Norelco needs so many different models</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I shopped local stores that were priced a lot more than on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> My first shave (face and head) after replacing the heads in my electric razor was so close</li>
            <li> treat yourself-you don&#x27;t really have to rub the whiskers off!</li>
            <li> Would purchase more in the future.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> this was correct the first time</li>
            <li> Got this set of blades for my old electric razor and they perform better than the ones that came with the razor when it was new.</li>
            <li> A quick trip to the BBB site revealed this unknown vendor had an \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating with BBB and many unresolved complaints.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the original head on a shaver that was over 5 years old.  </li>
            <li> The head on my shaver was the original, so it was about 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> I know you could purchase this product new for just a few more dollars, BUT we&#x27;ve saved the environment from one more electric razor being thrown away.  </li>
            <li> Really was surprised at how important a periodic change of blades for an electric razor was.</li>
            <li> My husband says the heads don&#x27;t seem to rotate fast enough but it does an OK job for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s first whisker all within a half hour----The nice thing</li>
            <li> I do not know the interval recommended, but if the shave is not as good as you remember when you bought the new product, you are due!</li>
            <li> It worked as well as the first time which is to say very well.</li>
            <li> Be careful that the vendor supplies Original Genuine Philips/Norelco Replacement Heads with the designation that you order and not a substitute.</li>
            <li> The product is precisely what I needed; service was what I hoped for; experience is far better than having to go to W-M or some other store.</li>
            <li> My razor is sharp again and good to go for a few more years.  </li>
            <li> It does not remove facial hairs easily.  </li>
            <li> This technology immediately proved to give a terrific, easy shave, and I have stayed with the Norelco shaver line ever since.  </li>
            <li> This web site made it easy to find the correct replacement part and order same.</li>
            <li> the U.S. website did not make finding the proper model number easy</li>
            <li> Item was priced lower than at my local drugstore, arrived promptly, was easy to install.</li>
            <li> This was a good value, and I won&#x27;t wait as long to replace the blades next time.</li>
            <li> The job my razor did certainly improved once I replaced the heads.  </li>
            <li> My husband has an older model electric shaver that he likes very much.  </li>
            <li> Now my razor works like new..!!  </li>
            <li> Will probably move to a better overall razor once this new head needs replacement.</li>
            <li> There is no reason to buy a new shaver when the blades are right here.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades and back to a clean shave once again.  </li>
            <li> I tried to find them locally but they want as much or more than a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> They work and my Norelco razor perfectly and only took a few minutes to swap out the old with the new ones.</li>
            <li> I needed blades for 2 different razors and both sets came quickly and were the right ones.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but if your man has tough beards, doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Price seemed pretty high as well.</li>
            <li> Ordered these new heads, put &#x27;em in the day they arrived, had a clean baby-smooth face in one-fourth of the time of the old heads.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> They were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Shaves are much closer and much faster.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is easier on my face; but getting a really close shave can take a while...especially in the neck area.  </li>
            <li> product as advertised, fast delivery</li>
            <li> and they work very well.  </li>
            <li> The price at amazon is much lower than Philips was selling on there site.</li>
            <li> I recommend replacing the heads every year, no matter how much the use.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks for the item.  </li>
            <li> My shave his so much faster and smoother.  </li>
            <li> The Replacement Heads for the Philips Norelco shaver came in a very timely manner and were packed so well</li>
            <li> Thanks, Joanne F. Welch</li>
            <li> He says it shaves much closer and much faster.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit well and make a big difference in the razor performance.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> In two years the blades cost as much as the electric razor does.</li>
            <li> Thanks you Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave now.</li>
            <li> husband got a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I think Phillips wants you to upgrade instead of continuing to change blades, so they change the numbers.</li>
            <li> I would say much longer than a year.</li>
            <li> and I know I could do it on amazon hahaha</li>
            <li> He would highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> thanks for asking.&lt;br /&gt;mee</li>
            <li> He really likes the Philips Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads were very dull,like they have been used before.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a job well done.    </li>
            <li> All went very well with no problems what so ever.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for your help and service.</li>
            <li> I was going to replace the whole razor but read on the reviews that they don&#x27;t make these in the Netherlands</li>
            <li> The HZ56 is a much poorer performance compared to the HZ55.</li>
            <li> They shave really close with no irritation.</li>
            <li> They are very durable.</li>
            <li> Much sharper, producing a smoother cut, and no rash.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these before and they work very well.</li>
            <li> and it cuts very well.</li>
            <li> They Work very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> When I got the item it was packaged in such a way that you could not determine if it would fit your razor without removing from package, the problem there is no RETURN once package opened.</li>
            <li> I did a search, and found that Amazon had the replacement parts at a much smarter price than Norelco, so I ordered them here.  </li>
            <li> They also perform nicely, once you have used them for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to find these replacement heads could not find them anywhere and the razor was only two years old.</li>
            <li> What an asset Amazon is, especially at a time when gas prices are so high!!!!</li>
            <li> My old blades were about 18 months old, and I&#x27;d forgotten how good an electric shaver can be with sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Just looking at the blades you can see that they are of much higher quality than the ones that came with the new shaver.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but not as sharp as orignal.</li>
            <li> The heads are just fine and work fine in two of my razors, the only drawback is the price which is more than half the price of a new razor at local stores.</li>
            <li> Even if your shaver is brand new, why not order the new heads right now?  </li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Saved money buying replacement heads (as opposed to buying a whole new razor!)</li>
            <li> Very sharp and do a better job than the new razor we bought!!</li>
            <li> I would clean the blades on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> You can get two + years out of the heads if you clean and oil them regularly.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips electric razors for a number of years now and as long as I can continue to get the shaving heads, everything will be fine.</li>
            <li> When you just buy replacement shaver blades, you can&#x27;t give an honest opinion because I don&#x27;t know how long they will last.</li>
            <li> The blades inside the small covers were fine, but I had to use the original covers on the shaver because the covers I received were bent up and would not allow the blades to turn.</li>
            <li> None of the previous happened ,instead the product  was received in good order,installed in short order and cut</li>
            <li> Replacement blades for my shaver are becoming harder to find.</li>
            <li> This is a reliable no-fuss product and I am happy enough to continue using it for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to return the item to the seller and didn&#x27;t get the full credit back that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I ordered that exact number and was surprised to see that HQ56 was sent, with a sticker on the box that stated the substitution was made - not by the shipper but by Philps Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The degradation in shaving experience was kind of subtle at first</li>
            <li> These  replacement blades has given my Norelco new life!  </li>
            <li> There is no way these were new when I received them!</li>
            <li> it was brand new!  </li>
            <li> The shaver works like new again!  </li>
            <li> Hubby has replaced the heads on his Norelco a number of times and it works like brand new!</li>
            <li> What a difference new heads make!  </li>
            <li> The shaver works like new again!</li>
            <li> Made my razor seem new!</li>
            <li> What a difference these new heads made in the shave!  </li>
            <li> You saved him from buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> I was ready to buy a new shaver (not Norelco)</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t need to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> I was getting a whole new head, not just the blades.  </li>
            <li> Got these replacement blades instead of buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> but i didnt want to buy a whole new electirc razer</li>
            <li> It is amazing every time I change them-I can shave in at least 1/2 the time and the cut is much smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively easy to change the heads, but some parts can fall out, so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> a set of heads costs more than half of what the lowest-priced razor model costs).  </li>
            <li> They works as replacement heads for this particular shaver.</li>
            <li> Daily use of the shaver does require a head cleaning every week but it makes the heads last for a year or more.</li>
            <li> I have an older Norelco shaver which requires replacement heads about every 1 to 1-1/2 years.</li>
            <li> My husband has bought more expensive ones and has not been satisfied with their performance</li>
            <li> Since this razor is an older model, I went to the Norelco websit and looked up its compatible razor heads</li>
            <li> If you razor is older</li>
            <li> Bottom line, my aging shaver is still in service, and continues to provide a decent shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an older shaver and no one carries the parts anymore.</li>
            <li> Replacement for older Norelco heads.</li>
            <li> I was looking for replacement shaver heads for my older Noreclo model 6613X electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> No where in the product description does the seller indicate this is actually an HQ56 rather than an HQ55, which is deceptive and will cost more for the same product.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to find these older replacement models any where, after installation they worked perfectly in two of my older Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Price was competitive with newer model heads.</li>
            <li> These heads were exactly like the original ones, except that they were amazingly sharp.</li>
            <li> Since this is for an older Norelco shaver, these cannot always be found in the store -</li>
            <li> They cost about 50% of a new corded razor though, so if you need any other part - like a the plastic head cover or a cord - you might be better off buying a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I was delighted to find these on Amazon- for some reason Norelco has a number of different replacement blades for their electric shavers and they&#x27;re not easy to find.  </li>
            <li> These techniques can create highly specialized alloy surfaces or whatever.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It was mailed in a 12\\&quot;x9\\&quot;x4\\&quot; box, and the postage was quite high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these heads.</li>
            <li> Product came quick enough, fits my razor and makes my razor work just like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li> I bought the norelco razor and when i went to clean it for the first time, the blades fell out into the sink, down the drain.  </li>
            <li> These Norelco replacement shaver heads made two older units perform like new.</li>
            <li> Appear to be genuine Norelco and work as expected.</li>
            <li> The order was filled in minimal time.</li>
            <li> I then went to Amazon, found the item for a few bucks more, and clicked away.</li>
            <li> The employees poppped the replacements in with ease and were back to shaving my father with a fresh set of blades.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost if you have been using your current head for a year.</li>
            <li> We have purchased this item in the past and the shaver heads, as my husband says, are really giving him a better shave.  </li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable and they return your razor to near new condition.</li>
            <li> I installed the new head a few weeks ago and seem to be working OK.  </li>
            <li> The heads are still top quality even though recent Norelco shaver bodies are a lot lower quality than they were when they were made in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;However, the battery in my newest Norelco shaver lasts a very long time between charges.</li>
            <li> They were at a reasonable price, and delivered quickly and at a bargain shipping price, and they perform as expected.</li>
            <li> The replacement hq56 for hq55 doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as the original hq55 - put my old blades back into razor!!!</li>
            <li> , Amazon.com is going to pay for Super Saver shipping anyway, so there goes one excuse.  </li>
            <li> New blades are certainly an improvement over year-old blades; and much cheaper than replacing the entire shaver.</li>
            <li> Its just absolutely incredible how expensive replacement blades are!</li>
            <li> I forgot how smooth shaving could be with sharp blades.</li>
            <li> They were new and delivered in</li>
            <li> The new heads installed in my shaver in record time.  </li>
            <li> The shaver now works like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li> A lot cheaper that buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> It just needed new blades.</li>
            <li> It is a lot cheaper that buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> According to my husband, the replacement heads make the razor seem brand new.  </li>
            <li> Turns out I saved time and money by replacing the blades on my electric shaver, rather than buying a new one.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying new razors, I began saving some money by buying sets of new replacement heads on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Also, the replacement heads from Amazon look excatly like those in a new razor, even under magnification.    </li>
            <li> Two days ago I loaded in a new set and turned on the razor.    </li>
            <li> The new heads restored shaving results to like new.</li>
            <li> We also signed up for the automatic delivery of new blades every six months</li>
            <li> I needed the new Shaving Heads and found out that Amazon was the place to go to get them.</li>
            <li> but it needed new blades.</li>
            <li> My husband said you don&#x27;t sharpen them, you get new blades.  </li>
            <li> it was when it was new.  </li>
            <li> like you have a new razor.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought a new razor (Remington).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li> New heads:</li>
            <li> New shaver:</li>
            <li> His razor hadn&#x27;t had new blades in a couple of years or longer, so when he couldn&#x27;t find them in a store, I found them on Amazone for him.  </li>
            <li> I tried these replacement blades in my new razor.  </li>
            <li> Made my razor just like new.</li>
            <li> Met my needs of new blades for the Norelco shaver I had.  </li>
            <li> Now my razor cuts like when I got it new 7 years ago.</li>
            <li> With these replacement shaver heads, it&#x27;s just like new again.</li>
            <li> I do believe you should compare the cost, and also if you should buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li> These blades made my electric razor shave like a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Nope, just get a set of new shaving heads and you can save some money.  </li>
            <li> These new heads give  you a close shave.  </li>
            <li> but it does make the shaver feel like brand new again.</li>
            <li> Every year I think that I could buy a new cordless razor every two years rather than spend $32 on replacements heads annually.  </li>
            <li> I equate this to the self-propelled lawn mower syndrome: I could buy a new mower every two years for what it costs for two years of annual service and mulching blade sharpening.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I bought a new razor, at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> With the new models that Norelco has introduced, the retail stores (Walmart, Target, etc.) have discontinued carrying the replacement razors for the Reflex Plus in favor of those for the newer brands.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> New blades is 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Razor works like new.</li>
            <li> Works just like brand new razor.  </li>
            <li> Makes the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li> Bought him a new one..</li>
            <li> It was returned and decided to order new heads.  </li>
            <li> My razor is now restored to brand new blade sharpness.</li>
            <li> Made a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li> I almost considered getting a new razon but decided to try the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads provide a like new close shave.</li>
            <li> but it beats buying a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> and it is now like new.</li>
            <li> Made my razor run like new.  </li>
            <li> the product was new and the correct item for the razor</li>
            <li> Ended up buying  a new razor.</li>
            <li> I was temped to buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> When I got the new replacement heads the problem was solved.  </li>
            <li> It was like having a brand new electric razor.</li>
            <li> I always am amazed the difference with a new set of cutters in the shaver.  </li>
            <li> it is like new again.</li>
            <li> Shaves like new, and for a lot cheaper then purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li> and they of course made my razor feel like a brand new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;with-out paying the price for a new one.</li>
            <li> With the new blades, the shave is quicker and smoother</li>
            <li> Not only does the new head cut much closer, it&#x27;s also much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty much exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> back of the box indicates these HQ 55 heads fit the following razor types: 34--, 36--, 38--, 44--, 46--, 48--, 66--, 69--, 5413, 5426, 5430, 5625, 5812, 5813, 5817, 5820, 5823, 5824, 6405, 6415, 6423, 6424, 6445, 6831, 6842, 6843, 6844, 6849, 6853, 6854, 6855, 6856, 6857, 6859, 6861, 6863, 6868, 6874, 6879.</li>
            <li> The only way you find that out is when you do the first shave with a new head.  </li>
            <li> received exactly what I needed in a short time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t have to be as lazy as me to notice the difference.</li>
            <li> So since the first set lasted 12 months, I decided to by a third set.</li>
            <li> Other sites had a blue box specifically for HQ55 Plus for more $$.</li>
            <li> I feel this is a cheaply made product that is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Norelco electric razor way back in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Other shavers such as Braun do a better job.</li>
            <li> I first ordered this product in Oct 2008, along with a apply for a credit  card that would give me $30 reduction on my next order..</li>
            <li> On the first order of this product last year..P &amp; H   were also waived..</li>
            <li> I have an eleven year old Norelco shaver and the thing just won&#x27;t die!</li>
            <li> Better performance than  some of the Norelco&#x60;s that I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> my grandfather asked me to find replacement heads for his 25 year old shaver!</li>
            <li> so well , I would have gotten them first, instead of the ones I got locally.</li>
            <li> Nice at first, but within a month I was having trouble with razor burn on my neck and all sorts of missed hair; worse than my original heads.</li>
            <li> These new heads made my old razor cut like a new one.  </li>
            <li> I bought one set of replacement heads (from another source) in the past and was completely unimpressed, but the replacement set purchased through Amazon seem to be of a much higher quality, and restored the shaver to its original \\&quot;new\\&quot; level of performance.</li>
            <li> The old shaver has a new lease on life.</li>
            <li> made my old razor liike new...</li>
            <li> Makes your old shaver feel brand new.</li>
            <li> My old razor works like new.  </li>
            <li> I received the box of razor heads for my Norelco electric razor in the mail promptly, immediately popped the old ones out, the new ones in, and shaved before 15 minutes had gone by.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about new heads making my razor as good as new.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, it was like getting a whole new electric razor at half the cost.  </li>
            <li> Everything was so easy compared to returning the two that did not fit.</li>
            <li> After a few years of using replacement heads from Amazon, it gradually dawned on me that shaving had become a lot harder -- it took a lot more time, more passes, and harder pressure to complete a shave.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, and item is exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> On the face of it this seems pretty improbable, because the head blades themselves are very intricate little devices with very close dimensional tolerances.  </li>
            <li> , I hope it lasts until my next trip to USA, down here in Brazil it costs too much, more than the shaver itself</li>
            <li> They arrived within a few business days and were exactly the right model #</li>
            <li> Easy to install &amp; Smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!  </li>
            <li> New shaving heads &#x3D; feel of a new razor for about a third of the cost of a new one.</li>
            <li> Shaves just like a new shaver again and  with the new Reflex Head holder almost restores it back to a complete new razor,</li>
            <li> My razor is 17 years old</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re debating whether you should spend the money then consider what a big difference these will make to the quality of your shave and how much time it will save you.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, about 9 months ago I decided to do a test by purchasing replacement heads directly from the Norelco website.  </li>
            <li> The soft envelop shipped did not protect the cardboard box holding the heads from being damaged.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco was not shaving well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 74 years young</li>
            <li> I noticed recently that I was no longer getting a very close shave, so I looked up the correct replacement blades on the Internet, and ordered them.</li>
            <li> It was much easier buying the replacement heads online than having to troop from one store to the next looking for them.</li>
            <li> Although, if your razor is really old, you MIGHT need to upgrade/replace the battery, if it is a cordless/battery shaver.</li>
            <li> wanted the HQ55 specifically because they work in my old razor.  </li>
            <li> Granted, my shaver is an old one, but when I specifically order</li>
            <li> They discontinued this and sent me another replacement head that was compatible with my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> I used to purchase these replacement heads directly from the Philips Employee Online Store.  </li>
            <li> I also do not see any need to switch to the newer models - the features that Norelco touts are marketing gimmicks as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I was sent a direct replacement, which is a newer model (HQ-56).  </li>
            <li> My 90 year old father did it himself, no problem.</li>
            <li> My 7+ years old Norelco shaver is still spinning.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;getting a close shave again, just like the old days</li>
            <li> For a while, it seemed as though I was out of luck finding replacement heads, and the last set I bought were wearing out, and not shaving very well.</li>
            <li> These replaced razor heads that were 2 years old.  </li>
            <li> The seller should completely remove the picture and sales offer.</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads on a 20 year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Husband has always used Norelco and it is very durable and only have to replace heads after years of use and</li>
            <li> Changing the heads at least yearly, is a practical practice to get the most out of a Norelco shaver</li>
            <li> It is so much easier checking on Amazon than trying to go to a lot of different stores to see if they have what you need in stock.  </li>
            <li> In expensive shaver and rated as good</li>
            <li> To my surprise on the first morning using the eBay razor, there was about twice as much whisker material down the wall of the sink bowl as I was accustomed to seeing after every shave.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t even find the right one at Walmart - and they were more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Online orders can be a real time-saver when you are looking for a specific part which will only work w/ a particular model.</li>
            <li> i) emails from Norelco&#x27;s website showing my failed purchase attempt much earlier this year and the successful purchase a week ago, plus</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco sells a multitude of very similar products, so getting a replacement head to match my exact shaver, that says &#x27;USE ONLY HEAD</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care what Norelco says, the HQ56 does not work the same in my older shaver as the HQ55 blades.  </li>
            <li> They arrived in due time, were the right item, and have worked out well.</li>
            <li> The high price of these replacement blades make me go buy the entire shaver at Walmart for $29!!!</li>
            <li> These blades last a long time if you clean them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I tend to replace the shave heads about every 9-10 months, so I will be back for a new set when it is time to replace the old ones.</li>
            <li> I actually debated whether to invest in a new razor than replace the blade heads that are now four years old.  </li>
            <li> I am also very pleased with the quality of the shaver overall, and how long it has lasted (at least for 5 years now).</li>
            <li> Price, through Amazon, was outstanding, and less than other razors I observed.</li>
            <li> I will diefinitly continue to re-order new blades as necessary.</li>
            <li> I came back and ordered replacement blades, and now my Norelco is like new.</li>
            <li> The quality of these replacements is  no different than a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Works to improve the shaver back to new condition.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I thought I would need a new razor as the replacement blades are not sold locally anymore.</li>
            <li> Always think they seem too expensive, when you can get a whole new razor for only $20 more.  </li>
            <li> It used to be you could buy a new shaver for a little more than new heads, but no more.</li>
            <li> After about 15 mins on the phone, the clerk finally confirmed they only had (1) item available and could only hold it behind the counter until end of business that same day.  </li>
            <li> The stores are much more expensive for the exact same product.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the razor that is why I purchased the replacement heads whoever the price is hard to swallow.</li>
            <li> No more long shaves to clean up the face!</li>
            <li> The heads, of course, work - and you&#x27;ll get a much improved shave after you pry them out of their theft resistant packaging and carefully install them.  </li>
            <li> I put my old blades back on.</li>
            <li> My Norelco razor, which is ten years old, said that it required HQ55+ blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a hand held shaver that is several years old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that they are less expensive than in 2011.  </li>
            <li> I have had my razors for quite a long time, and decided that they needed new heads.  </li>
            <li> If Norelco&#x27;s factory has high security for heads emerging from a final processing step but misses diversion and theft of heads from an earlier point in the production process, that would explain all the facts without having to invoke the idea of a totally separate counterfeiting plant.    </li>
            <li> My old blades were dull, and I was about to buy a whole new razor before I thought of getting replacements.</li>
            <li> The shipping container could have been a little more protective than just a plain brown envelope, but the heads were not damaged and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a New England Yankee who believes in keeping things running as long as possible.</li>
            <li> The price was less than I expected, shipping was fast and the replacement heads were just what was needed to get the Norelco razor up and running like new!</li>
            <li> These last at least a year and fit a lot of different razors.</li>
            <li> Apparently they are the same as the HQ 55 replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> So rather than buy a new razor, we just bought the heads which are not cheap, but are cheaper than a new razor.  </li>
            <li> New head after several years helped since it was starting to take a long time to shave.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this particular shaver again.</li>
            <li> and I have never had a set of cutters dull so quickly.  </li>
            <li> i can shave quickly without having to press hard on the razor.just what i ordered.</li>
            <li> The blades are fine but are not secure and tend to fall out if the razor is upside down.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, new quality and performance from your existing shaver.</li>
            <li> Not really being able to afford $35-$40 for the blades, I went on this site and it was less than half the price.......</li>
            <li> They are all going back, with a demand for full refund on shoddy material .</li>
            <li> Be aware it is only the round discs, so keep your snap on holder.</li>
            <li> -- it actually sounded noticeably different from what I had generally been hearing from various Norelco razors and head sets over the years.  </li>
            <li> Installing the new heads is incredibly simple with one twist of the center retainer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my razor since high school and finally decided I need some sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> My old blades were probably at least 5 years old and I wasn&#x27;t getting a very complete shave.  </li>
            <li> My father had no idea that all his razor needed was a new head with sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I had been investigating the puchase of a new razor since the heads on my current one were no longer sharp enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> It takes me HALF the amount of time to shave, and my Norelco Shaver is like NEW again!</li>
            <li> Razor performance during this period of about 20 years was always great -- as the saying goes, they will have to pry these razors out of my cold, dead hands.    </li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding the right replacement.  </li>
            <li> The price was below store cost and now my husband has a new shaver for a lot less cost.  </li>
            <li> It costs less to burn a gallon of gas and buy a completely new shaver.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and make razor cut like new razor but at less cost.  </li>
            <li> Only used a month, so do not know it they will last as long as originals.</li>
            <li> Therefore the newer replacement heads will not fit in older shaver models.  </li>
            <li> The whole issue of replacements is a tough one, as the blades are pricey (~$35), almost ½ the price of a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Or maybe Norelco retains control of one source that makes the high-quality heads that are available on Norelco&#x27;s website but also enabled some other, less capable source to make the heads that work so poorly.</li>
            <li> When Norelco clamped down on my local shaver repair shop and wouldn&#x27;t let them sell replacement parts anymore, I didn&#x27;t want to go directly to Norelco.  </li>
            <li> and I finally decided the heads were dead and it was time to get new blades.</li>
            <li> There is very little else one can say about shaver heads; they cut hair, last a long time, and don&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li> As I said, I can&#x27;t rate this set until I see how long they last.</li>
            <li> It has met our expectations and we look forward to it lasting us a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought these a long time back, and I&#x27;am still using them to shave.</li>
            <li> The new blades for my razor are very sharp and it doesn&#x27;t take long to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory, quick seviccenno problem, but fail to let me know the Balance on my gift card!</li>
            <li> These blades should last quite a long time!  </li>
            <li> Instead, this seller will send you HQ56 replacement heads, which works just as well but can be purchased for about $4 less directly from Amazon (plus no shipping if you are an Amazon Prime customer).  </li>
            <li> I recently ordered from Amazon a replacement head for my old Norelco Shaver,was going to buy a new shaver but decided to try a new cutting head instead.</li>
            <li> Really, probably at least that long.</li>
            <li> it took a long time to get it done.  </li>
            <li> I should have replaced the razor heads long before this.  </li>
            <li> Now I wonder why  you offer a $30 deduction on the next order if you never really meant it.  </li>
            <li> how long it&#x27;s been since I bought my razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d waited too long to change blade heads</li>
            <li> did not retain their edge for long.</li>
            <li> The life of the heads is not very good - about 1 year and the expense is too high.</li>
            <li> In years past I would foolishly buy a new razor as I don&#x27;t remeber seeing replacements in stores.</li>
            <li> was that the problem was solved and that I needn&#x27;t think of it again for a very long time---</li>
            <li> For less than half the money razor works like new.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had gone way over a year with the older ones, and though these are almost as expensive as buying a new razor</li>
            <li> So, when I got home a few days later I went back to the Norelco website and persevered until, with their customer service help, I got two sets of replacement heads ordered and delivered.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty dramatic, especially given that the razor had been used for an unknown number of shaves before I bought it on eBay.    </li>
            <li> The only sour grapes was i notice they sell that part number cheaper than the one i specified.</li>
            <li> The directions on replacing the heads was clear and concise;  getting the package open was another issue, and the plastic was very tough, and you did not want to risk damaging anything.  </li>
            <li> cutters are the only type that cuts whiskers that are laying down.</li>
            <li> does not stay sharp over limited time of useage - am considering other than Phillips razor for next electric razor purchase</li>
            <li> Replaced my old cutting heads and have much smoother shave now!  </li>
            <li> I went to 2 local Wal-Marts where I previously bought them</li>
            <li> Took the drain apart and only recovered about half the parts.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stay sharp too long, but I guess that&#x27;s he  nature of them.</li>
            <li> just follow the instruction on the back of the package and don&#x27;t mess around with the blade.</li>
            <li> Have given up for now and placed them on a shelf to await a time when I feel that I can devote a lot of effort on this small endeavor that has become a major problem for me.  </li>
            <li> are a little larger than HQ55.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this at all, because it seems so COMPLETELY improbable that someone would go to the trouble of counterfeiting these intricate little devices.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old shaver blades had become.  </li>
            <li> After about a years worth of shaves, my cousin told me his Norelco shaver was starting to pull the hair instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much for you to know about these replacement heads for a Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> It took longer for us to get it than we expected.</li>
            <li> It was about the 4th day after expected date.</li>
            <li> It came in a partially dented box.  </li>
            <li> For many years I simply bought the least expensive Norelco reflex razor every few years and did not bother with replacement heads (</li>
            <li> Also I had trouble finding the item locally.</li>
            <li> I expected from replacement heads for my Norelco shaver replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I went through two sets of these blades within a year because the screen and the blades got jammed and started to rip away at the screen.</li>
            <li> They deteriorated rapidly from that point on and were useless in about 2 months, basically hacking off my whiskers and not cutting them.  </li>
            <li> Saved a few dollars over the local discount store prices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them I few times.</li>
            <li> the time spent shaving.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> What I found is often towel threads and fluff</li>
            <li> get stuck and wound up in the heads blade center, pushing it away from your face until almost no blades are doing any work.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find the replacement discs for this shaver in local stores as it is several years old.</li>
            <li> that´s affordable, works like expected</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> It was not available locally.</li>
            <li> He had trouble finding these replacement heads at his local drug store, so we ordered and shipped to him</li>
            <li> I expected that the purchasing/shipping/billing processes would foul up somehow ,that the product would either not fit properly or that it would be inferior in some way,or the shipping caused damages or lose the order altogether---</li>
            <li> Since I was unable to drive to the store right away, I ordered a set of replacement heads for my electric shaver through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Were the right ones and I did not have to fight crowds and come home with the wrong one</li>
            <li> These are Original Equipment Manufactures replacement cutting heads for my Philips Norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li> The blades make a lot of noise and pull at my beard instead of cutting it cleanly.</li>
            <li> We were extremely please with the quality of our shaving heads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to have an option other than purchasing a competitive brand.</li>
            <li> my husband loves having a sharp razor again&lt;</li>
            <li> Has continued staying sharp, 6 months.</li>
            <li> + from this or any other seller.  </li>
            <li> and it is sharp and shaves well.</li>
            <li> I first bought a Norelco rotating reflex head shaver in the late 1970&#x27;s -- I was a grad student with very little money but scraped enough together to buy the razor (expensive back then) because a close friend recommended it.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the cost is almost as high as a new razor on sale, even at Amazon price.</li>
            <li> Helped to extend the lifespan of my razor just a little longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my former shaver was until I replaced the heads.</li>
            <li> For example, though I&#x27;m not a metallurgist, I do know that there are some highly specialized techniques and expensive equipment for hardening the surfaces of cutting edges, such as by using metal sputtering or ion implantation to harden just the first few layers of atoms on a metallic surface or edge.  </li>
            <li> I should have ordered these a LONG time ago, I had no idea what I was missing!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the razor heads aren&#x27;t as close-shaving as the commercials portray.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I waited so long to purchase this.  </li>
            <li> I bought these 5 months ago and they are in worse condition than the 2 year old heads they replaced.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion the quality is down</li>
            <li> Now that I have read some other reviews of these replacement heads, it seems possible that there actually is ALSO a counterfeit production source, because some reviewers said that the screens and blades failed immediately.  </li>
            <li> In the mean time I have gone back to using disposable razors.</li>
            <li> must be sharp!</li>
            <li> I had noticed a less close, harsher shaver.</li>
            <li> Amazon was selling the heads for almost half of the price I would have paid at the discount store.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that the longevity of them is considerably less than those that came with the razor.</li>
            <li> Meets typical Norelco quality.</li>
            <li> less passes over my mug to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Had I been told of the substitution up front, I could have purchased the HQ56 for five bucks less.  </li>
            <li> Typically, I shave once a week</li>
            <li> Holy Cow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> They were not cheap imitation blad,.</li>
            <li> It is certainly less expensive than having to buy a new Norelco razor.  </li>
            <li> with the new shaver head, I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting stuck on random hairs.</li>
            <li> But these are still a little cheaper than at the store.  </li>
            <li> so no more worries about rough shaves again!</li>
            <li> I was getting a little shaggy, in need of a shave.  </li>
            <li> Just have to be a little patient.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blades after a little bit of trouble finding them on their web site.</li>
            <li> As usual the product worked fine,  I have never been disappointed by a product received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> However, a few weeks ago I traveled to see my sister and brother-in-law, and I threw one of my used razors from eBay into my carry-on.  </li>
            <li> My last set lasted six years before the metal in the heads got so thin that holes started developing.</li>
            <li> they would not fit razor sent ,return them  nov 24</li>
            <li> They turned out to be HQ56  which does not fit in a Norelco model 6613X shaver even though it was stated that they were the replacement .</li>
            <li> did not fit my razor like it said it would</li>
            <li> Ordered the replacement razor heads and they arrived in a few days.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s half the price of the shaver!</li>
            <li> My other razor blades were getting dull</li>
            <li> I understand that for efficiency they reduce the number of packaging options, but this seems a little excessive.</li>
            <li> Far less expensive than replacing the razor every year!  </li>
            <li> I am like the person who buys a new car because the ashtray is dirty.  </li>
            <li> The model 6423LC sells for less than $40 at Amazon today (12Apr08) and is the least expensive model I found there that uses the same head assembly.</li>
            <li> It was shipped out in very little time and placed on the credit card they told me they had canceled.  </li>
            <li> It can be difficult to purchase them locally and buying this item online</li>
            <li> No more \\&quot;Manual Razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the \\&quot;plus\\&quot; means, but I guess I didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I put a couple of sets into the shopping cart and tried to check out, but the process repeatedly failed and I gave up back then.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the replacement blades, because the instructions for my razor said \\&quot; Use HQ55+ blades only\\&quot; and the only blades I could find were</li>
            <li> /&gt;The replacement heads at local stores are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Tolerated for 3 months, then bought a foil shaver, which always worked well for my beard in the past.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> I can usually use replacement heads for 2 years before replacing.  </li>
            <li> I tried the HQ56 replacement blades in the past and they cut and burned my face.  </li>
            <li> This time instead of the usual thorough brushing out</li>
            <li> I usually get a lot out of these anyway..</li>
            <li> They say to replace these blades yearly, but we can usually stretch that out longer than a year.  </li>
            <li> Orderd a 2 back of replacement heads, and they are difficult to line up the blades.</li>
            <li> So I did a careful but serious cleaning of the heads and the plastic device that holds them in and tada!</li>
            <li> Hard to remember</li>
            <li> Bought these heads for their exorbitant price and they were dull from the moment I installed them in the shaver.  </li>
            <li> The do the job to replace dull heads.</li>
            <li> These seem to be hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Have been unable to remove and replace with the new heads because the instructions are very poor and totaly lacking with any detail.  </li>
            <li> I would guess that we are now deaing with at least two sources of problems with the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> CONFUSING:</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too late now.  </li>
            <li> I should say you will need to replace the heads at least every two years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the cutting heads only</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised but delivery was extremely slow.</li>
            <li> They only make the company look bad.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it was a wasted $25.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; blades are worse than the lones from a razor I have not used for at least a year.</li>
            <li> The cutting blades remained sharp.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember what year my old shaver was puchased and the cutter blades were badly worn giving very poor performance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very dull, and poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They pull terribly and are a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am ahead of the game.</li>
            <li> If your head is broken or lost you&#x27;ll probably need to call the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I found this really unnecessary.</li>
            <li> It seemed impossible that counterfeiters would develop the expensive equipment and processing skill to make a crummy imitation version of Norelco&#x27;s heads and still hope to make money on them.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this model is not sold in stores anymore, so it was tough to find this model.</li>
            <li> Still lousy shave, and</li>
            <li> but eventually I reached the conclusion that maybe something was really, really wrong with the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> the conclusion, however improbable, seems incontrovertible -- there is something wrong with the replacement heads.    </li>
            <li> Since I felt guilty throwing away a shaver that was still working I decided to give these blades a try.</li>
            <li> What could go wrong?  </li>
            <li> My order was sent to the wrong address and therefor it was cancelled</li>
            <li> Expensive for the quality that you get</li>
            <li> Replacement heads can be so expensive in stores.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I accidentally ordered three sets of blades.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t giving him a close shave any more.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to find the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I received the wrong item and had to return it.</li>
            <li> it was a bit expensive</li>
            <li> And it got to be very irritating indeed, figuratively and literally.    </li>
            <li> I am unhappy with the Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads.  </li>
            <li> The product is just a replacement for the cutting edges of the electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product but to save yourself</li>
            <li> bad product...will never buy norelco again.....</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in the blades.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for those of us who hate nicks &amp; cuts.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are terrible.  </li>
            <li> replacement heads and cutters are about 1/2 Norelco&#x27;s outrageous price.</li>
            <li> I admit I am terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> worked fine, very pleased. looked in several stores for this then found on amazon in under 10 seconds...fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> All I can say is they work as advertised. They works as replacement heads for this particular shaver. Cheap and easy order.</li>
            <li> Good deal if you are like me and don&#x27;t see any reason to buy a new electric razor every year or two.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in the blades. Were they used? They did not shave they just rolled around on my beard and left a lot of stubble.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought these replacement heads. The are very good .Cheaper then buying a new razer.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for probably 20 years, have to replace blades periodically, which is ok, glad to be able to find them.</li>
            <li> My son and I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any store in our area so finding it on Amazon.com was perfect since my son wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use his present shaver any more without new replacement heads.  You saved him from buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> My razor is 17 years old and I have not been able to find replacement heads for it.&lt;br /&gt;I received exactly what I needed in a short time.  They were new and delivered in&lt;br /&gt;very good condition. They were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The new heads installed in my shaver in record time.  The shaver now works like it did when it was new.  Daily use of the shaver does require a head cleaning every week but it makes the heads last for a year or more.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper that buying a new razor. Only used a month, so do not know it they will last as long as originals.</li>
            <li> Husband just shouted the response to be. Electric razors are not as good as a hand razor but he is very happy using the new electric razor head since a friend gave him an old razor. It just needed new blades.</li>
            <li> I expected that the purchasing/shipping/billing processes would foul up somehow ,that the product would either not fit properly or that it would be inferior in some way,or the shipping caused damages or lose the order altogether---None of the previous happened ,instead the product  was received in good order,installed in short order and cut it&#x27;s first whisker all within a half hour----The nice thing was that the problem was solved and that I needn&#x27;t think of it again for a very long time---j---</li>
            <li> These replacement heads have dramatically improved the comfort and effectiveness of my Norelco shaver.  Shaves are much closer and much faster.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much for you to know about these replacement heads for a Norelco shaver. At a good price, this beats buying a new shaver, and replacing them is quite easy, even if you normally wouldn&#x27;t attempt such a thing. Be sure that the heads you buy will work with your shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the HQ55 was &#x27;state of the art&#x27; when I first got the shaver, but I&#x27;ve never been convinced it shaves \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; as advertised.  It is easier on my face; but getting a really close shave can take a while...especially in the neck area.  There&#x27;s probably better stuff out there, but you&#x27;ll pay dearly for it.  It gets the job done, which I guess you really can&#x27;t ask for any more-</li>
            <li> I bought these for a Norelco Reflex Plus 6615x razor and they fit correctly. The back of my razor says \\&quot;Use only head HQ55+\\&quot; but this one works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty lazy about changing my razor blades, like I&#x27;d probably had my last set for a couple years. Really, probably at least that long. Well I noticed that I was having to run the razor over the same spot over and over again to get it to cut and I finally decided the heads were dead and it was time to get new blades. I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;d forgotten how wonderful new razor heads are. My shaves have gone from taking 10 minutes to taking 3, and they leave me a lot smoother. If you&#x27;re debating whether you should spend the money then consider what a big difference these will make to the quality of your shave and how much time it will save you. I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t have to be as lazy as me to notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I have always used electric razors &amp; I find this a great product.  At regular intervals I replace the blades in my razor.  The blades give me a regular clean, close shave that I am satisfied with.</li>
            <li> We purchased the Norelco shaver replacement heads for my father and he is extremely pleased with the results. He struggled for several months getting a close shave, and this product worked perfectly for him.</li>
            <li> The heads are just fine and work fine in two of my razors, the only drawback is the price which is more than half the price of a new razor at local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a New England Yankee who believes in keeping things running as long as possible. I once had a Norelco for 14 years; I like this one I&#x27;ve had for I think 4 years.  So make sure you stock up on replacement heads as well as maintain your razors.  New shaving heads &#x3D; feel of a new razor for about a third of the cost of a new one.</li>
            <li> product as advertised, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to install. It only gets 4 stars because of the price point.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure this is good quality product, I found it was less costly to purchase a new Norelco 6940 shaver set from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Got what was expecting and received  when promised</li>
            <li> These heads came very fast from the vender.  They were the correct heads for my razor and they work very well.  I would order again if I had it to do over.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product.  It took longer for us to get it than we expected. It was about the 4th day after expected date.</li>
            <li> These new heads made my old razor cut like a new one.  This is about 4 times that I have replaced the heads.  It is a lot cheaper that buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> According to my husband, the replacement heads make the razor seem brand new.  Buying them at Amazon.com is a great deal because their prices are so low and the shipping is free!  I would recommend Amazon.com and Norelco replacement heads 100%.</li>
            <li> I changed the heads on my shaver after about a year-and-a-half of use. I had noticed a less close, harsher shaver. There was some improvement after changing the heads, but not that impressive. It&#x27;s relatively easy to change the heads, but some parts can fall out, so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I was not getting a clean shave.  Cleaned the razor thoroughly.  Still lousy shave, and it took a long time to get it done.  Ordered these new heads, put &#x27;em in the day they arrived, had a clean baby-smooth face in one-fourth of the time of the old heads.  Excellent product.  I&#x27;ll get another set in a year or so.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how overdue I was for replacement heads until I replaced them.  I do not know the interval recommended, but if the shave is not as good as you remember when you bought the new product, you are due!</li>
            <li> Made my shaving experience much better.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product, price and quality! I also think that you guys did a great job on the shipping , very prompt!</li>
            <li> Standard brand item at a low price.  used the option to have periodic deliveries and saved even more.</li>
            <li> The heads, of course, work - and you&#x27;ll get a much improved shave after you pry them out of their theft resistant packaging and carefully install them.  They cost about 50% of a new corded razor though, so if you need any other part - like a the plastic head cover or a cord - you might be better off buying a new razor.  If you have, as I do, a rechargeable model (and the batteries are still good), you might want to buy the cheapest corded model using the same head assembly and scavenger it for parts.  The model 6423LC sells for less than $40 at Amazon today (12Apr08) and is the least expensive model I found there that uses the same head assembly.</li>
            <li> Turns out I saved time and money by replacing the blades on my electric shaver, rather than buying a new one.</li>
            <li> Worked fine!  I liked the price.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased to find replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco electric razor at Amazon.com. It can be difficult to purchase them locally and buying this item online saved me a lot of running around. The price was less than I expected, shipping was fast and the replacement heads were just what was needed to get the Norelco razor up and running like new!</li>
            <li> Found replacement heads at the local store and on-line. Amazon was selling the heads for almost half of the price I would have paid at the discount store. The heads are made by Philips Norelco and are a perfect replacement for the original heads in my Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> I needed a backup set of replacement heads. The price at amazon is much lower than Philips was selling on there site. Amazon was giving me free shipping and lower price.</li>
            <li> I started using an Electric Razor at around the beginning of the year and Love it. No more \\&quot;Manual Razor Cuts\\&quot; and nicks. I know Norelco has a Good reputation and they have proven it to me by providing me with a comfortable close shave. I will diefinitly continue to re-order new blades as necessary. Thanks, a Satisfied Customer  Chuck Gmurek</li>
            <li> I am unhappy with the Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads.  It does not remove facial hairs easily.  Perhaps the heads I received were defective. Is It possible to mail these heads back and get a replacement?  Bea</li>
            <li> I have been using a Noleco electric razor for years and I would recommend it to anyone.  The new blades for my razor are very sharp and it doesn&#x27;t take long to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> As usual the product worked fine,  I have never been disappointed by a product received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Got this set of blades for my old electric razor and they perform better than the ones that came with the razor when it was new. Great product.</li>
            <li> I had not replaced my blades since getting my shaver several years ago and I will not make that mistake again. These new heads made my shaver better than when I bought it! Will be changing them yearly from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the only product for the HQ 55 (+) plus, but the box only says HQ 55</li>
            <li> New blades are great.  Hard to remember but I think the shaver works better now than when new.</li>
            <li> When you just buy replacement shaver blades, you can&#x27;t give an honest opinion because I don&#x27;t know how long they will last. So I decided to buy another set of blades. The last set. which usually lasts a year(the first set) lasted only 6 months. I was really disappointed in them. So since the first set lasted 12 months, I decided to by a third set. As I said, I can&#x27;t rate this set until I see how long they last.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that these aren&#x27;t HQ55+, they work just fine in my electric razor.  Don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a significant difference.  This is my second time buying them from Amazon.com - have never been dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Now, I have a smooth shave again after replacing the head.  It was easy to order, came in three days, and works perfectly on my 9-year old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> It came in a partially dented box.  The item itself was in perfect condition.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My old blades were about 18 months old, and I&#x27;d forgotten how good an electric shaver can be with sharp blades. It&#x27;s like a whole new shaver. My only concern is that last time I bought blades for this shaver I got \\&quot;HQ 55 plus\\&quot; and I couldn&#x27;t find them, only these. I&#x27;m not sure what the \\&quot;plus\\&quot; means, but I guess I didn&#x27;t need it. These are working fine.</li>
            <li> I first bought a Norelco rotating reflex head shaver in the late 1970&#x27;s -- I was a grad student with very little money but scraped enough together to buy the razor (expensive back then) because a close friend recommended it.  This technology immediately proved to give a terrific, easy shave, and I have stayed with the Norelco shaver line ever since.  The so-called \\&quot;Lift and Cut\\&quot; configuration has two sets of angled, stacked blades in the rotating shaver head, and I have every reason to believe that Norelco&#x27;s illustrations and claims of their special effectiveness are correct.    For many years I simply bought the least expensive Norelco reflex razor every few years and did not bother with replacement heads (a set of heads costs more than half of what the lowest-priced razor model costs).  Razor performance during this period of about 20 years was always great -- as the saying goes, they will have to pry these razors out of my cold, dead hands.    Then, with the advent of Amazon and eBay, my approach changed in recent years.  Instead of buying new razors, I began saving some money by buying sets of new replacement heads on Amazon.  Also, I really liked the low-end, powerful Norelco 6423LC model that Norelco had discontinued (it is not rechargeable but is great for travel because it is 120/240 volt).  So, more recently I bought a few used 6423LC&#x27;s on eBay and set them aside so that I would always have at least one for many years to come.    After a few years of using replacement heads from Amazon, it gradually dawned on me that shaving had become a lot harder -- it took a lot more time, more passes, and harder pressure to complete a shave.  The degradation in shaving experience was kind of subtle at first but eventually I reached the conclusion that maybe something was really, really wrong with the replacement heads.  And it got to be very irritating indeed, figuratively and literally.    I also bought and tried \\&quot;Vollco Sharpening Heads\\&quot;, which are designed to hone the edges of worn-down Norelco reflex razor heads, but these did not succeed at all in getting me back to a great, easy shave.    I reluctantly began to consider the possibility that the replacement heads from Amazon were counterfeit.  On the face of it this seems pretty improbable, because the head blades themselves are very intricate little devices with very close dimensional tolerances.  It seemed impossible that counterfeiters would develop the expensive equipment and processing skill to make a crummy imitation version of Norelco&#x27;s heads and still hope to make money on them.  Also, the replacement heads from Amazon look excatly like those in a new razor, even under magnification.    Nonetheless, about 9 months ago I decided to do a test by purchasing replacement heads directly from the Norelco website.  I put a couple of sets into the shopping cart and tried to check out, but the process repeatedly failed and I gave up back then.  What are the odds, right?  I figured maybe I was just wasting my time.    However, a few weeks ago I traveled to see my sister and brother-in-law, and I threw one of my used razors from eBay into my carry-on.  Now, one thing I learned early on with these razors is that you have to empty out the shavings every time you use them in order to avoid buildup and jamming.  So, every morning I pull off the head assembly and tap it against the sink.    To my surprise on the first morning using the eBay razor, there was about twice as much whisker material down the wall of the sink bowl as I was accustomed to seeing after every shave.  It was pretty dramatic, especially given that the razor had been used for an unknown number of shaves before I bought it on eBay.    So, when I got home a few days later I went back to the Norelco website and persevered until, with their customer service help, I got two sets of replacement heads ordered and delivered.  Two days ago I loaded in a new set and turned on the razor.    Big surprise at the outset -- it actually sounded noticeably different from what I had generally been hearing from various Norelco razors and head sets over the years.  And the shave was, finally, terrific and easy again!  I did not expect this at all, because it seems so COMPLETELY improbable that someone would go to the trouble of counterfeiting these intricate little devices.    But with three new facts in hand (changed sound, more whisker material, and really great, fast shave again), the conclusion, however improbable, seems incontrovertible -- there is something wrong with the replacement heads.    All things considered, my best guess is that these replacement heads sold on Amazon actually do come from the same factory in China where the good ones from Norelco are made, but are somehow being diverted and stolen from the production line at a point before some sort of final, critical manufacturing step(s) is carried out.    For example, though I&#x27;m not a metallurgist, I do know that there are some highly specialized techniques and expensive equipment for hardening the surfaces of cutting edges, such as by using metal sputtering or ion implantation to harden just the first few layers of atoms on a metallic surface or edge.  These techniques can create highly specialized alloy surfaces or whatever.    If Norelco&#x27;s factory has high security for heads emerging from a final processing step but misses diversion and theft of heads from an earlier point in the production process, that would explain all the facts without having to invoke the idea of a totally separate counterfeiting plant.    Obviously I will buy replacement heads ONLY from Norelco in the future.    I hope this review helps some people.  I will be happy to provide whatever information I can to help skeptics understand that this review is genuine.  For example, I have (i) emails from Norelco&#x27;s website showing my failed purchase attempt much earlier this year and the successful purchase a week ago, plus (ii) records of all my eBay razor purchases, and (iii) my purchases of replacement heads from Amazon:  Feb 26, 2007; Feb 10, 2008; Dec 20, 2009; Dec 12, 2010; Aug 5, 2011; Aug 21, 2012; July 29, 2013; and the Vollco sharpeners on Aug 21, 2012.    I have nothing to gain from publicizing this information -- I&#x27;m just very pleased indeed with the outcome and grateful to Norelco for putting out a fine product for several decades now.    P.S.  Now that I have read some other reviews of these replacement heads, it seems possible that there actually is ALSO a counterfeit production source, because some reviewers said that the screens and blades failed immediately.  This would not happen with heads diverted from an intermediate step the Norelco production process.  I would guess that we are now deaing with at least two sources of problems with the replacement heads.  Or maybe Norelco retains control of one source that makes the high-quality heads that are available on Norelco&#x27;s website but also enabled some other, less capable source to make the heads that work so poorly.</li>
            <li> Bought the NORELCO brand as I assumed these would be better than another replacement mfg.  After installing I&#x27;m wondering if the blades are as sharp as they should be... seems the razor doesn&#x27;t cut quite as good as it used to??</li>
            <li> Fit my old Norelco shaver as stated.  Nice sharp blades and back to a clean shave once again.  No problem changing them out either.</li>
            <li> Arrived as scheduled. Appear to be genuine Norelco and work as expected. I have been changing them about once a year and it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the original head on a shaver that was over 5 years old.  While it shaves better than the original, I had hoped for more of an improvement.  Will probably move to a better overall razor once this new head needs replacement.</li>
            <li> These blades worked as good as the original blades.  They were not cheap imitation blad,.I bought those before.</li>
            <li> Prolonged the life of a shaver and is smooth and durable.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS FINE AND SHIPPMENT CAME IN ON TIME AND AT A FAIR PRICE.  WOULD RECOMMEND AND AM SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> The new heads restored shaving results to like new. Too bad the cost is almost as high as a new razor on sale, even at Amazon price. I have replaced the heads many times and always have been pleased.</li>
            <li> The Norelco replacement heads were very good.  I replace them about once a year and find the at satisfactory.</li>
            <li> After about a years worth of shaves, my cousin told me his Norelco shaver was starting to pull the hair instead of cutting. I have a Norelco shaver and had the same experience, after replacing the shaver heads, my shaver was as good as new. I gave him the new heads, and he swears his Norelco is better than new. I recommend replacing the heads every year, no matter how much the use.</li>
            <li> After trying two different times to get a replacement head for the Norelco razor locally (with the correct number listed on the package), we tried Amazon and no problems at all. Everything was so easy compared to returning the two that did not fit.</li>
            <li> These heads work as advertised and provide a clean shave every time.  These razor heads are the king of whiskers.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, and cuts much better that what I had (which were exactly the same) because they were blunt. Overall very happy and would order again.</li>
            <li> These blades work great as the replacements for the older blades. My boyfriend had gone way over a year with the older ones, and though these are almost as expensive as buying a new razor, I figured it was worth it since he likes the original razor, and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to throw away a perfectly good product. If you liked them the first time around, the replacements work fine--but they&#x27;re really easy to \\&quot;install!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My father had no idea that all his razor needed was a new head with sharp blades. After searching serveral websites, including Norelco&#x27;s own, I realized that Amazon had the best price. Why pay more for the exact same product? Way to go, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Need to replace these blades every year or so.  Always think they seem too expensive, when you can get a whole new razor for only $20 more.  But these are still a little cheaper than at the store.  Good fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It works great!  I was happy with what I got and the product is working just like it should. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have an older Norelco shaver which requires replacement heads about every 1 to 1-1/2 years. This product restores the performance of the shaver; and the price on Amazon is better than the price at local retailers.</li>
            <li> It was what I needed.</li>
            <li> Pretty much exactly what I expected. This is the first replacement head I&#x27;ve bought and I&#x27;m glad I did!  :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads and have been very pleased with them. I tried to find them locally but they want as much or more than a whole new razor. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time &amp; without issue. It was exactly what we were looking for &amp; worked well on my Norelco Reflex Plus razor.</li>
            <li> Easy to change and what a difference.  Highly recommend.  I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my former shaver was until I replaced the heads.</li>
            <li> We were extremely please with the quality of our shaving heads. It&#x27;s nice to know that some people in the world still take pride in their products. Norelco will remain at the top of our shaver purchases. Amazon&#x27;s vendor shipped the product promptly and the billing was a breeze.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and the razor that it goes to is the greatest!I bought it as a gift for my husband and he really loves it!!you should check it out,you will be happy that you did.</li>
            <li> The replacement parts worked perfectly and I expect to get years of trouble free service, thank you.</li>
            <li> I saved more than $[...] by ordering from Amazon.  The product was delivered promptly and worked as advertised.  We also signed up for the automatic delivery of new blades every six months so no more worries about rough shaves again!</li>
            <li> The product I ordered was a set of replacement heads for a Norelco shaver. The whole issue of replacements is a tough one, as the blades are pricey (~$35), almost ½ the price of a new shaver. I shopped them online to find the best price and found them for a bit less than $30 with a shop I didn&#x27;t recognize. A quick trip to the BBB site revealed this unknown vendor had an \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating with BBB and many unresolved complaints. I then went to Amazon, found the item for a few bucks more, and clicked away. They arrived in due time, were the right item, and have worked out well. In fact, the shaver works like new, and I am glad I went the route I did. Lessons learned? Stay with OEM, check the BBB on newbie vendors, and stick with Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and blades are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco sells a multitude of very similar products, so getting a replacement head to match my exact shaver, that says &#x27;USE ONLY HEAD HQ55+&#x27; ... well the HQ55 without the \\&quot;+\\&quot; work just fine.  Perfect.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I needed the new Shaving Heads and found out that Amazon was the place to go to get them.</li>
            <li> Comprei esse repplacement para o meu barbeador Philips e agora ele está como um novo. Ótima opção para renovar o barbeador sem precisar comprar um novo.</li>
            <li> Philips HQ55 great product was a hard to find. Glad I was able to find it but think it might have been open before.</li>
            <li> We had difficulty finding the replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s razor in any stores locally, and found it at Amazon.com.  It&#x27;s the correct head, works fine, the price was good, the shipment fast and we are happy with the whole experience.</li>
            <li> Came on time, was what it was advertised to do, the correct replacement part! Thanks for the item.  Price was good as well.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades refreshed my razor.</li>
            <li> This is an exact fit replacement for my shaver.  Price is better than the local stores.  I tend to replace the shave heads about every 9-10 months, so I will be back for a new set when it is time to replace the old ones.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory, quick seviccenno problem, but fail to let me know the Balance on my gift card!</li>
            <li> Have been unable to remove and replace with the new heads because the instructions are very poor and totaly lacking with any detail.  Have given up for now and placed them on a shelf to await a time when I feel that I can devote a lot of effort on this small endeavor that has become a major problem for me.  In the mean time I have gone back to using disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered from Amazon a replacement head for my old Norelco Shaver,was going to buy a new shaver but decided to try a new cutting head instead.It works fine,if it lasts a year I&#x27;am ahead of the game.Amazon&#x27;s service was first rate.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product. Came on time and with no damage to product. Would recommend to family and friends. Will buy from you again. Thankyou very much for the business. Anthony</li>
            <li> as advertised,  Great,  Buy hew real Philips Norelcol and not knock off brands.</li>
            <li> For those of us who don&#x27;t upgrade our electric razors yearly, these replacement blades are excellent. The cost is reasonable and they return your razor to near new condition. Heck of a close shave.</li>
            <li> I ordered Norelco  HQ 55 shaver replacement heads. They arrived ahead of schedule.   The soft envelop shipped did not protect the cardboard box holding the heads from being damaged. The heads were protected by their own sturdy container.  CONFUSING: The heads were shipped in a box labeled HQ \\&quot;56\\&quot;, not \\&quot;55\\&quot;. The paperwork showed both 55 and 56; but NOT a word of explanation. Good news is the heads do fit in my shaver.</li>
            <li> The Norelco HQ 55 reflex replacement heads work as a replacement in my 15-year-old Norelco 725RL corded shaver. Nice. I&#x27;m a woman, and use this shaver for my legs - faster, smoother, and safer than any shaver sold for women.</li>
            <li> Like my Norelco shaver but it needed new blades. Very satisfied to get genuine Norelco blades at a good price.</li>
            <li> As my parents age, I am having to manage more of their needs.  Daddy asked me to take his electric razor out &amp; get the blades sharpened.  I had no idea where, neither did he.  My husband said you don&#x27;t sharpen them, you get new blades.  Among all the blades listed, I could not find Daddy&#x27;s model number, but your customer service did.  They quickly aimed me in the right direction, and the blades were delivered quickly.  Installation was a bit of trial and error, but only took 5 minutes.  Daddy is happy &amp; handsome.  What more could I want?</li>
            <li> Received in the time frame company promised. The price was below store cost and now my husband has a new shaver for a lot less cost.  Shaver was a great product from the beginning.  Dolores  Montgomery IL</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with my purchase of the HQ55 replacement cutters for my Norelco Shaver. Response time was excellent and the price was good. Also I had trouble finding the item locally. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These  replacement blades has given my Norelco new life!  My shave his so much faster and smoother.  This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Flex heads are super &amp; give a close shave !</li>
            <li> The razor is excellent and the replacement heads and cutters do just as well as the original. Head and cutter replacement is very simple. Price, through Amazon, was outstanding, and less than other razors I observed. The order was filled in minimal time.</li>
            <li> The Replacement Heads for the Philips Norelco shaver came in a very timely manner and were packed so well not even the the box they came in was dented.  We are real pleased with the service and they do work well.</li>
            <li> I know you could purchase this product new for just a few more dollars, BUT we&#x27;ve saved the environment from one more electric razor being thrown away.  Update your razor heads yearly.  It makes a HUGE difference with the end result........so says the wife :).</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you know what&#x27;ll happen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you are, shaving for that special evening out when you realize your face isn&#x27;t getting any smoother.  No matter how many passes you make with your Norelco Reflex Plus shaver, you just can&#x27;t seem to get that clean, close shave you remember from when it was new (when was that?  June, 2003? 2002!?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too late now.  No time to throw on a T-shirt, tear out of the garage to the nearest T**get, W*l-M**t or R*te-A*d and hope and pray they have a pack of Norelco HQ55+ heads in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, Amazon.com is going to pay for Super Saver shipping anyway, so there goes one excuse.  Norelco knows some guys keep a backup set of heads in the bathroom, so they seal the package against humidity.  Even if your shaver is brand new, why not order the new heads right now?  When they arrive, jot the replacement date on the back of the package with an indelible marker and toss it into the bathroom drawer, next to the replacement heads for your electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s OK, you can thank me later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> What  a huge mistake!! Talked to a representative at Philips Norelco because I could not find a part for the model I had. After they advised me as to what part I needed and gave me the model number I needed, I ordered it from Amazon. Well, it doesn&#x27;t even come close to fitting. Needless to say it was a wasted $25. I went out and bought a Braun Electric Razor which I know is better.</li>
            <li> These go for a lot more in the Store. No Tax and Free Shipping always helps</li>
            <li> I received the norelco replacement head and am very happy with it. This was easy to order, came in a timely fashion and the price was the best one around, I checked.                        Thanks, Joanne F. Welch</li>
            <li> It is a good replacement shaver head and gives  a close shave without pulling hair</li>
            <li> I bought the shaver and replacement heads along with the shaver. We haven&#x27;t used the replacement heads yet and don&#x27;t expect to for some time but the shaver is good for the price. My husband has bought more expensive ones and has not been satisfied with their performance so we went ahead and tried this low cost shaver. My husband says the heads don&#x27;t seem to rotate fast enough but it does an OK job for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband because he loves his Norelco razor and after purchasing another brand, that he didn&#x27;t like, we bought the replacement blades. Best purchase we made!! The blades are great!! Very sharp and do a better job than the new razor we bought!!</li>
            <li> Just what the Dr. ordered</li>
            <li> I replace the blade assembly every 18 months(appx.) It is amazing every time I change them-I can shave in at least 1/2 the time and the cut is much smoother.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 shaver heads from Amazon. I immediately put both shaver heads into use in my 2 shavers.  My shave quality improved right away.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, but be warned that this is just the three razor discs, not the full plastic head assembly. If your head is broken or lost you&#x27;ll probably need to call the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HQ 56 shaving heads from Amazon&#x27;s source turned out to be a replacement for the (discontinued) HQ 55 heads I had ordered, and I have found them to be exactly what I needed. They were at a reasonable price, and delivered quickly and at a bargain shipping price, and they perform as expected.</li>
            <li> The blades restored my Norelco razer&#x27;s performance to such as it was when it was new.  The blades do their job as they should</li>
            <li> I initially called a local store and asked a clerk to confirm if they had this product in stock.  After about 15 mins on the phone, the clerk finally confirmed they only had (1) item available and could only hold it behind the counter until end of business that same day.  Since I was unable to drive to the store right away, I ordered a set of replacement heads for my electric shaver through Amazon.  They arrived within a few business days and were exactly the right model # I had requested.  Online orders can be a real time-saver when you are looking for a specific part which will only work w/ a particular model.</li>
            <li> This is better than buying a new razor,it&#x27;s cheaper and you will feel  like you have a new razor.</li>
            <li> New head after several years helped since it was starting to take a long time to shave.  There is an orange box HQ55 at Amazon. Other sites had a blue box specifically for HQ55 Plus for more $$. I called Norelco and they said there is no difference between the two products. Not 5 star review since two of them at $24 cost more than a new razor at $40 to $50.</li>
            <li> Replacement cutter heads for an excellent electric razor. I have had this razor for several years and it gives a great shave. Cutter heads need replacement every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery of product and performance I expected from replacement heads for my Norelco shaver replacement heads.</li>
            <li> My old blades were dull, and I was about to buy a whole new razor before I thought of getting replacements. I am very happy I bought these, a great little investment, it feels like a whole new razor again. It was very easy to click into place, the longest part was researching which model heads to get that fit my razor :)</li>
            <li> The product was shipped within the dates promised and arrived on time.  It was in the factory packaging.  I find it to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was getting a little shaggy, in need of a shave.  My Norelco electric razor was in good working order, but the blades were dull and refused to cut any more.  Believe it or don&#x27;t, I couldn&#x27;t find replacement blades anywhere in this rinky-dink city, so that&#x27;s when I went to Amazon. They had all the replacements, including mine, so I ordered.  And while I was at it, I ordered replacement blades for my old antique Schick injector razors, which had provided me with many a good shave in the past. So now, thanks to the diversity of Amazon.com, I am a clean-shaven man!</li>
            <li> This is a return order for blades and I&#x27;ve noticed that the longevity of them is considerably less than those that came with the razor. I don&#x27;t seem to have an option other than purchasing a competitive brand. The blades are not inexpensive and my expendeture, so far, is greater than I would pay for a newer model.  Otherwise I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco was not shaving well. I went out and bought a new razor (Remington). I was not happy with the results. I came back and ordered replacement blades, and now my Norelco is like new. I&#x27;m very happy with these new OEM blades, and wish I had not wasted the money on the other razor.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t remember how smooth this razor shaved until I replaced the heads!&lt;br /&gt;what a difference they made&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li> I lost faith in Norelco after I bought my last shaver. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 30 years. This is the first one that didn&#x27;t give a good shave. I had to keep going over the same area. I was ready to buy a new shaver (not Norelco) and then I saw these replacement heads. Sadly they cost more than I paid for the shaver. Since I felt guilty throwing away a shaver that was still working I decided to give these blades a try. Big improvement. It&#x27;s like having a new shaver. Just looking at the blades you can see that they are of much higher quality than the ones that came with the new shaver. Once again I am happy but I&#x27;d like to know why Norelco sells shavers with the cheap heads. They only make the company look bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, even though it did not specifically indicate that it was for my razor - which called out for HQ 55 PLUS replacement heads.  Apparently they are the same as the HQ 55 replacement heads.  I am very happy with my shaving routine now with the new heads.</li>
            <li> They have been replaced by the HQ 56 , 55&#x27;s not made any more</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the replacement blades, because the instructions for my razor said \\&quot; Use HQ55+ blades only\\&quot; and the only blades I could find were HQ55. I checked the local stores and they did not have the HQ55+ blades.  The clerk said that he thought that the HQ55 must be good, he never had seen any HQ55+ blades.  The HQ55 blades fit my razor perfectly, and give me a nice clean shave every time, and I saved $10 because I bought them online.  Very Pleased !!</li>
            <li> These blades suck! I went through two sets of these blades within a year because the screen and the blades got jammed and started to rip away at the screen. I would clean the blades on a regular basis. I feel this is a cheaply made product that is not worth the money. The blades (HQ4+) that this model replaced worked a whole lot better and were reliable and never broke like the HQ55. Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were exactly as described and fit perfectly. The shipping container could have been a little more protective than just a plain brown envelope, but the heads were not damaged and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> received right away. fit good and have had to trouble with it. the price was better than buying it at the stores.</li>
            <li> Replaced the heads that I needed for my shaver.....</li>
            <li> I bought my first Norelco electric razor way back in the 80&#x27;s.  I STILL have it.  I decided to put that to rest and buy a Norelco with floating heads and it is even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads at local stores are expensive.  Fortunately, I was able to purchase mine at 50% off.  Great company, quick service.</li>
            <li> norelco hq55plus came to my house within the time span i was promised and also was cheaper than if i would have gone to the store for it!</li>
            <li> Factory replacement heads.  What could go wrong?  New heads: $30.  New shaver: $90.  Do the math.  You can get two + years out of the heads if you clean and oil them regularly.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are very easy to change.  They work  just as good as the original heads.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades for my shaver are becoming harder to find. This web site made it easy to find the correct replacement part and order same.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find these on Amazon- for some reason Norelco has a number of different replacement blades for their electric shavers and they&#x27;re not easy to find.  What an asset Amazon is, especially at a time when gas prices are so high!!!!</li>
            <li> My boss doesn&#x27;t have an Amazon account, and since we&#x27;re good friends, sometimes I order things for him and he pays me back.  His razor hadn&#x27;t had new blades in a couple of years or longer, so when he couldn&#x27;t find them in a store, I found them on Amazone for him.  He says they are great; it&#x27;s like having a new razor.  He says it shaves much closer and much faster.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads that I ordered.  What was substituted was Norelco HQ 56 heads, claiming they will fit my particular Norelco razor. I installed the HQ 56 heads and found them to be not at all much better than my existing worn 3 Year HQ 55 heads that needed to be replaced.  I did not receive the advertized product and was not advised that I would receive  a substitute.  I feel that I was deceived by the seller.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit well and make a big difference in the razor performance. They are competitively priced and they shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> They work great. I&#x27;ve had the razor for 10+ years, and its great to replace just the heads every 1-2 years instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads made my shaver good asnew at a considerable savings. Installation is really simple.</li>
            <li> Product was priced right and has worked effectively to give me a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> I got just what I needed,and just what I ordered,as easy as falling off a log.I&#x27;m 74 years young and I did it from my own home.Thanks to Amazon.com.It was quick and easy.                        Jamie Sutherlin</li>
            <li> The Norelco razor replacement heads are very easy to install, work perfectly and give an electric shave unrivaled since I first purchased the Norelco razor about 5 years ago. One word: smooth.</li>
            <li> My last set lasted six years before the metal in the heads got so thin that holes started developing. The cutting blades remained sharp.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, it was like getting a whole new electric razor at half the cost.  I get a smooth shave once again.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to find replacement heads Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase in three days and the item was the exact replacement I was looking for.  I would order again if needed.</li>
            <li> I went with 3 stars for neutral because I ordered what I thought was razor heads compatible with my razor, but they weren&#x27;t. So far the return process has been easy though.</li>
            <li> I have had my 6834XL Norelco corded/cordless shaver for many years, but I had never replaced the blades. I noticed recently that I was no longer getting a very close shave, so I looked up the correct replacement blades on the Internet, and ordered them. Once I received the replacement blades and started using them, the difference was amazing! I am able to get as close a shave now as with a razor, and I am very happy that I have the new blades. I am also very pleased with the quality of the shaver overall, and how long it has lasted (at least for 5 years now).</li>
            <li> I tried these replacement blades in my new razor.  They seem to be identical to those that came with the razor, which means they&#x27;re excellent.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old cutting heads and have much smoother shave now!  I should have replaced them at the recommended frequency!</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips electric razors for a number of years now and as long as I can continue to get the shaving heads, everything will be fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco for ten years. I couldn&#x27;t  find replacement heads at Walmart so I bought a Braun  shaver but I don&#x27;t like it, so I&#x27;m returning it tomorrow.[[ASIN:B00009RB1C Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex  Replacement Heads]]</li>
            <li> Product works fine. And the price is right.  Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Received the item in record time, and in good condition. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Saved money buying replacement heads (as opposed to buying a whole new razor!) and didn&#x27;t have to go from store to store to find them - Good deal!</li>
            <li> I find that these heads and cutters have the same problem as most Norelco blades they do not cut all that well. Other shavers such as Braun do a better job.</li>
            <li> product arrived in a timly manor, good construction, enjoying close shaves. &lt;br /&gt;robert schulkers</li>
            <li> Good price.  Quick shipment.  Good documentation (instructions).  I had gone over a year without replacing the heads.  Now, I will schedule to replace @ 11 months.  Made my razor just like new.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and work well.  Far less expensive than replacing the razor every year!  VERY easy to change the blades.</li>
            <li> This is our second purchase and have had no problems.  Very happy with Service.</li>
            <li> It was much easier buying the replacement heads online than having to troop from one store to the next looking for them.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised but delivery was extremely slow. Took almost 3 weeks to get to me. Unacceptable and I probably wont order from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> The time had come for me to replace the blades in my Norelco electric razor. I went to 2 local Wal-Marts where I previously bought them but they did not have any. One quick trip on the Internet and Amazon.com and they were on their way and I got them in 3 days. Great service by both Norelco and Amazon.com</li>
            <li> It was a perfect fit and it was delivered at the time specified.  I recommend this to anyone looking for replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement heads for a well used razor that I have had for many years. I will use this site again in a year when needed.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say. Norelco has always made a fine product. The seller got me the replacement blades on time to send to my father, who is in a constant care home. The employees poppped the replacements in with ease and were back to shaving my father with a fresh set of blades.</li>
            <li> The blades work fine  Its just absolutely incredible how expensive replacement blades are! In two years the blades cost as much as the electric razor does.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The job my razor did certainly improved once I replaced the heads.  The directions on replacing the heads was clear and concise;  getting the package open was another issue, and the plastic was very tough, and you did not want to risk damaging anything.  It was very clear that one replaces all three heads, and that job was very easy.    My Norelco razor has the model number on it, and the replacement heads are also specified by number, so if you lost the manual, you are not out of luck.</li>
            <li> Nice at first, but within a month I was having trouble with razor burn on my neck and all sorts of missed hair; worse than my original heads. Tolerated for 3 months, then bought a foil shaver, which always worked well for my beard in the past.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> I needed blades for 2 different razors and both sets came quickly and were the right ones. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blades after a little bit of trouble finding them on their web site. Received them in a timely fashion, Installed and blades word just great.    Dennis</li>
            <li> I first purchased my Norelco Razor in 1988. I have used Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads for the razor two times. The Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads fits my razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Clean close shave. They work and my Norelco razor perfectly and only took a few minutes to swap out the old with the new ones.</li>
            <li> I can usually use replacement heads for 2 years before replacing.  I bought these 5 months ago and they are in worse condition than the 2 year old heads they replaced.  They are terrible.  They don&#x27;t cut at all.  There is no way these were new when I received them!</li>
            <li> The product works fine.  The life of the heads is not very good - about 1 year and the expense is too high.</li>
            <li> I received the replacement blades quickly and they were as described.  Met my needs of new blades for the Norelco shaver I had.  Nothing but good things overall for this transaction.</li>
            <li> Bought these heads for their exorbitant price and they were dull from the moment I installed them in the shaver.  They deteriorated rapidly from that point on and were useless in about 2 months, basically hacking off my whiskers and not cutting them.  I&#x27;ll bet that Norelco outsourced manufacturing of the cutters to China and they botched the process transfer.  I switched to a Remington foil shaver model F4790 and am getting vastly superior results --- and replacement heads and cutters are about 1/2 Norelco&#x27;s outrageous price.</li>
            <li> Arrived within 5 days.  Now my razor cuts like when I got it new 7 years ago. Now if the batteries will hold out.  .</li>
            <li> order 55 sent 56 said they were replacement did not work well once you open packaging you can not send back, can not see blades till you open package never buy again</li>
            <li> Face it - if you buy a Norelco shaver you are going to replace the heads. I should say you will need to replace the heads at least every two years. More if you shave twice a day. These are genuine Norelco heads and replacing them is as easy as cleaning the old ones and they work better the first time you use them. This is the second time I have bought heads from Amazon.com and I will continue so in the future as you can&#x27;t beat the price. Now that they own Drugstore.com they will probably come from them.</li>
            <li> In getting new blades every 6 months was the best thing to happens, keeps the razor sharp amd it keeps my shave close.  Thanks you Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many many years.  Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads on my shaver with these and it works better now than it did when it was brand new.  I get a much closer shave now.</li>
            <li> My husband had stopped using his Norelco Reflux Plus shaver because it just wasn&#x27;t doing the job.  With these replacement shaver heads, it&#x27;s just like new again.</li>
            <li> I have had my razors for quite a long time, and decided that they needed new heads.  They cut the beard much better.  I do believe you should compare the cost, and also if you should buy a new razor.  I decided since the razors are doing a fine job, I would just get the new heads.  Hope it was the right thing to do.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads arrived quickly.  My razor shaves like it was brand new!  Every morning I look forward to a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> I should have replaced the razor heads long before this.  These new ones were easy to install and the difference is great.</li>
            <li> These blades made my electric razor shave like a new razor.  I was happy with the electric razor and now it shaves like new without having to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Time to upgrade your razor?  Nope, just get a set of new shaving heads and you can save some money.  These new heads give  you a close shave.  Although, if your razor is really old, you MIGHT need to upgrade/replace the battery, if it is a cordless/battery shaver.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to mention that my shaver is \\&quot;6844 XL\\&quot; and these heads fit.  The description says 6843, which must be a very slightly different model of shaver.</li>
            <li> I ordered the HQ55 blades in this ad.  What I received was the \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; HQ56 blades instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted the HQ55 specifically because they work in my old razor.  I tried the HQ56 replacement blades in the past and they cut and burned my face.  In fact, with the HQ56 blades I tried, the entire face screening piece of the blades rotated against my face, not just the cutters inside the screen.  OUCH!  That experience is why I specifically ordered these HQ55 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care what Norelco says, the HQ56 does not work the same in my older shaver as the HQ55 blades.  Granted, my shaver is an old one, but when I specifically order HQ55&#x27;s I want the HQ55&#x27;s and not the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot; HQ56 blades -- which are supposed to retrofit, but in my case definitely do not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning the HQ56 blades and am writing this review so hopefully the seller will update  their ad from HQ55&#x27;s to HQ56&#x27;s so this does not happen to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ad needs to be changed and my purchase money and both-ways shipping need to be refunded.</li>
            <li> They discontinued this and sent me another replacement head that was compatible with my old shaver.  I wish that I had known ahead of time.</li>
            <li> These Norelco replacement shaver heads made two older units perform like new. In these \\&quot;greening of America\\&quot; days, it&#x27;s good to extend the useful life of electronic devices instead of putting them in the landfill, &amp; buying new foreign products.</li>
            <li> I first ordered this product in Oct 2008, along with a apply for a credit  card that would give me $30 reduction on my next order.. The product was  never sent to me and also I was told my credit card had been canceled,  So  I reordered the same product in JAN 2009.  It was shipped out in very little time and placed on the credit card they told me they had canceled.  I never mentioned anything about my $30 bonus so I never had a chance to  apply it to the next order which I still have on hold. Now I wonder why  you offer a $30 deduction on the next order if you never really meant it.  If this falls into the right hands,,,I would like to use the $30 deduction  for another Philips Norelco HQ55 Reflex Replacement Head..  The first one  works like a dream...Order No.  24692169025000326483812 I think this is  the order number...On the first order of this product last year..P &amp; H   were also waived..Now if this still hold water..ship me another one.    Dean Parpart</li>
            <li> It was a gift to my mother who is a Buddhist nun.  She said that the replacement heads worked perfect on the shaver.</li>
            <li> I have an eleven year old Norelco shaver and the thing just won&#x27;t die! Popped these in easily and hope to get many more years use...</li>
            <li> The blades inside the small covers were fine, but I had to use the original covers on the shaver because the covers I received were bent up and would not allow the blades to turn.</li>
            <li> Great product, seller not so much.</li>
            <li> After using the razor for many years, the new blades made it as good as new.</li>
            <li> this replacement makes using the shaver cost $2 a month. it&#x27;s half the price of the shaver! but it does make the shaver feel like brand new again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stay sharp too long, but I guess that&#x27;s he  nature of them.</li>
            <li> Saved a few dollars over the local discount store prices. Was exactly the right set.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement heads for my husbands \\&quot;Norelco- Reflex Plus \\&quot;6615X\\&quot; electric razor. It&#x27;s an older razor that works great still. The heads that I bought (HQ 55) were perfect and simple to replace in the razor. Since this razor is an older model, I went to the Norelco websit and looked up its compatible razor heads and they were right. 2 Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> My order was sent to the wrong address and therefor it was cancelled and I hope to order again soon.  I need to be sure that the credit for the first order was made.  I still want the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> The product is just a replacement for the cutting edges of the electric shaver.  It is easy to remove the old and put on the replacement.  The replacement works fine.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase these replacement heads directly from the Philips Employee Online Store.  Every year I think that I could buy a new cordless razor every two years rather than spend $32 on replacements heads annually.  I equate this to the self-propelled lawn mower syndrome: I could buy a new mower every two years for what it costs for two years of annual service and mulching blade sharpening.  Anyway, I always give my razor a good cleaning when replacing the heads.  Some years I notice a closer shave for a while; this year I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> they would not fit razor sent ,return them  nov 24 2014</li>
            <li> We asked for Norelco HQ-55, and the company sent us HQ-56 and said it ws adaptable, it definetely is not and we are returning said item.</li>
            <li> I ordered HQ 55&#x27;s but was sent HQ56&#x27;s which are still compatible with my Phillips Norelco electric shaver. Ahhh, it&#x27;s nice to have my shaver working at peak performance again. I&#x27;ve been using Philips Norelco Triple Header Shavers with HQ55 or HQ56 blades for more than fifteen years and I swear by them. I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They provide a convenient tool for a close comfortable shave without irritating my skin. Sure it took some getting used too some twenty years ago but now that I&#x27;ve enjoyed the best it&#x27;s all there is.</li>
            <li> worked great. husband got a very close shave.</li>
            <li> This is not my 1st time ordering these shaver heads. The price is great and they are shipped on time. They fit my old shaver and cut great. And yes I will order from this company again seeing I shave a lot and wear them out. Lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them I few times. I bought them because my razor needed HQ55 heads. It doesn&#x27;t seem like they fix snug enough. It may get me by though. Price seemed pretty high as well.</li>
            <li> They fit the Norelco shaver and work good as new&lt;br /&gt;Rotating cutters are the only type that cuts whiskers that are laying down.</li>
            <li> makes my shave a lot better thanks</li>
            <li> Great product! Shaves as it should. It has met our expectations and we look forward to it lasting us a long time. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco customer for over 27 years and I have never had a set of cutters dull so quickly.  In my opinion the quality is down</li>
            <li> The heads are not as good as what you get with the new shaver. Expensive for the quality that you get</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, it came on a different  package as shown on the picture, but the heads fit&#x27;s on HG55, so I didnt have any trouble.</li>
            <li> Very nice close shave. Better performance than  some of the Norelco&#x60;s that I have had in the past. I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;it to anyone that asked.</li>
            <li> This product fit my husband&#x27;s Norelco razor that he has had for many years.  He is happy to have replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Worked great. It says a different number on the package, but it works. I think Phillips wants you to upgrade instead of continuing to change blades, so they change the numbers.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads were not as advertised . They turned out to be HQ56  which does not fit in a Norelco model 6613X shaver even though it was stated that they were the replacement . please look into this matter as others have commented about the same problem .</li>
            <li> No gripes concerning the new cutter heads and am quite satisfied with the performance of the new heads. It is nice to get such a clean cut after using the original parts which have been in use for MANY years. I can&#x27;t remember what year my old shaver was puchased and the cutter blades were badly worn giving very poor performance. Shaving is much better now.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads can be so expensive in stores.&lt;br /&gt;These came very quickly with a great price&lt;br /&gt;and my husband loves having a sharp razor again&lt;br /&gt;with a clean shave.  We plan to order them again&lt;br /&gt;hopefully from the same  company.  They came&lt;br /&gt;very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better to buy a pack of replacement heads than spending $$$ on a new electric razor.  The blades \\&quot;rejuvenate\\&quot; the razor to its original quality.   It&#x27;s good to replace them after a year.  I start to notice a difference when the end of the lifespan of the blades approaches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I bought a new razor, at a fraction of the price.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> The head is very good, but after I bought it I found the complete razor on sale at Longs Drug Store for less money than just buying the head  The head is over priced</li>
            <li> I have been using the Norelco Reflex Plus electric razor for 7 years now. With the new models that Norelco has introduced, the retail stores (Walmart, Target, etc.) have discontinued carrying the replacement razors for the Reflex Plus in favor of those for the newer brands. Therefore I got it from Amazon. It worked as well as the first time which is to say very well. This is a reliable no-fuss product and I am happy enough to continue using it for a long long time. I also do not see any need to switch to the newer models - the features that Norelco touts are marketing gimmicks as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost if you have been using your current head for a year. The new blades give a much better shave. Cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; blades are worse than the lones from a razor I have not used for at least a year. I put the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; blades back on the razor and will use it occasionally.  Unfortunately, I accidentally ordered three sets of blades.  They are all going back, with a demand for full refund on shoddy material .</li>
            <li> We received exactly what we ordered within 3-5 days and it fit into the shaver just perfect.! No problems, completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> They are what was needed, at the right price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about new heads making my razor as good as new. Installed the heads and much to my pleasant surprise the razor worked as well as the day I received it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I ordered Norelco HQ 55 Replacement heads for my model 6863 XL. I received the HQ 56 instead. The box says they are a replacement for the HQ55, but they don&#x27;t fit correctly. How do I return them and get HQ 55 heads instead?</li>
            <li> This is not directed to any sellers. The high price of these replacement blades make me go buy the entire shaver at Walmart for $29!!! It costs less to burn a gallon of gas and buy a completely new shaver. I get about 2 years out of the blades before it takes 10 minutes to get a clean shave. New blades is 3 minutes. I clean the shaving head often and spray Norelco HQ110. It&#x27;s a cleaner/lubricant that may extend the life the cutters.</li>
            <li> I was sent a direct replacement, which is a newer model (HQ-56).  Now my razor works like new..!!  I will most certainly purchace these again..!!</li>
            <li> Was looking online for a replacement since they did not sell the HQ4 instores anymore.  Found this it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re blades.  They fit into the razor.  They cut hairs and not skin.  What more could one ask for?  On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this particular shaver again.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly and in good shape. They are compatible with the HQ55+ heads that might razor required. So that was a non-issue.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, you just have to replace the head on your electric razor.  This product is a good value.</li>
            <li> This item was just what I needed.  Perfect turnaround time.  No problems with the order.  Will need more in future.</li>
            <li> Product came quick enough, fits my razor and makes my razor work just like it did when it was new.  What more could any one ask for?</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. My face is smooth and clean shaven again. Thought that it would never be that way again.</li>
            <li> Razor works like new. Close shave and easy to install. My 90 year old father did it himself, no problem.</li>
            <li> Really was surprised at how important a periodic change of blades for an electric razor was. I bought this lower end to use while on coumadin, but must admit it gives a pretty darn good shave in less the time and hassle with foam and Mach 3 razors. I don&#x27;t know what 12 Mach 3 blades each year cost, but I think this $25 electric razor blade annual purchase beats the cost and the time spent shaving.</li>
            <li> Great item.  Works just like brand new razor.  VERY easy to install.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was a very worth while purchase. My Norelco Shaver was not cutting properly and by replacing the shaver head it works as good as new.</li>
            <li> It is just what I ordered.  Worked as expected.  Will order again when I have the need.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered these a LONG time ago, I had no idea what I was missing! It takes me HALF the amount of time to shave, and my Norelco Shaver is like NEW again!</li>
            <li> I shopped all the local discount stores before I checked out Amazon.  Amazon had the best price of all and I got lucky it was a free shipping item!!!!</li>
            <li> Good price for these blades. 5 stars for them.  However, Amazon shipped this item measuring 4\\&quot;x5\\&quot;x1\\&quot; in a box measuring 10\\&quot;x7\\&quot;x3\\&quot;.  1 star for Amazon on this. I found this really unnecessary. Shame on you Amazon.</li>
            <li> You made it easy to order my blades online and it came in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> This marks the third time for me to buy replacement heads. My 7+ years old Norelco shaver is still spinning.</li>
            <li> My shaver is over 19 years old, and the replacement blades fit and work fine.  Glad they&#x27;re still available.  Makes the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li> they are as pictured and work fine</li>
            <li> I was going to order these for my Norelco 6940 but decided to give the heads another cleaning first.  This time instead of the usual thorough brushing out I gave them a closer look and more thorough intense cleaning.  What I found is often towel threads and fluff get stuck and wound up in the heads blade center, pushing it away from your face until almost no blades are doing any work.  So I did a careful but serious cleaning of the heads and the plastic device that holds them in and tada! The shaver works like new again!  I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product but to save yourself some money try a good cleaning first.  These blades should last quite a long time!  I would say much longer than a year. lol</li>
            <li> It works great and fit his razor, we will continue to order the replacement heads from you as long as razor continues to work!!!</li>
            <li> nice and sharp, a perfect fit for the old shaver.  very satisfied.  The do the job to replace dull heads.</li>
            <li> my grandfather asked me to find replacement heads for his 25 year old shaver! and I know I could do it on amazon hahaha - they fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> Does not provide close shave</li>
            <li> These heads were easy to install and work great  for Dad. He thinks he has a new shaver and is thrilled with them.</li>
            <li> The old shaver has a new lease on life. It is good for many more years of use. I changed the battery as well.</li>
            <li> My husband,s shaver needed to be replaced.  Bought him a new one.. Fancier.. But it did not shave well.  He always missed spots.  It was returned and decided to order new heads.  It worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efficiently sent.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!! Everything is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have known prior to purchasing these that the HQ56 blades replaced these in stores-my fault. The blades are great as always! We only buy Norelco :)</li>
            <li> This is an easy repair to do, and gives great results.  My beard is once again easy to clean and stays smoother with the new blades.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Fits the electric shaver well and works well. Would buy these again when it is time to replace.</li>
            <li> I would order from this seller again.  Service was great, as stated, securely wrapped and recieved sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco products for many years and found them to be of good quality. These replacement heads are very good. Having moved back from the U.K. where I purchased my last shaver the U.S. website did not make finding the proper model number easy but I finally got there. Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> These heads work as they should. Only complaint is that the razor heads aren&#x27;t as close-shaving as the commercials portray. A couple more passes over the same spot does result in a shave as the commercials claim.</li>
            <li> New blades are certainly an improvement over year-old blades; and much cheaper than replacing the entire shaver. They were easy and quick to install.</li>
            <li> Not really being able to afford $35-$40 for the blades, I went on this site and it was less than half the price.......and you know what....they are just like when I pay retail at a store or from Norelco.......love the product, will return again!</li>
            <li> Great.. works for me..I usually get a lot out of these anyway..one can last me a couple of years..great buy..A+</li>
            <li> Husband thought he would have to buy a whole new electric razor, I suggested we try replacing the heads, they work great!</li>
            <li> These are a good replacement when you need to replace the shaving head.  Be aware it is only the round discs, so keep your snap on holder.</li>
            <li> My shaver said it to use &amp;#34;HQ55+&amp;#34; and I bought these and they fit perfectly and work great! ! !</li>
            <li> Just the right replacement.</li>
            <li> This is easy to install and the razor shaves as good as new. I think this is the third replacement head I&#x27;ve gotten for this razor and the best price</li>
            <li> The replacement hq56 for hq55 doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as the original hq55 - put my old blades back into razor!!!</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly. Meets typical Norelco quality.</li>
            <li> Fits my Norelco perfectly. My razor is now restored to brand new blade sharpness. These last at least a year and fit a lot of different razors. Make sure this fits your razor before you purchase it. The Norelco (Phillips) website provides the information you need. If you razor is older you can also buy replacement batteries on Amazon that restore the ability to hold a charge for a week or more.</li>
            <li> Great to have sharp new Blades.  No more long shaves to clean up the face! I should do this more often.</li>
            <li> Glad I found a source of replacement blades for my old razor.</li>
            <li> Very good product, cuts great.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Good quality. And for people who need it, I recommend it 100%. In addition, this a good price.</li>
            <li> My husband was thrilled with the Norelco replacement heads.  We cannot purchase them at our local bigbox store anymore, and he&#x27;s been using these replacement heads for years, so we were thrilled when we found them online.  An extra bonus:  even with cost of shipping, these are cheaper here than they were when purchased locally!!</li>
            <li> Norelco works great and with new heads greater. great Product and easy to change heads. I have been using Norelco for 40 years.</li>
            <li> good replacement, thanks</li>
            <li> My dad was so pleased to be able to find the replacement head to his razor.  It was a perfect fit and has worked very well since using the replacement.  He would highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Good product, excelent</li>
            <li> Product came in on time and met my needs.</li>
            <li> Works like they were suspose to.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> ordered hq 55 as pictured and came hq 56. boy can;t trust anybody any more just will buy offline at walmart or so.</li>
            <li> I had been investigating the puchase of a new razor since the heads on my current one were no longer sharp enough to do the job.  This was a wonderful &amp; economical solution and works just fine.  Am so glad I saw these.</li>
            <li> all very good products</li>
            <li> Made a brand new razor.  Easy to install.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how long it&#x27;s been since I bought my razor but I could tell it wasn&#x27;t easy to shave anymore.  I almost considered getting a new razon but decided to try the replacement heads.  I think they are overpriced, but they do what they are supposed to do, so I&#x27;m not complaining about performance.</li>
            <li> works good, my old one was making a lot of noise and wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job.  the new one works fine.</li>
            <li> These Norelco Heads do exactly what they were purchased for, shaving with a close blade.  If you are in the need for replacing your electric shaver heads and this product works great for the Norelco shaver.  Check you model number to ensure you get the right blades.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work as well as originals. Even after break in, I don&#x27;t get as close a shave as I got before.</li>
            <li> Everything was fast and easy!!</li>
            <li> Just what my hubby needed.  Couldn&#x27;t even find the right one at Walmart - and they were more expensive.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s been using this product that he purchased for well over&#x27;s 5 months now. He replaced them with the old ones and his electric razor is working fabulously. We would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, fast delivery, fits perfect, gives me a great shave. i would order again and I would reccomend to my friends</li>
            <li> made my old razor liike new...&lt;br /&gt;getting a close shave again, just like the old days&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t know if they were available any longer</li>
            <li> Working perfectly for replacing old heads on fathers shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s electric razor is still running nicely and somehow the quality is not always there when it&#x27;s time to replace something.  So rather than buy a new razor, we just bought the heads which are not cheap, but are cheaper than a new razor.  They say to replace these blades yearly, but we can usually stretch that out longer than a year.  The quality of these replacements is  no different than a new razor.  Will continue to replace these heads until the razor dies.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and make razor cut like new razor but at less cost.  Got a newer model head that replaced what was noted on my razor.</li>
            <li> They seem to work well my father uses them and doesn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads provide a like new close shave. Amazon pricing was the best!</li>
            <li> well satisfied. thanks for asking.&lt;br /&gt;mee</li>
            <li> I looked for these locally and couldn&#x27;t find them. These worked great and were easy to install. Kind of pricey for what they are but it beats buying a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> They fit, and they work.  Shipped really fast!</li>
            <li> exactly what was offered.price was very fair</li>
            <li> was a pleasure to use</li>
            <li> Ok product the blades were not sharp. It burns after the shave and caused bleeding.</li>
            <li> All good, as advertised.</li>
            <li> The item was received quickly.  We have purchased this item in the past and the shaver heads, as my husband says, are really giving him a better shave.  He really likes the Philips Norelco shaver.  The heads are easily replaced.  Not difficult at all.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are actually HQ56 heads which now replace HQ-55-1 heads. They fit and worked just fine with no issues or problems to report.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding the right replacement.  This was perfect for replacement head for my electric razor.  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> this was a great product because we could not find this product around our town anywhere this was a good product for the excellent price</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for those of us who hate nicks &amp; cuts. Cheaper than Meijers.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were very dull,like they have been used before.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I could find replacement heads for my husb</li>
            <li> The product is precisely what I needed; service was what I hoped for; experience is far better than having to go to W-M or some other store. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The razor is awesome. I replaced the blades with this replacement set, and it works fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com&#x27;s packaging was tremendously wasteful. It was mailed in a 12\\&quot;x9\\&quot;x4\\&quot; box, and the postage was quite high. The product itself was the size of an index card and could have been sent in a CD mailer or a \\&quot;letter\\&quot;-sized package. I understand that for efficiency they reduce the number of packaging options, but this seems a little excessive. If you bought one CD, would it come in a foot-long box?</li>
            <li> I repleced the original cutters and the razor now cuts better than when I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but if your man has tough beards, doesn&#x27;t work as well. Yes I would still recommend it ..</li>
            <li> This was the only place I could find these blades.  The price was good and the turnaround time was excellent.</li>
            <li> just follow the instruction on the back of the package and don&#x27;t mess around with the blade. remember put the blade each same with the place, and its good to go</li>
            <li> Changing heads on rotary shavers is necessary about once a year depending on use, but especially if they are used every day. It used to be you could buy a new shaver for a little more than new heads, but no more. Installing the new heads is incredibly simple with one twist of the center retainer. I highly recommend these heads. Replaceing heads just makes good economical sense.</li>
            <li> Hubby has replaced the heads on his Norelco a number of times and it works like brand new!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, and item is exactly as expected.  Can&#x27;t ask for more, can I?  Would definitely order again from the same company.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find replacement heads for a Norelco 4601X, purchased in 2000, and no longer made. For a while, it seemed as though I was out of luck finding replacement heads, and the last set I bought were wearing out, and not shaving very well. So, I was enthusiastic about the HQ 55 heads, based on descriptions of their superior lifting capabilities. In reality, while these heads do a good job (and way better than the old ones), I don&#x27;t feel they are quite as good as they are described. Bottom line, my aging shaver is still in service, and continues to provide a decent shave. (I still miss my corded 1967 Tripleheader, a Christmas present from Mom &amp; Dad, which provided a smooth shave for more than 30 years!)</li>
            <li> The Blades worked flawlessly. They even apprear to be sharper after (2) weeks of use. Prompt delivery by amazon as well. Thanks for a job well done.    Tom, in Virginia Beach.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the blades.  The fit my shaver perfectly.  This was a good value, and I won&#x27;t wait as long to replace the blades next time.</li>
            <li> I installed them and they worked.  They shave like they are supposed to.. the price was great and the ship time was good.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, new quality and performance from your existing shaver.</li>
            <li> sent them back...no better than the old ones.  bad product...will never buy norelco again.....</li>
            <li> All went very well with no problems what so ever.  I would shopt this site again.  Thanks for your help and service.</li>
            <li> I could not believe what a difference these new blades were, shaved me with no problems and no pulling out hairs any more!!</li>
            <li> It was really great. My dad needed it for his shaver, and it did the trick. My Dad loved it. Perfect Christmas present.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT  QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li> In expensive shaver and rated as good</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s a no-brainer and I&#x27;m glad they have them available so I won&#x27;t need to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> They were received quickly and they work a lot better than the old ones!  I would have liked them to be a pinch sharper if that is the right word to use.</li>
            <li> My husband has an older model electric shaver that he likes very much.  Unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t giving him a close shave any more.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to find the replacement heads.  Amazon came through with the product delivered very promptly!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find the replacement discs for this shaver in local stores as it is several years old. I was pleased to be able to find them and at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> What a difference new heads make!  I need to change them more often!  These seem to be hard to find in the stores.  I can save time and money by getting them here, even if I pay shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my razor since high school and finally decided I need some sharp blades.  I was going to replace the whole razor but read on the reviews that they don&#x27;t make these in the Netherlands any more and there not made as well.  Glad I read this and kept the motor, my new blades work great as does the old motor which is strong.  My brother has a new motor which isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> My other razor blades were getting dull, It is nice to have nice sharp razor blades for my electric razor.  I love norelco razors always had great shaves with them.</li>
            <li> These blades fit a razor I have used for decades.  The razor works great, so I do not want to replace it.</li>
            <li> Makes your old shaver feel brand new. There is no reason to buy a new shaver when the blades are right here.</li>
            <li> Product was satisfactory.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the razor that is why I purchased the replacement heads whoever the price is hard to swallow. I will not do it again.</li>
            <li> These replaced razor heads that were 2 years old.  It&#x27;s great that they are less expensive than in 2011.  They also perform nicely, once you have used them for a few days.  Great product and the seller was very quick to send my blades.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and was sent HZ56. The HZ56 is a much poorer performance compared to the HZ55. If you order this don&#x27;t expect to receive this. A friend of mine got the same results when he ordered.</li>
            <li> Replaced my blades in my razor with these and it is now like new. good product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the cutting heads only but they work great. If you need the floating head also that is another part</li>
            <li> These are Original Equipment Manufactures replacement cutting heads for my Philips Norelco electric razor. They fit perfect and worked perfect!</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking I was getting a whole new head, not just the blades.  However the blades turned out to be all I needed.  They shave really close with no irritation.</li>
            <li> New heads work and fit great! This is the second time to purchase replacement heads which extend the life of a good razor.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this replacement head.  I think they were better then the original ones.  Glad I bought replacement</li>
            <li> yes they fit my razorand and I would surely order again when it comes time to buy more of them</li>
            <li> This product is no longer made by Norelco.  They are replacing it with HQ56.  BEWARE!!!!  HQ56 replacement heads  are a little larger than HQ55. Therefore the newer replacement heads will not fit in older shaver models.  This product should not be offered for sale.  The seller should completely remove the picture and sales offer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father and he has not said anything against it. He started using it from the moment it got here and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco, the name speaks for itself. These blades last a long time if you clean them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and now shaves like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Made my razor run like new.  Have owned Norelco shavers for over 40 years.  (Have owned several in that time)  They are very durable.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement heads!!</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads were exactly the product that I wanted. I haven&#x27;t been able to find these heads anywhere. It&#x27;s an older shaver and no one carries the parts anymore. I was so delighted when I received my package with the replacement heads. And I was even more pleased because the package arrived much sooner that the date I was given.</li>
            <li> Good price, clean shave, no pain. My man was so happy after he replaced the heads on his shaver.  Was a good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> great replacement for worn out heads .now i can shave quickly without having to press hard on the razor.just what i ordered.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads (Purchased on September 4, 2012)were easy to install. The shave I get with these heads are far better than the original set that came with the electric shaver</li>
            <li> My old razor works like new.  I am very satisfied and recommend this replacement head to anyone seeking to make their old razor just like new.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the discount stores, will buy again.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and as described</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads on a 20 year old Norelco.  It works much better than the one I bought a year ago.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> did not fit my razor like it said it would</li>
            <li> Replacement for older Norelco heads. Much sharper, producing a smoother cut, and no rash. Has continued staying sharp, 6 months.</li>
            <li> I was looking for replacement shaver heads for my older Noreclo model 6613X electric shaver.  On the shaver it says to only use HQ55+ replacement heads.  This seller had the only HQ55+ heads on Amazon.  Do not buy the HQ55 or HQ55+ from this or any other seller.  Norelco no longer makes either.  Instead, this seller will send you HQ56 replacement heads, which works just as well but can be purchased for about $4 less directly from Amazon (plus no shipping if you are an Amazon Prime customer).  No where in the product description does the seller indicate this is actually an HQ56 rather than an HQ55, which is deceptive and will cost more for the same product.  The HQ56 heads are fine.  It is nice to have a nice close shave again, I only wish I did not feel as though I was taken advantage of by an unscrupulous advertiser.</li>
            <li> does not stay sharp over limited time of useage - am considering other than Phillips razor for next electric razor purchase</li>
            <li> Ordered the replacement razor heads and they arrived in a few days. They were easy to replace and work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original heads lasted 6 years, these cut really well now. Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent replacement for my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to improve the shaver back to new condition.&lt;br /&gt;Was very easy to replace old shaver heads.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver now works just like new.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy one of these replacements again</li>
            <li> It fit my HQ55+ that I bought many years ago and I like that with the new shaver head, I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting stuck on random hairs.</li>
            <li> Product gave a comfortable and close shave and would recommend to anybody. Easy to install and order was received promptly.</li>
            <li> these will work fine. Seems to be the best price on the Internet. Give them a try. Goodbye for now</li>
            <li> this is the only place that have them at a&lt;br /&gt;good price. will be buying them for an other&lt;br /&gt;razor i have.</li>
            <li> the product was new and the correct item for the razor i wanted it for.  Also the packaging was original.  Not some fit all..</li>
            <li> Not at all.  The heads don&#x27;t fit the razor.  Ended up buying  a new razor.</li>
            <li> Great product, reasonable price and good quality.  I will reorder again this product. It is certainly less expensive than having to buy a new Norelco razor.  I shall order again.</li>
            <li> I now can get a good shave again.  I am very happy with the blades.  I was temped to buy a new shaver.  I am glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> that´s affordable, works like expected, I hope it lasts until my next trip to USA, down here in Brazil it costs too much, more than the shaver itself</li>
            <li> I purchased a Norelco razor from E-bay.  I already had one and noticed the new one did not seem to work as well or shave as smoothly.  When I got the new replacement heads the problem was solved.  It was like having a brand new electric razor.</li>
            <li> The item I bought meet my expectations in regards to quality and delivery time</li>
            <li> These came in a different package than I am used to, so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if they were going to fit my razor (a 6843XL), but they did. Installation was a snap, and my morning shave is much faster and more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the box indicates these HQ 55 heads fit the following razor types: 34--, 36--, 38--, 44--, 46--, 48--, 66--, 69--, 5413, 5426, 5430, 5625, 5812, 5813, 5817, 5820, 5823, 5824, 6405, 6415, 6423, 6424, 6445, 6831, 6842, 6843, 6844, 6849, 6853, 6854, 6855, 6856, 6857, 6859, 6861, 6863, 6868, 6874, 6879. Why Norelco needs so many different models, I&#x27;ll never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, Amazon had the best price on these, and the free shipping made the deal even better. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I found what I needed. I ordered, it arrived. It works as expected. No problems.</li>
            <li> Item was priced lower than at my local drugstore, arrived promptly, was easy to install. The shaver works like new again! I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and will re-order when needed.</li>
            <li> I replace my Norelco Shaving Heads once a year and found the best price on Amazon.com and the shipping was free.  I shopped local stores that were priced a lot more than on Amazon.com.  I received the shipment a week before the estimated arrival date via the USPS.</li>
            <li> I always am amazed the difference with a new set of cutters in the shaver.  They made the beard go away faster and seemed to cut deeper.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads easily installed into my razor and made a huge difference in the quality and closeness of my shaves.</li>
            <li> This item says it is compatiable with razors using the HQ 55+ replacement heads but it is not; the item isn&#x27;t as it looks or is listed and the packaging could be be better. I ended up having to return the item to the seller and didn&#x27;t get the full credit back that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> There is some confusion about norelco part numbers.  They shipped an updated number instead of the one i ordered.  The only sour grapes was i notice they sell that part number cheaper than the one i specified.</li>
            <li> fit great to my electric shaver norelco.</li>
            <li> My first shave (face and head) after replacing the heads in my electric razor was so close, it was almost like I had used a multi-blade disposable razor.  I will definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> My husband was glad to be able to get these replacements</li>
            <li> My husband has been needing these for a couple years. I found them at Amazon. Great price. No hassle. He&#x27;s as smooth as a baby now!!!</li>
            <li> My razor is sharp again and good to go for a few more years.  Easy to install.  Gave me a bit of razor burn again on my neck... must be sharp!</li>
            <li> Norelco excellent quality however over priced,  the shaver heads which need replaced yearly now days approaches the cost of an entire new raiser.</li>
            <li> My husband is so grateful that we are still able to find replacement heads for his older Norelco.  He loves his shaver and these heads fit great!</li>
            <li> super easy to install</li>
            <li> Ordered an HQ55 replacement heads. Received HQ56 instead but they worked the same. Shipment was fast. Can no longer find the replacement heads in a store.</li>
            <li> I bought one set of replacement heads (from another source) in the past and was completely unimpressed, but the replacement set purchased through Amazon seem to be of a much higher quality, and restored the shaver to its original \\&quot;new\\&quot; level of performance. Shaving time dropped from several minutes to about 30 seconds. I strongly recommend these replacement heads to anyone with a Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> No complains here.  Got them in time, and placing them on the razor is fairly straightforward.  Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Husband has always used Norelco and it is very durable and only have to replace heads after years of use and it is like new again.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find these older replacement models any where, after installation they worked perfectly in two of my older Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Price was competitive with newer model heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these before and they work very well. Surprise yourself at how well your shaver still works if you haven&#x27;t changed blades in six months or so. I vowed to replace them more often so I bought two. treat yourself-you don&#x27;t really have to rub the whiskers off!</li>
            <li> Easy to install &amp; Smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind!  Don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t available in stores any more - who knows!</li>
            <li> I had to purchase the replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s razor and didn&#x27;t have time to hunt around town. Took a chance and ordered on line. They arrived quickly and were easy to install.</li>
            <li> I bought these a long time back, and I&#x27;am still using them to shave. If I would have known that these blades from amazon would work  so well , I would have gotten them first, instead of the ones I got locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d waited too long to change blade heads so this were a particular joy ... do a great job on those neck hairs that are so hard to get.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were perfect in every way.They fit and were just what I wanted.Would recommend to anyone who needs replacements.</li>
            <li> even though i was sent a different product # HQ56 rather than HQ55 without a reason why&lt;br /&gt;after some ado with the vendor i was informed the HQ56 replaced HQ55.&lt;br /&gt;HQ56 did fit my razor and it cuts very well.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Dad. He is very happy with it. Purchased for my Dad. He is very happy with it</li>
            <li> I am  so very pleased with these replacements.  They Work very well.  These cost much more in my hometown stores.</li>
            <li> Shaves like new, and for a lot cheaper then purchasing a new razor.I bought two sets, so Im good for the year.This cuts the number of regular blades I use.</li>
            <li> Product did the job as advertised. Helped to extend the lifespan of my razor just a little longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> My razor is a Norelco triple header and the manual said to use the HQ 55 replacement heads, so I ordered some through Amazon.com and they arrived in about 3 days, but the shpping said 5 to 7 days so I was very pleased and they of course made my razor feel like a brand new one.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong item and had to return it. I can&#x27;t believe I had to pay postage to return an item that was your mistake</li>
            <li> The blades make a lot of noise and pull at my beard instead of cutting it cleanly. I put my old blades back on. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> great product. Seller delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed . I did not know at the time that the shaving blade replacement number had changed. Now I know and thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Better to replace a portion instead of buying new razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent value!  The stores are much more expensive for the exact same product.  I don&#x27;t know how they do it.</li>
            <li> Works to improve the shaver back to new condition.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to replace. The shaver now is like new,&lt;br /&gt;with-out paying the price for a new one.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement and this was the site that made it available and at a reasonable price..  It was not available locally.</li>
            <li> Product arrived just as described.  fits perfectly in my shaver.  Changing the heads at least yearly, is a practical practice to get the most out of a Norelco shaver</li>
            <li> The heads are still top quality even though recent Norelco shaver bodies are a lot lower quality than they were when they were made in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;However, the battery in my newest Norelco shaver lasts a very long time between charges.</li>
            <li> These precision made replacement heads maintain a smooth cut and they are well packaged to avoid transporting and handling damage. Now if they could only cut the price as well that would be nice.</li>
            <li> Worked great. Goiod fit. Recommend to all.</li>
            <li> My Norelco razor, which is ten years old, said that it required HQ55+ blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received HQ56 blades and they still fit perfectily.  There was a note on the package that said the 56&#x27;s will fit on the 55&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades were made in the Netherlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaves are now faster-- less passes over my mug to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Instead of spending a lot of money on repalcement heads at the store, these are just as good and should prolong my razor for a few more years.</li>
            <li> The shaver I own specifies HQ55 shaving heads.  I ordered that exact number and was surprised to see that HQ56 was sent, with a sticker on the box that stated the substitution was made - not by the shipper but by Philps Norelco.  The shavings heads installed perfectly and have renewed the comfortable shave I remember.  Had I been told of the substitution up front, I could have purchased the HQ56 for five bucks less.  No big deal on the five bucks but I feel that I was taken advantage of.</li>
            <li> Just the right replacement heads my Father In Law needed.  He had trouble finding these replacement heads at his local drug store, so we ordered and shipped to him</li>
            <li> Got these replacement blades instead of buying a whole new shaver. Great product, I have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Good product but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Philips/Norelco recommends replacing your shaver heads annually. These are priced much better than their own site, and the quality is the same.</li>
            <li> did not retain their edge for long.</li>
            <li> The blades are fine but are not secure and tend to fall out if the razor is upside down.</li>
            <li> The head fit on my shaver just perfect and it is sharp and shaves well.</li>
            <li> The price for the Norelco heads was great.  I installed the new head a few weeks ago and seem to be working OK.  I have purchased these heads before and I can get almost a year out of there service.  I clean the head 3 to 4 time a week and I think that helps.  Would purchase more in the future.  Price is right..............................</li>
            <li> these did not seem to work as well for my husband as the one&#x27;s we&#x27;d ordered before, they pulled at his wiskers...</li>
            <li> These heads were exactly like the original ones, except that they were amazingly sharp. Nice clean shave the way it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> When it come to replacing blade heads I admit I am terrible.  I am like the person who buys a new car because the ashtray is dirty.  I actually debated whether to invest in a new razor than replace the blade heads that are now four years old.  Yes, four years.  In my defense, I have to wait three days to get enough stubble to even shave.  Typically, I shave once a week so my blade head lasts longer than most.  I finally decided to get  replacement heads because I could feel my hairs being pulled by the blade.  The new blades have been great.  I forgot how smooth shaving could be with sharp blades.</li>
            <li> it was a bit expensive but i didnt want to buy a whole new electirc razer</li>
            <li> Cuts great. Even better with Williams Lectric Shave. I need to change blades more often. It is Worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> this product has replaced the HQ-5 and is excellent but it too has been deleted and replaced by the HQ-56. I wish that the HQ-5 and its successor, the HQ-55 were still in manufacture. I&#x27;ve been a Philips/Norelco customer for over sixty years and although each shavers has less life than its predecessor; the original blades and cutters are in a class by themselves and are far superior to any aftermarket ordered and available at any discounted price. Be careful that the vendor supplies Original Genuine Philips/Norelco Replacement Heads with the designation that you order and not a substitute.</li>
            <li> Since this is for an older Norelco shaver, these cannot always be found in the store - so glad I could still get them!</li>
            <li> I have a hand held shaver that is several years old. In years past I would foolishly buy a new razor as I don&#x27;t remeber seeing replacements in stores. For less than half the money razor works like new.</li>
            <li> Good, could be a little sharper. But does the job. Just have to be a little patient. Three more words required.</li>
            <li> Shaves just like a new shaver again and  with the new Reflex Head holder almost restores it back to a complete new razor,</li>
            <li> The product is fine, I do not understand the high prices.sometimes you can buy a new razor for about $10-$15 dollars more.</li>
            <li> Just what my dad needed.  It is so much easier checking on Amazon than trying to go to a lot of different stores to see if they have what you need in stock.  Fast shipping, happy customer!</li>
            <li> This Item needs replacing ever-so-often because it does wear out.</li>
            <li> good product, works well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old shaver blades had become.  It&#x27;s a creeping thing that you just get used to over time and don&#x27;t think about. The head on my shaver was the original, so it was about 10 years old.  I should have replaced it years ago.  The only way you find that out is when you do the first shave with a new head.  Holy Cow, what a difference!  Not only does the new head cut much closer, it&#x27;s also much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT go 10 years on this head, now that I know better!</li>
            <li> This is a good price and the blades work very well.  Almost cheaper to buy replacements than to keep buying disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I installed these heads but they do not shave any whiskers off of my face.&lt;br /&gt;They are very dull, and poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> OEM replacement blades. Fit perfect and now the five o&#x27;clock shadow appears at 9.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again when these wear out.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find these replacement heads could not find them anywhere and the razor was only two years old. The price was great to what I had paid last year at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I have an older electric norelco, one of the best razers I have invested in, it used to be my husbands but I got him a travel one and took this one now, I love to use it on my legs, and I don&#x27;t have any worry about razer burn or bumps....the replacement heads work well, and if you take care of them last quite a while...my last replacements last for almost 2 years...</li>
            <li> Received correct order on time, would recommend to anyone needing replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly on my razor even though it says HQ55+ only. ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I waited so long to purchase this.  Now I can enjoy my electric shaver again.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The replacement heads fit the razor perfectly. I thought I would need a new razor as the replacement blades are not sold locally anymore.</li>
            <li> My old blades were probably at least 5 years old and I wasn&#x27;t getting a very complete shave.  With the new blades, the shave is quicker and smoother</li>
            <li> I bought the norelco razor and when i went to clean it for the first time, the blades fell out into the sink, down the drain.  Took the drain apart and only recovered about half the parts.  Orderd a 2 back of replacement heads, and they are difficult to line up the blades.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but not as sharp as orignal.</li>
            <li> It works well in my shaver.</li>
            <li> Good product, but it took forever to receive.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Made my razor seem new!</li>
            <li> I received the box of razor heads for my Norelco electric razor in the mail promptly, immediately popped the old ones out, the new ones in, and shaved before 15 minutes had gone by.  I hadn&#x27;t replaced the heads for two years.  Finally, a quick clean shave.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item I determined the correct fit by going to the merchant site.When I got the item it was packaged in such a way that you could not determine if it would fit your razor without removing from package, the problem there is no RETURN once package opened. WHY the merchant who should have known what razor I was buying this for, and know it would fit should have notified me. But assume they don&#x27;t know WHY is item packaged in such a way you CAN NOT TELL if item fits without removing from package. ALL they would have to do is package in see thru material and there would be NO PROBLEM. I find this deceptive, and even am more concerned AMAZON doesn&#x27;t see to be concerned about the merchants, what I consider at best a very poor way of dealing with customers. I might add I emailed this merchant THREE times with no reply,and when did reply claimed I did not send email yet it went thru tne amazon system ,stay away is my advice.</li>
            <li> These arrived very quickly and fit perfectly into my husband&#x27;s electric shaver (which says it needs HQ 55+ heads).  There is very little else one can say about shaver heads; they cut hair, last a long time, and don&#x27;t cost much.  Win, win, win!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this model is not sold in stores anymore, so it was tough to find this model. After I got it, I put it in my Phillips Electric Shaver and it did the trick! Nice clean heads with sharp blades.</li>
            <li> What a difference these new heads made in the shave!  Should have bought them sooner!</li>
            <li> Best price we found for these replacement heads!</li>
            <li> These were purchased several years ago for another razor.  The product lasted, but the razor itself broke where the heads attached.</li>
            <li> Were the right ones and I did not have to fight crowds and come home with the wrong one this was correct the first time</li>
            <li> I chose this rating, because one of the individual heads, was not useable.  It must have been for another unit.</li>
            <li> When Norelco clamped down on my local shaver repair shop and wouldn&#x27;t let them sell replacement parts anymore, I didn&#x27;t want to go directly to Norelco.  I did a search, and found that Amazon had the replacement parts at a much smarter price than Norelco, so I ordered them here.  Delivered on time and in working condition.</li>
            <li> The heads fit fine, but don&#x27;t give a smooth shave. They pull terribly and are a big waste of money.</li>
