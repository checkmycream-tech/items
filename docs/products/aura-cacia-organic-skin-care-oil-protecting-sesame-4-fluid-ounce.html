            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of sesame!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not in my grocery/ health food store, so it&#x27;s great to have easy Amazon access.</li>
            <li>I warm it and use it in the evening after my shower.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is preferred but this is nice, probably won&#x27;t buy it all the time though.</li>
            <li>To each their own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that this makes me smell like peanuts, but it does feel pretty great on damp skin after a shower!</li>
            <li>A great product at a super price.</li>
            <li>This Sesame skin care oil is the best natural moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My skin so soft, very happy with it</li>
            <li>so I have had to put on moisturizer on top of the sesame oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the oil is ok</li>
            <li>All I can say I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>There are so many benefits from sesame oil inside and out.  </li>
            <li>but I like it :)</li>
            <li>Even though the product was taped at the top it still had a lot of spillage.</li>
            <li>and this does not make it break out or become more oily.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff - I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>, my hands were eczema free!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this sesame oil and use it on my face every night and on the soles of my feet as in Ayurvedic medicine the belief is it helps you to sleep.</li>
            <li>I love using purt, organic oil as a face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, was recommended to me as a better alternative than almond oil for dry skin care.</li>
            <li>Both are great for Sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use it before I get in the shower and my &amp;#34;crepe paper&amp;#34; skin is a lot more smooth.</li>
            <li>Organic smells strong.</li>
            <li>He had light acne and none of the store bought acne medication</li>
            <li>This really feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it as part of the process, but personally I find both the moisturization and scent of Nutiva coconut oil (also used in my kitchen for cooking--nice bonus) to be more effective.</li>
            <li>This oil works great on my super dry skin/scalp in the winter.</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing and leaves my skin feeling soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>It goes on oily but dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>Do a quick search on sesame oil to see them all.  </li>
            <li>I make my own hair, facial, body and bath oils from recipes found on the web.</li>
            <li>Dont care for the smell, but it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged, natural, potent and worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Organic Sesame Oil is super effective for dry skin because it&#x27;s absorbed quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>Makes you skin feel very soft and smooth and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, also, to know that I&#x27;m not absorbing all sorts of chemicals into my system.</li>
            <li>Make a skin smooth no more crash and nice</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth without excess oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Aura Cacia and love their products.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more in the future</li>
            <li>Thanks, Vani!</li>
            <li>Love it for my hair just prior to shampooing.</li>
            <li>Love to put this oil with essential oils in a luxourious bath to soak away stress or just keep my skin hydrated</li>
            <li>This oil makes my skin feels great especially after dry brushing and then showering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was concerned when I first began using this sesame oil because it smells very nutty, which is what you want from this product.</li>
            <li>It goes on first thing after my shower in AM, then soaks in while I get ready for work.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well and is very versatile in use.</li>
            <li>really worked.  </li>
            <li>I got a prescription from the doctor but really didn&#x27;t want him using any of the chemical stuff.  </li>
            <li>However the one I purchased from amazon had a funky smell to it,  whole foods sells this too.</li>
            <li>Their quality control is a standard I feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li>I like it but not so much the sesame smell.........</li>
            <li>I will be ordering this as gifts for the holiday, thanks.</li>
            <li>Really like this oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also absorbed by the skin and offers many other benefits inside and out.  </li>
            <li>I can even squirt it in my hands and even mix it gently with my new favorite Shika Borage Therapy Dry Skin Body Lotion before applying all over.  </li>
            <li>but I think coconut oil is better and less smelly.  </li>
            <li>I feel this is a little too heavy for daytime wear, but perfect for an all natural, organic nighttime treat for my sensitive</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these for those into alternative medicines/healing/wellness.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell strong like other reviews said.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just received 2 new shipments.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and had lizard skin.</li>
            <li>This organic sesame seed oil is keeps my skin soft and is part of my health care regime!</li>
            <li>Too small of bottle for body use though...must shower off after use unless you love smelling like a peanut.</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer after showering and it makes me so soft!</li>
            <li>Take it from an old sensitive expert.</li>
            <li>I have post-menopausal &amp;#34;dry skin blues&amp;#34; and my delicate eye area truly feels and appears more elastic in the 2 weeks since I began applying every night before bed.</li>
            <li>This oil fixed all of my problems.</li>
            <li>I did some research and found out that Sesame oil is quite hot for your body and you need to use barely a dab of it for the entire body.</li>
            <li>There is barely any fragrance</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it a bad product, just not as good for my skin as I was hoping for.  </li>

            <li> It smells like sesame seeds but the smell does not last long.  </li>
            <li> Expected a larger bottle for the price, my fault for not paying attention to ounce size...item was as described.</li>
            <li> Nothing ever came close to softening my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Skin is still dry and cracking despite using this oil every day.</li>
            <li> and my skin was dry</li>
            <li> FoodBabe approved, so I purchased as part of her suggested dry skin brushing process.</li>
            <li> I use this after dry brushing, before showering.</li>
            <li> I like it, not very much</li>
            <li> Living in NE in the winter gives me very dry skin and the oil performs like a dream.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands, nail beds are always bleeding, etc</li>
            <li> I added a little lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a larger size.  </li>
            <li> am careful with clothing.</li>
            <li> Plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I never buy any other brand because of the quality and consistency of their products.</li>
            <li> I also read other reviews how it helps acne.  </li>
            <li> Have to say that the smell is not great and mix it with a scented cream which is not what I needed as my skin is sensitive and also tried other scented oils to mix it with but found them too</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent of sesame seeds in this oil</li>
            <li> My health food store had it on sale for less than 5 dollars.</li>
            <li> It has been pretty cold this winter</li>
            <li> He applies to his face each night, leaves it on for a few minutes and then showers and rinses it off.  </li>
            <li> I still find it unbelievable.</li>
            <li> hard to get it to come out</li>
            <li> I got a bad reaction on my skin after using this product directly after my shower.</li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m in MN during the cold months, it&#x27;s difficult keeping my skin soft and my fingers from cracking.  </li>
            <li> - I bet the skin around my thumbs won&#x27;t split this winter from the cold dry</li>
            <li> I had bad eczema on my hands, this soothed and softened my skin due to eczema and within a week</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the results.  </li>
            <li> It smells horrible.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Makes you skin feel very soft and smooth and I use just before a shower.</li>
            <li> I like the peanut butter smell. It absorbs very well and is very versatile in use. I use it on my face and also for wiping off mascara.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality, price and packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Living in NE in the winter gives me very dry skin and the oil performs like a dream. It&#x27;s nice, also, to know that I&#x27;m not absorbing all sorts of chemicals into my system.</li>
            <li> Awesome cleanser &amp; moisturizer!</li>
            <li> lived up to my expectations, great product</li>
            <li> Nothing ever came close to softening my dry skin. I still find it unbelievable. I suffer a skin allergy as well which causes an itchy rash at times on the chest back and upper arms (I&#x27;m allergic to sulfates). I can even squirt it in my hands and even mix it gently with my new favorite Shika Borage Therapy Dry Skin Body Lotion before applying all over.  Both are great for Sensitive skin. Take it from an old sensitive expert. (I thank the Food Babe for recommending  these wonderful products. I&#x27;ve just received 2 new shipments.</li>
            <li> This organic sesame seed oil is keeps my skin soft and is part of my health care regime!</li>
            <li> One could never have enough oil. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Skin feels great.</li>
            <li> This oil is great.  It smells like sesame seeds but the smell does not last long.  It goes on oily but dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.  I plan to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was concerned when I first began using this sesame oil because it smells very nutty, which is what you want from this product. I did not want to smell nutty all day but of course that is not the case. This oil makes my skin feels great especially after dry brushing and then showering. It has been pretty cold this winter so I have had to put on moisturizer on top of the sesame oil.</li>
            <li> Helpful for crash skin after apply on skin 3 day . Make a skin smooth no more crash and nice</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil as I had read the reviews that it is good for skin and eczema.  I have very dry hands, nail beds are always bleeding, etc so thought I would try.  Have to say that the smell is not great and mix it with a scented cream which is not what I needed as my skin is sensitive and also tried other scented oils to mix it with but found them too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the oil is ok but I think coconut oil is better and less smelly.  I don&#x27;t think it a bad product, just not as good for my skin as I was hoping for.  Skin is still dry and cracking despite using this oil every day.</li>
            <li> hard to get it to come out</li>
            <li> Perfect and arrived in good packaging.</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent of sesame seeds in this oil once I&#x27;ve applied it.  But, if I mix with just a drop of a scented essential oil, you can&#x27;t detect the sesame smell at all.  This oil works great on my super dry skin/scalp in the winter.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth without excess oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is great. I warm it and use it in the evening after my shower. I added a little lavender essential oil. I alternate each night with castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;Use this morning on my face and neck. All I can say I am in love with this product. My health food store had it on sale for less than 5 dollars. I am going to get another bottle.</li>
            <li> I got a bad reaction on my skin after using this product directly after my shower. I have used sesame oil before but this one didn&#x27;t suit me. I did some research and found out that Sesame oil is quite hot for your body and you need to use barely a dab of it for the entire body.</li>
            <li> Organic smells strong. The &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; version has no scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Aura Cacia and love their products. I make my own hair, facial, body and bath oils from recipes found on the web. I never buy any other brand because of the quality and consistency of their products.</li>
            <li> Best thing for skin and nails ever</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin so I will use it till it&#x27;s gone but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this on another site but I think it works great!  There are so many benefits from sesame oil inside and out.  I use it myself but I was also looking for something for my teenage son.  He had light acne and none of the store bought acne medication really worked.  I got a prescription from the doctor but really didn&#x27;t want him using any of the chemical stuff.  Then I happened to come across the benefits of sesame oil and clearing up acne was one of them.  He applies to his face each night, leaves it on for a few minutes and then showers and rinses it off.  His skin looks so much better! I was shocked at the results.  The sesame oil basically attracts the toxins on the skin, then you shower them off.  It&#x27;s also absorbed by the skin and offers many other benefits inside and out.  Do a quick search on sesame oil to see them all.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a larger size.  As for complaints about the smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me or my family. It smells just like I would expect, sesame.</li>
            <li> My dad bought this for me and my son loves it.  It&#x27;s very safe for babies.  However the one I purchased from amazon had a funky smell to it,  whole foods sells this too. I recommend buying from there</li>
            <li> I like it, not very much but I like it :) Coconut oil is preferred but this is nice, probably won&#x27;t buy it all the time though. Got it on Food Babe&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> Pleased with everything!  Will purchase more in the future</li>
            <li> Excellent product, was recommended to me as a better alternative than almond oil for dry skin care.</li>
            <li> This Sesame skin care oil is the best natural moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used. I have post-menopausal &amp;#34;dry skin blues&amp;#34; and my delicate eye area truly feels and appears more elastic in the 2 weeks since I began applying every night before bed. I feel this is a little too heavy for daytime wear, but perfect for an all natural, organic nighttime treat for my sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I believe everyone could benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product--skin feels wonderful!  Thanks, Vani!</li>
            <li> Love it for my hair just prior to shampooing. Too small of bottle for body use though...must shower off after use unless you love smelling like a peanut. Expected a larger bottle for the price, my fault for not paying attention to ounce size...item was as described.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged, natural, potent and worth every cent.  Highly recommend these for those into alternative medicines/healing/wellness.  Aura Cacia makes a great product.  Their quality control is a standard I feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li> I like the way this makes my skin look and feel.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t make me smell like sunflower seeds.</li>
            <li> This really feels nice on my skin. I use it before I get in the shower and my &amp;#34;crepe paper&amp;#34; skin is a lot more smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer after showering and it makes me so soft!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing and leaves my skin feeling soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizet. Skin feels great after it.</li>
            <li> Even though the product was taped at the top it still had a lot of spillage. It smells horrible. I would never put this foul spelling product on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am another person out there who heard about this product from the Food Babe.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, but so far, so good.  I am seasonal between MN and FL and when I&#x27;m in MN during the cold months, it&#x27;s difficult keeping my skin soft and my fingers from cracking.  I have been using this on my body three times per week, nightly on my hands and daily on my face to replace my moisturizer.  I have oily skin and this does not make it break out or become more oily.  I also read other reviews how it helps acne.  I told my sister about it, as my nephew has had acne for years.  A great product at a super price.</li>
            <li> I like it but not so much the sesame smell.........</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I live in Arizona and had lizard skin. Yuk. This product is bringing my skin back to life. My legs are no longer scaly-I might wear shorts next summer! Great for callouses on your feet. Great for hands - I bet the skin around my thumbs won&#x27;t split this winter from the cold dry air.&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema issues on my hands and a spot on my leg and it is gone. There is barely any fragrance and it&#x27;s pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I am careful with clothing. It goes on first thing after my shower in AM, then soaks in while I get ready for work. Plus a little goes a long way. I love this stuff - I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I used to breakout a lot and my skin was dry then it would be oily. This oil fixed all of my problems. I love it!</li>
            <li> I had bad eczema on my hands, this soothed and softened my skin due to eczema and within a week, my hands were eczema free! Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t smell strong like other reviews said. Plus I use it for my face as well and works great!</li>
            <li> My skin so soft, very happy with it</li>
            <li> Love this product. I will be ordering this as gifts for the holiday, thanks.</li>
            <li> Organic Sesame Oil is super effective for dry skin because it&#x27;s absorbed quickly and completely. It&#x27;s not in my grocery/ health food store, so it&#x27;s great to have easy Amazon access.</li>
            <li> Very nice used along with the skin bursh.</li>
            <li> I mix this oil with regular lotion on my hand and use for my skin on the body. Works great!</li>
            <li> Delicious on the skin!  A great product. I&#x27;d never used this brand before and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this sesame oil and use it on my face every night and on the soles of my feet as in Ayurvedic medicine the belief is it helps you to sleep. And it smells divine.</li>
            <li> Love to put this oil with essential oils in a luxourious bath to soak away stress or just keep my skin hydrated</li>
            <li> FoodBabe approved, so I purchased as part of her suggested dry skin brushing process. I love it as part of the process, but personally I find both the moisturization and scent of Nutiva coconut oil (also used in my kitchen for cooking--nice bonus) to be more effective. I don&#x27;t love that this makes me smell like peanuts, but it does feel pretty great on damp skin after a shower! To each their own.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of sesame!  Feels great!!</li>
            <li> I love using purt, organic oil as a face cleanser.  It&#x27;s gentle and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This oil is great. I use this after dry brushing, before showering.</li>
            <li> Really like this oil. Dont care for the smell, but it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
