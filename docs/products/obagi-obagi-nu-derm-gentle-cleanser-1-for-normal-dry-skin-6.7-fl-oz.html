            <li> A little goes a long way, I&#x27;d imagine this bottle will last me at least 2 months, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used to use other obagi products with it (toner, moisturizer), but with their prices I went ahead and got a different toner and moisturizer - yet cannot part with the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I had very dry, scaley, flakey skin around my eyes mouth and forehead, using this along with the obagi hydrate moisturizer has worked wonders.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same cleanser that I used to buy from my esthetican, but much less expensive.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cost.</li>
            <li> It still cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but the fragrance is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive and has really nasty ingredients and chemicals in it.</li>

            <li> I accidentally bought Normal-Dry instead of Normal-Oily... This one doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good as the Normal-Oily version.  It still cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but the fragrance is disappointing.</li>

            <li> I have adult acne and sensitive skin. This product is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but cleans gently without aggravating the acne. It can even be used to remove eye makeup. My only complaint is the cost.</li>
            <li> Good product, cleans without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> Works, as it should. Way too expensive and has really nasty ingredients and chemicals in it. It&#x27;s my fault, I should have read the ingredients. Never again!!</li>

            <li> I have been using this cleanser for several years.  It does an excellent job and I love the smell.</li>
