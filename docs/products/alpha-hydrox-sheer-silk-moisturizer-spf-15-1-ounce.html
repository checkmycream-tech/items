            <li>Makes your skin feel so good.</li>
            <li>I love that it contains zinc for UV protection, it&#x27;s added bonus is that it is a good skin healer too!</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever bought, I&#x27;ve been loyally purchasing for 10 years.</li>
            <li>but all in all a great buy, i wish you got more for your money.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>i guess the price was too good to be true</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s never looked better.</li>
            <li>i love that the spf in this doesnt seem to break me out, also it does not smell like spf at all.</li>
            <li>The skin looks better.  </li>
            <li>Also, This moisturizer just doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients that make people love Alpha Hydrox.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>This is nice and light.</li>
            <li>Will switch to something with more emollients.</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>Dermal Therapy worked lots better &amp; you get more bang for your  buck.</li>
            <li>LOVE the product-</li>
            <li>Great Moisturizer - highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I used to use the Burt Bees radiance night cream, but I felt I needed something more</li>
            <li>I love that this lotion also acts as a primer which allows me to wear it alone or under foundation.  </li>
            <li>First off, let me say that every Alpha Hydrox product I have tried, I have absolutely loved.</li>
            <li>Great stuff so far.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist says that sunscreen is the most important beauty product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on you skin.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is defintely light, smooths right into the skin, and leaves a nice glow.</li>
            <li>It has my face looking bright and glowing, my skin is so soft and youthful.</li>
            <li>It has no fragrance and goes on the light.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth going on.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin baby-soft and it goes on smoothly without being greasy, but, it used to come in the pump-style as pictured and now comes in a tube with a screw-on cap.</li>
            <li>with SPF - goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make me greasy, even in T-zone.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good summer moisturizer, especially here in TX where we have many days over 100 degrees.</li>
            <li>The actual moisturizer is wonderful though and I highly recommend if you don&#x27;t have an overly oily complexion.</li>
            <li>However, I can vouch for it being smooth, going on cleanly, and despite the oil, not being greasy.</li>
            <li>Great deal from this amazing seller favorite lotion with SPF and is the only one that actually prevents any acne...in my 40s</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product nice and simple.  </li>
            <li>But it also doesn&#x27;t do great around my really dry areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I regularly use the alpha hydox lotion and find that it does a good job on my face, neck, and arms.  </li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer if you do not have the same allergic reaction to oil products that I have.</li>
            <li>semi greasy but that fades really quickly.</li>
            <li>I recently started using the Alpha Hydrox Sheer Silk Moisturizer and find this to be the best moisturizer yet!</li>
            <li>I have been using Alpha Hydrox Sheer Silk for many, many years</li>
            <li>First, the smell isn&#x27;t very fresh.</li>
            <li>still pretty full after years of purchase have passed</li>
            <li>so I read some reviews and decided that the Lumene would be worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, sinks right into the skin, and leaves a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is gold, and absorbs right in my skin after about 15 minutes--</li>
            <li>Love it, Second bottle already</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I use it on uber hot humid days.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought this was my HG moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a nice glow (probably due to the reflective properties of zinc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I so badly want to write a great review on this product because I think Alpha Hydrox makes amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Seriously, try the oil free kind topped off with retinol and your skin will be transformed.</li>
            <li>and then I use Burt Bees radiance eye cream and Lumene dry skin cocktail with vitamin C and artic cloudberries on top.</li>
            <li>They are thick and leave a white/gray powdering finish (just perfect for highlighting and magnifying every pore, wrinkle, dry patch, and blemish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is so reasonable though</li>
            <li>But this goes away once I use oil absorbing sheets.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>i really like that it contains sunscreen.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in my skin or improvement</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to scrimp on sunscreen (more is better), but it&#x27;s tempting to do so, with such a small container.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my dark spots IPL&#x27;d off, and good UVA protection is essential to keep them from recurring.</li>
            <li>Some of the melasma on my forehead had disappeared and my skin is SUPER silky soft :) I am getting really pale though.</li>
            <li>it does not last very long though, and doesnt do anything particularly amazing for me, so i dont</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for in terms of seeing a difference in your skin pretty much a preventative wrinkle day lotion no big deal!</li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth (it&#x27;s pretty thin, which I like) and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>So far, if I do not use this everyday, I seem to be okay.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use the whole Alpha Hydrox line, it is the only thing that does my skin</li>
            <li>and so far I have not had any problems with this creme.  </li>
            <li>I have been using under Burt&#x27;s Bees naturally ageless line.</li>
            <li>This means a physical sunscreen, with zinc oxide (not titanium dioxide, which doesn&#x27;t cover as much of the UVA spectrum).</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see much improvement of my skin and side the entire line of profits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s now more of a secondary moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, I took that to mean light!</li>
            <li>but I can get pretty dry in the fall/winter months.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s to be expected when exfoliating so much!</li>
            <li>Also, the weight of the product was a little less sheer or silky than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>i have very combination skin with very dry and oily patches, and this product works well for me.</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t say enough about how this line has helped clear up my acne.  </li>
            <li>However, once fall rolled around, I realized this is not heavy enough on the moisturizing side.</li>
            <li>After ten years, I finally found the product line that keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li>In the past, I found that other light moisturizers that I have used did not provide sufficient moisture to my skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A bottle lasts me a little over a month and it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out.</li>
            <li> and it took me this long to discover this</li>
            <li> Left my already dry skin very dry may work on oily skin.</li>
            <li> If it had to be a cap design I wish they would make it a flip-cap that stays attached and can be flipped back down instead of having to screw it back on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what ingredients my skin objected to, but I developed an odd red rash on my temple and upper lip.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> when my skin is dry and flaky, it remains dry and flaky even after i put this lotion on!</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a larger size!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to attribute the skin problems to this moisturizer, but after I stopped using it and went back to my usual face cream, my rash disappeared.</li>
            <li> I am crazy about fresh scents like Origins Frothy face stuff or Clairsonic cleansing gel.</li>
            <li> Usually products contain active ingredients in such small doses that there is no noticeable difference but not Alpha Hydrox.</li>
            <li> (at night I use AHA&#x27;s Night Replenishing Cr&amp;egrave;me), and I go through a container about once every month and a half or so.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the heaviness or greasiness typically associated with moisturizers that include an SPF.</li>
            <li> The problem is that most zinc oxide sunscreens are terrible for facial use.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years.</li>
            <li> That design is awful- trying to put the cap back on with your hand full of lotion is not easy and I often drop the cap or get lotion all over it instead of my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the typical heaviness, greasiness or odor that is usually associated with moisturizers that include SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat, the container is small.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I will recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> , I usually buy two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s little weak for winter months, but it still does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv, Avon&#x27;s Clearskin, and Murad&#x27;s Acne Complex, they all helped - marginally.  </li>
            <li> I call the souffle &#x27;face crack&#x27; because I am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> If I am sleepy or tired</li>
            <li> Makes me crazy because I waste product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> i am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed.</li>

            <li> This stuff is gold, and absorbs right in my skin after about 15 minutes-- it is in there doing its job. I love that it contains zinc for UV protection, it&#x27;s added bonus is that it is a good skin healer too! I use the whole Alpha Hydrox line, it is the only thing that does my skin justice-- it&#x27;s never looked better.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I have very sensitive skin and so far I have not had any problems with this creme.  I have been using this for several weeks.</li>
            <li> semi greasy but that fades really quickly. i have very combination skin with very dry and oily patches, and this product works well for me. i love that the spf in this doesnt seem to break me out, also it does not smell like spf at all. it does not last very long though, and doesnt do anything particularly amazing for me, so i dont \\&quot;love\\&quot; it. but all in all a great buy, i wish you got more for your money. would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I regularly use the alpha hydox lotion and find that it does a good job on my face, neck, and arms.  The skin looks better.  I do like this souffle too now that I have tried it.  I have been using under Burt&#x27;s Bees naturally ageless line.</li>
            <li> Slides very nicely over the Alpha Hydrox gel. Moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy- not matte, but dewy. No break-outs with this plus there&#x27;s SPF!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizer.  It&#x27;s light, sinks right into the skin, and leaves a nice glow.  It doesn&#x27;t have the typical heaviness, greasiness or odor that is usually associated with moisturizers that include SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat, the container is small.  I use this product only during the day (at night I use AHA&#x27;s Night Replenishing Cr&amp;egrave;me), and I go through a container about once every month and a half or so.  The price is so reasonable though, I usually buy two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus - I can&#x27;t say enough about how this line has helped clear up my acne.  I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv, Avon&#x27;s Clearskin, and Murad&#x27;s Acne Complex, they all helped - marginally.  AHA eliminated my acne. After ten years, I finally found the product line that keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li> I so badly want to write a great review on this product because I think Alpha Hydrox makes amazing stuff. Seriously, try the oil free kind topped off with retinol and your skin will be transformed. Usually products contain active ingredients in such small doses that there is no noticeable difference but not Alpha Hydrox. I talk up this line all the time but I thought the sheer moisturizer was just...meh. First, the smell isn&#x27;t very fresh. I am crazy about fresh scents like Origins Frothy face stuff or Clairsonic cleansing gel. Also, This moisturizer just doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients that make people love Alpha Hydrox.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that every Alpha Hydrox product I have tried, I have absolutely loved. I call the souffle &#x27;face crack&#x27; because I am addicted to it. I used the moisturizer as part of my morning routine, after applying the souffle. Unfortunately, this product did not work well for me. I&#x27;m not sure what ingredients my skin objected to, but I developed an odd red rash on my temple and upper lip. I didn&#x27;t want to attribute the skin problems to this moisturizer, but after I stopped using it and went back to my usual face cream, my rash disappeared. Again, because I didn&#x27;t want to give up on the product, I tried it for a couple of days and my skin became irritated and reddened. I even used it without the souffle (which has 12% AHA) and it still caused a rash. Also, the weight of the product was a little less sheer or silky than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin. In the past, I found that other light moisturizers that I have used did not provide sufficient moisture to my skin. This moisturizer is defintely light, smooths right into the skin, and leaves a nice glow. Simultaneously, it provides moisture that lasts all day. It doesn&#x27;t have the heaviness or greasiness typically associated with moisturizers that include an SPF.</li>
            <li> i HAD TWO SUN SPOTS ON MY FACE AND THIS PRODUCT HAS ACTUALLY LIGHTENED THOSE SPOTS. I HAVE USED IT FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS. I CAN TELL A DIFFERENCE AND WOULD DEFINATELY BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> It is your basic day cream. You get what you pay for in terms of seeing a difference in your skin pretty much a preventative wrinkle day lotion no big deal!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. A bottle lasts me a little over a month and it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out. It&#x27;s little weak for winter months, but it still does the job. (23 y/o Male)</li>
            <li> Love it, Second bottle already</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever bought, I&#x27;ve been loyally purchasing for 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different sunscreens. I&#x27;ve had my dark spots IPL&#x27;d off, and good UVA protection is essential to keep them from recurring. This means a physical sunscreen, with zinc oxide (not titanium dioxide, which doesn&#x27;t cover as much of the UVA spectrum). The problem is that most zinc oxide sunscreens are terrible for facial use. They are thick and leave a white/gray powdering finish (just perfect for highlighting and magnifying every pore, wrinkle, dry patch, and blemish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is perfect in every way. It goes on silky smooth (it&#x27;s pretty thin, which I like) and absorbs quickly. No \\&quot;slick\\&quot; after this product. It gives my skin a nice glow (probably due to the reflective properties of zinc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains zinc oxide (5 percent), so I&#x27;d categorize this as a physical sunscreen, even though it also has a chemical suncreen in it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a larger size! You don&#x27;t want to scrimp on sunscreen (more is better), but it&#x27;s tempting to do so, with such a small container.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the Alpha Hydrox Sheer Silk Moisturizer and find this to be the best moisturizer yet! It has my face looking bright and glowing, my skin is so soft and youthful. If I am sleepy or tired I have a refreshed look...which is a plus!! The only issue I have is during the day i notice a sheen. But this goes away once I use oil absorbing sheets. Other than that I will recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> i recently purchased this for my daily moisturizing needs. i am not impressed. when my skin is dry and flaky, it remains dry and flaky even after i put this lotion on! definitely will not be buying it again. i guess the price was too good to be true</li>
            <li> Got this is a sunscreen under my make up. It has no fragrance and goes on the light. I really like it</li>
            <li> I have an allergic reaction to oil-based moisturizers. So far, if I do not use this everyday, I seem to be okay. However, the oil will keep me from purchasing it in the future. However, I can vouch for it being smooth, going on cleanly, and despite the oil, not being greasy. It is a good moisturizer if you do not have the same allergic reaction to oil products that I have.</li>
            <li> I loved it, smoth and smelled good, not greasy.  Easy to use.  I will buy it again and again.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Great deal from this amazing seller favorite lotion with SPF and is the only one that actually prevents any acne...in my 40s and it took me this long to discover this...must be the alphahydroxy I don&#x27;t know but I love it</li>
            <li> This is nice and light. I use it on uber hot humid days. But when I&#x27;m in Colorado in the winter - this is just not enough. Will switch to something with more emollients.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face feel. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with alpha hydroxy treatment.  It feels smooth going on.  I would recommend this to anyone using alpha hydroxy treatments.</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvement in my facial dryness. Dermal Therapy worked lots better &amp; you get more bang for your  buck.</li>
            <li> LOVE the product- it makes my skin baby-soft and it goes on smoothly without being greasy, but, it used to come in the pump-style as pictured and now comes in a tube with a screw-on cap. That design is awful- trying to put the cap back on with your hand full of lotion is not easy and I often drop the cap or get lotion all over it instead of my face. If it had to be a cap design I wish they would make it a flip-cap that stays attached and can be flipped back down instead of having to screw it back on. Makes me crazy because I waste product. The actual moisturizer is wonderful though and I highly recommend if you don&#x27;t have an overly oily complexion.</li>
            <li> Great Moisturizer - highly recommend it!  with SPF - goes on light and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.  Will order this again!</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Like that it has SPF in it. Have been using this product for a few years. Have always been happy with results.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed. Broke me out.. still pretty full after years of purchase have passed</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product nice and simple.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again didn&#x27;t see much improvement of my skin and side the entire line of profits.</li>
            <li> Great stuff so far. It leaves me moisturized and glowy. It is sheer and doesn&#x27;t leave me oily either. I have been using it every day before I go out. I have been using it in conjunction with the souffle (2x&#x27;s a week). I use the 20% pads once a week in the evening after a shower. I wait about 15 minuets and then I use Burt Bees radiance eye cream and Lumene dry skin cocktail with vitamin C and artic cloudberries on top. I used to use the Burt Bees radiance night cream, but I felt I needed something more so I read some reviews and decided that the Lumene would be worth a try. Some of the melasma on my forehead had disappeared and my skin is SUPER silky soft :) I am getting really pale though. But it&#x27;s to be expected when exfoliating so much!</li>
            <li> I have been using Alpha Hydrox Sheer Silk for many, many years and I think it works great!  Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on you skin.  i really like that it contains sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great stuff; always reorder</li>
            <li> works well under  my make up</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in my skin or improvement</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this was my HG moisturizer. However, once fall rolled around, I realized this is not heavy enough on the moisturizing side. I have combo skin but I can get pretty dry in the fall/winter months. This doesn&#x27;t cut it during that time. But it&#x27;s a good summer moisturizer, especially here in TX where we have many days over 100 degrees. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make me greasy, even in T-zone. But it also doesn&#x27;t do great around my really dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now more of a secondary moisturizer. (I just discovered CeraVe!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for oily skin that doesn&#x27;t need lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer/sunscreen combination.  My dermatologist says that sunscreen is the most important beauty product.  I love that this lotion also acts as a primer which allows me to wear it alone or under foundation.  I prefer the tube packaging to the pump as it is easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> Left my already dry skin very dry may work on oily skin.</li>
            <li> I think this is too oily for my face. The reason I bought it was because they said it was sheer, I took that to mean light!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so good.</li>
