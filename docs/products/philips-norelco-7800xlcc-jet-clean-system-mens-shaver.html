            <li>However shaving is superb.</li>
            <li>Razor works great</li>
            <li>\\&quot;The razor works great.</li>
            <li>Great value.  </li>
            <li>I shave every once in 2 days and it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li>We received the razor in great condition.  </li>
            <li>the battery life is also good.  </li>
            <li>, so Phillips was good about that.</li>
            <li>: I got a pair of the supposedly superior \\&quot;SpeedXL</li>
            <li>It a great product and has lasted more than 3 years now.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great affordable first shaver, this is the one!</li>
            <li>My first was a Remington triple head like this and worked great.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco triple headers most of my life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the closest shave I have been able to obtain with  &lt;br /&gt;an eletric razor.</li>
            <li>All in all a very great razor, especially for the sale price of $50!\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>In China\\&quot; had much better build quality.  </li>
            <li>It has worked perfectly the entire time.  </li>
            <li>But others swear it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is ok but has an electronic problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this shaver, that I bought a new one tonight.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>After 21 months, the batteries are still fine,  I haven&#x27;t noticed any slowing of the razor, nor has it needed to be charged more often than before.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>This particular shaver is the best one I have used so far.</li>
            <li>motor sounds not so powerful, but it works ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 7800XLCC model will fit the Speed XL blades with no modifications as well as the Spectra HQ8 Heads.  </li>
            <li>The shave is smooth.</li>
            <li>This is is light and feels like a lightweight, cheap, aluminum razor.</li>
            <li>I could not be happier; the shave is close, quick, and easy.  </li>
            <li>very clean shaving, with pretty smooth finish..</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that you can rinse the shaver under water to clean.</li>
            <li>I use the shaver once a day and on a full charge...it will go for about a week.</li>
            <li>This was the only razor I could find that gave a good shave without tearing up my skin.  </li>
            <li>I thought for $80 i&#x27;d finally have a good razor.  </li>
            <li>the cleaning system is cool, and the fact that this shaver is so easy to clean (it says you can open it up and run it under water which i&#x27;ve been doing to clean it) make it worthwhile to me though.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a long time, but it does work fine.  </li>
            <li>These combined cost more than a new razor.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li>I have a fine, and soft beard, and sensetive skin to boot.  </li>
            <li>I want to know that this Norelco 7800XLCC Jet Clean System Men&#x27;s Shaver of $49.99 on Amazon is new or refurbished or used.</li>
            <li>the first one i got from amazon was $40</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like not being able to buy the solution locally, or even on the Norelco website.  </li>
            <li>So this will be by 4th razor since i first started shaving.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought a Norelco shaver for years and thought that this one would be hot.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have ever used, so I&#x27;m not experienced with this type of thing, but it has been working great for me for about 2 months now.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco shaver was made of heavy, strong metal and felt like a good, solid razor.</li>
            <li>This is really a hybrid razor:</li>
            <li>I was dissapointed that there was not a bar that would allow you to know how much charge remains in the razor.  </li>
            <li>i did not like as much</li>
            <li>so i kept goin back to the original.</li>
            <li>So time and again I went back to that original Remington.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easier to open it and run water over it to clean because the cradle doesn&#x27;t get all the hair out.</li>
            <li>I have taken it on the road with a full charge for several week long trips, and the batteries held up fine.  </li>
            <li>my first shaver was my dad&#x27;s old school norelco shaver</li>
            <li>but, My main problem is with ON/OFF button.</li>
            <li>and i wanted one with a cleaning system for a decent price</li>
            <li>I had been using a regular razor for years but with the price of blades figured something like this would be worth it, and when I saw this on sale for 50 bucks</li>
            <li>Once every few months would be ok.</li>
            <li>They are repairing it now and I am supposed to have a new unit soon</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty close, but of course it&#x27;s not as close as a regular manual shaver.  </li>
            <li>&quot; but my old razor a 6826xl which was \\&quot;Made</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice and have already noticed a closer shave, so I highly reccomend this razor! &lt;</li>
            <li>Finally I feel that after purchasing Norelco razors for several years this was the most inferior compaired to other Norelco purchases I have made.</li>
            <li>I get clean shave with little bit of effort</li>
            <li>It also was taking me much longer to shave because I had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I generally shave 6 mornings, and give it a rinse under the tap water each day.  </li>
            <li>The razor can also be run directly off the adapter, in case your batteries are totally drained.      </li>
            <li>And last, but not least, this razor is blissfully quiet.</li>
            <li>The shave is ok, but not great.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And last, but not least, this razor is blissfully quiet.</li>
            <li> The shave is ok, but not great.</li>
            <li> Immediately I noticed a smoother, closer shave, in about half the time it normally took.</li>
            <li> The battery last long enough for weeks if you use only couple of minutes a day.</li>
            <li> Then i got a regular flat screen one and that just cut me and not the hair</li>
            <li> i mean it shaves decently, but as an asian male with not much facial hair, i still see that i have to shave every couple days which i prefer not to.  </li>
            <li> Charging light should stop blinking once fully charged, unfortunately thats not the case with the one that I have got.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time too.  </li>
            <li> its definitely not the miracle device i expected</li>
            <li> i have been using it for a long time now.</li>
            <li> On the 7th day, I put it in the charger base for a complete charge and clean.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I like it a lot because I usual running off to work</li>
            <li> So the razor was simple enough to set up and use but the motor just seems weak to me.   </li>
            <li> it was getting old and broken tho</li>
            <li> if there was a half star system, i&#x27;d give this shaver a 4.5/5.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is so poorly designed it barely functions, and the cleaning kit says it isn&#x27;t even antibacterial which seems to defeat the purpose of having it.  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s easy to take just the adapter on the road, and leave the base at home.  </li>
            <li> the only drawback is that if the longer than half a centimeter, its tough to shave with it.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base is a great idea, because it does all the work for you, and the only thing you have to remember is to put it on the base.</li>
            <li> And i&#x27;m not even convinced the cleaning fluid isn&#x27;t irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that on my base the male plug broke off.</li>
            <li> Negative</li>
            <li> It does not really cut me which i am grateful for but it also takes like 20 runs over the same spot to get &#x27;most\\&quot; of the hair which is incredibly annoying.  </li>
            <li> 2 weeks ago I got a little careless, and water ran into places it was not supposed to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It still takes 8 hours to charge for 45 minutes of shaving, which can be frustrating.</li>
            <li> The same adapter and cable that plug in to the base, will plug into the shaver also.  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s useable and ill keep tryin and see if i adjust but</li>
            <li> Although the shaver runs well, I need new cutting heads and a replacement base.  </li>
            <li> : I have always been very careful while cleaning the base.  </li>
            <li> So, just be very careful while cleaning the base.  </li>
            <li> It was probably just a random chance accident that it happened with mine.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, but sometimes it irritated the skin.  </li>
            <li> All in all im disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning time in the base is about 4 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Even though the base was unplugged, that was it.  </li>
            <li> I still hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like this gimmick of having to buy cleaning solution for the base every two weeks.</li>

            <li> I used to have some Remington shaver that a friend bought me for the last 5 yrs.  It wasn&#x27;t bad, but sometimes it irritated the skin.  my first shaver was my dad&#x27;s old school norelco shaver so i thought i&#x27;d give them a try again.  the first one i got from amazon was $40 (i forgot the model #) and ended up sending it back to norelco for their 60 day guarantee.  it was just alright.  this one i feel about the same way.  i mean it shaves decently, but as an asian male with not much facial hair, i still see that i have to shave every couple days which i prefer not to.  the cleaning system is cool, and the fact that this shaver is so easy to clean (it says you can open it up and run it under water which i&#x27;ve been doing to clean it) make it worthwhile to me though.  the battery life is also good.  if there was a half star system, i&#x27;d give this shaver a 4.5/5.</li>
            <li> This shaver is pretty nice.  As for the shave...it&#x27;s pretty close, but of course it&#x27;s not as close as a regular manual shaver.  Overall, I like it a lot because I usual running off to work so I shave in the car.  The charge lasts a long time too.  I use the shaver once a day and on a full charge...it will go for about a week.</li>
            <li> Razor works great but it&#x27;s easier to open it and run water over it to clean because the cradle doesn&#x27;t get all the hair out.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco triple headers most of my life. This particular shaver is the best one I have used so far. Immediately I noticed a smoother, closer shave, in about half the time it normally took. I didn&#x27;t have to go over it multiple times. The cleaning has been made easier, I like the fact you can rinse it under the fascet.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever used, so I&#x27;m not experienced with this type of thing, but it has been working great for me for about 2 months now.  I could not be happier; the shave is close, quick, and easy.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great affordable first shaver, this is the one!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and clean. The battery last long enough for weeks if you use only couple of minutes a day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The motor sounds not so powerful, but it works ok.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for college and here are his comments: \\&quot;The razor works great. It&#x27;s the closest shave I have been able to obtain with  &lt;br /&gt;an eletric razor. The cleaning base is a great idea, because it does all the work for you, and the only thing you have to remember is to put it on the base. My only complaint is that on my base the male plug broke off. It was probably just a random chance accident that it happened with mine. They are repairing it now and I am supposed to have a new unit soon, so Phillips was good about that. All in all a very great razor, especially for the sale price of $50!\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Charging light should stop blinking once fully charged, unfortunately thats not the case with the one that I have got. They say you can plugin and use it if discharged but the shaver doesn&#x27;t work that way. I think its just an exception having this defect. However shaving is superb.</li>
            <li> I like the quietness of the shaver, the closeness of the shave, and the lightness of the razor.  Also, I like the larger holding area for the whiskers. I don&#x27;t like not being able to buy the solution locally, or even on the Norelco website.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when I run out of solution.</li>
            <li> Contrary to the box description, this razor does not take \\&quot;Quadra\\&quot; blades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 7800XLCC model will fit the Speed XL blades with no modifications as well as the Spectra HQ8 Heads.  Great value.  Mine says, \\&quot;Made In Holland\\&quot; but my old razor a 6826xl which was \\&quot;Made In China\\&quot; had much better build quality.  This is really a hybrid razor: A Speed XL body with Spectra HQ8 blades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It still takes 8 hours to charge for 45 minutes of shaving, which can be frustrating.</li>
            <li> I got this Shaver 21 months ago.  It has worked perfectly the entire time.  I have a fine, and soft beard, and sensetive skin to boot.  This was the only razor I could find that gave a good shave without tearing up my skin.  I generally shave 6 mornings, and give it a rinse under the tap water each day.  On the 7th day, I put it in the charger base for a complete charge and clean.  The razor comes out spotless, and lubricated.  After 21 months, the batteries are still fine,  I haven&#x27;t noticed any slowing of the razor, nor has it needed to be charged more often than before.  I have taken it on the road with a full charge for several week long trips, and the batteries held up fine.  And last, but not least, this razor is blissfully quiet. Cleaning time in the base is about 4 minutes.  Charge intially was something like 12 or 13 hours.  After that, it charges up in 6 to 8 hours.  Kind of a long time, but it does work fine.  The same adapter and cable that plug in to the base, will plug into the shaver also.  So, it&#x27;s easy to take just the adapter on the road, and leave the base at home.  The razor can also be run directly off the adapter, in case your batteries are totally drained.      Negative: I have always been very careful while cleaning the base.  2 weeks ago I got a little careless, and water ran into places it was not supposed to.  Even though the base was unplugged, that was it.  The cleaning portion won&#x27;t run now.  So, just be very careful while cleaning the base.  I&#x27;m so happy with this shaver, that I bought a new one tonight.  Although the shaver runs well, I need new cutting heads and a replacement base.  These combined cost more than a new razor.      Oh, which reminds me that the unit has a 2 year warranty, but Norelco won&#x27;t honor it with no receipt, so save it!      Update: I got a pair of the supposedly superior \\&quot;SpeedXL heads\\&quot; and popped them in.  I have seen no differance in the closeness, quality, or comfort of the shave.  But others swear it&#x27;s better.  Everyones&#x27; face is different.</li>
            <li> I was suprised by this razor.  Firstly I was never able to get the self cleaning mechanism to work.  Additionaly I was dissapointed that there was not a bar that would allow you to know how much charge remains in the razor.  Finally I feel that after purchasing Norelco razors for several years this was the most inferior compaired to other Norelco purchases I have made.</li>
            <li> I had been using a regular razor for years but with the price of blades figured something like this would be worth it, and when I saw this on sale for 50 bucks I jumped on it.  I have only used it twice and have already noticed a closer shave, so I highly reccomend this razor! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I want to know that this Norelco 7800XLCC Jet Clean System Men&#x27;s Shaver of $49.99 on Amazon is new or refurbished or used. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hello</li>
            <li> I was trying to make the shift from a razor blade to an electric shaver and found that this shaver did not provide the close shave I was looking for.  It also was taking me much longer to shave because I had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs.  In the end, after using it for 5 weeks, I took advantage of the 60 day return policy and returned the shaver.  I am back to my razor blade.  I still hate shaving.</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok but has an electronic problem. I get clean shave with little bit of effort but, My main problem is with ON/OFF button. Just after using this for 3-4 months my shaver ON/OFF button stopped working.  It is always in ON position I can&#x27;t switch off the razor. The only way it switches off is when the battery runs out.</li>
            <li> So this will be by 4th razor since i first started shaving.  My first was a Remington triple head like this and worked great. Years later i got another Remington i did not like as much and it cut me so i kept goin back to the original. Then i got a regular flat screen one and that just cut me and not the hair it seemed.  So time and again I went back to that original Remington.  it was getting old and broken tho so i decided i needed and upgrade and i wanted one with a cleaning system for a decent price so i thought i&#x27;d give Norelco a try.  So the razor was simple enough to set up and use but the motor just seems weak to me.   It does not really cut me which i am grateful for but it also takes like 20 runs over the same spot to get &#x27;most\\&quot; of the hair which is incredibly annoying.  The beard trimmer is so poorly designed it barely functions, and the cleaning kit says it isn&#x27;t even antibacterial which seems to defeat the purpose of having it.  And i&#x27;m not even convinced the cleaning fluid isn&#x27;t irritating my skin. All in all im disappointed.  I thought for $80 i&#x27;d finally have a good razor.  I mean it&#x27;s useable and ill keep tryin and see if i adjust but its definitely not the miracle device i expected and i&#x27;ve decided the flexible heads r just a gimmick.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for a long time now. It a great product and has lasted more than 3 years now. very clean shaving, with pretty smooth finish..the only drawback is that if the longer than half a centimeter, its tough to shave with it. I shave every once in 2 days and it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li> We received the razor in great condition.  I gave it to my boyfriend for Christmas and it took some time to get it started, because we didn&#x27;t want to miss something, but he has used it everyday and really likes it.  The shave is smooth. It took time to get used to it because he couldn&#x27;t feel it working.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a Norelco shaver for years and thought that this one would be hot. Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s ok, but I expected more for the price. My old Norelco shaver was made of heavy, strong metal and felt like a good, solid razor. This is is light and feels like a lightweight, cheap, aluminum razor. The shave is ok, but not great. I also don&#x27;t like this gimmick of having to buy cleaning solution for the base every two weeks. Once every few months would be ok. I do like the fact that you can rinse the shaver under water to clean. A decent razor, but not worthy of the name Norelco.</li>
