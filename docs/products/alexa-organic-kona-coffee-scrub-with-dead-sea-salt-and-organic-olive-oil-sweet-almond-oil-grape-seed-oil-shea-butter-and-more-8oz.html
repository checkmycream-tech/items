            <li> I was actually thinking this might be a good option for someone that has chicken</li>
            <li> It feels fantastic from the neck down, but too heavy for my face.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to report on any diminished cellulite.</li>
            <li> Its never been this smooth, and the scrub doesn&#x27;t leave behind an oily residue!  </li>
            <li> The odor of the wash is calming and I found it comforting after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and Alexa has miraculously moisturized it!</li>
            <li> Over night, some skin tones on my face evened out, appearing less red.</li>
            <li> Neither of us are big fans of coffee, but we both agreed that the smell isn&#x27;t bad as the coffee doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Correction: too heavy for my face following the package instructions.</li>
            <li> My face had been really broke out lately :/</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d say if I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The small gritty scrubbers makes you feel like some dead skin was taken off and leaves you feeling cleaner than just soap.  </li>
            <li> little like coffee and a little like coco.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling silky soft after use not to mention that I am obsessed with the coffee scent.</li>
            <li> I never use anything harsh on my face as it has a tendency to break out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a typical complaint for this type of product (sandy), in this type of packaging (resealable bag).</li>
            <li> so I can keep it closed, but it could be worse.</li>
            <li> The granules get caught in the seal tracks and I&#x27;m unable to seal the package back up.</li>
            <li> Not sure what caused it,</li>
            <li> I usually leave the exfoliating to the women, but this product is a must have for everyone.</li>
            <li> do have one complaint.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I received my order super fast! Alexa is an absolutely amazing product! My skin feels very refreshed and silky! It has a delectable aroma!!! ☺</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and, personally, I found the product to be too oily and greasy. I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get it off of my skin. I also didn&#x27;t see that it was actually doing any exfoliating either, so I ended up giving the bag to my mother to try and she said it really helped on some of her face and elbows. Neither of us are big fans of coffee, but we both agreed that the smell isn&#x27;t bad as the coffee doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance. This could be because of the mixture of oils too (there are 4 different kinds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with some other reviews on here that the packaging could be better. My bag is now inside of a separate ziplock bag so I can keep it closed, but it could be worse.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results from this product. I have extremely sensitive skin and did not break out from it. I chose standard shipping, and it got here within 6 days (but that did include a weekend). My skin feels softer, smoother, and overall healthier-after just one use! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of coffee, then you&#x27;ll LOOOVE this, it smells divine! This product says it&#x27;s for face and body, but I did not like the heavy oily feeling it left on my face; I couldn&#x27;t wash my face fast enough. It feels fantastic from the neck down, but too heavy for my face. Correction: too heavy for my face following the package instructions. It&#x27;s fine if I follow up with my usual face wash, but not just with a rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to report on any diminished cellulite. I can definitely give two thumbs up for exfoliation. I certainly approve of the scent. Every time I smell it, the Folgers song goes through my head, &amp;#34;The best part of waking up, is Folgers in your cup&amp;#34;. It really does smell like a freshly opened can of coffee. I have to take a full minute, every time I open it, just to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one complaint. It&#x27;s a typical complaint for this type of product (sandy), in this type of packaging (resealable bag). The granules get caught in the seal tracks and I&#x27;m unable to seal the package back up. Trying to clear all of the granules from the top is a test in patience that I don&#x27;t have. However, as complaints go that&#x27;s minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the packaging the ingredients are: Dead Sea Salt, Organic Kona Coffee, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Sweet Almond Oil, Organic Grape Seed Oil, Coffee Arabica Seed Oil, Organic Shea Butter, Cacao Powder, Coconut Flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product through a promotional discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub! It leaves my skin feeling silky soft after use not to mention that I am obsessed with the coffee scent.</li>
            <li> The aroma combination of the coffee and coconut make for a very invigorating experience. My skin was super smooth after using it. I was actually thinking this might be a good option for someone that has chicken skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion for the company is to change the packaging. I&#x27;d love to see the in a jar with a little scoop. It would make it easier to use and would also take the presentation to the next level - which would make it ideal for gift giving. The packaging as-is is not conducive for gift giving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALEXALIFE provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> Made my skin very smooth...i like this product</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it.  After only 3 days she notices a huge difference in her skin. She loves how her face looks and feels.  I may have to try it myself if she lets me :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Love how it smells. Good scrub to leave skin feeling smooth and soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> Smells good and was shipped quickly. Yet to see if it is productive. Will update again.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so soft and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> The organic nature of this product is what appealed to me the most. I was delighted when I received the product and discovered it was even more than what I imagined. The aroma is splendid! My skin is so soft and feels nourished after using this scrub. Definitely looking forward to continued use. Top-notch product.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome scrub that left my skin feeling soft the first time I used it! I can&#x27;t wait to use it all of the time!</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the bag, the delicious aroma hit me!  After using it, I felt invigorated and oh so soft and smooth!  I can appreciate all the natural ingredients in this product, which are all so good for a person&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells great and made my skin feel soft and smooth.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> WOW! What an amazing product! Even from the very first use, I noticed a remarkable difference.  My skin is incredibly soft. The aroma is simply divine! Perfect shipping &amp; delivery. What a great company!  I look forward to ongoing business with them. I HIGHLY  recommend this truly unique scrub, it&#x27;s more like an experience than a cleansing.</li>
            <li> My order of ALEXA&#x27;s coffee scrub arrived very quickly.  The coffee and cocoa aroma has a warm, relaxing and delicious smell.  I almost want to taste it.  The day I received my package, I used the scrub on my feet and legs.  My skin feels amazing!  Its never been this smooth, and the scrub doesn&#x27;t leave behind an oily residue!  It&#x27;s great for exfoliating, and giving my skin a refreshed and youthful look.  My children  used the scrub on their eczema, and are pleased with the results.  My son says it takes the bumps on his skin away.  I will keep this scrub on my list of favorites!</li>
            <li> skin feels smooth after use it and it smells good</li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, I received a discount for trying and reviewing this product. I was a little skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d say if I didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;m happy to report that is not the case. This is a great product. It is like a combination of an exfoliant and a moisturizer. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth and it smells good, too.  I have used it on my face, my feet, my knees, legs and neck. I never use anything harsh on my face as it has a tendency to break out. That has not happened with this product. I would highly recommend it for all of your skin.</li>
            <li> So I received this yesterday and COULD NOT WAIT to try it out after being selected to review it. This scrub in a bag is pure perfection. Smells amazing, not too harsh on my skin and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. My only hope would be for it to be offered in maybe a jar or squeeze tube rather than the bag. This product wont let you down ladies, if you want to pamper yourself for a cost friendly price, this is where to start!</li>
            <li> It smelled great, but when i used it my skin started to sting. Not sure what caused it, but I dont generally have sensitive skin and I know I didnt over do it.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount for my honest review and feedback.  So this is a great product.  How do I know, I had my mother use it as well and she loved it.  That&#x27;s saying a lot.  The woman is picky as hell.  First it has a nice scent... little like coffee and a little like coco.  My mother hates smells in her shampoo, soap, food, perfume... She enjoyed this smell and so did I.  Best if all after you use the product, it leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.  The small gritty scrubbers makes you feel like some dead skin was taken off and leaves you feeling cleaner than just soap.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scrub, hands down.  It&#x27;s refreshing, not harsh but really gets the job done, and leaves your skin soft and smooth.  And the smell is AMAZING!  The coffee and coconut ingredients must be top shelf.  Repeat buyer here, guaranteed...thanks!</li>
            <li> I am not big on exfoliating, but my wife told me to try this new product. I originally said NO, but she was just going on and on about it. So like a good husband, I tried it. I&#x27;ve used it on my feet and hands twice this week and can really tell a difference with how smooth my skin is. I usually leave the exfoliating to the women, but this product is a must have for everyone. I plan on using ALEXA alot more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS...the smell is absolutelty amazing!! I am not a coffee drinker, but love the smell of coffee. Just a perk of a product that actually works. This product has impressed in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife and I will definitely be buying more ALEXA in the future.</li>
            <li> Love Alexa coffee scrub! My skin feels years younger.&lt;br /&gt;Great service and shipping.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the results from using ALEXA: Her Connection Coffee and Dead Sea Salt. My skin loves this product! It made my face, hands, elbows, and feet soft and moisturized. Over night, some skin tones on my face evened out, appearing less red. The odor of the wash is calming and I found it comforting after a long day at work. A little goes a long way, and I love that, too!  I received my third order of this product. I love it so much I am gifting it. My skin is hydrated and I have experienced a reduction in pore size and redness. Yay! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used it this morning and my skin is so soft. I have extremely dry skin and Alexa has miraculously moisturized it! I am happy with the product and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> The packaging is super nice, looks &#x27;luxurious&#x27;. Smells amazing, definitely a strong coffee smell. I&#x27;ve only been using it on my face &amp; hands so far, but it definitely leaves my skin super soft feeling but not oily. My face had been really broke out lately :/ &amp; I feel like it is helping to clear it up. I love that it is natural ingredients. A treat for sure. I think it would go great in a gift basket of &#x27;spa&#x27; items.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. After only one use my skin felt amazing. It also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good product. But the bag came almost empty 3oz the most.</li>
