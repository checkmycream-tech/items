            <li>3 months, i can say that i&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>It also gives UV protection which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lighter moisturizer that had SPF and this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but not the best.</li>
            <li>but I think it smells great and is in no way overpowering.</li>
            <li>I use the Ageless Night Creme (for about one month now) and am really happy with that too.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, it&#x27;s a great lotion that does the job.</li>
            <li>This is a great day lotion</li>

            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a strong smell, but I think it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
            <li>once that&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, but my skin no likey.</li>
            <li>Good for your face as a moisturizer too for daytime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from that, I have found this lotion to be fairly lightweight--considering it contains sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample in the mail and loved how it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It has a real strong perfume smell and after a couple uses I ended up tossing it because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>I love the radiance day cream, and I thought the lotion with SPF 15 would be just the bees knees!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and a very light consistency and the pump is also good and hygienic.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy burtsbees products and this one is definetely great, too.</li>
            <li>nice smell</li>
            <li>nice cute bottle (for the ones who care). will buy it again.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer smells very good, but it peels off very quickly rather than being absorbed.</li>
            <li>Very nice natural ingredientsâ€¦feel good on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is very light and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>My skin has become so bright so quickly that I&#x27;ve have to stop using my foundation.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in, not greasy at all, smells pleasant and has SPF 15 that does not irritate my face even when working out.  </li>
            <li>Light moisturizer and nice scent.</li>
            <li>I love the Radiance line, but I don&#x27;t like the added fragrance</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this one doesn&#x27;t knock my socks off.</li>
            <li>I became a fan some time ago of Burt&#x27;s Bees hand lotions and wanted to find an equally excellent face lotion, so I bought this at my local Fred Meyer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and it seems to suit my skin type.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Night Cream.</li>
            <li>There are a lot better lotions out there to choose from, I would avoid this one.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I won&#x27;t be buying this lotion again.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I personally love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice light lotion</li>
            <li>and I love that it is all-natural and has non-chemical sunscreens in it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>most synthetic sunscreens (i.e., everything that ends in \\&quot;benzone\\&quot;) make my eyes sting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not so sure of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>but you see what you buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it moisturized well, but caused my face to brake out and exspired a month after I recieved it.</li>
            <li>So lovely.</li>
            <li>for some reason most places online</li>
            <li>I was glad to have found the spf 15 product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started buying a lot of my beauty products online, it seems like every time I find a product I love</li>
            <li>But on a positive note, it is a really nice sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t smell like the beach and has a nice texture.  </li>
            <li>And to be honest, I am a loyal user of the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms and chapsticks, as well as their After-Sun Lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I think I can experiment here a lot and finally find my ideal one.</li>
            <li>dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Too strong for the face.</li>
            <li>So, while it doesn&#x27;t stink, it does have a strong floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I find this product smells very natural and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>but it is light and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product because of the ingredients!  </li>
            <li>This is a light daytime moisturizer that has an SPF</li>
            <li>Unlike Burt&#x27;s Bees, l&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lotion immediately gets absorbed and it gives you a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using Burt&#x27;s Bees on most days because I still think that safer ingredients make it worth it</li>
            <li>star off for needing to figure out how to finesse this product, but a very solid 4 stars for smelling nice, effectively defending me from sunburn, and not making me break out.</li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to absorb right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to see this on the Prime list and it arrived fresh and new and I was thrilled with the way my skin felt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light and it absorbs without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It brightens better than Aveeno&#x27;s Positively radiant.</li>
            <li>but overall, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was surprisingly unimpressed by this product, and for people with sensitivity to smell, I&#x27;d recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Moisturizing Creme instead.</li>
            <li>It is no longer considered a true SPF 15 by the FDA.</li>
            <li>It is no longer considered a true SPF 15 by the FDA and forbidden to be sold.</li>
            <li>It is a little more perfumy than the cream, but seems to be good.</li>
            <li>, it makes my face feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Nice product if you are looking for a light facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The chaulky feel is a mystery, and it does seem to provide adequate moisture.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and protects from sun damage.  </li>
            <li>zinc and titanium oxides are white insoluble powders, so what are you going to expect from cream if cream contains such ingredients? :D</li>
            <li>But overall the consistency allows it to absorb pretty well, and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin and have never been able to use any product containing sunscreen without  my face burning and breaking out.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, it&#x27;s almost completely natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to purchase more natural and organic products, so I figured I&#x27;d give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I am trying to use more natural products.</li>
            <li>and I rarely wear makeup now.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have laugh lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li>With 98.2% of the lotion being natural, I feel much better about using it every day.     </li>
            <li>Two pumps seems to be the perfect amount to evenly cover my face without leaving any excess lotion behind.</li>
            <li>The night lotion is a far better moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film once it dries.</li>
            <li>Anyway for me smooth white residue is much better than shiny face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and although it isn&#x27;t available right now, we certainly plan to purchase this again.  </li>
            <li>but it smelled distinctly like sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>so I prefer NOT to try any of their other kinds because I am sure I will love those too</li>
            <li>you can put your blush on right after, no make up, power needed.</li>
            <li>one is the best of all I tried but not ideal of course</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who are sensitive to strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;m sensitive to frangrances, especially certain floral fragrences.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I expected a truly amazing product.  </li>
            <li>but overall my skin is feeling better</li>
            <li>This is more like sunscreen than a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>but it goes on fairly light and takes care of any dryness I might have while leaving me with soft skin.  </li>
            <li>would agree to have whiter face but higher spf</li>
            <li>Really recommend this product though!</li>
            <li>this product works really well!</li>
            <li>the stores stop carrying it regularly, so being able to get exactly what I want</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the most gentle one we&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin and seems to sink right into our skin.  </li>
            <li>But I also have severely dry skin, so I&#x27;m sure it will be adequate for someone with normal skin.</li>
            <li>but in the mean time I&#x27;ll continue searching for a better (yet still safe) moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It goes on really well even though at first it may seem runny.</li>
            <li>However, for people that are sensitive to scents and heavy lotions, you may be better served with a more hypoallergenic sunscreen than this one.</li>
            <li>One pump of lotion easily covers my entire face.</li>
            <li>I should say that I have combination skin, but I tend to be more concerned with my challenges with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt come at higher SPF but at least good for the winter.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I looked at the ingredients and realized that the strong scent was actually an added fragrance.</li>
            <li>Initially, I&#x27;m left with a dewey finish (which to some people might be considered greasy), but it dries just fine.  </li>
            <li>one is slightly oily for the first 20-30 minutes but after skin becomes normal and even moisturized, so I liked it</li>
            <li>, it is a little sticky but definetly worth it :)</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d avoided it originally because everything i&#x27;ve put on my face in years has \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot; emblazoned all over it and this one certainly doesn&#x27;t, but the market is pretty short on avo/octobenzone-free sunscreens right now, so i gave it a</li>
            <li>I think the people having this issue are using too much lotion.</li>
            <li>I also really like the fragrance of this lotion.</li>
            <li>It is much lighter than the night cream and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>I bought this really wanting to like it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even pointed it out (and it takes a lot for him to notice something, haha).  </li>
            <li>It has a very overpowering &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of this product</li>
            <li>My skin stays very hydrated using this.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is a pump rather than getting the lotion under my fingernails every time I put it</li>
            <li>This cream is much thicker and it never seems to fully absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>one thing I love about natural products, besides the ingredients, are the fragrances (or relative lack thereof).</li>
            <li>I went back to my old favorite: Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish.</li>
            <li>After enjoying the first bottle, I went back to an Olay product and noticed that I had more blemishes and dry skin problems, so I switched back to Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li>(we currently live in Oregon where it&#x27;s nice and humid all the time) where it&#x27;s super dry and while the rest of my body was dry my face wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a very fair-skinned person who sunburns really quickly, so everyday sunscreen is super important to me.  </li>
            <li>as others have mentioned, this product very much has a fragrance, so try to test it out in a store if you&#x27;re sensitive to scented products.  </li>
            <li>as others have mentioned, this product very much has a fragrance, so try to test it out in a store if you&#x27;re sensitive to scented products.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ve used other burt&#x27;s bees products (lip balm, for example), the fragrance is pretty familiar - it&#x27;s a lightly floral honey scent that smells very natural, and i&#x27;m sure is due to the ingredient list (royal jelly, various flower extracts) as much as any</li>

            <li>This is the first time I have tried this product and I am so far liking it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not bad since the sunscreen protection it provides is from ingredients such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, that are safer for the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, needs a lot of moisture but is prone to break outs with the use of certain products.</li>
            <li>It is important to me to wear sunscreen daily, and I&#x27;m a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees natural</li>
            <li>especially because this lotion makes my face feel soft and smooth without the burn of some face</li>
            <li>After scouring the online cosmetics database for safe cosmetic products to use, my husband and I finally settled on Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Lotion with SPF 15 for our daily sunscreen lotion.  </li>
            <li>Being a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products (mainly their shampoos and toothpaste), I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>face looks so vibrant and healthy!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Excited to see that Burt&#x27;s Bees made a sunscreen in a daily facial lotion, I grabbed this right away.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I find this product to be suitable moisturizing without being too heavy, but then again the heat and humidity of summer haven&#x27;t hit yet, so we&#x27;ll see what I think in a month!</li>
            <li>But this lotion has a gentle and natural scent.     </li>
            <li>Results aren&#x27;t instant, but people have noticed over the past three weeks that my skin looks really good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty thin but goes on nice.  </li>
            <li>star off for needing to figure out how to finesse this product, but a very solid 4 stars for smelling nice, effectively defending me from sunburn, and not making me break out.lump up, resulting in the subtle white film that a different reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li>That is strange because I have a very nice skin which is normal and absolutely not oily or dry (I dont have pimples at all, may be one once a year</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it all up and looking to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose</li>
            <li>The consistency is a bit thicker than other brands, but it works really well for my skin, which is pretty sensitive, so I really like it.</li>
            <li>If it keeps working like this, I am giving up my old moisturizer for this one!</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old with normal skin</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin soft and feeling like new</li>
            <li>I tried to find an ideal sunscreen when I moved to sunny Alabama and it looks like it is impossible</li>
            <li>Half the price and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I was initially concerned over the price, but at the rate I&#x27;m going (one application every morning using 2 pumps), this little bottle is going to last many months!</li>
            <li>put it on right after washing &amp; drying your face, so that your skin is just slightly damp, and the very lightweight liquid spreads evenly over your skin.  </li>
            <li>With much more no effect, only with a little amount.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and was recommended this Burt Bees Radiance Day Lotion to use as a face sun screen as Burt&#x27;s Bees tends to be a line that caters to sensitive skin people by using (almost) all natural products.  </li>
            <li>I only notice the color of the lotion if there is too much on part of my face.</li>
            <li>This review is from: Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Day Lotion, 2-Ounce Bottle (Health and Beauty)   </li>
            <li>This is a warning for those people who are sensitive to smell...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and sense of smell, and perfume-type smells tend to give me headaches and irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>performance was far below acceptable to me.</li>
            <li>I really like this SPF 15 facial lotion.  </li>
            <li>, smell goes away completely after application.</li>
            <li>I am not a person that is big on using lotion unless I feel the absolute need to, except for this.</li>
            <li>This irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After rubbing it into my face, I noticed that I looked considerably oily.  </li>
            <li>; - which is nice to hear because I always look so drained and tired.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with it.  </li>
            <li>and I tried many times when applying it (a little less lotion or a little more).</li>
            <li>the bottle is about half full still.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed that even though I was outside for about 6 hours on a particularly sunny day, I did not get a sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking that this would have a little less of a scent to it and smell more like their normal radiance lotion</li>
            <li>burt&#x27;s bees radiance was the 3rd one i tried, and the only one i could stick with throughout a whole month-long trial.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it feels extremely oily when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>IN SHORT: Won&#x27;t be buying this product again, highly fragranced and not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li>I do generally apply once or twice per day.</li>
            <li>It is even more confusing if you actually read the reviews, because several people talk about how they don&#x27;t like it, yet give it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the only reason i gave it two stars is because it might protect you against the sun and its natural.</li>
            <li>this sunscreen is definitely a no-go for sensitive skin people like me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit pricier than other store-brand moisturizers, but at this rate, i&#x27;m only going to need to buy a bottle 2-3 times per year, so the cost is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>only have spf 30 and spf 7 in this product line, (which is odd... who would use spf 7, it&#x27;s not even worth it).</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything and seems to be a good base under my makeup.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very smooth and sheer and surprisingly it&#x27;s not greasy at the end of long day&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li>after the moisturizer is completely dry, that tacky feeling goes away too, and skin is soft and blissfully not greasy/shiny.  </li>

            <li>The other thing that bothered me about this product was that it dried really quickly and made my normal/dry skin feel somewhat oily.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell good).</li>

            <li> 3 months, i can say that i&#x27;m very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> It also gives UV protection which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lighter moisturizer that had SPF and this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but not the best.</li>
            <li> but I think it smells great and is in no way overpowering.</li>
            <li> I use the Ageless Night Creme (for about one month now) and am really happy with that too.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, it&#x27;s a great lotion that does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a great day lotion</li>
            <li> It has sunscreen but is not greasy and it looks great under make-up.  </li>

            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a strong smell, but I think it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
            <li> once that&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, but my skin no likey.</li>
            <li> Good for your face as a moisturizer too for daytime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from that, I have found this lotion to be fairly lightweight--considering it contains sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample in the mail and loved how it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It has a real strong perfume smell and after a couple uses I ended up tossing it because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> I love the radiance day cream, and I thought the lotion with SPF 15 would be just the bees knees!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  </li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and a very light consistency and the pump is also good and hygienic.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy burtsbees products and this one is definetely great, too.</li>
            <li> nice smell</li>
            <li> nice cute bottle (for the ones who care). will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer smells very good, but it peels off very quickly rather than being absorbed.</li>
            <li> Very nice natural ingredientsâ€¦feel good on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is very light and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> My skin has become so bright so quickly that I&#x27;ve have to stop using my foundation.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in, not greasy at all, smells pleasant and has SPF 15 that does not irritate my face even when working out.  </li>
            <li> Light moisturizer and nice scent.</li>
            <li> I love the Radiance line, but I don&#x27;t like the added fragrance</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t love this product.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this one doesn&#x27;t knock my socks off.</li>
            <li> I became a fan some time ago of Burt&#x27;s Bees hand lotions and wanted to find an equally excellent face lotion, so I bought this at my local Fred Meyer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and it seems to suit my skin type.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Night Cream.</li>
            <li> There are a lot better lotions out there to choose from, I would avoid this one.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I won&#x27;t be buying this lotion again.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I personally love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice light lotion</li>
            <li> and I love that it is all-natural and has non-chemical sunscreens in it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> most synthetic sunscreens (i.e., everything that ends in \\&quot;benzone\\&quot;) make my eyes sting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not so sure of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> but you see what you buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it moisturized well, but caused my face to brake out and exspired a month after I recieved it.</li>
            <li> So lovely.</li>
            <li> for some reason most places online</li>
            <li> I was glad to have found the spf 15 product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started buying a lot of my beauty products online, it seems like every time I find a product I love</li>
            <li> But on a positive note, it is a really nice sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t smell like the beach and has a nice texture.  </li>
            <li> And to be honest, I am a loyal user of the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms and chapsticks, as well as their After-Sun Lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I think I can experiment here a lot and finally find my ideal one.</li>
            <li> dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Too strong for the face.</li>
            <li> So, while it doesn&#x27;t stink, it does have a strong floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and I find this product smells very natural and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> but it is light and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because of the ingredients!  </li>
            <li> This is a light daytime moisturizer that has an SPF</li>
            <li> Unlike Burt&#x27;s Bees, l&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lotion immediately gets absorbed and it gives you a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using Burt&#x27;s Bees on most days because I still think that safer ingredients make it worth it</li>
            <li> star off for needing to figure out how to finesse this product, but a very solid 4 stars for smelling nice, effectively defending me from sunburn, and not making me break out.</li>
            <li> I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to absorb right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was so glad to see this on the Prime list and it arrived fresh and new and I was thrilled with the way my skin felt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light and it absorbs without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It brightens better than Aveeno&#x27;s Positively radiant.</li>
            <li> but overall, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was surprisingly unimpressed by this product, and for people with sensitivity to smell, I&#x27;d recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Moisturizing Creme instead.</li>
            <li> It is no longer considered a true SPF 15 by the FDA.</li>
            <li> It is no longer considered a true SPF 15 by the FDA and forbidden to be sold.</li>
            <li> It is a little more perfumy than the cream, but seems to be good.</li>
            <li> , it makes my face feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Nice product if you are looking for a light facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The chaulky feel is a mystery, and it does seem to provide adequate moisture.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and protects from sun damage.  </li>
            <li> zinc and titanium oxides are white insoluble powders, so what are you going to expect from cream if cream contains such ingredients? :D</li>
            <li> But overall the consistency allows it to absorb pretty well, and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin and have never been able to use any product containing sunscreen without  my face burning and breaking out.</li>
            <li> And to top it off, it&#x27;s almost completely natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to purchase more natural and organic products, so I figured I&#x27;d give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am trying to use more natural products.</li>
            <li> and I rarely wear makeup now.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have laugh lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li> With 98.2% of the lotion being natural, I feel much better about using it every day.     </li>
            <li> Two pumps seems to be the perfect amount to evenly cover my face without leaving any excess lotion behind.</li>
            <li> The night lotion is a far better moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film once it dries.</li>
            <li> Anyway for me smooth white residue is much better than shiny face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and although it isn&#x27;t available right now, we certainly plan to purchase this again.  </li>
            <li> but it smelled distinctly like sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> so I prefer NOT to try any of their other kinds because I am sure I will love those too</li>
            <li> you can put your blush on right after, no make up, power needed.</li>
            <li> one is the best of all I tried but not ideal of course</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who are sensitive to strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m sensitive to frangrances, especially certain floral fragrences.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I expected a truly amazing product.  </li>
            <li> but overall my skin is feeling better</li>
            <li> This is more like sunscreen than a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> but it goes on fairly light and takes care of any dryness I might have while leaving me with soft skin.  </li>
            <li> would agree to have whiter face but higher spf</li>
            <li> Really recommend this product though!</li>
            <li> this product works really well!</li>
            <li> the stores stop carrying it regularly, so being able to get exactly what I want</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the most gentle one we&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin and seems to sink right into our skin.  </li>
            <li> But I also have severely dry skin, so I&#x27;m sure it will be adequate for someone with normal skin.</li>
            <li> but in the mean time I&#x27;ll continue searching for a better (yet still safe) moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It goes on really well even though at first it may seem runny.</li>
            <li> However, for people that are sensitive to scents and heavy lotions, you may be better served with a more hypoallergenic sunscreen than this one.</li>
            <li> One pump of lotion easily covers my entire face.</li>
            <li> I should say that I have combination skin, but I tend to be more concerned with my challenges with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt come at higher SPF but at least good for the winter.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I looked at the ingredients and realized that the strong scent was actually an added fragrance.</li>
            <li> Initially, I&#x27;m left with a dewey finish (which to some people might be considered greasy), but it dries just fine.  </li>
            <li> one is slightly oily for the first 20-30 minutes but after skin becomes normal and even moisturized, so I liked it</li>
            <li> , it is a little sticky but definetly worth it :)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d avoided it originally because everything i&#x27;ve put on my face in years has \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot; emblazoned all over it and this one certainly doesn&#x27;t, but the market is pretty short on avo/octobenzone-free sunscreens right now, so i gave it a</li>
            <li> I think the people having this issue are using too much lotion.</li>
            <li> I also really like the fragrance of this lotion.</li>
            <li> It is much lighter than the night cream and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> I bought this really wanting to like it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even pointed it out (and it takes a lot for him to notice something, haha).  </li>
            <li> It has a very overpowering &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of this product</li>
            <li> My skin stays very hydrated using this.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is a pump rather than getting the lotion under my fingernails every time I put it</li>
            <li> This cream is much thicker and it never seems to fully absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> one thing I love about natural products, besides the ingredients, are the fragrances (or relative lack thereof).</li>
            <li> I went back to my old favorite: Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish.</li>
            <li> After enjoying the first bottle, I went back to an Olay product and noticed that I had more blemishes and dry skin problems, so I switched back to Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> (we currently live in Oregon where it&#x27;s nice and humid all the time) where it&#x27;s super dry and while the rest of my body was dry my face wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a very fair-skinned person who sunburns really quickly, so everyday sunscreen is super important to me.  </li>
            <li> as others have mentioned, this product very much has a fragrance, so try to test it out in a store if you&#x27;re sensitive to scented products.  </li>
            <li> as others have mentioned, this product very much has a fragrance, so try to test it out in a store if you&#x27;re sensitive to scented products.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve used other burt&#x27;s bees products (lip balm, for example), the fragrance is pretty familiar - it&#x27;s a lightly floral honey scent that smells very natural, and i&#x27;m sure is due to the ingredient list (royal jelly, various flower extracts) as much as any</li>

            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product and I am so far liking it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not bad since the sunscreen protection it provides is from ingredients such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, that are safer for the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, needs a lot of moisture but is prone to break outs with the use of certain products.</li>
            <li> It is important to me to wear sunscreen daily, and I&#x27;m a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees natural</li>
            <li> especially because this lotion makes my face feel soft and smooth without the burn of some face</li>
            <li> After scouring the online cosmetics database for safe cosmetic products to use, my husband and I finally settled on Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Lotion with SPF 15 for our daily sunscreen lotion.  </li>
            <li> Being a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products (mainly their shampoos and toothpaste), I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> face looks so vibrant and healthy!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Excited to see that Burt&#x27;s Bees made a sunscreen in a daily facial lotion, I grabbed this right away.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I find this product to be suitable moisturizing without being too heavy, but then again the heat and humidity of summer haven&#x27;t hit yet, so we&#x27;ll see what I think in a month!</li>
            <li> But this lotion has a gentle and natural scent.     </li>
            <li> Results aren&#x27;t instant, but people have noticed over the past three weeks that my skin looks really good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thin but goes on nice.  </li>
            <li> star off for needing to figure out how to finesse this product, but a very solid 4 stars for smelling nice, effectively defending me from sunburn, and not making me break out.lump up, resulting in the subtle white film that a different reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li> That is strange because I have a very nice skin which is normal and absolutely not oily or dry (I dont have pimples at all, may be one once a year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it all up and looking to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose</li>
            <li> The consistency is a bit thicker than other brands, but it works really well for my skin, which is pretty sensitive, so I really like it.</li>
            <li> If it keeps working like this, I am giving up my old moisturizer for this one!</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old with normal skin</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin soft and feeling like new</li>
            <li> I tried to find an ideal sunscreen when I moved to sunny Alabama and it looks like it is impossible</li>
            <li> Half the price and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I was initially concerned over the price, but at the rate I&#x27;m going (one application every morning using 2 pumps), this little bottle is going to last many months!</li>
            <li> put it on right after washing &amp; drying your face, so that your skin is just slightly damp, and the very lightweight liquid spreads evenly over your skin.  </li>
            <li> With much more no effect, only with a little amount.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and was recommended this Burt Bees Radiance Day Lotion to use as a face sun screen as Burt&#x27;s Bees tends to be a line that caters to sensitive skin people by using (almost) all natural products.  </li>
            <li> I only notice the color of the lotion if there is too much on part of my face.</li>
            <li> This review is from: Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Day Lotion, 2-Ounce Bottle (Health and Beauty)   </li>
            <li> This is a warning for those people who are sensitive to smell...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and sense of smell, and perfume-type smells tend to give me headaches and irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> performance was far below acceptable to me.</li>
            <li> I really like this SPF 15 facial lotion.  </li>
            <li> , smell goes away completely after application.</li>
            <li> I am not a person that is big on using lotion unless I feel the absolute need to, except for this.</li>
            <li> This irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After rubbing it into my face, I noticed that I looked considerably oily.  </li>
            <li> ; - which is nice to hear because I always look so drained and tired.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with it.  </li>
            <li> and I tried many times when applying it (a little less lotion or a little more).</li>
            <li> the bottle is about half full still.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that even though I was outside for about 6 hours on a particularly sunny day, I did not get a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking that this would have a little less of a scent to it and smell more like their normal radiance lotion</li>
            <li> burt&#x27;s bees radiance was the 3rd one i tried, and the only one i could stick with throughout a whole month-long trial.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it feels extremely oily when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> IN SHORT: Won&#x27;t be buying this product again, highly fragranced and not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> I do generally apply once or twice per day.</li>
            <li> It is even more confusing if you actually read the reviews, because several people talk about how they don&#x27;t like it, yet give it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only reason i gave it two stars is because it might protect you against the sun and its natural.</li>
            <li> this sunscreen is definitely a no-go for sensitive skin people like me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit pricier than other store-brand moisturizers, but at this rate, i&#x27;m only going to need to buy a bottle 2-3 times per year, so the cost is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> only have spf 30 and spf 7 in this product line, (which is odd... who would use spf 7, it&#x27;s not even worth it).</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything and seems to be a good base under my makeup.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very smooth and sheer and surprisingly it&#x27;s not greasy at the end of long day&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li> after the moisturizer is completely dry, that tacky feeling goes away too, and skin is soft and blissfully not greasy/shiny.  </li>
            <li> after the moisturizer is completely dry, that tacky feeling goes away too, and skin is soft and blissfully not greasy/shiny.  </li>
            <li> The other thing that bothered me about this product was that it dried really quickly and made my normal/dry skin feel somewhat oily.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell good).</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees does have a slight fragrance, which I don&#x27;t really mind, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long.</li>
            <li> It also caused my face to look very shiny and greasy, which was odd since I have extremely dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavier, since it&#x27;s a creme formula, but a little goes a long way and you just gently massage it into the skin.</li>
            <li> I started using other Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products at the same time and have noticed a difference in skin texture and general smoothness.</li>
            <li> and I think it will last me a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> One minute after applying it to my face, my skin turned very red, almost like I&#x27;d been sitting in the sun too long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;when bior&amp;eacute; discontinued their dual fusion SPF 30 last year, i stockpiled as much as i could, but the day finally came when the last of it was expired and used up, so i had to start the tedious trial-and-error through new products.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays properly moisturized throughout the day, without getting too oily or dry anywhere.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t buy any expensive one yet, but I tried ALL (all chemical) relatively cheap sunscreens that you can find in Walmart or CVS, they are all the same - too greasy for me and my face looked like I spilled canola oil on it (that also caused pores increasing).</li>
            <li> A few hours in, my skin started to feel itchy, and when I glanced in a mirror, the redness hadn&#x27;t faded and the lotion seemed to be sitting in a thin film on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li> For someone who does not particularly enjoy this scent or for someone who is very sensitive to scented lotions, this is problematic.  </li>
            <li> After using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 for several weeks, I started looking for a face lotion with SPF that didn&#x27;t contain any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time (about 6 months) and does not have any sulfates, parabens, phthalates, or petrochemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that this product was discontinued last year by Burt&#x27;s Bees due to updated FDA sunscreen regulations testing.</li>
            <li> This product was discontinued last year by Burt&#x27;s Bees due to updated FDA sunscreen regulations testing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this lotion very long (a couple of weeks)</li>
            <li> Like all sunscreen products I&#x27;ve ever used if you let it dry and then rub your face it will peel off</li>
            <li> and my kids to moisturize our itchy, dry, cracking skin.  </li>
            <li> i have an oily skin so for the ones with a dry skin, don&#x27;t go for it, it will make your skin even drier.</li>
            <li> i love Burt&#x27;s bees but it was disappointing when i put the lotion on my face, then i started feeling little white stuff on my face</li>
            <li> The smell was far to over bearing for me to get past.  </li>
            <li> 2 pumps is enough to cover my face, tips of my ears, and my neck down to my cleavage, and</li>
            <li> any continued attempts to massage this product into your skin will result in the minerals starting to clump up, resulting in the subtle white film that a different reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li> and I must say that I am confused by all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other natural SPF + face lotion combos, so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares.</li>
            <li> This product left a filmy residue on my face and when I rubbed at it, it seemed as if I were rubbing little bits of glue from my face.  </li>
            <li> It does have sunblock in it after all, which takes a little extra effort to run in.</li>
            <li> Taste a bit pungent, after using the skin a bit dry, not moist, as other products.</li>
            <li> The SPF 15 is a must and hard to find with natural ingredients in a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Overall my skin feels softer and looks healthier, and is perhaps a bit less oily than when using other products.     </li>
            <li> I got tired of smearing products on my face that boast a wide array of chemicals that we ultimately don&#x27;t know are good or bad for us.</li>
            <li> My only hang up about this lotion other than price is the  white film it leaves and it is hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain if Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Lotion makes me look</li>
            <li> This lotion has a strong, unpleasant flowery scent.</li>
            <li> and I do not have the typical dry skin I get in the winter.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way though, I have been using it every morning for six months.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it does give your skin a radiant glow.</li>
            <li> I will still buy it again because the pros definitely outweigh a small con.</li>
            <li> However, it really is moisturizing as you can feel even later in the day, it protects your skin from the wind and cold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, about the product...it is very chalky and difficult to rub in.  </li>
            <li> The bad thing is that it does take a long time to absorb into your skin and it feels pretty sticky and heavy for a long time.</li>
            <li> Loves this lotion because it does not leave your skin feeling oily or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the product was less expensive, especially when you get a smaller quantity of it</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with residue as some previous reviewers seem to.</li>
            <li> However, once applied it has a slightly greasy consistency</li>
            <li> gives me a slightly whiter tone.</li>
            <li> I have read the other reviews and must say that I have never had a problem with this lotion making me look pale or rubbing off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t touch your face after aplying this lotion until your face becomes almost dry and you won&#x27;t have such unpleasant white particles.</li>
            <li> it was a sticky mess with the lotion peeling off when it drys out, very bad if you put make up on top of it, i kept using it once in a while but always did the same thing, and it was difficult to take the white stuff off, it was just the lotion peeling off as it dried.</li>
            <li> There is a scent which I was a little worried about</li>
            <li> one reviewer noted this product to feel \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; - when you&#x27;ve rubbed in all the moisturizer part, the mineral sunscreen part is still sitting on the surface of your skin, and yes, it does indeed start to feel a little sticky/tacky.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I don&#x27;t mind a little dew...</li>
            <li> I figured this would wear off after a little bit of time, but it remained that way which I did not care for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now and it does the job for me.</li>
            <li> It also makes me look pale.</li>
            <li> It is also much less expensive than the majority of natural/organic facial lotions.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I was pretty shocked at the perfume-y fragrance of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> i also happen to be a little acne-prone with combination skin - thick, heavy moisturizers</li>
            <li> I usually wash my face with tea tree oil soap and then apply this lotion when my face is still damp.</li>
            <li> I just use two small pumps, rub it evenly onto my hands, and then apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> I think the trick with this lotion is to not use an excessive amount, and to rub it in well.</li>
            <li> i had to wash it off my face :/</li>
            <li> like it but not loving the sunscreen smell, although not sure you can get away from that either</li>
            <li> Needless today say this day cream does not live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> My one negative</li>
            <li> - I find it both unpleasant, unnecessary, and undesirable in a natural product.</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees products get a little expensive</li>
            <li> (at least you can take it on an airplane though!), but I will say this bottle lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> This day lotion isn&#x27;t horrible, but I don&#x27;t much like it.</li>
            <li> I have to disagree with the few customers who say it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat difficult skin, prone to acne and oiliness.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t claim to), it also doesn&#x27;t make it worse!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a tad expensive but a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff seems to be pricey to me</li>
            <li> This one had a sickly perfume scent to it that gave me headaches and made me sneeze.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed...</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice product if you are looking for a light facial moisturizer. I like thicker moisturizers so this product didn&#x27;t do the job for me but overall, it is a good product. Light moisturizer and nice scent.</li>
            <li> This day lotion isn&#x27;t horrible, but I don&#x27;t much like it. Why? It feels chaulky during application and makes me look washed out. This must be because of the sunscreens used since another brand that includes the some of the same ingredients does the same. The chaulky feel is a mystery, and it does seem to provide adequate moisture.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but I doubt I&#x27;ll buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because of the ingredients!  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my skin type (oily), but it feels sticky on my face as I&#x27;m rubbing it in.  It seems to absorb well, though, so once that&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s good.  I&#x27;ll finish the bottle, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months. Results aren&#x27;t instant, but people have noticed over the past three weeks that my skin looks really good.  Give it about four to five weeks and there will be a noticeable difference with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product and I am so far liking it. I love the Radiance line, but I don&#x27;t like the added fragrance - I find it both unpleasant, unnecessary, and undesirable in a natural product. I find this product to be suitable moisturizing without being too heavy, but then again the heat and humidity of summer haven&#x27;t hit yet, so we&#x27;ll see what I think in a month! I haven&#x27;t tried other natural SPF + face lotion combos, so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, needs a lot of moisture but is prone to break outs with the use of certain products. I do not like skin care with fragrance in it and this stuff is WAY too smelly! It smells good, but my skin no likey. It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for my skin either, and has cause extra break out. A little does go a long way though, I have been using it every morning for six months.  IN SHORT: Won&#x27;t be buying this product again, highly fragranced and not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> My only hang up about this lotion other than price is the  white film it leaves and it is hard to rub in. Other than that it does give your skin a radiant glow. I use this in the morning with Burt Bee&#x27;s Acne lotion.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I expected a truly amazing product.  I was unimpressed, however.  This product left a filmy residue on my face and when I rubbed at it, it seemed as if I were rubbing little bits of glue from my face.  I noticed no change in my skin&#x27;s texture or appearance, just the residue.  Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to purchase more natural and organic products, so I figured I&#x27;d give this product a try. After enjoying the first bottle, I went back to an Olay product and noticed that I had more blemishes and dry skin problems, so I switched back to Burt&#x27;s Bees! I do wish the product was less expensive, especially when you get a smaller quantity of it (at least you can take it on an airplane though!), but I will say this bottle lasts quite a while. It is also much less expensive than the majority of natural/organic facial lotions.   I have noticed that several people have mentioned white residue from the lotion. I think the people having this issue are using too much lotion. I usually wash my face with tea tree oil soap and then apply this lotion when my face is still damp. You only need one pump of the lotion! One pump of lotion easily covers my entire face. I only notice the color of the lotion if there is too much on part of my face. Rub it in well and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. I also really like the fragrance of this lotion. The consistency is a bit thicker than other brands, but it works really well for my skin, which is pretty sensitive, so I really like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am trying to use more natural products. I haven&#x27;t used this lotion very long (a couple of weeks) but it is light and absorbs very quickly. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything and seems to be a good base under my makeup. My skin stays properly moisturized throughout the day, without getting too oily or dry anywhere. If it keeps working like this, I am giving up my old moisturizer for this one!</li>
            <li> This lotion does have a scent but I think it smells great and is in no way overpowering. It lasts a long time (about 6 months) and does not have any sulfates, parabens, phthalates, or petrochemicals. The SPF 15 is a must and hard to find with natural ingredients in a moisturizer. It is much lighter than the night cream and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now.  I wanted the Ageless Day Lotion but it does not come with SPF so opted for this.  I love it, it makes my face feel fresh and clean and I rarely wear makeup now.  When I got my hair cut, my hairdresser commented on how even toned my skin looked and was amazed that I didn&#x27;t have any makeup on.  I use the Ageless Night Creme (for about one month now) and am really happy with that too.  I don&#x27;t have laugh lines or wrinkles so can&#x27;t say if it helped with those or not but overall my skin is feeling better and I do not have the typical dry skin I get in the winter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t love this product. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this one doesn&#x27;t knock my socks off. I don&#x27;t really like the smell (it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell good). It is very light and absorbs well. I do generally apply once or twice per day. It&#x27;s a good product, but not the best.</li>
            <li> This review is from: Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Day Lotion, 2-Ounce Bottle (Health and Beauty)   I bought this really wanting to like it. I became a fan some time ago of Burt&#x27;s Bees hand lotions and wanted to find an equally excellent face lotion, so I bought this at my local Fred Meyer&#x27;s. I was really disappointed... one thing I love about natural products, besides the ingredients, are the fragrances (or relative lack thereof). This one had a sickly perfume scent to it that gave me headaches and made me sneeze. Granted, I&#x27;m sensitive to frangrances, especially certain floral fragrences. This is a warning for those people who are sensitive to smell... either try a different product or find a place with a tester to see what your tolerance is. I kept mine for a while, hoping that my PMS caused a hyper-sensitive reaction to the fragrance, but I eventually gave up and tossed it. The other thing that bothered me about this product was that it dried really quickly and made my normal/dry skin feel somewhat oily. Overall, I was surprisingly unimpressed by this product, and for people with sensitivity to smell, I&#x27;d recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Moisturizing Creme instead. It&#x27;s a bit heavier, since it&#x27;s a creme formula, but a little goes a long way and you just gently massage it into the skin. I love the way it smells and it seems to suit my skin type.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Night Cream. Needless today say this day cream does not live up to my expectations. I&#x27;ve used the product for a few weeks now and I must say that I am confused by all the positive reviews.  It is even more confusing if you actually read the reviews, because several people talk about how they don&#x27;t like it, yet give it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, about the product...it is very chalky and difficult to rub in.  If I touch or rub my face after it dries, it results in glue like residue flaking off.  My boyfriend even pointed it out (and it takes a lot for him to notice something, haha).  Forget about applying makeup over it.  I am using the rest of the bottle by mixing it with another lotion.  There are a lot better lotions out there to choose from, I would avoid this one.</li>
            <li> I got tired of smearing products on my face that boast a wide array of chemicals that we ultimately don&#x27;t know are good or bad for us. That&#x27;s why I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees. With 98.2% of the lotion being natural, I feel much better about using it every day.     I have somewhat difficult skin, prone to acne and oiliness. Whereas this lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to help that (it doesn&#x27;t claim to), it also doesn&#x27;t make it worse! Overall my skin feels softer and looks healthier, and is perhaps a bit less oily than when using other products.     I have not had any issues with residue as some previous reviewers seem to. I just use two small pumps, rub it evenly onto my hands, and then apply it to my face. Two pumps seems to be the perfect amount to evenly cover my face without leaving any excess lotion behind. I think the trick with this lotion is to not use an excessive amount, and to rub it in well. It does have sunblock in it after all, which takes a little extra effort to run in. But overall the consistency allows it to absorb pretty well, and the smell is pleasant. I have sensitive skin and sense of smell, and perfume-type smells tend to give me headaches and irritate my skin. But this lotion has a gentle and natural scent.     Ultimately, it&#x27;s a great lotion that does the job. And to top it off, it&#x27;s almost completely natural! I was initially concerned over the price, but at the rate I&#x27;m going (one application every morning using 2 pumps), this little bottle is going to last many months! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product and I tried many times when applying it (a little less lotion or a little more). Each time I used it, I was left with a visable white residue on my face. It looked like I had patted my face lighly with flour. Instead of using it for the day, I tried using it just at night. It doesn&#x27;t appear to moisturize as well as I hoped. The night lotion is a far better moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film once it dries. I do not reccommend this produt. It is way overpriced and it&#x27;s performance was far below acceptable to me.</li>
            <li> Excited to see that Burt&#x27;s Bees made a sunscreen in a daily facial lotion, I grabbed this right away. It has a nice scent and a very light consistency and the pump is also good and hygienic. However, once applied it has a slightly greasy consistency and if there is another moisturizer applied before it can get clumpy on the face. It also caused my face to look very shiny and greasy, which was odd since I have extremely dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not bad since the sunscreen protection it provides is from ingredients such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, that are safer for the skin. I probably would not buy this again once it is done.</li>
            <li> I use Burt&#x27;s Bees night cream so I decided to give the day lotion a try. It has a very overpowering &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell. Too strong for the face. After a week or so I stopped using it. It was stronger than my perfume! I went back to my old favorite: Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish. Half the price and fragrance free. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I won&#x27;t be buying this lotion again.</li>
            <li> This is a great day lotion and I love the smell.  I personally love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  It has sunscreen but is not greasy and it looks great under make-up.  I have normal to dry skin and I might try the day cream next time just to test it out.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy burtsbees products and this one is definetely great, too. The bad thing is that it does take a long time to absorb into your skin and it feels pretty sticky and heavy for a long time. But after it is done absoring it keeps your skin moisturized for the rest of the day without making your skin greesy or oily.</li>
            <li> This lotion is almost perfect! I will still buy it again because the pros definitely outweigh a small con. This lotion does everything it says it will do. My skin has become so bright so quickly that I&#x27;ve have to stop using my foundation. I don&#x27;t need it anymore. It brightens better than Aveeno&#x27;s Positively radiant. However, the one con is that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I&#x27;d like. But I also have severely dry skin, so I&#x27;m sure it will be adequate for someone with normal skin. I use it with another moisturizer and it&#x27;s perfect! I love it! My skin looks so much younger!</li>
            <li> I really like this SPF 15 facial lotion.  It soaks right in, not greasy at all, smells pleasant and has SPF 15 that does not irritate my face even when working out.  I started using other Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products at the same time and have noticed a difference in skin texture and general smoothness.</li>
            <li> This is more like sunscreen than a daily moisturizer.  It is a bit &#x27;greasy&#x27; for a moisturizer, I was hoping for a daily moisturizer that had sunscreen in it.  I will likely only use it in summer on days I know I will be outside.  But on a positive note, it is a really nice sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t smell like the beach and has a nice texture.  And I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn while wearing it.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle of this lotion and I love it! One bottle lasts about 6 months for me. It&#x27;s a nice light lotion and I love that it is all-natural and has non-chemical sunscreens in it. I have read the other reviews and must say that I have never had a problem with this lotion making me look pale or rubbing off. I am 40 years old with normal skin and I use it every day under my make-up. I use mineral make-up (powder) so maybe that is the difference. My skin looks great!</li>
            <li> This is a light daytime moisturizer that has an SPF so I use it every day. I have been using it for a few months now and it does the job for me.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  My one negative which doesn&#x27;t make me remove a star is that there&#x27;s no expiration printed on the bottle.  Instead the date is printed on the cardboard box.  If I would have known I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased from the seller that says they don&#x27;t include the box.  You don&#x27;t need much of this product and I think it will last me a LONG time.  It&#x27;s pretty thin but goes on nice.  Like all sunscreen products I&#x27;ve ever used if you let it dry and then rub your face it will peel off so you may want to put this on and immediately put foundation on over it.  My skin stays very hydrated using this.  We took a trip back to Utah (we currently live in Oregon where it&#x27;s nice and humid all the time) where it&#x27;s super dry and while the rest of my body was dry my face wasn&#x27;t.  I ended up going to the store and picking up Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion for my arms and legs and my kids to moisturize our itchy, dry, cracking skin.  Burt&#x27;s Bees knows how to make lotion!</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin and have never been able to use any product containing sunscreen without  my face burning and breaking out. This product is amazing!!! My skin feels wonderful, its helped some of the redness and I havent had one breakout. There is a scent which I was a little worried about but there have been no issues. I love it!!</li>
            <li> This lotion works great! It keeps your skin soft and feeling like new, it is a little sticky but definetly worth it :)</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and protects from sun damage.  Very nice natural ingredientsâ€¦feel good on your skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price. I like the fact there is sunscreen in it. Good for your face as a moisturizer too for daytime.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a very fair-skinned person who sunburns really quickly, so everyday sunscreen is super important to me.  most synthetic sunscreens (i.e., everything that ends in \\&quot;benzone\\&quot;) make my eyes sting.  i also happen to be a little acne-prone with combination skin - thick, heavy moisturizers make me break out and also make my face look oily/shiny.  shopping for SPF facial moisturizers is therefore something i try to avoid at all costs - if something works, i&#x27;m sticking with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when bior&amp;eacute; discontinued their dual fusion SPF 30 last year, i stockpiled as much as i could, but the day finally came when the last of it was expired and used up, so i had to start the tedious trial-and-error through new products.  burt&#x27;s bees radiance was the 3rd one i tried, and the only one i could stick with throughout a whole month-long trial.  i&#x27;d avoided it originally because everything i&#x27;ve put on my face in years has \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot; emblazoned all over it and this one certainly doesn&#x27;t, but the market is pretty short on avo/octobenzone-free sunscreens right now, so i gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after 3 months, i can say that i&#x27;m very happy with this product.  2 pumps is enough to cover my face, tips of my ears, and my neck down to my cleavage, and the bottle is about half full still.  it&#x27;s a bit pricier than other store-brand moisturizers, but at this rate, i&#x27;m only going to need to buy a bottle 2-3 times per year, so the cost is very reasonable.  put it on right after washing &amp; drying your face, so that your skin is just slightly damp, and the very lightweight liquid spreads evenly over your skin.  one reviewer noted this product to feel \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; - when you&#x27;ve rubbed in all the moisturizer part, the mineral sunscreen part is still sitting on the surface of your skin, and yes, it does indeed start to feel a little sticky/tacky.  when this texture happens, STOP.  any continued attempts to massage this product into your skin will result in the minerals starting to clump up, resulting in the subtle white film that a different reviewer mentioned.  as long as you don&#x27;t touch your skin for about 15 minutes after you barely start to notice the tacky feel under your fingers, that doesn&#x27;t happen.  after the moisturizer is completely dry, that tacky feeling goes away too, and skin is soft and blissfully not greasy/shiny.  as others have mentioned, this product very much has a fragrance, so try to test it out in a store if you&#x27;re sensitive to scented products.  if you&#x27;ve used other burt&#x27;s bees products (lip balm, for example), the fragrance is pretty familiar - it&#x27;s a lightly floral honey scent that smells very natural, and i&#x27;m sure is due to the ingredient list (royal jelly, various flower extracts) as much as any added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one star off for needing to figure out how to finesse this product, but a very solid 4 stars for smelling nice, effectively defending me from sunburn, and not making me break out.lump up, resulting in the subtle white film that a different reviewer mentioned.  as long as you don&#x27;t touch your skin for about 15 minutes after you barely start to notice the tacky feel under your fingers, that doesn&#x27;t happen.  after the moisturizer is completely dry, that tacky feeling goes away too, and skin is soft and blissfully not greasy/shiny.  as others have mentioned, this product very much has a fragrance, so try to test it out in a store if you&#x27;re sensitive to scented products.  if you&#x27;ve used other burt&#x27;s bees products (lip balm, for example), the fragrance is pretty familiar - it&#x27;s a lightly floral honey scent that smells very natural, and i&#x27;m sure is due to the ingredient list (royal jelly, various flower extracts) as much as any added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one star off for needing to figure out how to finesse this product, but a very solid 4 stars for smelling nice, effectively defending me from sunburn, and not making me break out.</li>
            <li> Taste a bit pungent, after using the skin a bit dry, not moist, as other products. With much more no effect, only with a little amount.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer smells very good, but it peels off very quickly rather than being absorbed. I&#x27;ve read that this product was discontinued last year by Burt&#x27;s Bees due to updated FDA sunscreen regulations testing. It is no longer considered a true SPF 15 by the FDA.</li>
            <li> I do like Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Lotion.  It is important to me to wear sunscreen daily, and I&#x27;m a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was pretty shocked at the perfume-y fragrance of this lotion.  I don&#x27;t wear perfume, so maybe I&#x27;m just not accustomed to it, but I didn&#x27;t expect this from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  In fact, ever since I started using this stuff, I have received compliments on my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;!  So, while it doesn&#x27;t stink, it does have a strong floral fragrance.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who are sensitive to strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, I have found this lotion to be fairly lightweight--considering it contains sunscreen.  I rub the lotion between my hands before I spread it over my neck and face.  Initially, I&#x27;m left with a dewey finish (which to some people might be considered greasy), but it dries just fine.  I should say that I have combination skin, but I tend to be more concerned with my challenges with dry skin.  Thus, I don&#x27;t mind a little dew...especially because this lotion makes my face feel soft and smooth without the burn of some face lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain if Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Lotion makes me look \\&quot;radiant,\\&quot; but it goes on fairly light and takes care of any dryness I might have while leaving me with soft skin.  Plus, the price is reasonable.  I&#x27;m just not so sure of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I tried to find an ideal sunscreen when I moved to sunny Alabama and it looks like it is impossible&lt;br /&gt;This one is the best of all I tried but not ideal of course (I didn&#x27;t buy any expensive one yet, but I tried ALL (all chemical) relatively cheap sunscreens that you can find in Walmart or CVS, they are all the same - too greasy for me and my face looked like I spilled canola oil on it (that also caused pores increasing). That is strange because I have a very nice skin which is normal and absolutely not oily or dry (I dont have pimples at all, may be one once a year and I don&#x27;t fill like my face needs moisturizing)&lt;br /&gt;I tried creams, lotions, sprays and sticks...&lt;br /&gt;This one is slightly oily for the first 20-30 minutes but after skin becomes normal and even moisturized, so I liked it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say about white residue: zinc and titanium oxides are white insoluble powders, so what are you going to expect from cream if cream contains such ingredients? :D Don&#x27;t touch your face after aplying this lotion until your face becomes almost dry and you won&#x27;t have such unpleasant white particles. Anyway for me smooth white residue is much better than shiny face.&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t like, that spf is only 15 but you see what you buy &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;I would agree to have whiter face but higher spf and anyway this is my second mineral sunscreen so I think I can experiment here a lot and finally find my ideal one.</li>
            <li> After scouring the online cosmetics database for safe cosmetic products to use, my husband and I finally settled on Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Lotion with SPF 15 for our daily sunscreen lotion.  It&#x27;s definitely the most gentle one we&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin and seems to sink right into our skin.  I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to absorb right into my skin.  I have to disagree with the few customers who say it smells bad.  I have a very sensitive nose and I find this product smells very natural and pleasant.  We once subscribed to this item using Subscribe and Save and although it isn&#x27;t available right now, we certainly plan to purchase this again.  We love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it moisturized well, but caused my face to brake out and exspired a month after I recieved it.</li>
            <li> i love Burt&#x27;s bees but it was disappointing when i put the lotion on my face, then i started feeling little white stuff on my face it was a sticky mess with the lotion peeling off when it drys out, very bad if you put make up on top of it, i kept using it once in a while but always did the same thing, and it was difficult to take the white stuff off, it was just the lotion peeling off as it dried. i had to wash it off my face :/ the only reason i gave it two stars is because it might protect you against the sun and its natural.</li>
            <li> I love the radiance day cream, and I thought the lotion with SPF 15 would be just the bees knees! It is a little more perfumy than the cream, but seems to be good. I really like the fact that it is a pump rather than getting the lotion under my fingernails every time I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 10/11/11 I have found that over time, the day lotion with SPF 15 is not as moisturizing as the regular day cream. I will be returning to the regular day cream when this tube is gone.</li>
            <li> After using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Active Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 for several weeks, I started looking for a face lotion with SPF that didn&#x27;t contain any harmful ingredients. Being a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products (mainly their shampoos and toothpaste), I decided to give this a try. This cream is much thicker and it never seems to fully absorb into my skin. It also makes me look pale. Even though l&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s moisturizer has SPF 15, it doesn&#x27;t feel like a sunscreen. Unlike Burt&#x27;s Bees, l&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lotion immediately gets absorbed and it gives you a refreshing feeling. Burt&#x27;s Bees does have a slight fragrance, which I don&#x27;t really mind, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long. I&#x27;m going to continue using Burt&#x27;s Bees on most days because I still think that safer ingredients make it worth it but in the mean time I&#x27;ll continue searching for a better (yet still safe) moisturizer.</li>
            <li> illuminating. nice smell, smell goes away completely after application. gives me a slightly whiter tone. dries very quickly. you can put your blush on right after, no make up, power needed. i have an oily skin so for the ones with a dry skin, don&#x27;t go for it, it will make your skin even drier. zinc will always make your skin drier. shame it doesnt come at higher SPF but at least good for the winter. nice cute bottle (for the ones who care). will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product was discontinued last year by Burt&#x27;s Bees due to updated FDA sunscreen regulations testing. It is no longer considered a true SPF 15 by the FDA and forbidden to be sold. It should not be sold or purchased by consumers.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I&#x27;ve used it all up and looking to buy a new one.  This lotion is very smooth and sheer and surprisingly it&#x27;s not greasy at the end of long day&#x27;s work.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a strong, unpleasant flowery scent. It doesnt absorb into skin well, and looks chalky. I was very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell was far to over bearing for me to get past.  It has a real strong perfume smell and after a couple uses I ended up tossing it because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> Loves this lotion because it does not leave your skin feeling oily or weighed down.  It also gives UV protection which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am not a person that is big on using lotion unless I feel the absolute need to, except for this. I received a sample in the mail and loved how it made my skin feel. Several people have even told me, &amp;#34;your face looks so vibrant and healthy!&amp;#34; - which is nice to hear because I always look so drained and tired. The Burt&#x27;s Bees products get a little expensive so I prefer NOT to try any of their other kinds because I am sure I will love those too but I will end up having to get a second mortgage to buy them. Really recommend this product though!</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see this on the Prime list and it arrived fresh and new and I was thrilled with the way my skin felt. So lovely. Thank you for the quality!</li>
            <li> like it but not loving the sunscreen smell, although not sure you can get away from that either</li>
            <li> this product works really well! for some reason most places online only have spf 30 and spf 7 in this product line, (which is odd... who would use spf 7, it&#x27;s not even worth it). I was glad to have found the spf 15 product. It goes on really well even though at first it may seem runny. However, it really is moisturizing as you can feel even later in the day, it protects your skin from the wind and cold. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I looked at the ingredients and realized that the strong scent was actually an added fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lighter moisturizer that had SPF and this fits the bill perfectly. It&#x27;s super light and it absorbs without leaving a greasy feeling. I think it&#x27;s a tad expensive but a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff seems to be pricey to me so that&#x27;s just a personal observation. I like this brand and I will buy it again definitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started buying a lot of my beauty products online, it seems like every time I find a product I love the stores stop carrying it regularly, so being able to get exactly what I want shipped to my house has been really great.</li>
            <li> This irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product.  One minute after applying it to my face, my skin turned very red, almost like I&#x27;d been sitting in the sun too long.  A few hours in, my skin started to feel itchy, and when I glanced in a mirror, the redness hadn&#x27;t faded and the lotion seemed to be sitting in a thin film on top of my skin.  Just didn&#x27;t absorb well.  I&#x27;d rather have worn Coppertone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strong smell, but I think it&#x27;s wonderful.  And to be honest, I am a loyal user of the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms and chapsticks, as well as their After-Sun Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this sunscreen is definitely a no-go for sensitive skin people like me.  One use and I sent it to the trash.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and was recommended this Burt Bees Radiance Day Lotion to use as a face sun screen as Burt&#x27;s Bees tends to be a line that caters to sensitive skin people by using (almost) all natural products.  Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with it.  First of all, it feels extremely oily when you put it on.  After rubbing it into my face, I noticed that I looked considerably oily.  I figured this would wear off after a little bit of time, but it remained that way which I did not care for.  Also, it has a noticeable sunscreen smell to it.  I was thinking that this would have a little less of a scent to it and smell more like their normal radiance lotion but it smelled distinctly like sunscreen.  For someone who does not particularly enjoy this scent or for someone who is very sensitive to scented lotions, this is problematic.  The scent made my eyes water.  Additionally, I noticed that after wearing this sunscreen for 3 or 4 days I started to breakout along my jaw line and T-zone.  After I stopped applying the sunscreen, I noticed that it went away.  I will say that it does its job in protecting you from a sunburn. I only applied once a day and I noticed that even though I was outside for about 6 hours on a particularly sunny day, I did not get a sunburn.  However, for people that are sensitive to scents and heavy lotions, you may be better served with a more hypoallergenic sunscreen than this one.</li>
