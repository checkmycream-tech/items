            <li>the colors great, the product is great, but this bottle was so tiny</li>
            <li>I find you have to have a very light touch</li>
            <li>I have the t zone skin like most people have and</li>
            <li>Love this line of make up.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite blush.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about how healthy I look or if I have been outdoors, on vacation, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this color and ease of putting on</li>
            <li>It is a better buy to purchase the full size.  </li>
            <li>This color looks great on most complexions and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Just sweep it on cheekbones with a good brush for a very natural look.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals products make my skin feel good all over.  </li>
            <li>either makeup was too dry for my cheeks and great on my nose and chin or vice versa.  </li>
            <li>Bare minerals have always been a  top quality and what I will always use, I love this color on my checks.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Very very misleadingly!</li>
            <li>but I asked a coworker what she used one time because she rarely ever touched up her makeup throughout the day</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite all over color.</li>
            <li>and I used it for a couple years, even though i wear makeup EVERY single day, which I thought was pretty good product longevity.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>; Just be more open about the sizes, please!</li>
            <li>I know it is supposed to be for blush, but you will LOVE IT for hazel, green, light brown eyes as an eye shadow.</li>
            <li>This is a dark rose with a hint of plum.  </li>
            <li>It was a large pot</li>
            <li>or you end up with too much color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much warmer tone than what I had before.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments and it shocks women when I tell them it&#x27;s really for the cheeks.</li>
            <li>:/ love the product though!</li>
            <li>They last all day with nary a touch up and stay true.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a decent price when I ordered it, when I opened the package, I thought, &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>I have green eyes and the best eye shadow for green eyes is this Bare Escentuals Glee.</li>
            <li>I use the medium foundation, Glee all over face color for blush and a little around the rest of my face, then the mineral veil on top of that and aside from mascara I am done.  </li>
            <li>I only wear Bare Minerals blush and I have several other colors, (Beauty-a warm pink, perfect for light skin; Dusk-a dark peach, Clear Radiance-a highlighting powder with a hint of pink; Pearl Blossom-</li>
            <li>It also looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I have had several of the blushes for years and have yet to use a single one completely, so they are very economical.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a transition color in my crease, it&#x27;s so natural.</li>
            <li>always looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell how big these bottles are online, &amp; I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to investigate, I wish the sellers would have a photo of the bottle for sale next to a Quarter or Pencil or something where we can actually see the product next to something we&#x27;re familiar with.</li>
            <li>They are rich in pigment so you only need a little bit on the brush.  </li>
            <li>The container is so tiny, not exactly easy to &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; your brush, as you cannot fit the blush brush in the lid to obtain the color.  </li>
            <li>She said Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>I use &amp;#34;Glee&amp;#34; by Bare Minerals EVERY DAY &amp; have for over 10 years,</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Bare Escentuals Glee.</li>
            <li>I received this in the initial kit, along with Warmth, which was much too dark.  </li>
            <li>My old color was &amp;#34;glee&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s what I ordered this time, but its clearly not the same shade.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because Glee is too dark for me.</li>

            <li> I use this as a transition color in my crease, it&#x27;s so natural.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Bare Escentuals Glee. I use it as a blush and am very pleased with how it works.</li>
            <li> Bare minerals have always been a  top quality and what I will always use, I love this color on my checks.</li>
            <li> The container is so tiny, not exactly easy to &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; your brush, as you cannot fit the blush brush in the lid to obtain the color.  I find you have to have a very light touch or you end up with too much color. I would not want glee all over!  Would advise watch size of containers when purchasing.</li>
            <li> Now that I have found Amazon with my prime membership two day shipping I will NEVER buy this from Ulta again.  I love Bare Minerals and have used it for years.  I have the t zone skin like most people have and either makeup was too dry for my cheeks and great on my nose and chin or vice versa.  Bare Minerals products make my skin feel good all over.  Before using these products I usually couldn&#x27;t wait to run to the sink to wash the makeup off my face but I actually forget sometimes to wash my face before I go to bed because you don&#x27;t feel it.  It also looks very natural.  I was skeptical when I saw all the infomercials when the products were fairly new but I asked a coworker what she used one time because she rarely ever touched up her makeup throughout the day and she always looked awesome.  She said Bare Minerals.  I was hooked since then.  I use the medium foundation, Glee all over face color for blush and a little around the rest of my face, then the mineral veil on top of that and aside from mascara I am done.  You can even use a little extra foundation with a small brush to touch up the areas under the eyes and to cover blemishes a little better.  I will never go back to other kinds of makeup.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Love this line of make up. Arrived quickly. Product sealed perfectly. This color looks great on most complexions and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get a bigger jar next time.</li>
            <li> Great all over cover but I wish they came with the sliding open and close container</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blush. Just sweep it on cheekbones with a good brush for a very natural look. Lasts forever, and goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell how big these bottles are online, &amp; I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to investigate, I wish the sellers would have a photo of the bottle for sale next to a Quarter or Pencil or something where we can actually see the product next to something we&#x27;re familiar with. I use &amp;#34;Glee&amp;#34; by Bare Minerals EVERY DAY &amp; have for over 10 years, the colors great, the product is great, but this bottle was so tiny, it&#x27;s the same size as their regular eye shadow jars. I thought it was a decent price when I ordered it, when I opened the package, I thought, &amp;#34;Oh that&#x27;s why!&amp;#34; Just be more open about the sizes, please!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little too fair to get great use out of this color but its still beautiful. I use it as a bronzer sometimes during winter for that pinkish glow and a blush for the summer when I&#x27;m alittle darker.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments about how healthy I look or if I have been outdoors, on vacation, etc.&lt;br /&gt;It always looks natural.  Love it!</li>
            <li> very small for the price - and I guess it is my fault for not checking before I bought it :/ love the product though!</li>
            <li> I had some bare escentuals blush from a long time ago that I had been wearing. It was a large pot and I used it for a couple years, even though i wear makeup EVERY single day, which I thought was pretty good product longevity. My old color was &amp;#34;glee&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s what I ordered this time, but its clearly not the same shade. It&#x27;s a much warmer tone than what I had before. It&#x27;s not awful and I&#x27;m not sending it back, but this will teach me to buy blush on the Internet :(</li>
            <li> Good product. I will order a larger one now that I have tried it.</li>
            <li> This is a dark rose with a hint of plum.  It is perfect for medium skin, however, I am light and I don&#x27;t use it very often.  I received this in the initial kit, along with Warmth, which was much too dark.  I only wear Bare Minerals blush and I have several other colors, (Beauty-a warm pink, perfect for light skin; Dusk-a dark peach, Clear Radiance-a highlighting powder with a hint of pink; Pearl Blossom-a beautiful rose with a subtle shimmer; Fruit Cocktail-a very bright rose, perfect for evening).  They last all day with nary a touch up and stay true.  They are rich in pigment so you only need a little bit on the brush.  I have had several of the blushes for years and have yet to use a single one completely, so they are very economical.  Be aware that some of the lower priced blushes on Amazon are travel sizes, which are very, very small.  It is a better buy to purchase the full size.  I highly recommend this product and the only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because Glee is too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful youthful glow and just the right amount, does not look made up. love this color and ease of putting on</li>
            <li> I have green eyes and the best eye shadow for green eyes is this Bare Escentuals Glee. I know it is supposed to be for blush, but you will LOVE IT for hazel, green, light brown eyes as an eye shadow. It stays on all day. I have used it for years. I get a lot of compliments and it shocks women when I tell them it&#x27;s really for the cheeks.</li>
            <li> This was a very tiny size... I didn&#x27;t realize that when I purchased it.. Would not buy from this company again...its a sample size? Very very misleadingly!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite all over color. This brand has the best products! The price is cheaper than buying at Ulta.</li>
