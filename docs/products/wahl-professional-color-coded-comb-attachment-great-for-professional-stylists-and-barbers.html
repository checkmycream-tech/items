    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect .. Amazon is the best place for online shopping.</li>
            <li>Excellent!!!!!!</li>
            <li>its perfect for the blends and fades.  </li>
            <li>Fits perfectly and helps out a lot with doing fades!</li>
            <li>Perfect for its use.</li>
            <li>The perfect size!  </li>
            <li>Perfect 1.5 guard!!</li>
            <li>This guard works great.</li>
            <li>We are happy.</li>
            <li>Great for blending.</li>
            <li>when it FITS!&lt;br /&gt;WAHL was doing GREAT, but their 1 1/2 (3/16 in.)</li>
            <li>This is a great attachment and it is not lose on the Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>, I do not recommend you use them for Wahl clippers, I honestly don&#x27;t know what clippers you&#x27;re even supposed to use them for if they don&#x27;t work with the ones they were specifically designed for?!</li>
            <li>Good length for beard trimming</li>
            <li>Does not seem to be a 100% perfect fit for my wahl chrome pros but does do the job.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect length, exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>and I ended up with a nice bald spot on top of my head.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more comb teeth.</li>
            <li>The 1 1/2 allows me to do better fades.</li>
            <li>i love that this exists and you can buy it.</li>
            <li>This is an PHENOMENAL guard....</li>
            <li>The reason this logic is incorrect is because as the blade gets closer to the scalp (#1.5 versus #2), it grabs the hair much better...</li>
            <li>Works perfectly with the Wahl 84701 Professional Super Taper II Hair Clipper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>The product fits my Wahl Color Pro 20 perfectly, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it falling off like some of the other reviews say.</li>
            <li>but teeth bend too easily</li>
            <li>Fit perfect and arrived before expected date.</li>
            <li>They must have corrected any of the issues mentioned in other reviews (like improper fit) because mine received in January of 2015 works perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked fine, but my hair is now shorter than I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have both the #1 and #2 attachments and both of them fit fine.</li>
            <li>Everyone who said this doesn&#x27;t fit well is correct.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced the same thing.  </li>
            <li>The missing link between the 3mm and the 6mm clip for that perfect fade.</li>
            <li>The shear attachment didn&#x27;t really fit well.</li>
            <li>Great for achieving that blend between 1 and 2, which is a big jump.</li>
            <li>(so I can have all the available lengths)</li>
            <li>Fits the clipper perfect, I have a standard wahl clipper nothing professional at all.</li>
            <li>Great clip its a lil loose hold on my clippers but this clip makes fades come thru.</li>
            <li>It does the job but nothing really special.</li>
            <li>you have to be careful when buzzing your hair or a chunk will fly off.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviews it&#x27;s great at 1st</li>
            <li>While it certainly does get the job done, it&#x27;s made cheaply and does not stay secured on the clippers.</li>
            <li>Great substitute for the attachment we misplaced.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t love that it falls off the clipper frequently.</li>
            <li>It moves around quite a bit and doesn&#x27;t match right with the teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this problem with a #2 guard before, and once I replaced it, the new one was fine.</li>
            <li>For some reason the 2 corner blades are super flimsy and it doesn&#x27;t really attach correctly to the wahl razor.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted, will buy another for backup.</li>
            <li>Is another good guard to have, but I did have trouble snapping it on a couple times.</li>
            <li>After only a few uses, started slipping  here and there, like many this short tend to do, but it cuts a good length and is a great price.</li>
            <li>They do fall off at certain angles with not too much pressure needed.</li>
            <li>This can only SECURELY fit certain models of Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I pretty much just bought it to complete my set.</li>
            <li>so make sure you don&#x27;t put to much pressure or it will cut unevenly.</li>
            <li>it begin to fit loosely on the clippers.</li>
            <li>its the guard that doesn&#x27;t come with the normal guard system.</li>
            <li>The #1/2 is the only disappointment as the teeth dont match the clipper teeth but the others are perfect.</li>
            <li>it works fine dispite all the other reviews about the product not fitting the clipper it fits fine.</li>
            <li>but it still falls off frequently.  </li>
            <li>it makes my guard system complete.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a fixed version of the 1.5 length, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>and I hope this is the fixed version.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>and then you&#x27;ll touch your head with the clippers without an attachemnt, and have to shave your whole head or have a giant divet in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marked like a wahl product, but I suspect it&#x27;s some junky knock off, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>Makes the step from the 2 to the 1 seamless.</li>
            <li>Why couldn&#x27;t they simply design it to fit well like all the other attachments?  </li>
            <li>This size is a necessary component if you want to cut a decent fade type hairstyle.</li>
            <li>It fits fine and isn&#x27;t any more flimsy or stiff than the other attachments that came with it - the only difference is the color (the rest of mine are black)</li>
            <li>Save the couple bucks and buy new clippers to get the crucial 1 1/2 guard.</li>
            <li>It fits no problem even though our WAHL is several years old, and it cuts between the 1 and 2.  </li>
            <li>said they fixed it and re-released their guard, I&#x27;m currently on my second 1 1/2 guard</li>
            <li>SO there&#x27;s a good chance it&#x27;ll fall off while cutting your hair</li>
            <li>but the 1 went too far and left me with that white looking scalp.  </li>
            <li>This Attachment is the width of the professional width trimmers, but it also works with the smaller personal one (it just overhangs on the sides).</li>
            <li>You need this to get a good fade, especially when cutting kids or yourself.</li>
            <li>Worked well at first, but after a few months of use (I cut my hair twice a month)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This particular Wahl attachment for some reason does not fit my Wahl clippers that well.</li>
            <li> It seems that they fixed the previous problem with the 1 1/2&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The part that attaches to the back of the clipper head is just a bit too wide.  </li>
            <li> above all, be careful not to scalp anyone.</li>
            <li> This guard falls off the clipper too easily while cutting hair and can cost you a client.</li>
            <li> So there is nothing wrong with this product, it is the right size, I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it not fitting my buzzer or falling off, I think the reviews that say that are old and no longer</li>
            <li> I always wanted my sides and back a little bit shorter than a 2</li>
            <li> The plastic is flimsy and fits loosely compared to the other guards that come with the kit.</li>
            <li> We have a WAHL kit that comes with a traditional set of combs, and I long complained to my husband I wished there was a comb between the #1 and #2.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much useless unless you want to risk gouging your hair if it falls off.</li>
            <li> The vibrations and cutting of the clippers slowly but surely tears away at the guard</li>
            <li> I may buy a #2 and file it down for a custom #</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:555fca682dd838a76e02eb1001eac7da]]I have to agree with the other reviewers who say this does not fit snug.</li>
            <li> because half way between a #1 and a #2 comb is not #1.5(3/16th) as you would think.</li>
            <li> It does wobble a little bit</li>
            <li> Does not fit well on all wahl clippers.  </li>
            <li> conversely, as the size gets bigger it grabs the hair exponentially worse.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this one got screwed up.</li>
            <li> Beware, this attachment does not fit the Wahl Chrome Pro clippers well at all!</li>
            <li> On my second shave with this attachment the backside of the guards went into the blade and got chewed up, at the point it was useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems like this specific #1.5 has flimsier plastic.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Hard to find size!</li>
            <li> Annoying, but it still generally gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Spent years looking for this 1.5 size and for some reason never looked on amazon, that was stupid!</li>
            <li> Disappointing and very frustrating.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Everyone who said this doesn&#x27;t fit well is correct.  I&#x27;ve experienced the same thing.  I&#x27;ve glued chips of plastic in a couple of places to try and keep it in place but it still falls off frequently.  Why couldn&#x27;t they simply design it to fit well like all the other attachments?  Disappointing and very frustrating.</li>
            <li> It works on one of my two clippers. It does wobble a little bit so make sure you don&#x27;t put to much pressure or it will cut unevenly.</li>
            <li> The missing link between the 3mm and the 6mm clip for that perfect fade.</li>
            <li> Perfect .. Amazon is the best place for online shopping.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t come in any of the sets I have seen, and as such I had to order it separately. This size is a necessary component if you want to cut a decent fade type hairstyle.</li>
            <li> This can only SECURELY fit certain models of Wahl clippers. They do fall off at certain angles with not too much pressure needed. Beware of scalping!</li>
            <li> Great clip its a lil loose hold on my clippers but this clip makes fades come thru.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a bit, but falls off too often.  The part that attaches to the back of the clipper head is just a bit too wide.  Annoying, but it still generally gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I use this for my neat looking beard trim. I wish it had more comb teeth.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!!!! Fits the clipper perfect, I have a standard wahl clipper nothing professional at all. It&#x27;s sturdy and worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> This guard works great. The 1 1/2 allows me to do better fades.</li>
            <li> i love that this exists and you can buy it. i don&#x27;t love that it falls off the clipper frequently. you have to be careful when buzzing your hair or a chunk will fly off. make it tighter</li>
            <li> Fit perfect and arrived before expected date.</li>
            <li> it makes my guard system complete.  its perfect for the blends and fades.  its the guard that doesn&#x27;t come with the normal guard system.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and helps out a lot with doing fades!</li>
            <li> Perfect for its use. Somewhow theres a big difference between the #1 and the #2 clip, yes even with the adjustment of the blade, this takes care of that.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a fixed version of the 1.5 length, but it&#x27;s not. It doesn&#x27;t stay on the clipper well and the combs are so flexible they bend and get caught on the tips of the clipper blades. It&#x27;s pretty much useless unless you want to risk gouging your hair if it falls off.</li>
            <li> This works. We have a WAHL kit that comes with a traditional set of combs, and I long complained to my husband I wished there was a comb between the #1 and #2.  So we ordered one. It fits no problem even though our WAHL is several years old, and it cuts between the 1 and 2.  We are happy.</li>
            <li> While it certainly does get the job done, it&#x27;s made cheaply and does not stay secured on the clippers. I have to reattach several times during the haircut.</li>
            <li> Does not fit well on all wahl clippers.  flimsy.</li>
            <li> The shear attachment didn&#x27;t really fit well. For some reason the 2 corner blades are super flimsy and it doesn&#x27;t really attach correctly to the wahl razor.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Great for blending. Must to have for clipper cut</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, started slipping  here and there, like many this short tend to do, but it cuts a good length and is a great price. Just maybe buy two so you have a backup and, above all, be careful not to scalp anyone.</li>
            <li> Worked well at first, but after a few months of use (I cut my hair twice a month) it begin to fit loosely on the clippers.</li>
            <li> Good length for beard trimming so I&#x27;m told. Works perfectly with the Wahl 84701 Professional Super Taper II Hair Clipper.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews it&#x27;s great at 1st but teeth bend too easily</li>

It moves around quite a bit and doesn&#x27;t match right with the teeth. I have both the #1 and #2 attachments and both of them fit fine. Not sure why this one got screwed up.</li>
            <li> The product fits my Wahl Color Pro 20 perfectly, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it falling off like some of the other reviews say.</li>
            <li> The perfect size!  I always wanted my sides and back a little bit shorter than a 2 but the 1 went too far and left me with that white looking scalp.  This is the perfect length, exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> This guard is the s***</li>
            <li> Beware, this attachment does not fit the Wahl Chrome Pro clippers well at all! The plastic is flimsy and fits loosely compared to the other guards that come with the kit. On my second shave with this attachment the backside of the guards went into the blade and got chewed up, at the point it was useless. I tried to finish my haircut with it and it fell off mid stroke and I ended up with a nice bald spot on top of my head. I&#x27;d stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> This is an PHENOMENAL guard.... when it FITS!&lt;br /&gt;WAHL was doing GREAT, but their 1 1/2 (3/16 in.) FALLS OFF!&lt;br /&gt;Wahl said they fixed it and re-released their guard, I&#x27;m currently on my second 1 1/2 guard and I hope this is the fixed version.&lt;br /&gt;Not about to blow money AGAIN if it the guard is defective! WAHL we need answers...</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  the clipper i had didnt have the three smallest combs so i bought the #1/2 and the #1 and #1-1/2.  The #1/2 is the only disappointment as the teeth dont match the clipper teeth but the others are perfect.</li>
            <li> This guard falls off the clipper too easily while cutting hair and can cost you a client. The vibrations and cutting of the clippers slowly but surely tears away at the guard, I do not recommend you use them for Wahl clippers, I honestly don&#x27;t know what clippers you&#x27;re even supposed to use them for if they don&#x27;t work with the ones they were specifically designed for?!</li>
            <li> Spent years looking for this 1.5 size and for some reason never looked on amazon, that was stupid! Exactly what i wanted, will buy another for backup.</li>
            <li> needed a replacement it works fine dispite all the other reviews about the product not fitting the clipper it fits fine.</li>
            <li> Is another good guard to have, but I did have trouble snapping it on a couple times. Does not seem to be a 100% perfect fit for my wahl chrome pros but does do the job.</li>
            <li> Fits both of my Wahl trimmers. This Attachment is the width of the professional width trimmers, but it also works with the smaller personal one (it just overhangs on the sides).</li>
            <li> Junk, it almost comes off when you&#x27;re using it. SO there&#x27;s a good chance it&#x27;ll fall off while cutting your hair and then you&#x27;ll touch your head with the clippers without an attachemnt, and have to shave your whole head or have a giant divet in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marked like a wahl product, but I suspect it&#x27;s some junky knock off, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This particular Wahl attachment for some reason does not fit my Wahl clippers that well. It&#x27;s plastic bends out of place and then slips on the guard. I&#x27;ve had this problem with a #2 guard before, and once I replaced it, the new one was fine. Unfortunately, it seems like this specific #1.5 has flimsier plastic.</li>
            <li> It does the job but nothing really special. I pretty much just bought it to complete my set. Haven&#x27;t even used it yet.</li>
            <li> This is a great attachment and it is not lose on the Wahl clippers. It seems that they fixed the previous problem with the 1 1/2&#x27;s</li>
            <li> So there is nothing wrong with this product, it is the right size, I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it not fitting my buzzer or falling off, I think the reviews that say that are old and no longer apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars.... because half way between a #1 and a #2 comb is not #1.5(3/16th) as you would think. The reason this logic is incorrect is because as the blade gets closer to the scalp (#1.5 versus #2), it grabs the hair much better... conversely, as the size gets bigger it grabs the hair exponentially worse. What all the means is that the #2 leaves the hair substantially longer than the #1.5. The #1.5 is almost as close a buzz as the #1. It has to do with the hair bending over when using the #2, but not bending when using a shorter spacer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked fine, but my hair is now shorter than I wanted. Like I said, almost as short as it would be with the #1. What is needed then is a #1.75 (7/32nd). I somehow don&#x27;t think that will happen.  I may buy a #2 and file it down for a custom #1.75.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Crewcut</li>
            <li> They must have corrected any of the issues mentioned in other reviews (like improper fit) because mine received in January of 2015 works perfectly. Great for achieving that blend between 1 and 2, which is a big jump.</li>
            <li> bought this to finish out my attachment collection (so I can have all the available lengths) It fits fine and isn&#x27;t any more flimsy or stiff than the other attachments that came with it - the only difference is the color (the rest of mine are black)</li>
            <li> Attachment constantly falls off.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on. Save the couple bucks and buy new clippers to get the crucial 1 1/2 guard.</li>
            <li> Perfect 1.5 guard!! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Great substitute for the attachment we misplaced.  Hard to find size!</li>
            <li> Fits well to both my Wahl clippers. You need this to get a good fade, especially when cutting kids or yourself. Makes the step from the 2 to the 1 seamless.</li>
