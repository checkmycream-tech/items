            <li> But my drivers for this purchase were cost, quantity, and it should be marketed for an older girl.  </li>
            <li> I looked around, and real name brand makeup is expensive...  </li>
            <li> This is the cutest little makeup kit it has everything that I need in one package.</li>
            <li> I felt she was missing out on getting/playing  Makeup, since I don&#x27;t have any.  </li>
            <li> The case is hard plastic and folds to about the size of a wallet.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately i was really upset that the colors and the blush was really bad..</li>

            <li> I bought this for my daughter who likes to play dress up. It&#x27;s cheap in price but not too cheap in quality. I wouldn&#x27;t use it but I am picky with my makeup.</li>
            <li> I really really liked the item but i received it all messed up...i wish i can order ut again but unfortunately i was really upset that the colors and the blush was really bad..</li>
            <li> I love this set. Pretty colors and the kit folds up nicely so I can just toss it into my purse. Very handy!</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister for a Xmas gift. She is 10 and really into make up. So I found this and decided to give it a shot. She loved it! Especially since it folds up and looks like a clutch purse. Such a cute gift to get girls that like make up.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters love it for dress up / make up play time.</li>
            <li> It is the size of a medium clutch purse.</li>
            <li> I got this for my pre-teen daughter.  I felt she was missing out on getting/playing  Makeup, since I don&#x27;t have any.  I looked around, and real name brand makeup is expensive...  Not that I&#x27;m saying this isn&#x27;t name brand.  I just could not see me handing the kid a $50 set of makeup, to be destroyed in a week.  This was great!  Cheap, I don&#x27;t care if she destroys it all immediately.  It appears to be of a good quality.  But my drivers for this purchase were cost, quantity, and it should be marketed for an older girl.  She &#x27;s happy, therefore I am happy.</li>
