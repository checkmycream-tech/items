            <li>I have experienced a considerable amount of discomfort including redness, swelling, peeling, burning and a rash.</li>
            <li>and I continue to use it as a light glycolic peel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall alcohol being a part of the original formula.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit \\&quot;sting-y\\&quot; when you&#x27;re first using it, but that fades over time and my skin looks better.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering another way right away!</li>
            <li>My previous experience with the product was great.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says it will!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Miracle Care!</li>
            <li>My complexion was always challenging since my teen years, and every month during my Moon Cycle, my face would tend to break out.  </li>
            <li>We have been using this product for the last 6 years and we really love the way it works.</li>
            <li>and yes, still have acne and blackheads), and this combo is the only one that has reliably and consistently kept me acne-free and is kind to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and the first bottle I bought actually did last 6 weeks, which is surprising.</li>
            <li>It clears up pimples quickly, prevents new ones, and my skin even looks smoother.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it had any effect on my pimples, as they seem to be living a good life with threats of this product.</li>
            <li>It really did \\&quot;erase\\</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>I definitely a prefer the original formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past two months and my skin looks better than ever!</li>
            <li>it last a long time and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I also started noticing sun spots as I got older.  </li>
            <li>Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li>(It does not happen over night, but works as well as those high priced cosmetics.)</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT: After it dries on your skin, apply a lotion or your skill will dry out a bunch!</li>
            <li>In combination with Nelson&#x27;s Pure and Clear Acne gel, which I use all over my face twice a day rather than as a spot treatment, my acne has virtually disappeared.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now costing almost exactly double what my first bottle cost me 8 years ago! ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li>it also dries out red pimples pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I now have a few more</li>
            <li>It is clear and light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t bleach your towels like other pimple meds</li>
            <li>, it can be a little drying, however if you pair it with a moisturizer you should be fine.</li>
            <li>The solution seems to have changed a little and is slightly less effective, but still a decent product.</li>
            <li>So far after 3 weeks, it seems to be working well.</li>
            <li>It really fades age spots, I had several on my face</li>
            <li>However, this round appears to suggest a change in the original chemistry of the product.</li>

            <li>but less when I&#x27;m consistently using this.  </li>
            <li>But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is it keeps getting more and more expensive!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it works on your acne</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> So far after 3 weeks, it seems to be working well. I put it on my face at night. YES, it does sting but it also tightens your skin at the same time. I like the way I can feel it working. Complexion has cleared up quite a bit. IMPORTANT: After it dries on your skin, apply a lotion or your skill will dry out a bunch! Apply lotion and your good to go! I will be ordering another way right away!</li>
            <li> I have difficult to treat adult acne, and I have used this product for years.  It is expensive, but a little goes a long way.  It works better than salicylic acid or benzoil peroxide.  I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years.  The solution seems to have changed a little and is slightly less effective, but still a decent product. My only complaint is it keeps getting more and more expensive!  If the price keeps going up, I will have to find a different product as it is getting a little ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, my acne redness decreased, my zits and bumps got smaller and my skin got smoother overall.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using Pimple Eraser for over a year, and have bought several bottles.  It doesn&#x27;t sting at all, and I use it twice a day immediately after cleansing with a Clarisonic.  In combination with Nelson&#x27;s Pure and Clear Acne gel, which I use all over my face twice a day rather than as a spot treatment, my acne has virtually disappeared.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many acne remedies over the years (I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and yes, still have acne and blackheads), and this combo is the only one that has reliably and consistently kept me acne-free and is kind to my sensitive skin.  If I stop using one or the other, acne and bumps inevitably appear.  Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have used it for well over a year and my ingrown hairs are much less of a problem now than ever before in my life! and now with the cleanser it&#x27;s the perfect package. Thanks Miracle Care!</li>
            <li> I would have given a 5 star rating in the past. My previous experience with the product was great. However, this round appears to suggest a change in the original chemistry of the product. I have experienced a considerable amount of discomfort including redness, swelling, peeling, burning and a rash. I haven&#x27;t given up on the product, but I definitely a prefer the original formula. I don&#x27;t recall alcohol being a part of the original formula.</li>
            <li> IN THE PAST, this was the only product that worked for my adult acne. It really did \\&quot;erase\\&quot; everything and give me beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, now it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything at all. Maybe there was a formulation change? Or perhaps I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but the bottle says results in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite expensive for not seeing any results :-(</li>
            <li> Long-time user ... When something works, you stick with it, although I don&#x27;t love the continuing price increases over the years! It&#x27;s now costing almost exactly double what my first bottle cost me 8 years ago! ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores. I keep it on hand always. It&#x27;s the best spot treatment for pimples out there, I think. It also doesn&#x27;t bleach out your towels and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t work. I feel like it create more acne.</li>
            <li> Not working at all. I bought it for a month now and i still dont see the result. As saying i used it everyday and every night!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Have used this before and couldn&#x27;t find it. It performs perfectly/!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past two months and my skin looks better than ever! I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne for years and have tried numerous treatments, including multiple topical and oral prescriptions. Pimple eraser works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It clears up pimples quickly, prevents new ones, and my skin even looks smoother. I&#x27;ve noticed smaller pores, less blackheads, and no increased sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description says it last 4-6 weeks. I use it twice a day and the first bottle I bought actually did last 6 weeks, which is surprising. Now I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I&#x27;m never going back!</li>
            <li> I love Pimple Eraser. I started using this product years ago for acne and I continue to use it as a light glycolic peel. It is great for fine lines, and acne scars. I use it every day and am always complemented on my great skin.</li>
            <li> works great I&#x27;ll buy another</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. avoid buying it. I put it on everyday and its been a month and doesnt work at all.</li>
            <li> Although this is the first time I&#x27;ve bought Pimple Eraser from Amazon, I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years, and am one very happy customer!  This does exactly what it says it will!  My complexion was always challenging since my teen years, and every month during my Moon Cycle, my face would tend to break out.  I also started noticing sun spots as I got older.  Now, I use it every night after washing my face, and then once it dries, I follow with my face lotion before bed.  My skin is smooth, no sun or age spots (I&#x27;m in the sun a lot!) and I do feel it helps with wrinkle lines too!  Will buy it forever, and now that it&#x27; only available on Amazon, I&#x27;m even more happy!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF - MY M OTHER AND I ARE BOTH HOOKED!!</li>
            <li> i get pimples on my scalp alot and this stuff does the trick. it also dries out red pimples pretty fast.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for the last 6 years and we really love the way it works. It is clear and light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t bleach your towels like other pimple meds do (you know what I mean if you have teenagers) it last a long time and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and just found it again here on Amazon.  It really fades age spots, I had several on my face and they are gone.  I now have a few more and I can see them start to fade. (It does not happen over night, but works as well as those high priced cosmetics.)</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work but it seems to be the other way around. I am not sure if it had any effect on my pimples, as they seem to be living a good life with threats of this product. However, I noticed that I break out every time after using this product, and only at places where I applied pimple eraser. Too bad, I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill. But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
            <li> This Pimple eraser does nothing. Over time, it seems to slow the rate of pimples appearing, but if you suddenly stop using it, all pimples re appear faster. I would suggest searching for a different product that costs less money.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product it has diminished my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I came across a review for this when researching the Oil Cleansing Method and only bought it after my face exploded from even trying that method. So far I have been using it with the Natural Facial Cleanser also created by this company and Tea Tree Oil from NOW Foods. So far my acne is calming down and the scars are starting to fade. Thank Science. I thought I would die of embarrassment. I do find because it has SD Alcohol in it, it can be a little drying, however if you pair it with a moisturizer you should be fine. Also using a mask to take off the dead skin cells really helps as well. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who is looking to reduce their acne scars.</li>
            <li> My skin almost never broke out when I was younger.  Hit menopause and WHAM! I breakout worse than a teenager.... but less when I&#x27;m consistently using this.  It can be a bit \\&quot;sting-y\\&quot; when you&#x27;re first using it, but that fades over time and my skin looks better.  So I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
