            <li>This is the best face scrub I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>All DHC products are wonderful and keep your skin and hair looking great.  </li>
            <li>good, it is what i want !</li>
            <li>I like the way that removes all the pores on my nose and feel so great after use.</li>
            <li>They were so great.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Good to use every 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Thankfully it isn&#x27;t potent and washes away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>This is the best facial scrub.  </li>
            <li>I have a combination skin type and the most of the moisturizers worked through well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.</li>
            <li>Seems OK</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel very clean.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and was just what I ordered.</li>
            <li>and then did some online research for a fragrance free scrub that would do the job without roughing up my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to ones in a drug store but with many more beads to scrub your face.  </li>
            <li>Still, it just doesn&#x27;t feel right to me.</li>
            <li>Most can be a little irritating but this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I usually buy directly from DHC but it was nice to find it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It cleanses and exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>The scrub is gentle and grainy enough to deep clean, leaving my face smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>should say that the directions clearly tell you to use the scrub BEFORE your cleanser.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m too sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li>Best exfoliant for the summer when there is so much use of moisturizer, sunscreen and sometimes insect repellent, not to mention perspiration.</li>

            <li> I have very oily skin that is hard to dry out</li>
            <li> They were not too oily or dry.</li>
            <li> scrub particles are sharper than I think they should be for facial skin, it leaves an odd, bad film on the skin, and the combination of consistency and packaging encourages you to push more product out of the tube than you need to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Believe me, you have to in order to remove that awful waxy feeling, but following with my usual cleanser does take that weird film off of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I think the benefit of using this outweighs the weird scent, so I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>

            <li> Good to use every 2 or 3 days.  Takes off oils and accumulated dead cells.  Makes my face feel very clean.  Thankfully, no perfumy odor.</li>
            <li> It cleanses and exfoliates very well. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the horrid smell... I&#x27;m not sure how others feel about it, but I truly hate it. Thankfully it isn&#x27;t potent and washes away. I think the benefit of using this outweighs the weird scent, so I&#x27;ll continue using it. It&#x27;s a good product. Maybe I&#x27;m too sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliant for the summer when there is so much use of moisturizer, sunscreen and sometimes insect repellent, not to mention perspiration.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay I am not sure I would order it again it is pricey for a facial scrub and somewhat drying I have very oily skin that is hard to dry out this product did cause dryness around my mouth</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have used it for years.  Exfoliates without scratching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scrub for years.  It&#x27;s similar to ones in a drug store but with many more beads to scrub your face.  Drug store brands are almost useless.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial scrub.  I actually use it every day.  I have oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much. It arrived very quickly and was just what I ordered. This is the best face scrub I have ever used.  Most can be a little irritating but this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I highly recommend it. I like the way that removes all the pores on my nose and feel so great after use. I also like their moisturizers. They were so great. I have a combination skin type and the most of the moisturizers worked through well on my skin. They were not too oily or dry. I am thinking to change all my cosmetic lines to DHC.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub. I am 58 and still get breakouts and blackheads on my face. Buy this. My sister started me on this DHC facial scrub and now I can not do without it . It throughly cleans, but is not abrasive. Great product!</li>
            <li> good, it is what i want ! scrub!</li>
            <li> Great product.  All DHC products are wonderful and keep your skin and hair looking great.  I usually buy directly from DHC but it was nice to find it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> For my face, it&#x27;s either 5 stars or it&#x27;s not a keeper.  The three things I don&#x27;t like about the DHC Facial Scrub are: scrub particles are sharper than I think they should be for facial skin, it leaves an odd, bad film on the skin, and the combination of consistency and packaging encourages you to push more product out of the tube than you need to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say that the directions clearly tell you to use the scrub BEFORE your cleanser. Believe me, you have to in order to remove that awful waxy feeling, but following with my usual cleanser does take that weird film off of my skin.  Still, it just doesn&#x27;t feel right to me. And I usually use a scrub once or twice a week, depending on conditions, in place of my cleanser; so that&#x27;s double product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish using it but I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have always used department store brand scrubs which were more expensive and then did some online research for a fragrance free scrub that would do the job without roughing up my skin.  DHC is a Japanese skin care line and those people know a thing or two about beauty!  The scrub is gentle and grainy enough to deep clean, leaving my face smooth and refreshed. You can see and feel difference with or without makeup application. This is a skin care &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me. Thank you, Amazon for selling this product!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect.  Seems OK</li>
