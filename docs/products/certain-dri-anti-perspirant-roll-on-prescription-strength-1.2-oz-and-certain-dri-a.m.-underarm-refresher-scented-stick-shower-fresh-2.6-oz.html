    <ol>
            <li>very happy.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I could cry.</li>
            <li>know a lot of people mentioned burning and itching while using the roll-on, but I hardly experienced that.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Roll-On&amp;#34; came in good condition</li>
            <li>Good deal on Amazon too.</li>
            <li>I just spray on some perfume and stay happy that I&#x27;m not sweating through every shirt I own.</li>
            <li>Happy Teacher :-)</li>
            <li>Honestly, I sweat quite a lot and none of the products in the EU which I used, worked (at all).</li>
            <li>When you really need the best anti-perspirant...</li>
            <li>Ok, good to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; smell that I find kind of funky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for someone.</li>
            <li>I was using an antiperspirant AND a prescription strength deodorant and still able to stink</li>
            <li>It was always so embarrassing to go on dates and notice that I was sweating more than my date.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the top, pieces came falling out</li>
            <li>I switched to &amp;#34;SECRET&amp;#34; and love it.</li>
            <li>like I read in so many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Sure, it stings, but it doesn&#x27;t sting any more than the sting of being the sweatiest person in a room.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good like a sweat reducer.</li>
            <li>Now seeing there&#x27;s an AM and PM makes me uber excited to wear what I want and have ZERO worries!</li>
            <li>AM stick has an interesting soapy smell that can over power your cologne but isn&#x27;t off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to add to your bedtime process, brush-teeth, floss, mouthwash, certain-dri, bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next time I will try a stronger antiperspirant, but this gave me hope of having a better and more confident life!</li>
            <li>Then read some reviews that the roll on is better and they are right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an embarrassment to have, thankfully this has helped subside the amount of sweating significantly.</li>
            <li>The odor of sweat is completely gone since I use Certain Dri, so I am happy.</li>
            <li>and I have to soak my shirts in vinegar sometimes TWICE before they come clean.</li>
            <li>SOOOO glad I discovered Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>This has really helped me to be able to wear whatever color shirt</li>
            <li>, the A.M. stuff works really well, but I really don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li>Luckily it wears off quickly and I don&#x27;t smell it after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so fun.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid because it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Since I do not live in the US but the EU, it would take a while before it would be delivered according to the expected delivery date, but I received it within a week, so I was happy!</li>
            <li>The only thing I ould not rate it 5 stars is the Certain Dri AM that is not that effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neither feminine nor masculine but it is a rather strong scent.</li>
            <li>It worked THE FIRST DAY.</li>
            <li>This worked very well,  I no longer have sweat stains!  </li>
            <li>I have tried most standard drugstore brands, including all of their &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength versions.  </li>
            <li>works better and differently than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>It really worked for me !</li>
            <li>and I love having the 2 in the same package.</li>
            <li>But Certain Dri really does work for me!</li>
            <li>I tried all those &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; antiperspirants from the grocery store and nothing worked...until Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>You really do need the AM one.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works....</li>
            <li>It has a really chemically smell under the &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and it was getting to be really embarrassing.</li>
            <li>and I can wear that cool red Star Wars shirt I&#x27;ve been wanting to wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The roll on product seems to be doing ok, I&#x27;ve noticed a slight change.</li>
            <li>It does say to not use right after shaving or showering, but one night I scratched an itch, then 20 min later put it on and it burned SO MUCH</li>
            <li>The PM roll-on made me itch a bit the first few times I used it, but it&#x27;s fine now.  </li>
            <li>Huge wet arm pits.</li>
            <li>/sweat through them fairly early in my day.</li>
            <li>I even took a break from antiperspirant and tried some natural remedies.</li>
            <li>Nobody else I&#x27;ve ever known has sweat as much as I have my entire life.</li>
            <li>The morning antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything, which isn&#x27;t such a big deal I guess.</li>
            <li>major confidence booster</li>
            <li>Only baking soda based products worked, and I eventually developed a sensitivity to</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, due to new medications I&#x27;m on, my sweating had gotten out of control.</li>

            <li> I was sceptical that it really would control excessive sweating.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would solve my problems of insecurity, but it did not completely.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe i waited this long to try it.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of wearing only white and black because I used to pit out everything!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a petite young woman who has smelled worse than every single man she&#x27;s ever dated BY FAR.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too find of the deodorant smell, I&#x27;ve grown sick of shower fresh, but it works and that&#x27;s really all that matters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few years of excessive sweating and having NO CLUE what caused it...someone suggested Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> I go out anywhere and boom, dry pits!</li>
            <li> Which is why for the longest time I&#x27;d only wear black t-shirts.</li>
            <li> He was skeptical at first and now we are on our second order.</li>
            <li> Armpits become wet halfway the day (even after daily usage), but a lot less than what I was used.</li>
            <li> my son was excessive armpit sweating, wet all polo shirts, was deeply concerned and a friend recommended this deodorant, after the third day of use no more sweating</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pretty or feminin</li>
            <li> I usually use the &amp;#34;morning&amp;#34; treatment 2 times a day though (which is no big deal to me to freshen up).</li>
            <li> I use the PM stuff about every other night</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend because he sweats to an extreme.</li>
            <li> Then I found this a few years ago, and even if the rest of me is dripping, my arm pits are dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works after a single use&lt;br /&gt;Eliminates all excessive sweating and odor</li>
            <li> After reading the previous reviews, I wanted to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I previously used this deodorant years ago without a problem, but this time it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It itched a little for maybe 5-10 minutes, but it never burned and my skin was not irritated at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking you can smell me a few feet away</li>
            <li> I use it two or three nights a week, and use the AM everyday.</li>
            <li> My son was embarrassed by excessive sweating</li>
            <li> He has not had one day with excessive sweat.  </li>
            <li> I usually have pit stains within 10 minutes of putting on a shirt.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;AM&amp;#34; deodorant was extremely dry and difficult to put on because of its dryness.</li>
            <li> I use both the AM and PM on a daily base, since my armpits stay wet during the day.</li>
            <li> Seriously embarrassing.</li>
            <li> or so then didn&#x27;t and sweat is worse than ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the nighttime stick can be REALLY irritating if you have shaved, showered, or scratched your underarms within about 1-2 hours of planned application.</li>
            <li> You use the roll-on at night and it burns, stings, and itches a little but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who (unfortunately) sweats a lot.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s just impossible to use.</li>
            <li> I used to sweat like crazy!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from horrific body odor since puberty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After reading the previous reviews, I wanted to give this product a try. Since I do not live in the US but the EU, it would take a while before it would be delivered according to the expected delivery date, but I received it within a week, so I was happy! I use both the AM and PM on a daily base, since my armpits stay wet during the day. Honestly, I sweat quite a lot and none of the products in the EU which I used, worked (at all). I was hoping it would solve my problems of insecurity, but it did not completely. Armpits become wet halfway the day (even after daily usage), but a lot less than what I was used. The odor of sweat is completely gone since I use Certain Dri, so I am happy. Next time I will try a stronger antiperspirant, but this gave me hope of having a better and more confident life!</li>
            <li> Bought for husband. Worked for a week or so then didn&#x27;t and sweat is worse than ever. Still searching for a solution that works. I&#x27;m sure it works for someone.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from horrific body odor since puberty. I&#x27;m talking you can smell me a few feet away and I have to soak my shirts in vinegar sometimes TWICE before they come clean. \\&quot;Prescription strength\\&quot; deodorants are a joke, I sweat through them within an hour on some days. I was using an antiperspirant AND a prescription strength deodorant and still able to stink/sweat through them fairly early in my day. I&#x27;m a petite young woman who has smelled worse than every single man she&#x27;s ever dated BY FAR. Not so fun. I bought this as a last resort before seeking a medical alternative. It worked THE FIRST DAY. You use the roll-on at night and it burns, stings, and itches a little but nothing too bad. In the morning you use the stick. It&#x27;s summer here and I didn&#x27;t smell THE ENTIRE DAY! No sweating, no stinking, NOTHING! The next day I had a workout class and I did manage to stink through but it was NOTHING compared to what it would have been before. I smelled as much as a regular person would while working out and not like a yeti&#x27;s gym sock which is what I would have been before. I am so happy I could cry. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering the stick smells like soap. It&#x27;s neither feminine nor masculine but it is a rather strong scent. (Over powered my perfume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works after a single use&lt;br /&gt;Eliminates all excessive sweating and odor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Roll-on stings and itches</li>
            <li> I have underarm sweat even if it&#x27;s snowing outside.  It&#x27;s horrible.  This worked very well,  I no longer have sweat stains!  Victory!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t experience a ton of perspiration, but I almost always perspire a bit through my antiperspirant by dinnertime - and need to freshen up.  I have tried most standard drugstore brands, including all of their &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength versions.  I even took a break from antiperspirant and tried some natural remedies. Only baking soda based products worked, and I eventually developed a sensitivity to it&#x27;s abrasive texture. SOOOO glad I discovered Certain Dri. I have been using it for a couple of months now and it has worked so well for me.  The PM roll-on made me itch a bit the first few times I used it, but it&#x27;s fine now.  I use it two or three nights a week, and use the AM everyday.</li>
            <li> This has really helped me to be able to wear whatever color shirt I want and not have to worry about sweat showing under my arms.</li>
            <li> Nobody else I&#x27;ve ever known has sweat as much as I have my entire life. It was always so embarrassing to go on dates and notice that I was sweating more than my date. It&#x27;s not pretty or feminin whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works you guys. I&#x27;m not too find of the deodorant smell, I&#x27;ve grown sick of shower fresh, but it works and that&#x27;s really all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people mentioned burning and itching while using the roll-on, but I hardly experienced that. It itched a little for maybe 5-10 minutes, but it never burned and my skin was not irritated at all. I suppose it all depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li> there was a noticeable difference in just one day. i can&#x27;t believe i waited this long to try it. very happy.</li>
            <li> Head up - this product burns - so I can no longer shave on a daily basis, but I also don&#x27;t need to apply daily so it works out. After one use, I knew I was hooked- works better and differently than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> I have severe hyperhydrosis. Unless I were to pay for botox, it will never go away. It&#x27;s an embarrassment to have, thankfully this has helped subside the amount of sweating significantly. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it does It&#x27;s job as said. You have to follow directions!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my doctor.  I was sceptical that it really would control excessive sweating.  All I can say is &amp;#34;it works.&amp;#34; I bought both AM and PM applies at night before bed.  It really worked for me !</li>
            <li> My son was embarrassed by excessive sweating so I bought the solid.....didn&#x27;t work.  Then read some reviews that the roll on is better and they are right.  He has not had one day with excessive sweat.  Great product.  He also uses the AMrefresher.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from sweating all my life. This has been a life changer! I have used Botox shots at 1000 dollars. Gave this a try and I can&#x27;t be any happier!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know if it works or not because the thing has a manufacturing defect. The &amp;#34;Roll-On&amp;#34; came in good condition and I&#x27;m really excited to put it into use; however, the AM Scented Stick came broken. As soon as I opened the top, pieces came falling out and now it&#x27;s just impossible to use.</li>
            <li> After a few years of excessive sweating and having NO CLUE what caused it...someone suggested Certain Dri. I was ELATED to use the night version and it actually works! Now seeing there&#x27;s an AM and PM makes me uber excited to wear what I want and have ZERO worries! Thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;One Happy Teacher :-)</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has ever stopped me from sweating profusely.  I will definitely be a repeat buy!!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a 4.5 STAR. Works pretty good like a sweat reducer. The only thing I ould not rate it 5 stars is the Certain Dri AM that is not that effective.</li>
            <li> The product works just as described.</li>
            <li> I used to sweat like crazy! Huge wet arm pits. Seriously embarrassing. Then I found this a few years ago, and even if the rest of me is dripping, my arm pits are dry. get them both for maximum affect. Good deal on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> I previously used this deodorant years ago without a problem, but this time it didn&#x27;t work. The &amp;#34;AM&amp;#34; deodorant was extremely dry and difficult to put on because of its dryness. Then it left irritation under my arms. I ended up developing a rash because of the irritation. My armpits were constantly burning. The &amp;#34;PM&amp;#34; deodorant doesn&#x27;t work unless you utilize the &amp;#34;AM&amp;#34;. It wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid because it didn&#x27;t work for me. I switched to &amp;#34;SECRET&amp;#34; and love it.</li>
            <li> When you really need the best anti-perspirant...</li>
            <li> Works great and I love having the 2 in the same package. You really do need the AM one.</li>
            <li> I usually have pit stains within 10 minutes of putting on a shirt. Which is why for the longest time I&#x27;d only wear black t-shirts. But Certain Dri really does work for me! I do have to apply it every night. But for me, there is no irritation at all like I read in so many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can wear whatever I want! I usually use the &amp;#34;morning&amp;#34; treatment 2 times a day though (which is no big deal to me to freshen up).</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.... But it does have some drawbacks. I&#x27;ve found that the nighttime stick can be REALLY irritating if you have shaved, showered, or scratched your underarms within about 1-2 hours of planned application. It does say to not use right after shaving or showering, but one night I scratched an itch, then 20 min later put it on and it burned SO MUCH I was up for hours. Ok, good to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the A.M. stuff works really well, but I really don&#x27;t love the smell. It has a really chemically smell under the &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34; smell that I find kind of funky. Luckily it wears off quickly and I don&#x27;t smell it after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, due to new medications I&#x27;m on, my sweating had gotten out of control. This is the only thing that&#x27;s helped at all. I use the PM stuff about every other night and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend because he sweats to an extreme. He was skeptical at first and now we are on our second order.</li>
            <li> Finally something works!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who (unfortunately) sweats a lot. All the time. Even if it&#x27;s 20 degrees outside. It started after I started some medications and it was getting to be really embarrassing. I tried all those &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; antiperspirants from the grocery store and nothing worked...until Certain Dri. Sure, it stings, but it doesn&#x27;t sting any more than the sting of being the sweatiest person in a room. The morning antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything, which isn&#x27;t such a big deal I guess. I just spray on some perfume and stay happy that I&#x27;m not sweating through every shirt I own.</li>
            <li> my son was excessive armpit sweating, wet all polo shirts, was deeply concerned and a friend recommended this deodorant, after the third day of use no more sweating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;exceeded our expectations, I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> Product came melted! The roll on product seems to be doing ok, I&#x27;ve noticed a slight change. However the am depderent came melted/damaged.</li>
            <li> FINALLY! I have tried literally everything under the sun for sweat reduction/prevention. Gone are the days of wearing only white and black because I used to pit out everything!&lt;br /&gt;Now I go out anywhere and boom, dry pits! major confidence booster and I can wear that cool red Star Wars shirt I&#x27;ve been wanting to wear.&lt;br /&gt;The AM stick has an interesting soapy smell that can over power your cologne but isn&#x27;t off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to add to your bedtime process, brush-teeth, floss, mouthwash, certain-dri, bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 will keep a constant supply of this.</li>
