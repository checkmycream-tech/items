    <ol>
            <li>This product worked great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this product works great!).</li>
            <li>Best eye cream I have used to date!!</li>
            <li>but this is great!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I will purchase it again when I need a refill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, it is GREAT.</li>
            <li>I think it works great and notice a difference when I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I think the people that gave great reviews for this product either work for the company or they sell it.</li>
            <li>This Grapefruit Eye Cream is nice, and very pleasant to put on, but it hasn&#x27;t created that &amp;#34;total</li>
            <li>But it is nice!</li>
            <li>and I wish I could say something good about this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for another brand that may be better but this ones working for me!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this line of product!  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s effective as well.</li>
            <li>However, it smelled good, and helped the skin under my eyes feel more moisturized.</li>
            <li>The Yes to Grapefruit eye cream feels nice going on to your eyes and it does a nice job of moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li>The nude colored cream kind of works</li>
            <li>Clinique, I am not too sure, might try it too eventually, but that&#x27;s a good line.</li>
            <li>So its kind of like an illuminator for your eyes.</li>
            <li>It feels nice.</li>
            <li>This is an honest review</li>
            <li>and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>It did reduce the darkness pretty good but certainly didn&#x27;t eliminate it; that would&#x27;ve been nice, lol.</li>
            <li>and I should mention I use this in conjunction with Clinique Even Better Eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li>I swear by this product and am hoping to try more items from the Say</li>
            <li>On top of using this cream I started getting more quality sleep, so I can&#x27;t attribute the reduction in my under-eye circles to this cream.</li>
            <li>Need to give this product more time to work.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but there are better products.</li>
            <li>It smells nothing like grapefruit to me, it&#x27;s more floral than anything, but not overpoweringly so.</li>
            <li>My skin was so light under my eyes!</li>
            <li>I apply this stuff before applying my make up or after I was my face in the morning and my eye area looks much better.</li>
            <li>Better than foundation</li>
            <li>In a nutshell, this product hasn&#x27;t made me feel more confident about going around without any sort of make up under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS CREAM</li>
            <li>Great product delivering what I would normally spend $50 or more on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely remove the bags but it improves them a Great Deal.</li>
            <li>The smell is interesting but not bad.</li>
            <li>It smells fine, just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of yes to products</li>
            <li>for the price, this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I really don&#x27;t know how well it works.</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency to it, but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my circles.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, does not burn, and brightens up the eye</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly, wasn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any highlighting purposes nor significant improvements with fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with rose undertones and have been experiencing dark circles because of lack of sleep.  </li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks for me to notice a significant difference (2 weeks of continuous use)</li>
            <li>I like this a lot better than concealer, because its lighter on my skin, and now I don&#x27;t need as much makeup!</li>
            <li>This cream isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>However, it worked almost right away for me!</li>
            <li>Full review with before and after pictures  http://linlovesbeauty.blogspot.de/2014/07/review-yes-to-grapefruit-dark-circle.html</li>
            <li>The only thing I feel this product is good for is allowing a smoother application of the concealer I apply under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at how effective this is.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t affect my makeup application.</li>
            <li>I even like it better than my high end brand.</li>
            <li>I almost look like I have black eyes, lol.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try.</li>
            <li>but it soaks right in your skin, and smooths the area around your eye.</li>
            <li>Also, you cant apply it right before putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>Now, after two months, my dark circles have dramatically improved and they are about as good as I think they&#x27;ll ever get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the bruising around the eyes won&#x27;t be relieved very much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it consistently, so maybe that&#x27;s why it hasn&#x27;t made a difference.</li>
            <li>and once I am satisfied will apply cut back to once a day application.</li>
            <li>I wanted something affordable and natural, so after finding this I was excited to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes a nice difference lightening dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell it does a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I will certainly keep using this as it is on my list of SOS emergency</li>
            <li>I started to see results in about two weeks and a large difference in about a month.</li>
            <li>About 2 or 3 months ago I started becoming very aware of how dark and sunken the circles under my eyes were looking.</li>
            <li>Really seems to help the appearance under my eyes.</li>
            <li>very chemically smell.</li>
            <li>Smell is yucky and does absolutely nothing it claims.  </li>
            <li>This product really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Really haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this and</li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks of use (twice a day) I realized I no longer absolutely had to wear concealer.</li>
            <li>I suspect this is how this cream reduces or, better to say, masks visible dark spots</li>
            <li>My main problem with this product is the smell - it smells expremely chemically (not at all like grapefruit) - almost like bleach, in fact.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and really don&#x27;t see a change.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and have no reaction to this cream unless I put too much too close to my eyes.</li>
            <li>Even if it didn&#x27;t erase the dark circles, I might recommend it simply because it feels and smells so nice as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a normal eye cream that moisturizes and refresh your under eye area.</li>
            <li>I am almost out of it, do I am going to order a new tube and try it again.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes from this natural product.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well into the skin ,without feeling greasy or burning your eyes, as I have experienced with other products for the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried eye creams before because I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance when it comes to skincare...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and the skin is nearly clear, it&#x27;s that translucent.</li>
            <li>I give it more leeway, but I do wish the product would be white or pink instead of dark beige and smell more like the other grapefruit products.  </li>
            <li>Luckily this product wasn&#x27;t that expensive (compared to other products) and it&#x27;s part of a good cosmetics line.  </li>
            <li>when in reality I was awake all night because of a loud thunder storm.</li>
            <li>Being that it works and it is natural</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not terribly sure it&#x27;s helping my dark circles so much (but they are hereditary, so I don&#x27;t think anything really will), it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin under my eyes, which most things do.  </li>
            <li>People are always asking who punched me in my eyes and it gets old.</li>
            <li>people that get slightly less sleep than normal and are under moderately higher amounts of stress than normal</li>
            <li>Stopped using it because the small was strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>Smells refreshing, creamy texture, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>After trying many others, this is the only one that actually does anything to minimize dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I personally did not notice a huge difference in dark spots under my eyes.</li>
            <li>not bad, has a little bit of a tint to it but not noticeable once applied.</li>
            <li>Chanel eye cream felt great but was meant for wrinkles, not bruising, and is VERY expensive (and tests on animals.)</li>
            <li>I got it exchanged, yet, the new one is the same.</li>
            <li>This makes the product a great value since the tube will likely last me at least half a year if not longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly for the price I&#x27;m not sure I would buy again just because once I remove my make up my circles are as dark as before.</li>
            <li>It DID lighten my hereditary dark circles after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I do tend to be sensitive to smells, but only noticed it when applying.</li>
            <li>My dark circles became really noticeable at the start of college.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t notice much of a differnce in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this cream to people with GENETIC dark circles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a difference where my dark circles are.</li>

            <li> I do tend to be sensitive to smells, but only noticed it when applying.</li>
            <li> My dark circles became really noticeable at the start of college.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice much of a differnce in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this cream to people with GENETIC dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference where my dark circles are.</li>
            <li> I can see the veins underneath it and have to use a darker concealer/foundation shade over it to look even, unlike nearly every other human in the world that uses a lighter shade, so I have to be cautious about what I place there.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month, and well it does lighten your dark circles it does not get completely rid of them.</li>
            <li> Those of us with thin skin or major genetic eye-bruising issues need something MUCH more heavy duty with high amounts of Vitamin K (beating a dead horse, here) as well as other anti-oxidants to encourage cell renewal and blood cleansing.</li>
            <li> In the days days the wrinkles and dark circle underneath my left eye is almost completely gone, and my right eye is close behind.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are barely visible anymore</li>
            <li> , I look like I wasn&#x27;t counting the distance of lighting strikes all freaking night long-</li>
            <li> I am 19 years old with pale skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my early twenties, I have dark circles and bags that are due to genetics.</li>
            <li> All it did was kept my eye area from feeling dry - any eye cream can do that.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure that it really reduces dark circles.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I think the packaging is nice too, I like that its not a jar ( I hate dipping my fingers in jars and then getting it under my nails) and</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves the product and will only get this brand for her under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve got dark circles AND red itchy patches beneath my eyes -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of stuff for my dark circles, and this one actually seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> but I noticed the dark circles coming back</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way, this will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I typically put extra concealer under my eyes to hide the darkness, but I noticed the morning after I started using this product, that I didnt need the concealer!</li>
            <li> Lucky it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Mine are due to genetics, not allergies, but even so I would expect a product to at least improve and reasonably diminish my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I am 37 and have spent some $$on eye creams...</li>
            <li> Not sure it actually does correct the dark circles well enough, but I do see a difference/good results.</li>
            <li> I faithfully used it everyday for my dark circles and hardly noticed any positive change in a month&#x27;s time of using it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any lingering issues with the scent like other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and a wrinkle reducer but never even opened the other product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing, helps my makeup go on smoother, and lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not having the experience other did.  </li>
            <li> The product itself seems to have a sheer slight coverage and is a fantastic base to apply concealer over.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent eyecream, nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this helps with inflammation issues due to food-related bloating (all the grilling and alcohol and salt) and slight sleep-deprivation-related darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> A small dab goes a long way</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference, and average moisturizing.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I figured I should try and do something about that, so I found this product and started using it hoping to reduce dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I did some research and realized I had genetic dark</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am always trying to find something to help with the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> helps reduce the appearance of aging, in theory, but I&#x27;ll look for another product to help diminish my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat severe dark circles and they started to fade from this product.</li>
            <li> The tube seriously lasts forever I have been using it daily for almost a year now.</li>
            <li> I also like the way it feels and the slight scent of grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> If you have slight under eye discoloration, give it  try.</li>
            <li> would give this 5 stars, but the smell and the color are a little odd.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month, twice per day (&amp; have skipped only a day here and there) and have not noticed any decreased appearance of the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark under eyes though so that may be a factor.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as I have been using it for a few weeks now and can not see a difference.  </li>
            <li> For people with heavy, genetic under-eye circles or allergy-related bruising, this WILL NOT work for you.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>

            <li> Using continuously for the past 30 days, not seeing any effect.given the price I feel this product does not deliver the goods.</li>
            <li> I have tried several creams even an expensive one.</li>

            <li> - they are fantastic (without the horrible smell).</li>
            <li> Ill update when my tube is empty.</li>
            <li> so I hate to say that I&#x27;m not a fan of this particular product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, seeing as I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of under eye products that supposedly help improve the appearance of dark circles and didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I bought it form them first, the product had a darker color than usual and smelled really awful.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully for weeks, and saw absolutely no difference in my dark circles :(</li>
            <li> but they are definitely gone bad.</li>
            <li> It is useless and waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, pale skin</li>
            <li> My dark circles aren&#x27;t too bad to begin with but it is my qualm about my skin that I wish I could improve.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The tube seriously lasts forever I have been using it daily for almost a year now.</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned money, and go buy yourself something you deserve that works!&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find it here. A bunch of marketing strategies loaded with disappointment!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, seeing as I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of under eye products that supposedly help improve the appearance of dark circles and didn&#x27;t see any improvement. My dark circles aren&#x27;t too bad to begin with but it is my qualm about my skin that I wish I could improve. This product worked great! It took about 2 weeks for me to notice a significant difference (2 weeks of continuous use) and I continue to put it on each night before bed. A small dab goes a long way so not only is this product affordable but it&#x27;s effective as well. My dark circles are barely visible anymore and I credit this product and I should mention I use this in conjunction with Clinique Even Better Eyes in the morning. (Yes to grapefruit at night and Clinique in the morning) I swear by this product and am hoping to try more items from the Say Yes To line.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as I have been using it for a few weeks now and can not see a difference.  I also feel it is quiet costly for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I personally did not notice a huge difference in dark spots under my eyes. On top of using this cream I started getting more quality sleep, so I can&#x27;t attribute the reduction in my under-eye circles to this cream. It looks like the cream has pigment in it, similar to tinted moisturizer that probably builds up in your skin after a while. I suspect this is how this cream reduces or, better to say, masks visible dark spots (This is just my theory).</li>
            <li> Really seems to help the appearance under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an under-eye treatment for months and finally decided to try this one because I regularly use Yes to Blueberries and Yes to Carrots products, but I always buy them at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived and what came out of the bottle was brown and smelled awful... very chemically smell. It didn&#x27;t absorb in to my skin like a lotion should and the smell was disgusting so close to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> Need to give this product more time to work.  So far, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and really don&#x27;t see a change.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product feels when it goes on but I&#x27;m not sure that it really reduces dark circles.</li>
            <li> Ick, I will never buy again.  Smell is yucky and does absolutely nothing it claims.  All it did was kept my eye area from feeling dry - any eye cream can do that.</li>
            <li> for the price, this is fantastic. I even like it better than my high end brand. I prefer keeping it in the fridge for the added bonus of soothing puffy eyes in the morning. The product itself seems to have a sheer slight coverage and is a fantastic base to apply concealer over. I will certainly keep using this as it is on my list of SOS emergency favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(note: just this morning my husband said it looked like I got a lot of sleep, when in reality I was awake all night because of a loud thunder storm. I woke up, grabbed this from the fridge, dabbed it on, and behold, I look like I wasn&#x27;t counting the distance of lighting strikes all freaking night long- I&#x27;d say this product works great!).</li>
            <li> To be honest, I really don&#x27;t know how well it works. I haven&#x27;t been using it consistently, so maybe that&#x27;s why it hasn&#x27;t made a difference. I am almost out of it, do I am going to order a new tube and try it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, it is GREAT. But amazon has some bad stock somehow. I bought it form them first, the product had a darker color than usual and smelled really awful. I got it exchanged, yet, the new one is the same. I couldn&#x27;t  see expiration date on them but they are definitely gone bad. Don&#x27;t buy from amazon.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream I have used to date!! I am 37 and have spent some $$on eye creams... This is by far the best and the price can&#x27;t be beat. It seems to help with the under eye darkness as it says, of course there is no miracle cream cream, but it brightens and tightens.</li>
            <li> This cream isn&#x27;t anything special. It has a nice consistency to it, but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my circles. It also smells bad. I have been using it for about three weeks now.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves the product and will only get this brand for her under eye dark circles. I tried it too...not bad, has a little bit of a tint to it but not noticeable once applied.</li>
            <li> I have been using it over a month days and nights. I did not see any difference. It is useless and waste of money.</li>
            <li> Using continuously for the past 30 days, not seeing any effect.given the price I feel this product does not deliver the goods. Beware!!!</li>
            <li> Used the product continuously for 2 weeks and saw no results. Stopped using it because the small was strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> It DID lighten my hereditary dark circles after the first use.  However, it also caused a rash which I&#x27;m still trying to recover from (and it&#x27;s been over two weeks since I&#x27;ve used it!).  Now I&#x27;ve got dark circles AND red itchy patches beneath my eyes - definitely not fun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Prior to using this product, I didn&#x27;t consider myself to have &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;....so use with caution!</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully for weeks, and saw absolutely no difference in my dark circles :( I have tried lots of different products, so I was hoping this would be it. . . unfortunately that was not the case. However, it smelled good, and helped the skin under my eyes feel more moisturized.</li>
            <li> Not sure it actually does correct the dark circles well enough, but I do see a difference/good results.</li>
            <li> This product really works for me.  After trying many others, this is the only one that actually does anything to minimize dark circles under my eyes.  I have fair skin with rose undertones and have been experiencing dark circles because of lack of sleep.  I use this at night and no circles in the morning!  The product does say to apply morning &amp; night, but I find my mascara smears a bit under eye if I apply this in the morning.  Just using it before bed seems to be enough anyways.  I use a much smaller amount than recommended.  Probably a dab of about 3mm or the size of a cooked piece of quinoa is enough for under both eyes.  This makes the product a great value since the tube will likely last me at least half a year if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this 5 stars, but the smell and the color are a little odd.  Being that it works and it is natural I give it more leeway, but I do wish the product would be white or pink instead of dark beige and smell more like the other grapefruit products.  I didn&#x27;t notice any lingering issues with the scent like other reviewers.  I do tend to be sensitive to smells, but only noticed it when applying. Granted, I am using it at night only so the smell may have faded by morning.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Guess it depends on the person. I think it works great and notice a difference when I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of stuff for my dark circles, and this one actually seems to be working.  I don&#x27;t look like like a dying person when I take off my concealer!  I also like the way it feels and the slight scent of grapefruit.  It soaks in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t affect my makeup application.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference, and average moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Really haven&#x27;t used it much but it soaks right in your skin, and smooths the area around your eye.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not worth it. My dark circles became really noticeable at the start of college. I wanted something affordable and natural, so after finding this I was excited to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after using the product twice daily for three weeks, I saw no changes whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I would pay $5 for this product. It goes on smooth, does not burn, and brightens up the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point Blank: Do not even try it if you have really bad dark circles. It does not work. If you have slight under eye discoloration, give it  try.</li>
            <li> Great product delivering what I would normally spend $50 or more on.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice difference lightening dark circles under the eyes. I use it in the morning and again at night.</li>
            <li> I was kimd of nervous because of the price after the yes to tomato line didn&#x27;t work for me but this is great! I have premature aging around my eyes and the fact that I always look tired and sick started to bother me. I bought this and a wrinkle reducer but never even opened the other product. In the days days the wrinkles and dark circle underneath my left eye is almost completely gone, and my right eye is close behind. I have beeb applying at night and morning, and once I am satisfied will apply cut back to once a day application.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way, this will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The Yes to Grapefruit eye cream feels nice going on to your eyes and it does a nice job of moisturizing your skin. I haven&#x27;t notice much of a differnce in the dark circles under my eyes. My main problem with this product is the smell - it smells expremely chemically (not at all like grapefruit) - almost like bleach, in fact. If you can get past the smell it does a good job of moisturizing. If you&#x27;re a fan of the line, try the [[ASIN:B00AACBZMU Yes to Grapefruit Brightening Facial Towelettes, 25 Count]] - they are fantastic (without the horrible smell).</li>
            <li> For people with heavy, genetic under-eye circles or allergy-related bruising, this WILL NOT work for you.&lt;br /&gt;For people that get slightly less sleep than normal and are under moderately higher amounts of stress than normal, this will definitely help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this helps with inflammation issues due to food-related bloating (all the grilling and alcohol and salt) and slight sleep-deprivation-related darkness under my eyes. I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and the skin is nearly clear, it&#x27;s that translucent. I can see the veins underneath it and have to use a darker concealer/foundation shade over it to look even, unlike nearly every other human in the world that uses a lighter shade, so I have to be cautious about what I place there. Clinique, Lancome, etc didn&#x27;t work without making my skin plump up and turn red and make my eyes burn from the fumes of the cream. Chanel eye cream felt great but was meant for wrinkles, not bruising, and is VERY expensive (and tests on animals.) I really like the feel of this and how it keeps my eyes un-puffed, but I wish they would have added Vitamin K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without Vitamin K in the formulation, the bruising around the eyes won&#x27;t be relieved very much. The Licorice Root extract does help, but only for some of the puffiness and inflammation. Those of us with thin skin or major genetic eye-bruising issues need something MUCH more heavy duty with high amounts of Vitamin K (beating a dead horse, here) as well as other anti-oxidants to encourage cell renewal and blood cleansing.</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror about eight months ago and thought man I almost look like I have black eyes, lol. I figured I should try and do something about that, so I found this product and started using it hoping to reduce dark circles under my eyes. It did reduce the darkness pretty good but certainly didn&#x27;t eliminate it; that would&#x27;ve been nice, lol. I bought another brand too and the last month started to use it but I noticed the dark circles coming back so I went back to using this product and it reduced the darkness again. I&#x27;m still searching for another brand that may be better but this ones working for me!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month, and well it does lighten your dark circles it does not get completely rid of them. Which was what I was looking for. The nude colored cream kind of works but there are better products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this line of product!  While I&#x27;m not terribly sure it&#x27;s helping my dark circles so much (but they are hereditary, so I don&#x27;t think anything really will), it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin under my eyes, which most things do.  It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing, helps my makeup go on smoother, and lasts forever.  For this price it&#x27;s everything I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied this three times in the last 36 hours and I ALREADY see a difference. It smells nothing like grapefruit to me, it&#x27;s more floral than anything, but not overpoweringly so. The texture isn&#x27;t greasy, it&#x27;s rather silky and cooling. I have very thin, pale skin so maybe that&#x27;s why I already see it working. Even if it didn&#x27;t erase the dark circles, I might recommend it simply because it feels and smells so nice as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Obviously, looking at these reviews, this product does not work for everyone. However, it worked almost right away for me! I have always had dark circles under my eyes. I am 19 years old with pale skin. I typically put extra concealer under my eyes to hide the darkness, but I noticed the morning after I started using this product, that I didnt need the concealer! My skin was so light under my eyes! I will say though, it is not permanent. You have to keep applying it. Also, you cant apply it right before putting on makeup. Give it time to soak in! I like this a lot better than concealer, because its lighter on my skin, and now I don&#x27;t need as much makeup! I say TRY IT, you have nothing to lose!</li>
            <li> I faithfully used it everyday for my dark circles and hardly noticed any positive change in a month&#x27;s time of using it. It went on smoothly, wasn&#x27;t greasy but that&#x27;s about it. Had high hopes from this natural product. I&#x27;m going to use ROC next, it has 200+ reviews! Clinique, I am not too sure, might try it too eventually, but that&#x27;s a good line.</li>
            <li> Have used this for almost two&lt;br /&gt;Months. I&#x27;m a huge fan of yes to products so I hate to say that I&#x27;m not a fan of this particular product. It smells fine, just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. I have very dark under eyes though so that may be a factor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried eye creams before because I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance when it comes to skincare...I didn&#x27;t see the point of them. About 2 or 3 months ago I started becoming very aware of how dark and sunken the circles under my eyes were looking. Even with plenty of sleep they looked terrible. I did some research and realized I had genetic dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this two months ago, and I immediately noticed some superficial brightening (meaning if I washed the cream off, the brightness went away) on the areas where I used it. After about 3 weeks of use (twice a day) I realized I no longer absolutely had to wear concealer. Now, after two months, my dark circles have dramatically improved and they are about as good as I think they&#x27;ll ever get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this cream to people with GENETIC dark circles. From what I can tell based on the other reviews, it might not work as for people that are just tired or temporarily have dark circles from allergies.</li>
            <li> I apply this stuff before applying my make up or after I was my face in the morning and my eye area looks much better. The smell is interesting but not bad. Honestly for the price I&#x27;m not sure I would buy again just because once I remove my make up my circles are as dark as before. So its kind of like an illuminator for your eyes. Better than foundation I guess. Ill update when my tube is empty.</li>
            <li> This Grapefruit Eye Cream is nice, and very pleasant to put on, but it hasn&#x27;t created that &amp;#34;total correcting&amp;#34; effect that I was looking for!  But it is nice!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s helping. It feels nice.</li>
            <li> Smells refreshing, creamy texture, and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s soothing to the eye area, and I can see an improvement since using this undereye correcting cream. It absorbs well into the skin ,without feeling greasy or burning your eyes, as I have experienced with other products for the delicate eye area. This is a very good product and I will purchase it again when I need a refill.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent eyecream, nothing too crazy. Didn&#x27;t notice any highlighting purposes nor significant improvements with fine lines. It seems to be a normal eye cream that moisturizes and refresh your under eye area. Has a weird artificial scent. Would not repurchase.

            <li> I&#x27;m not having the experience other did.  I don&#x27;t see much of a difference where my dark circles are. Lucky it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am always trying to find something to help with the dark circles around my eyes. People are always asking who punched me in my eyes and it gets old. I have been using this product as directed and it has had zero results. I think the people that gave great reviews for this product either work for the company or they sell it. I would not recommend wasting your money on this. This is an honest review and I wish I could say something good about this product but if I did it would be a lie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month, twice per day (&amp; have skipped only a day here and there) and have not noticed any decreased appearance of the dark circles under my eyes.  Mine are due to genetics, not allergies, but even so I would expect a product to at least improve and reasonably diminish my dark circles.  The only thing I feel this product is good for is allowing a smoother application of the concealer I apply under my eyes.  In a nutshell, this product hasn&#x27;t made me feel more confident about going around without any sort of make up under my eyes.  Luckily this product wasn&#x27;t that expensive (compared to other products) and it&#x27;s part of a good cosmetics line.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it just because keeping the under eye area moisturized helps reduce the appearance of aging, in theory, but I&#x27;ll look for another product to help diminish my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over  a week and I see results. I use it at night and in the morning and it moisturizes well and the scent is nice. I have somewhat severe dark circles and they started to fade from this product. I still apply concealer and I notice how awake I look I am surprised at how effective this is. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience in eye creams ( I&#x27;m 19) so I cannot compare this product to others. Lastly, I think the packaging is nice too, I like that its not a jar ( I hate dipping my fingers in jars and then getting it under my nails) and this product is a squeeze tube and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product for the eye area. I think this will last me about 6 months. Take Care.</li>
            <li> I am in my early twenties, I have dark circles and bags that are due to genetics. I have tried several creams even an expensive one. None of them worked. This eye cream is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t completely remove the bags but it improves them a Great Deal. I have sensitive eyes and have no reaction to this cream unless I put too much too close to my eyes. I started to see results in about two weeks and a large difference in about a month. It is worth a try. I hope they keep the current formula. I LOVE THIS CREAM</li>
