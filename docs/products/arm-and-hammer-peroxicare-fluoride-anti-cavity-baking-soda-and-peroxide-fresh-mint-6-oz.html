            <li>It&#x27;s good toothpaste, but made me gag when it got on my tongue.</li>
            <li>And the mint flavoring is good without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really good.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it as a powerful agent against the tartar, I tried it and found it perfect for that job, so I&#x27;ll keep on ordering it</li>
            <li>good price, nice to have the option to get it on line</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes better than any I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I love how the baking soda makes my mouth feel bright after I use it.  </li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the others, then I tried this.</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A&amp;H is my favorite brand of toothpaste that contains Peroxide and Baking Soda.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel confident about my breath.</li>
            <li>Refreshing grown up toothpaste, made even better as it was recommended by my hygienist.</li>
            <li>My favorite tooth paste.</li>
            <li>Better dental hygiene results after using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The hygienist is pleased, so I&#x27;ve stuck with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to family members and they are pleased with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a kosher product that I love.</li>
            <li>feeling that aquafresh does, which I used for years previously, but it does feel good and more importantly, it&#x27;s the best for your teeth, enamel and gums.</li>
            <li>Best of all, this toothpaste is more natural and gentle.</li>
            <li>More importantly for me, it also has no baking soda.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried many toothpastes and this one was the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the flavor, but I&#x27;ve got to admit it does a great job giving your teeth a fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste, makes my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>Am using a fluoride free one with xylitol.</li>
            <li>For me, I was so happy to find this toothpaste at my local store.</li>
            <li>Taste gross but great for HCG diet.</li>
            <li>This is good tooth paste but as far a whitening</li>
            <li>we are pretty satisfied</li>
            <li>The dentists dont know what to do when I go in for a cleaning because this stuff keeps my teeth so clean.</li>
            <li>Taste is just not for me, but my teeth looked and felt really clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel incredibly clean after use.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste will leave your teeth feeling so clean you will swear</li>
            <li>Like all the other Arm and Hammer products I&#x27;ve used, this one is very good, leaves mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny that I was a loyal customer of PeroxiCare for so many years, and now I would steer anyone I know away from this product.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using it, I&#x27;ve had great checkups with a minimal amount of plaque build-up.  </li>
            <li>Tried and true.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old, have my own teeth and have just had some dental work done yesterday.</li>
            <li>Leaves breath fresh and teeth feels clean.</li>
            <li>but I like how it&#x27;s mild.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling super fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Well worth using.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste and I have sensitive teeth &amp; gums so works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Some other toothpastes taste chalky, but this one is bright and fresh.</li>
            <li>Arm &amp; Hammer went and messed up many of their toothpastes with Stain Defense, but thank God they left this one original.</li>
            <li>always feel clean and ready to go after using this toothpaste</li>
            <li>I don’t wear a particular size or fit for this item but maybe haven’t been using this product as much</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get adjusted to the taste of Arm &amp; Hammer, but now both my husband and I only feel satisfied using this brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t happily use any other kind of toothpaste (except other Arm and Hammer ones, like Complete Care) because they just don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>my favorite big box store has stopped carrying it, so I&#x27;ll be purchasing it from Amazon now instead of shopping around to find another source.</li>
            <li>Thanks, A&amp;H!</li>
            <li>I used this toothpaste for many years (5+), and recently changed to Sensodyne Pronamel.</li>
            <li>makes my teeth feel clean, better than any other toothpaste i have tried.</li>
            <li>it is pretty much a loser.  </li>
            <li>I am a true A&amp;H consumer for both their toothpaste and for their laundry detergent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel fresh without that strong, minty flavor (like other toothpastes) that seemed to just mask everything.</li>
            <li>Really can&#x27;t handle the flavor.  </li>
            <li>never give something 5 stars unless it really goes well beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>This really cleans my teeth and has whitened them.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Well, haha, thanks Arm &amp; Hammer for doing your job.</li>
            <li>After years of peeling, my lips are still in quite rough shape, but hopefully they will continue to heal and become more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; with time.</li>
            <li>, a superb benefit is that my gums have benefited also as they look pinker and less swollen with NO MORE bleeding (I have Gingivitis).</li>
            <li>Avid user of this toothpaste because there really isn&#x27;t much better for your teeth and gums than baking soda mixed with flouride, it&#x27;s a simple solution that just works.</li>
            <li>have also recently discovered Crest Pro Health Intensive Clean...</li>
            <li>My teeth are white and feel clean.</li>
            <li>I will have 2 more dental crowns completed in July; however,  they did not need to be done due to recent cavities (most recent cavity was 40 years ago)</li>
            <li>Real minty taste with a little background of baking soda, but I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this particular product of Arm &amp; Hammer since it hit the market and don&#x27;t want to change.  </li>
            <li>I find the PeroxiCare&#x27;s taste and cleaning effectiveness to be the best of the different Arm &amp; Hammer kinds out there as the taste is not too sweet (as I find Crest and Colgate are) and I don&#x27;t get a stale taste in my mouth after brushing (as I sometimes get with the Complete Care type and other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes like Tom&#x27;s of Maine.)</li>
            <li>Was easily able to get this for half that price, delivered (my order was over $50 over several items).</li>
            <li>The crowns were needed only due to cracking of the previously filled teeth (from youth).</li>
            <li>This is not the case with me, but it got me thinking about the extremely high baking soda content in this toothpaste (I believe it&#x27;s the highest on the market, which was initially why I bought it).</li>
            <li>so, oh well, totally worth it for less stains.</li>
            <li>Several people in the reddit posting recommended Pronamel, since it&#x27;s one of the few toothpaste options available that doesn&#x27;t have sodium laurel sulphate, but still has fluoride.</li>
            <li>I give credit to A&amp;H PeroxiCare toothpaste for much of my dental health, especially to the absence of any trace of gum disease!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few months of using the Pronamel toothpaste, my lips have become noticeably less chapped / irritated, and are starting to feel much better.</li>

            <li> Not sure if it is the baking soda or peroxide that makes it super bitter almost salty tasting.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new toothpaste, I&#x27;ve tried a few as well.</li>
            <li> I have a health condition that requires extra care of my gums and tongue and this is the only toothpaste that prevents little tongue ulcers from forming.</li>
            <li> every single time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but Stain Defense ruins the taste, and doesn&#x27;t have the same mouth feel as this.</li>
            <li> Heck, can get it for less than four bucks at my local store.</li>
            <li> Perhaps some people&#x27;s lips can handle this product, but not mine (again, I had no problems inside my mouth like some other reviews had, but my lips are in rough shape due to use of this product).</li>
            <li> Baking soda can be very drying and irritating, but I never put two and two together previously, as to why my lips may be so chapped.</li>
            <li> feeling from any other product...</li>
            <li> Just about like every other like product  on the market.  </li>
            <li> The material feels unlike any other toothpaste I have used</li>
            <li> I recently came across a reddit posting where people where explaining the problems they had with toothpaste containing sodium laurel sulphate (usually sores in the mouth).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly never gotten such a &amp;#34;just had a cleaning at the dentist&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> weird taste in your mouth after continued use, havent really seen a whitening effect yet</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the sickening sweet taste left in my mouth..</li>
            <li> I think this toothpaste tastes a little salty, but it&#x27;s baking soda toothpaste</li>
            <li> Got rid of my green tea stains.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use that expensive toothpaste for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really disappointed that this industry cannot provide a true tooth whitening product that works.</li>

            <li> Really can&#x27;t handle the flavor.  Once was enough.</li>
            <li> always feel clean and ready to go after using this toothpaste</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never give something 5 stars unless it really goes well beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new toothpaste, I&#x27;ve tried a few as well. I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the others, then I tried this. This really cleans my teeth and has whitened them. It makes my mouth feel fresh without that strong, minty flavor (like other toothpastes) that seemed to just mask everything. I don&#x27;t think it tastes bad, it&#x27;s a bit different but I like how it&#x27;s mild. This is now my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> A&amp;H is my favorite brand of toothpaste that contains Peroxide and Baking Soda. I&#x27;ve tried Crest and Colgate, but theirs do not compare to A&amp;H when it comes to having both those ingredients. When brushing, you can feel that tingle. I am a true A&amp;H consumer for both their toothpaste and for their laundry detergent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only toothpaste I use.  I&#x27;ve honestly never gotten such a &amp;#34;just had a cleaning at the dentist&amp;#34; feeling from any other product...every single time.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It tastes pretty bad and I don&#x27;t feel confident about my breath.</li>
            <li> The dentists dont know what to do when I go in for a cleaning because this stuff keeps my teeth so clean. I have a health condition that requires extra care of my gums and tongue and this is the only toothpaste that prevents little tongue ulcers from forming. Real minty taste with a little background of baking soda, but I love it. My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like the taste though so you may have to try it and see.</li>
            <li> Refreshing grown up toothpaste, made even better as it was recommended by my hygienist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely not used to the aftertaste, but what concerns me the most about this toothpaste is that my gum became sensitive to really cold food/drinks after 1 week of using this toothpaste. I never had this issue using Crest/Colgate or even Aquafresh toothpaste. Is this an indication that I have weak gum? Could it be that I&#x27;m allergic to baking soda? Any dentists reading this, please advise. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Got rid of my green tea stains.</li>
            <li> Made my gums bleed for some reason.  Like they just peeled away. Threw it away. Am using a fluoride free one with xylitol.</li>
            <li> Since I changed to this tooth paste, my dental appointments (cleanings) have improved and I think my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> White like Snow White</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it as a powerful agent against the tartar, I tried it and found it perfect for that job, so I&#x27;ll keep on ordering it</li>
            <li> Package was open upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Ever sice I discovered this toothpast, there is no going back.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent sensation of cleanness.</li>
            <li> No issues. Product showed up as described</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the sickening sweet taste left in my mouth.. It lingers on, ick.</li>
            <li> I noticed this has been helping my teeth look cleaner.  I think this toothpaste tastes a little salty, but it&#x27;s baking soda toothpaste so, oh well, totally worth it for less stains.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get adjusted to the taste of Arm &amp; Hammer, but now both my husband and I only feel satisfied using this brand of toothpaste. It does help when people ask you &amp;#34;Why are your teeth so white?&amp;#34; Well, haha, thanks Arm &amp; Hammer for doing your job. I find the PeroxiCare&#x27;s taste and cleaning effectiveness to be the best of the different Arm &amp; Hammer kinds out there as the taste is not too sweet (as I find Crest and Colgate are) and I don&#x27;t get a stale taste in my mouth after brushing (as I sometimes get with the Complete Care type and other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes like Tom&#x27;s of Maine.) We now live in Malaysia where they don&#x27;t sell Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste, and we must say we miss this toothpaste terribly!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes better than any I have ever used! I love how the baking soda makes my mouth feel bright after I use it.  Some other toothpastes taste chalky, but this one is bright and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good toothpaste, but made me gag when it got on my tongue. Not sure if it is the baking soda or peroxide that makes it super bitter almost salty tasting. Taste is just not for me, but my teeth looked and felt really clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> Have not found any difference, taste aweful</li>
            <li> My favorite tooth paste. Hands down.</li>
            <li> Avid user of this toothpaste because there really isn&#x27;t much better for your teeth and gums than baking soda mixed with flouride, it&#x27;s a simple solution that just works. And the mint flavoring is good without being overpowering. This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;showered mouth&amp;#34; feeling that aquafresh does, which I used for years previously, but it does feel good and more importantly, it&#x27;s the best for your teeth, enamel and gums.</li>
            <li> makes my teeth feel clean, better than any other toothpaste i have tried.</li>
            <li> Jeeez... I &#x27;m reviewing toothpast...&lt;br /&gt;I have always liked this one&lt;br /&gt;I have also recently discovered Crest Pro Health Intensive Clean... I like that one too</li>
            <li> weird taste in your mouth after continued use, havent really seen a whitening effect yet</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste - whitens &amp; cleans my teeth like I just came from the dentist feel. Hard to find in stores alot of times SO ordering online is the way to go. Quick shipping. Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste, makes my teeth feel so clean. I can&#x27;t happily use any other kind of toothpaste (except other Arm and Hammer ones, like Complete Care) because they just don&#x27;t work as well. I usually buy at Walmart but Amazon had a coupon for a tube so I went for it.</li>
            <li> It has a pasty taste but it&#x27;s really good.  My teeth are white and feel clean. Well worth using.</li>
            <li> For me, I was so happy to find this toothpaste at my local store. After using it for about 2 weeks (along with PLAX Rinse), I noticed that my tartar is continuing to come off my teeth and they are whiter and brighter!&lt;br /&gt;Also, a superb benefit is that my gums have benefited also as they look pinker and less swollen with NO MORE bleeding (I have Gingivitis). This is the best toothpaste that I have found for both my teeth and gums. (Note that I also use the WaterPik Water Flosser on level 3 as this cleans my gums and teeth greatly as well)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Best of all, this toothpaste is more natural and gentle. I no longer have to use that expensive toothpaste for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to all!</li>
            <li> Excellent price. Arm &amp; Hammer went and messed up many of their toothpastes with Stain Defense, but thank God they left this one original. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but Stain Defense ruins the taste, and doesn&#x27;t have the same mouth feel as this.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning teeth, I feel like I get an all-day clean feeling after brushing with this toothpaste. The flavor is very bad at first, but after using it a few times it becomes not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could take it or leave it, which is why I&#x27;m giving it three stars. I am not crazy about the flavor, but I&#x27;ve got to admit it does a great job giving your teeth a fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel incredibly clean after use. Notice reduction in bleeding gums. Awesome product</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste and I have sensitive teeth &amp; gums so works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This is good tooth paste but as far a whitening it is pretty much a loser.  Just about like every other like product  on the market.  Use a Strawberry paste, it  works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really disappointed that this industry cannot provide a true tooth whitening product that works.</li>
            <li> I don’t wear a particular size or fit for this item but maybe haven’t been using this product as much but he times I was using it, it felt like it works great or it should. The material feels unlike any other toothpaste I have used but they were all fluoride and without baking soda which is what the customers should expect. The quality is above my expectations.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years like all A&amp;H products I like them a lot.</li>
            <li> Better dental hygiene results after using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> good price, nice to have the option to get it on line</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. Figured I&#x27;d order it from Amazon since I&#x27;m getting low. $7.41 for the 6-oz tube?! No way. Was easily able to get this for half that price, delivered (my order was over $50 over several items). Heck, can get it for less than four bucks at my local store.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular product of Arm &amp; Hammer since it hit the market and don&#x27;t want to change.  Ever since I started using it, I&#x27;ve had great checkups with a minimal amount of plaque build-up.  The hygienist is pleased, so I&#x27;ve stuck with it.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to family members and they are pleased with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just found out my favorite big box store has stopped carrying it, so I&#x27;ll be purchasing it from Amazon now instead of shopping around to find another source.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing!!! It leaves your mouth feeling super fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years. Tried and true.</li>
            <li> Love just about anything Arm&amp;hammer!! This toothpaste will leave your teeth feeling so clean you will swear you were just at the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Definitely happy.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed  with these. I only had the for a brief time when one side stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now. It&#x27;s a kosher product that I love.</li>
            <li> Great at cleaning teeth and freshens breath.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much.  Leaves breath fresh and teeth feels clean.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old, have my own teeth and have just had some dental work done yesterday. I will have 2 more dental crowns completed in July; however,  they did not need to be done due to recent cavities (most recent cavity was 40 years ago) and I have NO signs of gum disease. The crowns were needed only due to cracking of the previously filled teeth (from youth). I give credit to A&amp;H PeroxiCare toothpaste for much of my dental health, especially to the absence of any trace of gum disease! Thanks, A&amp;H!</li>
            <li> I order two one for me and my boyfriend  we are pretty satisfied</li>
            <li> This tooth paste has improved the health of my gums over the past two years of use.</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price.</li>
            <li> I switched to this toothpaste when I discovered the Crest I&#x27;d been using had plastic in it. Like all the other Arm and Hammer products I&#x27;ve used, this one is very good, leaves mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Taste gross but great for HCG diet.</li>
            <li> I tried many toothpastes and this one was the best, hands down.</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste for many years (5+), and recently changed to Sensodyne Pronamel. I&#x27;ve always had such horribly chapped lips the past few years (that now, thinking back, likely coincided with starting the use of this product), and recall that when I was younger my lips were much less chapped (they chapped only when it got very cold in the winter). I recently came across a reddit posting where people where explaining the problems they had with toothpaste containing sodium laurel sulphate (usually sores in the mouth). This is not the case with me, but it got me thinking about the extremely high baking soda content in this toothpaste (I believe it&#x27;s the highest on the market, which was initially why I bought it). Baking soda can be very drying and irritating, but I never put two and two together previously, as to why my lips may be so chapped. Several people in the reddit posting recommended Pronamel, since it&#x27;s one of the few toothpaste options available that doesn&#x27;t have sodium laurel sulphate, but still has fluoride. More importantly for me, it also has no baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months of using the Pronamel toothpaste, my lips have become noticeably less chapped / irritated, and are starting to feel much better. After years of peeling, my lips are still in quite rough shape, but hopefully they will continue to heal and become more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; with time. It&#x27;s funny that I was a loyal customer of PeroxiCare for so many years, and now I would steer anyone I know away from this product. Perhaps some people&#x27;s lips can handle this product, but not mine (again, I had no problems inside my mouth like some other reviews had, but my lips are in rough shape due to use of this product). If you just started using this product, and find that your lips are getting increasingly chapped, please consider making a switch to another product that doesn&#x27;t contain baking soda.</li>
