    <ol>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>Everything else that came in the package is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I recieved this Item and im not to happy with it.</li>
            <li>This product is very nice.</li>
            <li>It is good for a starter.</li>
            <li>Its a good product to practice with and get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was a good price.</li>
            <li>very satisfied</li>
            <li>So I suggest you use your own brushes or buy some.</li>
            <li>Its good for a first timer, to practice getting the feel of doing your own nails.</li>
            <li>It wouldnt keep the charm on at all and get this, I was actually able to pop the acrylic residue off without messing up my pre polished nails....</li>
            <li>Today I ended up using it for once fell in love.</li>
            <li>Probably best to do outside or something.</li>
            <li>but there are better powders now, and I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li>The more acrylic liquid the better.</li>
            <li>Everything worked fine.</li>
            <li>and this is the perfect little starter kit.</li>
            <li>THE WAY, the acrylic has a super strong smell.</li>
            <li>It was good enough and was if I were in a salon.</li>
            <li>it was fun to practice with them, haven&#x27;t done nails myself since state board exam.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a white acrylic powder at the store by my house because I liked how it turned out.</li>
            <li>My advice is: if you want a decent product with good quality you must spend the extra money.</li>
            <li>thats right...</li>
            <li>I was sceptically about the product been the first time doing it (my nails)</li>
            <li>but i would not use it consistently.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had were the brushes that came with it, they weren&#x27;t good enough to apply the acrylic to the nail without coming apart.</li>
            <li>buying real professional products is always worth your money.</li>
            <li>applicator brush is SMALL pretty much unusable, but rest is good.</li>
            <li>but the primer seemed to go fast.</li>
            <li>and it smelt up the whole house.</li>
            <li>Saves me so much moneyyy cause</li>
            <li>I only wanted a cheap test kit to see if I would be alright making acrylic flowers &amp; bows or if I would suck at them.</li>
            <li>the picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>and the brushes suck.they are so small.it was just a waste of money to be honest.</li>
            <li>It did not stay long maybe 2 days before they started chipping (easily).</li>
            <li>but at the end I was surprise by the results, will highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The brushes dont have much hair on them so it nearly impossibe to apply the acrylic powder onto the nails.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it was just me, or maybe mine wasn&#x27;t filled up as much, I dont know, I didn&#x27;t get to check it when I first open the acrylic liquid.</li>
            <li>I applied the podwer and it jus peeled right off after it was set to dry.</li>
            <li>The Primer is decent and the nail forms are basic.</li>
            <li>The acrylic is mediocre at best, and the brush sucks.</li>
            <li>My only problems were, the 2 brushes they come with are reallly small and you cant really spread the product right.</li>

            <li> The sassi acrylic kit was so bad, it needs a better brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the sassi nail primer with brush, will use the other products.</li>

            <li> Well everything is really small.</li>
            <li> Everything was so small.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars 1 because I have it (very late arrival though)</li>
            <li> it was all dented up and broken that the products just fell out.</li>
            <li> Needless to say i got a seperate brush to apply with.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed, at all.</li>
            <li> ill review it again and take pics when i myself use it.</li>

            <li> I recieved this Item and im not to happy with it. The brushes dont have much hair on them so it nearly impossibe to apply the acrylic powder onto the nails. Needless to say i got a seperate brush to apply with. I applied the podwer and it jus peeled right off after it was set to dry. I actually gave it another try seeing as to how I bought this to apply 3d nail art to my false nails, it was a no go. It wouldnt keep the charm on at all and get this, I was actually able to pop the acrylic residue off without messing up my pre polished nails.... how does that work??? oh ya thats right... It doesnt. I gave it two stars 1 because I have it (very late arrival though) two because I got what was in this picture.</li>
            <li> Overall the products work well. but they are smaller bottles then i expected. to small for the prices if you ask me.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t the best. It did not stay long maybe 2 days before they started chipping (easily). My advice is: if you want a decent product with good quality you must spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> Today I ended up using it for once fell in love. It was good enough and was if I were in a salon.</li>
            <li> So what can I say about this kit. Well everything is really small. Everything worked fine. My only problems were, the 2 brushes they come with are reallly small and you cant really spread the product right. So I suggest you use your own brushes or buy some. Another thing I had a problem with is I could only do my nails twice with this kit. I ran outta the acrylic liquid already. I have the tiniest bit left. Not enough to do both hands. I have wayyy than enough powder and primer left. they give you a lot of that. but the primer seemed to go fast.Not sure if it was just me, or maybe mine wasn&#x27;t filled up as much, I dont know, I didn&#x27;t get to check it when I first open the acrylic liquid. Anyways besides that and the brushes, the product does work okay.&lt;br /&gt;BY THE WAY, the acrylic has a super strong smell. Probably best to do outside or something. I did it in my room and it smelt up the whole house. Just a heads up.</li>
            <li> Everything was so small. and the brushes suck.they are so small.it was just a waste of money to be honest.</li>
            <li> it was fun to practice with them, haven&#x27;t done nails myself since state board exam. but there are better powders now, and I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> The sassi acrylic kit was so bad, it needs a better brush. The more acrylic liquid the better. Nails should&lt;br /&gt;be included.</li>
            <li> Saves me so much moneyyy cause now I don&#x27;t have to pay 20 $ each time I want my nails done!</li>
            <li> I was sceptically about the product been the first time doing it (my nails) but at the end I was surprise by the results, will highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice. The only problem I had were the brushes that came with it, they weren&#x27;t good enough to apply the acrylic to the nail without coming apart. Everything else that came in the package is wonderful.</li>
            <li> applicator brush is SMALL pretty much unusable, but rest is good.</li>
            <li> It is good for a starter. But the Acrylic does come off after a couple days. Its a good product to practice with and get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> When I got my package and opened it.. it was all dented up and broken that the products just fell out. I was not impressed, at all.</li>
            <li> I only wanted a cheap test kit to see if I would be alright making acrylic flowers &amp; bows or if I would suck at them. This had everything I needed for my little test and some extra things I don&#x27;t plan on using since I don&#x27;t need them for making the flowers. I ended up buying a white acrylic powder at the store by my house because I liked how it turned out. When I run out of acrylic liquid, hopefully I&#x27;ll know which 1 to buy because of this!</li>
            <li> Its good for a first timer, to practice getting the feel of doing your own nails. but i would not use it consistently. buying real professional products is always worth your money. my biggest concern is the brushes. the picture is very deceiving. the brush head is so tiny!!!</li>
            <li> The acrylic is mediocre at best, and the brush sucks. The Primer is decent and the nail forms are basic.</li>
            <li> I am just starting to consider going into being a nail tech and this is the perfect little starter kit. It&#x27;s just enough to practice with. very satisfied</li>
            <li> Bought this for the sassi nail primer with brush, will use the other products.</li>
            <li> i havent used it yet... but it came with what i need... the bushes suck but im going to use them. one to apply cuticle oil cuz i have a huge bottle of it i bought from sallys beauty supply and the other ill use for something else... i havent used it but i know someone who only uses this and she never has problems...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was a good price. ill review it again and take pics when i myself use it.</li>
