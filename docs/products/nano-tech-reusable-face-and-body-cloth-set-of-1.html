            <li>Better to use baby washcloths.  </li>
            <li>I WILL be buying more of these</li>
            <li>I love these and use them almost every day.  </li>
            <li>so I have to wash them more than once per week.</li>
            <li>Love these cloths.</li>
            <li>These are nothing more than micro fiber pieces of fabric.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for traveling, too!</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and am allergic to so many things.  </li>
            <li>Love these cloths.</li>
            <li>and it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>I was using the Jane Iredale \\&quot;magic mitt\\&quot; and thought these might be a better deal (six, instead of one, with a washing bag).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any cleanser, just ACV toner, and combined with a healthy diet</li>
            <li>We love these cloths.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I love to exfoliate every day.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more, if needed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear make up, but I do love to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>White ones are perfect for decollete area.</li>
            <li>These are far superior for your skin!</li>
            <li>Feels nice and clean.</li>
            <li>and then I put the wash cloth under warm water and sort of lay it on my face and wipe my face clean.</li>
            <li>My face felt very clean and restored with energy.  </li>
            <li>I loved these at first.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face routine nice and quick.</li>
            <li>Amazing cloth that gently exfoliates my skin that I use every day for my children and myself!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s SO easy to throw one of these in my bag.</li>
            <li>My skin looks clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>They clean off my makeup 100% and are so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Work fine, but according to the label you can&#x27;t use fabric softener.  </li>
            <li>I hope when I do need additional cloths that they are still available.</li>
            <li>These washcloths are great and so simple to use!</li>
            <li>In the shower I use them all over my body, and they leave my skin feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li>and you do so lightly or else</li>
            <li>so you enjoy using them</li>
            <li>My skin could feel the fresh air and was, to me, breathing healthily.  </li>
            <li>It took my mascara right off without soap and my face feels smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I would recommend Nano to anyone who is interested in clean healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>This is all I use to clean my face day and night.</li>
            <li>I use the cloth to clean my face in the evening, both for when I wear makeup</li>
            <li>After ONE use of these my skin was clean and polished looking</li>
            <li>I had no idea there was anything that could clean like this.</li>
            <li>but they work to clean your face.  </li>
            <li>I always use a washcloth and cleanser to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>How could they possibly clean as well as cleanser and a cloth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it helps to clean skin without leaving lint.  </li>
            <li>I was originally using the H2O at home cloths but went to buy more and found out that it cost as much to ship them as it was to buy them</li>
            <li>see nothing special in whst they have done for my skin.</li>
            <li>I received my first microfiber washcloth with a cleansing oil I bought from Sephora and I fell in love with it right away because it got my face so clean.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about them.</li>
            <li>Not only do the cloths come packaged so nicely (it would make a great gift), but they are such high quality and way better than the one that I had gotten at Sephora.</li>
            <li>on I can see it on the cloth and move it around to get a clean area, then I use some soap and wash the cloth right away.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more effective than the other microfiber clothes that I tried.  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality, very absorption and soft on facial skin.</li>
            <li>The whole family is enjoying this pure luxury!</li>
            <li>dry quickly for the next use...and do a wonderful job of removing creams and makeup.</li>
            <li>I have used three different types of microfiber wash cloths and these are now at the top of my the list!</li>
            <li>They are super soft and clean up easily in warm/hot water.  </li>
            <li>These are great for exfoliating without over stripping the skin so they keep my dead skin cells in check.  </li>
            <li>I just received these as a gift a few months ago and after using them I had the great idea to give these out as x-mas presents.</li>
            <li>These take off every bit of makeup using ONLY warm water.</li>
            <li>Also, terrific for gifts in that they come nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>I had to go in with my old \\&quot;magic mitt\\&quot; to get the remainder of my mascara off.</li>
            <li>I love how soft the cloths are and would reccomend them.</li>
            <li>Worth it for no cleansers nor chemicals.</li>
            <li>I rarely give a five star review</li>
            <li>All you need is water and they take your makeup right off.</li>
            <li>They are right when they say you don&#x27;t need to use any cleanser.</li>
            <li>The label allows me to hang it to dry, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>They take all the makeup, dirt, mascara off without scrubbing and leave my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s so simple</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they say, and if, by chance, you try these and don&#x27;t think you will use them, someone you know would thank you forever for introducing them to this product1</li>
            <li>I really like these wash cloths!  </li>
            <li>love them and love the fact that I can wash my face without any harsh cleansers!</li>
            <li>Started out using them on my newborn only, but have been using them myself and love them for makeup removal.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t even wear that much makeup!</li>
            <li>The white is much more gratifying to use because it&#x27;s easier to see all the dirt that&#x27;s removed.  </li>
            <li>I just opened the package last night and I love the way these wash cloths feel when I&#x27;m using them on my face.  </li>
            <li>so it is hard for me to find products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, and I finally found the perfect one!!!</li>
            <li>They are so soft we use one of them to clean our glasses.</li>
            <li>I use these very gently on my face because anything too much can cause a flare-- for me anyway.  </li>
            <li>but this pretty much does it all.</li>
            <li>I need more time to see how my skin does in the long term.</li>
            <li>I have only used the cloth for a few days but already see its advantages in terms of doing a good cleansing job (but keep in mind that I wear light make-up and never wear mascara).</li>
            <li>towel itself is very durable, thick and actually quite beautiful!</li>
            <li>Certainly will reorder for reason of...</li>
            <li>My skin is so much healthier not using products.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic  Will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>These cloths really do work.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much clearer and brighter</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They work well, but I regret paying so much for it</li>
            <li>They are a very generous</li>
            <li>I have to be gentle but every bit comes off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My moisturizer even glides on so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Like others have mentioned, you only need water to completely remove all but the most stubborn eye makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to try these and ripped open the box to use them as soon</li>
            <li>I only use water and my face still feels clean after using just the cloths.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find a nice soft facial wash cloth in regular store.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have received Nano as a gift.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these towels to anyone.</li>
            <li>When wet they are soft as butter, love the gentle exfoliating action they provide while washing your face.</li>
            <li>Super soft and gentle on the face and takes basic makeup off with normal pressure.</li>
            <li>My face is squeaky clean and dry after I use these cloths.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate any product that doesn&#x27;t add more waste to the environment.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a regular wash clothe since buying these, well worth the money</li>
            <li>These towels are nice and thick.</li>
            <li>Nothing special other than they are designated as my very now cloths.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the feel of my skin without cleanser - not tight or dry.</li>
            <li>I have always used a facial cleanser, so using cloth with only warm water seemed strange.</li>
            <li>They rinse out well, and wash up just like new in the washer.  </li>
            <li>They were very neatly stitched on the outside, unlike my cleaning cloths, and much thicker.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and anything  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>these are very soft and have a luxurious feel</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t need to use any harsh cleansers to get my makeup off of my face!  </li>
            <li>These cloths completely changed how I wash my skin!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I&#x27;ll be honest, I was skeptical; I thought, \\&quot;This feels like a normal cloth.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Each and every time, regardless of how carefully or how long I wash, the cotton picks up more</li>
            <li>I just wet the cloth in hot water, then gently wipe the oil off.</li>
            <li>tried using lots of scrubbers, but these can be felt doing the job, don&#x27;t even use soap with them just rinse them during use, they remove dead skin poste haste, rinse  and hang up til next time skin feels really clean and gets in the facial folds like around nose and so forth making it sooo clean</li>
            <li>Deep cleans gently when bathing my children with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wet them and go over my face (make sure it is thoroughly wet</li>
            <li>Plus they make your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>They stay soft, even after washing.</li>
            <li>This is simply a soft cloth.  </li>
            <li>E V E R Y O N E should have these - it has become a complete staple for me.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The fibers on the Nano Tech cloths are much thicker and softer feeling than a regular microfiber cloth.</li>
            <li>These cloths are so soft, I use them on my face and body.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well these work.</li>
            <li>A pain if you&#x27;d like them to stay soft....</li>
            <li>They feel like soft, microfiber dust cloths.  </li>
            <li>Wow - it removed all the makeup and oil.  </li>
            <li>They are supper soft.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out otherwise.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used the anti-aging Otha from 7/10/14 pm.</li>
            <li>So far I like them and the money I will save on cleansers</li>
            <li>The stitched edges of the cloths are not abrasive but, just as soft as the rest of the cloth.</li>
            <li>It has worked wonders naturally.</li>
            <li>A little rinse with castile soap gets the make up off the cloth and it&#x27;s perfectly clean and ready for the next wash!</li>
            <li>I can use my sensitive cleanser and this cloth and it gets my skin really clean without the harsh effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m imagining it, but after a few weeks of use, my skin looks better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>The soft, thick fibers grab every last trace of makeup, leaving me with a clean, gently exfoliated face.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin but can be a little sensitive to certain products.</li>
            <li>And dry out so fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these and another major brand and cannot tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, delicate skin that reacts to pretty much everything, so I&#x27;m always looking for compatible skincare</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unbelievable how clean they stay even after taking of your makeup.</li>
            <li>so apparently all the &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; is out of them because I used fabric softener.  </li>
            <li>I am not a heavy makeup user, but it takes off every bit of makeup and appears to exfoliate at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I have far fewer blemishes and an overall even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice (and a bit weird) is that there isn&#x27;t even a trace of the makeup on the cloth after using it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until after my face had dried that I could feel a true and obvious difference.  </li>
            <li>Thick, rich feeling face and body towels.</li>
            <li>Everything just washes right out of it with plain water.</li>
            <li>Not perfectly clean - because nothing ever unclogs my pores - but much better than with my usual cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on cleansers from department stores that always tend to dry my skin</li>

            <li> Love how nicely these remove makeup on my skin.</li>
            <li> They are wonderful clothes, soft, and after i was my face with products, they take even more make up, or anything.</li>
            <li> and I love these cloths.</li>
            <li> Better to use baby washcloths.  </li>
            <li> I WILL be buying more of these</li>
            <li> I love these and use them almost every day.  </li>
            <li> so I have to wash them more than once per week.</li>
            <li> Love these cloths.</li>
            <li> These are nothing more than micro fiber pieces of fabric.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for traveling, too!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and am allergic to so many things.  </li>
            <li> Love these cloths.</li>
            <li> and it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> Just okay.</li>
            <li> I was using the Jane Iredale \\&quot;magic mitt\\&quot; and thought these might be a better deal (six, instead of one, with a washing bag).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any cleanser, just ACV toner, and combined with a healthy diet</li>
            <li> We love these cloths.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> I love to exfoliate every day.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more, if needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up, but I do love to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> White ones are perfect for decollete area.</li>
            <li> These are far superior for your skin!</li>
            <li> Feels nice and clean.</li>
            <li> and then I put the wash cloth under warm water and sort of lay it on my face and wipe my face clean.</li>
            <li> My face felt very clean and restored with energy.  </li>
            <li> I loved these at first.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face routine nice and quick.</li>
            <li> Amazing cloth that gently exfoliates my skin that I use every day for my children and myself!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s SO easy to throw one of these in my bag.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> They clean off my makeup 100% and are so refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Work fine, but according to the label you can&#x27;t use fabric softener.  </li>
            <li> I hope when I do need additional cloths that they are still available.</li>
            <li> These washcloths are great and so simple to use!</li>
            <li> In the shower I use them all over my body, and they leave my skin feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li> and you do so lightly or else</li>
            <li> so you enjoy using them</li>
            <li> My skin could feel the fresh air and was, to me, breathing healthily.  </li>
            <li> It took my mascara right off without soap and my face feels smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I would recommend Nano to anyone who is interested in clean healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> This is all I use to clean my face day and night.</li>
            <li> I use the cloth to clean my face in the evening, both for when I wear makeup</li>
            <li> After ONE use of these my skin was clean and polished looking</li>
            <li> I had no idea there was anything that could clean like this.</li>
            <li> but they work to clean your face.  </li>
            <li> I always use a washcloth and cleanser to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> How could they possibly clean as well as cleanser and a cloth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it helps to clean skin without leaving lint.  </li>
            <li> I was originally using the H2O at home cloths but went to buy more and found out that it cost as much to ship them as it was to buy them</li>
            <li> see nothing special in whst they have done for my skin.</li>
            <li> I received my first microfiber washcloth with a cleansing oil I bought from Sephora and I fell in love with it right away because it got my face so clean.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about them.</li>
            <li> Not only do the cloths come packaged so nicely (it would make a great gift), but they are such high quality and way better than the one that I had gotten at Sephora.</li>
            <li> on I can see it on the cloth and move it around to get a clean area, then I use some soap and wash the cloth right away.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more effective than the other microfiber clothes that I tried.  </li>
            <li> Excellent quality, very absorption and soft on facial skin.</li>
            <li> The whole family is enjoying this pure luxury!</li>
            <li> dry quickly for the next use...and do a wonderful job of removing creams and makeup.</li>
            <li> I have used three different types of microfiber wash cloths and these are now at the top of my the list!</li>
            <li> They are super soft and clean up easily in warm/hot water.  </li>
            <li> These are great for exfoliating without over stripping the skin so they keep my dead skin cells in check.  </li>
            <li> I just received these as a gift a few months ago and after using them I had the great idea to give these out as x-mas presents.</li>
            <li> These take off every bit of makeup using ONLY warm water.</li>
            <li> Also, terrific for gifts in that they come nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I had to go in with my old \\&quot;magic mitt\\&quot; to get the remainder of my mascara off.</li>
            <li> I love how soft the cloths are and would reccomend them.</li>
            <li> Worth it for no cleansers nor chemicals.</li>
            <li> I rarely give a five star review</li>
            <li> All you need is water and they take your makeup right off.</li>
            <li> They are right when they say you don&#x27;t need to use any cleanser.</li>
            <li> The label allows me to hang it to dry, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> They take all the makeup, dirt, mascara off without scrubbing and leave my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s so simple</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they say, and if, by chance, you try these and don&#x27;t think you will use them, someone you know would thank you forever for introducing them to this product1</li>
            <li> I really like these wash cloths!  </li>
            <li> love them and love the fact that I can wash my face without any harsh cleansers!</li>
            <li> Started out using them on my newborn only, but have been using them myself and love them for makeup removal.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even wear that much makeup!</li>
            <li> The white is much more gratifying to use because it&#x27;s easier to see all the dirt that&#x27;s removed.  </li>
            <li> I just opened the package last night and I love the way these wash cloths feel when I&#x27;m using them on my face.  </li>
            <li> so it is hard for me to find products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, and I finally found the perfect one!!!</li>
            <li> They are so soft we use one of them to clean our glasses.</li>
            <li> I use these very gently on my face because anything too much can cause a flare-- for me anyway.  </li>
            <li> but this pretty much does it all.</li>
            <li> I need more time to see how my skin does in the long term.</li>
            <li> I have only used the cloth for a few days but already see its advantages in terms of doing a good cleansing job (but keep in mind that I wear light make-up and never wear mascara).</li>
            <li> towel itself is very durable, thick and actually quite beautiful!</li>
            <li> Certainly will reorder for reason of...</li>
            <li> My skin is so much healthier not using products.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic  Will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> These cloths really do work.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much clearer and brighter</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They work well, but I regret paying so much for it</li>
            <li> They are a very generous</li>
            <li> I have to be gentle but every bit comes off.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My moisturizer even glides on so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, you only need water to completely remove all but the most stubborn eye makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was excited to try these and ripped open the box to use them as soon</li>
            <li> I only use water and my face still feels clean after using just the cloths.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a nice soft facial wash cloth in regular store.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have received Nano as a gift.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these towels to anyone.</li>
            <li> When wet they are soft as butter, love the gentle exfoliating action they provide while washing your face.</li>
            <li> Super soft and gentle on the face and takes basic makeup off with normal pressure.</li>
            <li> My face is squeaky clean and dry after I use these cloths.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate any product that doesn&#x27;t add more waste to the environment.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a regular wash clothe since buying these, well worth the money</li>
            <li> These towels are nice and thick.</li>
            <li> Nothing special other than they are designated as my very now cloths.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the feel of my skin without cleanser - not tight or dry.</li>
            <li> I have always used a facial cleanser, so using cloth with only warm water seemed strange.</li>
            <li> They rinse out well, and wash up just like new in the washer.  </li>
            <li> They were very neatly stitched on the outside, unlike my cleaning cloths, and much thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and anything  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> these are very soft and have a luxurious feel</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t need to use any harsh cleansers to get my makeup off of my face!  </li>
            <li> These cloths completely changed how I wash my skin!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I&#x27;ll be honest, I was skeptical; I thought, \\&quot;This feels like a normal cloth.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Each and every time, regardless of how carefully or how long I wash, the cotton picks up more</li>
            <li> I just wet the cloth in hot water, then gently wipe the oil off.</li>
            <li> tried using lots of scrubbers, but these can be felt doing the job, don&#x27;t even use soap with them just rinse them during use, they remove dead skin poste haste, rinse  and hang up til next time skin feels really clean and gets in the facial folds like around nose and so forth making it sooo clean</li>
            <li> Deep cleans gently when bathing my children with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wet them and go over my face (make sure it is thoroughly wet</li>
            <li> Plus they make your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> They stay soft, even after washing.</li>
            <li> This is simply a soft cloth.  </li>
            <li> E V E R Y O N E should have these - it has become a complete staple for me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The fibers on the Nano Tech cloths are much thicker and softer feeling than a regular microfiber cloth.</li>
            <li> These cloths are so soft, I use them on my face and body.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well these work.</li>
            <li> A pain if you&#x27;d like them to stay soft....</li>
            <li> They feel like soft, microfiber dust cloths.  </li>
            <li> Wow - it removed all the makeup and oil.  </li>
            <li> They are supper soft.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out otherwise.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used the anti-aging Otha from 7/10/14 pm.</li>
            <li> So far I like them and the money I will save on cleansers</li>
            <li> The stitched edges of the cloths are not abrasive but, just as soft as the rest of the cloth.</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders naturally.</li>
            <li> A little rinse with castile soap gets the make up off the cloth and it&#x27;s perfectly clean and ready for the next wash!</li>
            <li> I can use my sensitive cleanser and this cloth and it gets my skin really clean without the harsh effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m imagining it, but after a few weeks of use, my skin looks better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> The soft, thick fibers grab every last trace of makeup, leaving me with a clean, gently exfoliated face.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin but can be a little sensitive to certain products.</li>
            <li> And dry out so fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these and another major brand and cannot tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, delicate skin that reacts to pretty much everything, so I&#x27;m always looking for compatible skincare</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable how clean they stay even after taking of your makeup.</li>
            <li> so apparently all the &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; is out of them because I used fabric softener.  </li>
            <li> I am not a heavy makeup user, but it takes off every bit of makeup and appears to exfoliate at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I have far fewer blemishes and an overall even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice (and a bit weird) is that there isn&#x27;t even a trace of the makeup on the cloth after using it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until after my face had dried that I could feel a true and obvious difference.  </li>
            <li> Thick, rich feeling face and body towels.</li>
            <li> Everything just washes right out of it with plain water.</li>
            <li> Not perfectly clean - because nothing ever unclogs my pores - but much better than with my usual cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on cleansers from department stores that always tend to dry my skin</li>
            <li> I follow up with the oil cleanse method afterwards and my face feels clean without being dried out or any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I only use the tan color cloths for the face, it&#x27;s gentle enough to exfoliate the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> Well long story short, I took it with me everywhere</li>
            <li> Wet it with warm or cold water, and it takes off every speck of makeup - even waterproof eyeliner and mascara.  </li>
            <li> They let me use no or minimal facial cleansers these days</li>
            <li> They do not exfoliate AT ALL and are much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was curious about these cloths, especially because they are used without cleanser.  </li>
            <li> After cleaning off makeup it does not dry out my skin it absorbs left over water and does not leaving the little scratches.</li>
            <li> While this is made of the same material, the % of each material is a little different.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Two of the cloths are white, the other four are tan.  </li>
            <li> so I use a cloth one time and throw in wash and hang dry.</li>
            <li> And I throw it into the machine (wash and dry)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry by morning.</li>
            <li> I wash them in the bag in the machine and hang dry them.</li>
            <li> They wring out almost dry after use.</li>
            <li> I use one to dry off after the shower and I use one for my face!</li>
            <li> I could not live without them!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it takes off all my heavy eye make up with just using water - I never have to deal with gross make up remover again.  </li>
            <li> I wet the cloth and started washing.  </li>
            <li> With the Nano Tech, I don&#x27;t have to worry about using multiple products, cleansers, harsh exfoliants and makeup removers.  </li>
            <li> I washed the cloths in cold water, normal cycle, and they looked like new.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I cannot use face brushes, clarisonic or even so called sensitive exfoliators on my skin.  </li>
            <li> AT LEAST THEY ARE SOFT, BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY I PAID FOR THEM,  </li>
            <li> They offer very little abrasion and only when used without soap.</li>
            <li> These micro-fiber face cloths are thicker, softer and work just as well as any other micro fiber cloths I have tried, including ones that cost over twice the price of these.  </li>
            <li> The only problem with the scrubber gloves is that I have to buy them so often and they can be a little too harsh depending on the brand I buy which varies purchase to purchase.</li>
            <li> and if I forget and rub too hard, my face becomes really red and irritated.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there are six, rather than seven</li>
            <li> so my skin is much less irritated.</li>
            <li> may still have some slight staining, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> Too rough or thick for the face in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I take one or two and don&#x27;t have to carry a heavy container of pre moistened wipes.  </li>
            <li> But after a few washing they took on a moldy smell.</li>
            <li> but it was stiff</li>
            <li> Over the course of a week, my bumpy forehead cleared to just a few small pimples.  </li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t as big as a windshield, after all, I&#x27;d only need a quarter of each sheet, and they&#x27;re so thick that it&#x27;s impossible to get all the eye makeup off.</li>
            <li> I bought these towels to replace the exfoliating scrubber gloves that I usually buy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money!</li>
            <li> - how could I not love them?  </li>
            <li> Then I tossed them inthe hamper and lazily put off doing laundry for a week and the bumpy forehead made a return.  </li>
            <li> BTW, the negative reviews that say that these are plain microfiber cloths are incorrect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard removing all that lint from those grabby fibers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything it says it does ~ for me, at least.</li>
            <li> I wash them in delicate and use no fabric softener as instructed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped save me money too, no more buying products that I just have to throw away - you just throw these cloths in the wash!</li>
            <li> When you do use these with soap they are so slick as to be useless.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re SO thick!</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds weird but ever since I started using these without the cleanser, my acne has started clearing up.</li>
            <li> I am literally OBSESSED with these cloths.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, expensive creams, lotions, procedures at salons.</li>
            <li> Everything was expensive, lots of times my skin was in a state of redness and peeling.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and buy these and pass on all the expensive promises out there.</li>
            <li> and I always have extras if one gets dirty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent! I have very sensitive skin and I love these cloths. They let me use no or minimal facial cleansers these days so my skin is much less irritated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly on my face for a couple of months now and loving it!  It makes my face glow after I use it, like I just gotten a facial.  I&#x27;m on Retin-A, and this has prevented the flakiness from developing on my face.  It&#x27;s much more effective than the other microfiber clothes that I tried.  However, it is quite abrasive still and if I forget and rub too hard, my face becomes really red and irritated.</li>
            <li> Too rough or thick for the face in my opinion.  Better to use baby washcloths.  I ended up using these for cleaning up around the house.</li>
            <li> These are great for the face.  I have very sensitive skin and anything  can set it off.  I use these very gently on my face because anything too much can cause a flare-- for me anyway.  These are great for exfoliating without over stripping the skin so they keep my dead skin cells in check.  I WILL be buying more of these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed how well these remove make up with just water. I follow up with the oil cleanse method afterwards and my face feels clean without being dried out or any harsh chemicals. A little rinse with castile soap gets the make up off the cloth and it&#x27;s perfectly clean and ready for the next wash!</li>
            <li> I love these and use them almost every day.  My only complaint is that there are six, rather than seven so I have to wash them more than once per week.</li>
            <li> Just like everyone reports.  It took my mascara right off without soap and my face feels smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year. This is all I use to clean my face day and night. I have spent so much money on cleansers from department stores that always tend to dry my skin and there&#x27;s still dirt and makeup. These cloths are amazing! They take all the makeup, dirt, mascara off without scrubbing and leave my skin smooth and soft. I do use an exfoliator about once a month but this pretty much does it all. I love that it&#x27;s so simple and I am still happy with them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these cloths! I just received these as a gift a few months ago and after using them I had the great idea to give these out as x-mas presents. I hate to use products on my face and these take off all your make up with just water! Plus they make your skin so soft. A great deal for beautiful skin...</li>
            <li> Love these cloths. I have used them for about a year and have not noticed any change in the way they function. They are awesome. I hope when I do need additional cloths that they are still available. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without them, now.&lt;br /&gt;I have given these as gifts to my mother, daughters, and my pre-teen granddaughter.  I DO follow the care instructions which include not using softener or dryer sheets. Can&#x27;t say enough good about them. They do exactly what they say, and if, by chance, you try these and don&#x27;t think you will use them, someone you know would thank you forever for introducing them to this product1</li>
            <li> AWESOME. These take off every bit of makeup using ONLY warm water. Great value too, as you get six in this set. They stay soft, even after washing.</li>
            <li> These clothes feel so good and remove the debris well! I use it to wipe up after the face brush.</li>
            <li> Love these amazing face cloths ~ they remove all of your make up even your mascara!  When wet they are soft as butter, love the gentle exfoliating action they provide while washing your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it works!  Wet it with warm or cold water, and it takes off every speck of makeup - even waterproof eyeliner and mascara.  I am going to save a ton of money not buying cleanser and eye makeup remover.  My face is squeaky clean and dry after I use these cloths.</li>
            <li> This is simply a soft cloth.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything it says it does ~ for me, at least.</li>
            <li> These washcloths are great and so simple to use! Keeps my face routine nice and quick. All you need is water and they take your makeup right off. They are right when they say you don&#x27;t need to use any cleanser. I only use water and my face still feels clean after using just the cloths. My face has looked great since using.  These are also great to give as gifts. I gave a set to my mom and she commented on how great the packaging is- perfect for Christmas presents!</li>
            <li> tried using lots of scrubbers, but these can be felt doing the job, don&#x27;t even use soap with them just rinse them during use, they remove dead skin poste haste, rinse  and hang up til next time skin feels really clean and gets in the facial folds like around nose and so forth making it sooo clean</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these washcloths!!  I received them as a gift and I&#x27;m hooked!  My skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Mascara and liquid eyeliner come off in seconds without scrubbing. I love these cloths! A holiday must buy for friends!</li>
            <li> I am sold on using these clothes for cleaning my face. My skin is so much healthier not using products.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift so I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Amazing cloth that gently exfoliates my skin that I use every day for my children and myself!! Takes makeup off with just water! Deep cleans gently when bathing my children with sensitive skin. The best beauty AND baby product I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> I bought these towels to replace the exfoliating scrubber gloves that I usually buy. The only problem with the scrubber gloves is that I have to buy them so often and they can be a little too harsh depending on the brand I buy which varies purchase to purchase. I thought that these towels would be a great replacement because they &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; lightly and don&#x27;t have to be replaced as often as the gloves but I was wrong. They do not exfoliate AT ALL and are much smaller than I expected. I am still trying to decide if I should return them or just keep them for my daughter to use. I am going to stick with the gloves and hopefully one day I can find a cheaper replacement.</li>
            <li> They come beautifully packaged. After that it&#x27;s all downhill. These are nothing more than micro fiber pieces of fabric. They offer very little abrasion and only when used without soap. When you do use these with soap they are so slick as to be useless. Terribly over-priced.</li>
            <li> I love these. I use OCM to remove my makeup and these are perfect for that. Removes all the excess oil and makeup like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> I was originally using the H2O at home cloths but went to buy more and found out that it cost as much to ship them as it was to buy them so I started looking for something different.  While this is made of the same material, the % of each material is a little different.  It does, however, do a great job of taking off your makeup without using any cleanser. I know it sounds weird but ever since I started using these without the cleanser, my acne has started clearing up.</li>
            <li> I really like these wash cloths!  They do a great job!  I have used three different types of microfiber wash cloths and these are now at the top of my the list!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic  Will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I am literally OBSESSED with these cloths. I can&#x27;t believe it takes off all my heavy eye make up with just using water - I never have to deal with gross make up remover again.  I travel all the time and it&#x27;s SO easy to throw one of these in my bag. E V E R Y O N E should have these - it has become a complete staple for me.</li>
            <li> These towels are nice and thick. Removes all my makeup without soap/cleanser. Feels nice and clean. I have normal skin but can be a little sensitive to certain products. I have always used a facial cleanser, so using cloth with only warm water seemed strange. But after using the cloth.I really enjoy the feel of my skin without cleanser - not tight or dry. It comes with 6 cloths so I use a cloth one time and throw in wash and hang dry.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life?  It is revolutionary!  I don&#x27;t buy facial cleanser anymore.  I use the cloth to clean my face in the evening, both for when I wear makeup and when I don&#x27;t.  If I had makeup (including mascara) on I can see it on the cloth and move it around to get a clean area, then I use some soap and wash the cloth right away.  And I throw it into the machine (wash and dry) once a week.  I don&#x27;t use bleach and the cloth may still have some slight staining, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Fantastic for traveling, too!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  I mean, I cannot use face brushes, clarisonic or even so called sensitive exfoliators on my skin.  I have rosacea and am allergic to so many things.  This cloth has been my holy grail when it comes to my cleansing routine.  I can use my sensitive cleanser and this cloth and it gets my skin really clean without the harsh effects on my skin.  They rinse out well, and wash up just like new in the washer.  I could not live without them!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of these face cloths. Excellent quality, very absorption and soft on facial skin. I will recommend it</li>
            <li> They are wonderful clothes, soft, and after i was my face with products, they take even more make up, or anything. They are amazing i have bought 3 sets (so i could have for the morning/night) and could wash them at the same time!</li>
            <li> they are amazing! love them and love the fact that I can wash my face without any harsh cleansers!</li>
            <li> Love these cloths. They remove all of my makeup with just warm water. Maybe I&#x27;m imagining it, but after a few weeks of use, my skin looks better than it has in a long time. I no longer have to spend money on facial cleansers and microdermabrasion products. BTW, the negative reviews that say that these are plain microfiber cloths are incorrect. The fibers on the Nano Tech cloths are much thicker and softer feeling than a regular microfiber cloth.</li>
            <li> These cloths are truly amazing. I&#x27;ve always had problems with clogged pores on my face. After ONE use of these my skin was clean and polished looking and it just keeps getting better. I had no idea there was anything that could clean like this. I&#x27;ve tried everything, expensive creams, lotions, procedures at salons. Everything was expensive, lots of times my skin was in a state of redness and peeling. Now all I use is this cloth and Clinque toner and Cetaphil lotion. My skin looks clean and healthy. These cloths really do work. I will continue to use and buy these and pass on all the expensive promises out there.</li>
            <li> Just okay. Nothing special other than they are designated as my very now cloths.&lt;br /&gt;I see nothing special in whst they have done for my skin.</li>
            <li> These are great.  They are kinder to skin than those puffs, but they do exfoliate.  They also wash well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so it is hard for me to find products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, and I finally found the perfect one!!! These cloths were given to me by my daughter because she swears by them. These cloths are so soft, I use them on my face and body. They take make up off with ease just by wetting them. In the shower I use them all over my body, and they leave my skin feeling so smooth. I am so happy I found this product. It&#x27;s helped save me money too, no more buying products that I just have to throw away - you just throw these cloths in the wash! I could just go on all day about how amazing these cloths are! It is a definite must have for me!!!</li>
            <li> I never in a million years thought I would write a 5 star review on a set of washcloths. I received my first microfiber washcloth with a cleansing oil I bought from Sephora and I fell in love with it right away because it got my face so clean. Well long story short, I took it with me everywhere and I was staying in a hotel and the cleaning lady took it by mistake thinking it was one of the hotel towels and I was SO SAD! I came on Amazon to purchase a replacement and came across this bundle! Ohh my goodness it&#x27;s worth every penny! Not only do the cloths come packaged so nicely (it would make a great gift), but they are such high quality and way better than the one that I had gotten at Sephora. It&#x27;s unbelievable how clean they stay even after taking of your makeup. Everything just washes right out of it with plain water. I choose to use my face cleanser and then I put the wash cloth under warm water and sort of lay it on my face and wipe my face clean. My skin is so much clearer and brighter and I KNOW it&#x27;s because of these cloths. I use one to dry off after the shower and I use one for my face! I&#x27;m so happy I have backups to use when the others are in the wash! I highly recommend! These are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, you only need water to completely remove all but the most stubborn eye makeup.</li>
            <li> These clothes  do a great job of cleaning and exfoliating my skin. Another reason I like the cloths is when I&#x27;m traveling I take one or two and don&#x27;t have to carry a heavy container of pre moistened wipes.  I also appreciate any product that doesn&#x27;t add more waste to the environment.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well these work. Super soft and gentle on the face and takes basic makeup off with normal pressure. Squeeze the water out after use at night and it&#x27;s dry by morning. What&#x27;s nice (and a bit weird) is that there isn&#x27;t even a trace of the makeup on the cloth after using it. I don&#x27;t work as a clown or movie/broadway star, so if you use a lot of makeup your mileage may vary. Packaging is nice and would make a nice xmas or bday gift.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! Started out using them on my newborn only, but have been using them myself and love them for makeup removal. Even takes all my mascara (not waterproof) off with only water. And dry out so fast.</li>
            <li> Super!!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> i GAVE THESE 2 STARS BECAUSE AT LEAST THEY ARE SOFT, BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY I PAID FOR THEM,  A REGULAR WASHCLOTH WORKS JUST AS WELL.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I use these to remove my makeup and wash my face.  They don&#x27;t necessarily exfoliate like a muslin cloth but they work to clean your face.  They are super soft and clean up easily in warm/hot water.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money! They&#x27;re just microfiber towels, my boyfriend is a mechanic and he has boxes of them for the same price as the 6 of these. They work well, but I regret paying so much for it</li>
            <li> My wife ordered Nano Tech Cloths and loves them. Certainly will reorder for reason of...they feel great on the face...dry quickly for the next use...and do a wonderful job of removing creams and makeup. Also, terrific for gifts in that they come nicely packaged. The whole family is enjoying this pure luxury!</li>
            <li> I was using the Jane Iredale \\&quot;magic mitt\\&quot; and thought these might be a better deal (six, instead of one, with a washing bag). But they&#x27;re SO thick! They&#x27;re even too big. My face isn&#x27;t as big as a windshield, after all, I&#x27;d only need a quarter of each sheet, and they&#x27;re so thick that it&#x27;s impossible to get all the eye makeup off. I had to go in with my old \\&quot;magic mitt\\&quot; to get the remainder of my mascara off. And I don&#x27;t even wear that much makeup! Definitely disappointed. Maybe I\\&quot;ll use these as washcloths for the body, instead of the face. Or maybe I&#x27;ll just use them as dust cloths.</li>
            <li> I loved these at first. But after a few washing they took on a moldy smell. That is just the reason I wanted to try then instead of cotton. I wash them in delicate and use no fabric softener as instructed.</li>
            <li> Love how nicely these remove makeup on my skin.</li>
            <li> These are really nice. I love how soft the cloths are and would reccomend them.</li>
            <li> Thick, rich feeling face and body towels. Feels great against my skin. I would highly recommend these towels to anyone. Buy it, pamper yourself!</li>
            <li> Good for skin. Helps with clogged pores</li>
            <li> Work fine, but according to the label you can&#x27;t use fabric softener.  A pain if you&#x27;d like them to stay soft....so apparently all the &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; is out of them because I used fabric softener.  So i just use them as a regular face cloth now.</li>
            <li> These are the most awesome way to clean your face. Ever. I wet them and go over my face (make sure it is thoroughly wet and you do so lightly or else you&#x27;ll irritate your face--broke my own rule and I&#x27;m currently paying the price). I wash them in the bag in the machine and hang dry them. I don&#x27;t use any cleanser, just ACV toner, and combined with a healthy diet my skin looks great. They do have to be replaced once they&#x27;re fibers lose their catch but 6 lasted 3 months for me. Worth it for no cleansers nor chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love these!  I like having a separate wash cloth for my face.  Now I have around eight of them!  They feel great on my face and I always have extras if one gets dirty.</li>
            <li> I always use a washcloth and cleanser to clean my face.  Afterward, I wipe my face with a cotton ball soaked with toner.  Each and every time, regardless of how carefully or how long I wash, the cotton picks up more dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious about these cloths, especially because they are used without cleanser.  How could they possibly clean as well as cleanser and a cloth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try these and ripped open the box to use them as soon I they arrived.  They are beautifully packaged in a silky pouch - nice for a gift.  I thought I might store the cloths in it.  Yeah, hasn&#x27;t happened!  There is a net laundry bag included, which I like.  I assume it stops the cloths from rubbing against cotton while in the wash and picking up cotton lint.  Anyone who has microfiber cloths has probably done wash them with towels and ruined a cloth or two.  It&#x27;s hard removing all that lint from those grabby fibers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of the cloths are white, the other four are tan.  The white is much more gratifying to use because it&#x27;s easier to see all the dirt that&#x27;s removed.  They feel like soft, microfiber dust cloths.  They are a very generous size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wearing makeup - foundation, powder, and regular mascara.  My skin is oily and flaky.  I wet the cloth and started washing.  Wow - it removed all the makeup and oil.  My skin felt great.  I swiped the toner-soaked cotton ball over my face - NO DIRT!  I whipped out my 15X, pore-magnifying mirror and checked out my pores.  Not perfectly clean - because nothing ever unclogs my pores - but much better than with my usual cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I can&#x27;t resist testing things, I also tried them with cleanser.  Don&#x27;t do it!  I think it lubricates or clogs the fibers and they don&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cleanser to buy, no irritation, my skin feels smoother - how could I not love them?  Over the course of a week, my bumpy forehead cleared to just a few small pimples.  Then I tossed them inthe hamper and lazily put off doing laundry for a week and the bumpy forehead made a return.  I washed the cloths in cold water, normal cycle, and they looked like new.  After a week of use, the bumps again receded.  I&#x27;m sold!  I guess I need to have a larger supply on-hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are AWESOME!</li>
            <li> We love these cloths. They are supper soft. They wring out almost dry after use. We use them in the shower and at the lavatory daily. They are so soft we use one of them to clean our glasses.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a regular wash clothe since buying these, well worth the money</li>
            <li> From the looks online, these cloths appeared to be just like my cleaning cloths.  I was surprised to find out otherwise.  They were very neatly stitched on the outside, unlike my cleaning cloths, and much thicker.  The label allows me to hang it to dry, which is nice.  I am not a heavy makeup user, but it takes off every bit of makeup and appears to exfoliate at the same time.  They were not inexpensive, so I felt that it was a gamble to purchase these.  I am happy with them and I rarely am happy with anything!</li>
            <li> So far I have used the anti-aging Otha from 7/10/14 pm. My skin(face), is smoother and makeup comes off...it amazing. Mascara and water proof liners come off! I have to be gentle but every bit comes off. I need more time to see how my skin does in the long term. So far I like them and the money I will save on cleansers will be a blessing!!</li>
            <li> Good. I can&#x27;t find a nice soft facial wash cloth in regular store. This is just what I want.</li>
            <li> I just opened the package last night and I love the way these wash cloths feel when I&#x27;m using them on my face.  They clean off my makeup 100% and are so refreshing.  I love that I don&#x27;t need to use any harsh cleansers to get my makeup off of my face!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love them they have the body gleaming I used another cloth which did similar work but it was stiff these are very soft and have a luxurious feel so you enjoy using them</li>
            <li> I have only used the cloth for a few days but already see its advantages in terms of doing a good cleansing job (but keep in mind that I wear light make-up and never wear mascara). It also rinses easily and dries overnight which make it a good travel companion.</li>
            <li> These cloths completely changed how I wash my skin! The soft, thick fibers grab every last trace of makeup, leaving me with a clean, gently exfoliated face.  I love to exfoliate every day.  With the Nano Tech, I don&#x27;t have to worry about using multiple products, cleansers, harsh exfoliants and makeup removers.  I&#x27;m really really happy with how my skin looks and feels after using these.  My moisturizer even glides on so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towel itself is very durable, thick and actually quite beautiful! So happy to be done with cheap cotton washcloths!! These are far superior for your skin! I recommend these to anyone who cares at all about their skin.  Thanks NanoTech!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these and another major brand and cannot tell the difference. Whatever these cloths are made of work and result in a clearer complexion for me. Will order these again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These micro-fiber face cloths are thicker, softer and work just as well as any other micro fiber cloths I have tried, including ones that cost over twice the price of these.  It&#x27;s nice that they come with their own laundry bag.</li>
            <li> This product is so good it is like going to the  Skin Therapist  it helps to clean skin without leaving lint.  After cleaning off makeup it does not dry out my skin it absorbs left over water and does not leaving the little scratches.</li>
            <li> It is great. It is affordable especially, for the quantity and durability of the cloths. The stitched edges of the cloths are not abrasive but, just as soft as the rest of the cloth. Will buy more, if needed.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have received Nano as a gift.  Have you ever found a product that left you with the question, \\&quot;What did I do with out this?\\&quot;  For me this is one of those instances.  I don&#x27;t wear make up, but I do love to exfoliate.  The first time I used this product, I&#x27;ll be honest, I was skeptical; I thought, \\&quot;This feels like a normal cloth.\\&quot;  It wasn&#x27;t until after my face had dried that I could feel a true and obvious difference.  My face felt very clean and restored with energy.  My skin could feel the fresh air and was, to me, breathing healthily.  I have been using Nano for about a month now and I have seen a great improvement;  I have far fewer blemishes and an overall even skin tone.  I would recommend Nano to anyone who is interested in clean healthy skin.  It has worked wonders naturally.</li>
            <li> Amazing exfoliation! I have sensitive, delicate skin that reacts to pretty much everything, so I&#x27;m always looking for compatible skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;I use this cloths to wipe away the oils I use as cleansers for my face. I just wet the cloth in hot water, then gently wipe the oil off. I only use the tan color cloths for the face, it&#x27;s gentle enough to exfoliate the delicate eye area. White ones are perfect for decollete area. I rarely give a five star review but this product definitely deserves it.</li>
