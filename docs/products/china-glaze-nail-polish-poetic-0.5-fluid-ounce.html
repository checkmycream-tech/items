    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I keep returning to this brand, they make some of the best colors.</li>
            <li>This is a very beautiful color, I was very impressed with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still beautiful, but I don&#x27;t feel that I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>Great color.  </li>
            <li>And it matches skin tones nicely!</li>
            <li>I did two just to be safe!)</li>
            <li>The color is nice.</li>
            <li>It stays on well and is a nice color.  </li>
            <li>Covers great in one coat, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Truth be told, I think it looks more like Magical 80203</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Love the color and how it wears</li>
            <li>China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>After 3 coats it looks ok.</li>
            <li>Better products out there.</li>
            <li>It could be that my monitor is the problem, but I was really expecting more of a pinky kind of color, and this has more of a bronze-type hue to me.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this brand and today I received 8 more that I ordered, extremely excited to try all the new colors!!</li>
            <li>The polish goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>So far so lovely!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really find the color I needed and they have so many but not on line, I guess.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice light pearl pink with copper undertones.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a light mauve-ish pink with coral.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>, this is a lovely summer shade, and I will definitely be adding it to my collection.</li>
            <li>and they have strengthened and grown so much already!</li>
            <li>I was expecting this nail polish to be the same colour as in the picture, but honestly, it&#x27;s darker and a little more rose/purple tinted than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>the color i got was a pink/copper but the picture looked much pinker..</li>
            <li>for those of you who really like what&#x27;s in the picture, be warned.</li>
            <li>Smooth formulation and the brush is neither too large nor too small,  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that I only needed one coating for the exact color on the bottle(but</li>
            <li>I personally thought the photo really matches the color I received.</li>
            <li>I love China Glaze nail polish, it seems to stay on longer and chip less than other brands.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d had my heart set on the exact shade I thought I was buying, I&#x27;d be disappointed, but as it turns out this is the exact color I was actually looking for! :)</li>
            <li>Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smooth formulation and the brush is neither too large nor too small,  It&#x27;s no wonder I keep returning to this brand, they make some of the best colors.</li>
            <li> I ordered this color thinking it may be the coppery-toned polish I&#x27;ve been searching for that my manicurist used. Unfortunately, this was not it. This is more of a light mauve-ish pink with coral.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, (ignore the pun!), this is a lovely summer shade, and I will definitely be adding it to my collection.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this nail polish to be the same colour as in the picture, but honestly, it&#x27;s darker and a little more rose/purple tinted than I was expecting. It&#x27;s still beautiful, but I don&#x27;t feel that I got what I paid for. Truth be told, I think it looks more like Magical 80203 does in it&#x27;s photo...</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish. Covers great in one coat, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the color and how it wears</li>
            <li> I have not ever tried this brand or have seen it in stores, but I must say my nails were a mess and then I started to use this brand and they have strengthened and grown so much already!

            <li> China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish.  Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.</li>
            <li> i would have to say the picture was a little deceiving. the color i got was a pink/copper but the picture looked much pinker.. o well. i guess im stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Not the color I hoped it was, :(  I couldn&#x27;t really find the color I needed and they have so many but not on line, I guess.</li>
            <li> I love China Glaze nail polish, it seems to stay on longer and chip less than other brands. However, when I received this nail polish, the color looks a lot different to me in person than on my monitor. It could be that my monitor is the problem, but I was really expecting more of a pinky kind of color, and this has more of a bronze-type hue to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a very difficult time finding the exact shade of polish I want, and this looked like it was the closest I could get. When it arrived, it didn&#x27;t look the same as it did in the picture. It&#x27;s a bit lighter than I expected. If I&#x27;d had my heart set on the exact shade I thought I was buying, I&#x27;d be disappointed, but as it turns out this is the exact color I was actually looking for! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for those of you who really like what&#x27;s in the picture, be warned. It&#x27;s a little lighter than it seems!</li>
            <li> A lot darker than pictured when I bought it.</li>
            <li> The color is nice. I thought the nail polish was a bit thin. After 3 coats it looks ok. Better products out there. A bit expensive also.</li>
            <li> The polish is thicker than I&#x27;m used to.  The color is just...blah.  It doesn&#x27;t make an impression.  Probably gonna just toss it.</li>
            <li> It stays on well and is a nice color.  I should buy some additional colors.  It dries quickly as well.</li>
            <li> This is a very beautiful color, I was very impressed with it. I personally thought the photo really matches the color I received. And it matches skin tones nicely! I was surprised that I only needed one coating for the exact color on the bottle(but I did two just to be safe!) So far so lovely!</li>
            <li> Great color.  The photo represents the color well.  It&#x27;s a nice light pearl pink with copper undertones.  The polish goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
