            <li>I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I thought after reading the reviews I would have liked it, but the smell is not pleasing to me.  </li>
            <li>The kind that leaves ash and soot on stuff...  </li>
            <li>My favorite - wonderful smell, light and fresh!</li>
            <li>I love this incense,  the smell is great,  so clean almost like a wood fire burning.  </li>
            <li>Great fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Very pretty!!</li>
            <li>Many sales from this item</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Of all the HEM products, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I normally love HEM incense.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of Sage</li>
            <li>It is too potent for me too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps children to feel more secure sleeping on their own rooms.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Love it~</li>
            <li>def my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>They love it as well.</li>
            <li>And REALLY awesome quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>will order more when I run out</li>
            <li>I thought I could use the incense type since it would be more convenient.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and burns for 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Hem makes so many better incense products, and this doesn&#x27;t smell like sage.</li>
            <li>May not be for everyone, but I love the smell of sage.</li>
            <li>I do like strong fragrances, but strong and nice.</li>
            <li>The most important of all totally Authentic will buy again.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a HUGE deal for so many boxes.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a good purchase for a store that wants to sell incense.</li>
            <li>The sweet scent of this sage is unbeatable!</li>
            <li>Too strong.</li>
            <li>strong but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>the smell was so strong that even after getting it out of my house, the odor continued to linger and made all of us nauseous.</li>
            <li>It is a unique odor develope by HEM which is probably why they named it &amp;#34;WHITE&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have tried many incense brands and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>the white sage smell is noticeable throughout the house and pleasantly lingers.</li>
            <li>now with the gas prices soaring, it&#x27;s well worth having it deivered to my home quickly!  </li>
            <li>I loved the smell of the white sage.</li>
            <li>There is just too much perfume,  which can be overwhelming at times.</li>
            <li>They are extremely strong, almost as much as nag champa incense.</li>
            <li>not only do these smell amazing, they burn well</li>
            <li>definitely worth waiting for,  This was waiting on another item to ship and them whe</li>
            <li>It is fresh and I have plenty to get me through for a while.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE white Sage and this has no scent of sage in it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>And the white sage is one of my favorite fragrances as well.  </li>
            <li>Love White Sage by HEM!</li>
            <li>I have purchased other incense that was supposed to be white sage, but these are the first ones that did actually have that wonderful sage aroma and not just a perfumey scent to them.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer should cut back on the perfume and give us more genuine white sage scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The smell of these are very light, and not overwhelming, but not so light you can&#x27;t smell them.</li>
            <li>and I will certainly reorder some time.</li>
            <li>I ordered several scents and they all smell fine.</li>
            <li>they smell great some sticks came broken</li>
            <li>when is someone going to come out with an incense that really smells like sweetgrass.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the day to burn a whole one.</li>
            <li>I still highly recommened HEM incense!  </li>
            <li>All was well with the order Thanks allot.</li>
            <li>A bit too much for me</li>
            <li>I lit up a few and was instantly glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.  </li>
            <li>This is a very distinctive incense that smells almost exactly like an old European club house, with old men wearing aftershave and smoking cigars in wood-panelled rooms.  </li>
            <li>The heavy smokiness means it&#x27;s not one that I would burn often, but it could be very interesting if for some unusual reason you wish to re-create the atmoshpere of such a place - perhaps a theatrical scene, or expatriate nostalgia.</li>
            <li>I have only recently become acquainted  with white sage.</li>
            <li>Its a little on the strong side for me, gives me a head ache....</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s actual wood-panelling and cigar smoke in this, with a hint of older man aftershave!  </li>
            <li>I enjoy to use this everyday whether I am meditating or not.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if all Sage incense has this strong, overpowering, medicinal aroma, but this one does.</li>
            <li>Like, I bought some other stuff off of here and the smoke is very clean, the smoke from these sticks is black.  </li>
            <li>well, probably my mistake as I have never smelled white sage other than as a smudging ..and that smell is what i expected, but it is sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>But after burning the actual product,  I find the HEM white sage incense  to be far from the actual product in term of scent.</li>

            <li> I can definitely see buying these or other incense from this supplier again!</li>

            <li> The box lasted me half a year</li>
            <li> To me it is simply typical of heavily perfumed Indian (East India) incense.</li>

            <li> because it said it was the small of \\&quot;Sage\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;However, it smelled like an Indian incense store with no perceivable smell of sage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased w/ them all except</li>
            <li> I was expecting the scent of sage, but it has a very heavy perfumed fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is difficult for the incense to get crushed because of the cardboard tube.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t unpleasant, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> both are broken.</li>
            <li> Smelled weird.</li>
            <li> one disappointed customer</li>
            <li> wife completely hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I use it to cleanse all evil.</li>

            <li> This is a very distinctive incense that smells almost exactly like an old European club house, with old men wearing aftershave and smoking cigars in wood-panelled rooms.  It&#x27;s quite uncanny - there&#x27;s actual wood-panelling and cigar smoke in this, with a hint of older man aftershave!

            <li> This is quite potent ! I can only burn it for a little while,&lt;br /&gt;otherwise it&#x27;d bother hubby, can&#x27;t wait til he&#x27;s gone for&lt;br /&gt;the day to burn a whole one.</li>
            <li> I normally love HEM incense.  The Pine and Lavendar are terriffic!  I love the smell of Sage so I bought the HEM White Sage.  It does not smell like Sage.  It is a unique odor develope by HEM which is probably why they named it &amp;#34;WHITE&amp;#34; Sage.  It is too potent for me too.  Live and learn.  I still highly recommened HEM incense!  It is quality incense at a great price!</li>
            <li> This white sage is very helpful when it comes to get rid of negative entities in a house.&lt;br /&gt;It helps children to feel more secure sleeping on their own rooms.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit overwhelming.  I thought after reading the reviews I would have liked it, but the smell is not pleasing to me.  I do like strong fragrances, but strong and nice.</li>
            <li> the best sage incense I&#x27;ve smelled!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Very pretty!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand/product of white sage for years and I use it to cleanse all evil. The price on Amazon is about what I the same as I have been paying......now with the gas prices soaring, it&#x27;s well worth having it deivered to my home quickly!  I will be ordering this product/brand when I run low again. Love it~</li>
            <li> not only do these smell amazing, they burn well and it&#x27;s a HUGE deal for so many boxes. I can definitely see buying these or other incense from this supplier again!</li>
            <li> these smell amazing!! def my favorite scent. also a good cover up for 420 activities.</li>
            <li> well, probably my mistake as I have never smelled white sage other than as a smudging ..and that smell is what i expected, but it is sweet smelling. it isn&#x27;t unpleasant, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it was a good deal. I ordered several scents and they all smell fine. It&#x27;s a lot of incense sticks for the money but they burn very dark.  Like, I bought some other stuff off of here and the smoke is very clean, the smoke from these sticks is black.  The kind that leaves ash and soot on stuff...  It&#x27;s almost like burning plastic type smoke?  I think this would be a good purchase for a store that wants to sell incense. It&#x27;s packaged for resale.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other incense that was supposed to be white sage, but these are the first ones that did actually have that wonderful sage aroma and not just a perfumey scent to them. I would definitely buy these again!</li>
            <li> All was well with the order Thanks allot.</li>
            <li> The smell of these are very light, and not overwhelming, but not so light you can&#x27;t smell them. They&#x27;re at that PERFECT happy medium when it comes to potency. It DEFINITELY smells like white sage, but it almost has a minty sort of scent that goes along with it and I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what that would be, but it adds to it, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually so good that when I was burning it at my house, 2 of my friends wanted to know where I got it, so I told them and gave them both a box of it. They love it as well. Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product! And REALLY awesome quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the white sage. The box lasted me half a year and I will certainly reorder some time.</li>
            <li> Items were just what I ordered and shipment arrived within the time stated. All was great with all of the products ordered.&lt;br /&gt;JBJ Sac White Sage Incense, Attract Money Incense Plus Canoe Incense Burner and White Sage Set, and Dragons Blood Incense.</li>
            <li> I have tried many incense brands and this is by far my favorite. And the white sage is one of my favorite fragrances as well.  The scent lasts a while (long-lasting) and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Smelled weird. Too strong. Gave them away.</li>
            <li> This is not one of my favorites. Not sure if all Sage incense has this strong, overpowering, medicinal aroma, but this one does. I shall use this only for cleansing and not for an every day burn.</li>
            <li> My favorite - wonderful smell, light and fresh!</li>
            <li> Love White Sage by HEM!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and I only buy Hex sticks. Best brand money can buy. The scent stays around even after the incense is burned out.</li>
            <li> this has great smell and I get lots of compliments on it. This box of six is perfect for gifts.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and unbroken. Great smell; strong but not overpowering.  the white sage smell is noticeable throughout the house and pleasantly lingers. will order more when I run out</li>
            <li> I love this incense,  the smell is great,  so clean almost like a wood fire burning.  What a great value as well.</li>
            <li> A bit too much for me, I prefer something a bit different in white sage</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re trying to fragrance a cathedral or sports stadium, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.  They are extremely strong, almost as much as nag champa incense.</li>
            <li> Great idea if you like the smell of sage or want to cleanse your house without the hassle of dealing with sage leaves. I bought it as a gift for my mom and she has been bugging me ever since to get her more!</li>
            <li> Good incense and service was excellent. I gave this incense for Christmas gifts too. I would buy this incense again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it said it was the small of \\&quot;Sage\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;However, it smelled like an Indian incense store with no perceivable smell of sage.&lt;br /&gt;My wife completely hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would never buy this product if I was expecting sage smell.</li>
            <li> I would not even give this one star if that were an option. It is perfumed, unnatural and the smell was so strong that even after getting it out of my house, the odor continued to linger and made all of us nauseous.</li>
            <li> I have only recently become acquainted  with white sage. I thought I could use the incense type since it would be more convenient. But after burning the actual product,  I find the HEM white sage incense  to be far from the actual product in term of scent. There is just too much perfume,  which can be overwhelming at times. The manufacturer should cut back on the perfume and give us more genuine white sage scent.&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about the packaging which is I find to be impressive. It is difficult for the incense to get crushed because of the cardboard tube.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and burns for 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Hem makes so many better incense products, and this doesn&#x27;t smell like sage. My advice: if you want sage, get some sage.</li>
            <li> Smells good and burns well; I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the scent of sage, but it has a very heavy perfumed fragrance. I cannot definitively identify the perfume scent.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it isn&#x27;t too bad...considering the price. However, If you are wanting to do a house spiritual cleansing...I would recommend buying sage smudging bundles instead.</li>
            <li> I love the scent! It is strong but smells great! May not be for everyone, but I love the smell of sage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased w/ them all except I only received 2 white sage incense instead of 3 &amp; both coffin burns came apart so I tried to glue them w/ a good wood glue which did not work. both are broken. I&#x27;d like to continue to purchase white sage but concerned about doing so. my email peacedovehippiemama@gmail.com. one disappointed customer</li>
            <li> Great incense, smells wonderful,very quick shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy to use this everyday whether I am meditating or not.  It is relaxing and calming.  There is a great aura in the home from using this.</li>
