            <li>If you want to smell good, and have people compliment you about how your hair smells, I would advise AGAINST purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>I love the herstyler shampoo and conditioner!  </li>

            <li>, I use a really good shampoo and conditioner and feel like this has done nothing special.</li>
            <li>My fine hair is now sleek, shiny and moves!</li>
            <li>Herstyler makes my hair so soft and smooth, and it has a great smell!</li>
            <li>I love them both.  </li>
            <li>It is my FAVORITE shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this line</li>
            <li>I like the conditioner most, but felt the shampoo too drying for my hair</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>:) wish I had more conditioner.</li>
            <li>They make my hair smooth and shiny with no frizzing, and it smells divine!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love is all I have to say.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>But because I&#x27;m a man, and since it&#x27;s mostly women that use this product, I think I&#x27;m qualified to have an opinion about this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair felt after using it.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>Love these hair products</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is phenomenal compared to what I was paying at the mall</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This Herstyler shampoo and conditioner is definately my favorite.</li>
            <li>With 5 stars, I love it.</li>
            <li>I was worried that this brand wasn&#x27;t going to be any good, but was worth trying for the price.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this I was amazed at how great my hair felt and how easy it was to straighten it after.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep the ends from becoming frizzy and breaking.</li>
            <li>my hair has never been more smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like conditioner that makes my hair extremely soft because it won&#x27;t take to any heat styling, but this conditioner is great.  </li>
            <li>I received this item very quickly.</li>
            <li>more than likely will continue to order it, as it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, love the smell and the feel, I have bright red hair and this stuff dosent strip my hair or make it dry.</li>
            <li>Contents not as advertised, container is filled with air and when opened you can tell contents</li>
            <li>so I need something to smooth it out when I straighten it.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean and styles easy without drying my hair out anymore.</li>
            <li>really - I smell amazing.</li>
            <li>I will be buying from you again because the price is just right :)</li>
            <li>I was beyond excited when I found it for so cheap...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never disappointed and</li>
            <li>I love the scent so much though that I use it every once in awhile and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>When used in conjunction with the mask, my hair is shiny, soft, full of body and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair come out nice, soft, shiny, and just very healthy looking in general.</li>
            <li>So I bought this again, and it wasn&#x27;t as good as the last time I used.</li>
            <li>We have very different hair and have never been able to use the same products, so I was very glad to learn that we wouldn&#x27;t be adding another set of products to the line up in the shower!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I will admit, I am a man, but I frequently purchase female hygiene products because they smell better or work better to make my hair look healthy.  </li>
            <li>Its my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for something else but for now I do love the New Loreal line.</li>
            <li>I bought this item a few years ago and it worked great.</li>
            <li>This is most likely FAKE, not Argan Oil at all, more like coconut oil at best.</li>
            <li>There is nothing herbal, or fruity, or fresh smelling about this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Tried a sample at our local mall and thought the product was good....to be honest</li>
            <li>I recently received a nice Herstyler flat iron for reviewing purposes on my blog, and decided to buy this shampoo / conditioner set to help my hair to be more smooth and silky when using the flat iron, and it sure has!</li>
            <li>RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>Now don&#x27;t go raising the prices sky high please!!</li>
            <li>I received my first shampoo and conditioner set when I purchased a Herstyler hair straighter at the mall, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li>I had first tried this shampoo and conditioner when it was given to me as a gift... and when I went to purchase it, I realized how much it retailed for!</li>
            <li>Make your hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and makes my hair very silky!</li>
            <li>The only thing redeeming about this is it came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>You have to look close when purchasing certain types of items.</li>
            <li>Leaves my dry, damaged hair soft, shiny and manageable right out of the shower, and the scent is wonderful and very long lasting.</li>
            <li>But fortunately I found the items much cheaper online, so I only buy the shampoo &amp; conditioner online now.</li>
            <li>My hair responded VERY well to this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very kinky hair.</li>
            <li>I came across the HerStyler brand at my local mall &amp; bought a straightener, &amp; the woman threw in shampoo &amp; conditioner for free.</li>
            <li>When I am stressed it really shows in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I got it very inexpensively at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s straight up synthetic and offensive.  </li>
            <li>I can get this in our mall, but it is much cheaper on here.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was having hair issues and this product has really helped her alot.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Herstyler flat iron and hair dryer and the sales guy gave me these free to try.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these product to everyone, regardless of hair type or styling habits.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>IT FEELS SMOOTH AND LEAVES NO FRIZZ WHEN U STRAIGHTEN HAIR WITH FLAT IRON STAYS SOFT AND MANAGEBLE</li>
            <li>I loved how the shampoo lathers and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It does make your hair soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally pretty straight anyway, so I can&#x27;t say everyone would have the same experience.</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair cleansed and very soft.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this line and his hair feels like a baby chicks fur, very soft..</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t strip color and it leaves your hair so soft!</li>
            <li>My middle daughter just moved back in and tried them for the first time, and she loves them, too!</li>
            <li>I also use a leave in conditioner (Nexus humectress) and that helps to keep my wild frizzy hair under control.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>They make my feel so soft after washing it, &amp; I don&#x27;t even feel like I need to straighten my hair when I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft without stripping the color.  </li>
            <li>Completely eliminates the frizzyness.</li>
            <li>Smell is a subjective character trait, and I don&#x27;t consider myself to be overly sensitive to perfumes and scents, but</li>
            <li>wow, this shampoo/conditioner STINKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product keeps it soft and silky through out the day no matter the weather conditions.</li>
            <li>I have heard a lot of good things about this shampoo and conditioner, well I feel they are all wrong.</li>
            <li>I now bought the new LOreal line and use 2 different styles shampoo for rebuilding and conditioner for moisture.</li>
            <li>The content felt very dilute and made my hair dry and tangle.</li>
            <li>Even Flat Iron Experts company whom I received the flat iron from agreed that these helped make my hair so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to buy them as needed as long as the price doesn&#x27;t increase too much.</li>
            <li>Cleans like a clarifying shampoo and the conditioner left my hair feeling soft and  moisturized.</li>
            <li>Really helps with dry winter hair coming into spring and summer!!</li>
            <li>I once only used only  the shampoo and it made my hair soft and shiny without conditioner too.</li>
            <li>I needed to find a new shampoo and conditioner that would moisturize my very dry hair.  </li>
            <li>so it might weigh your hair down too much.</li>
            <li>Really like it better than the very expensive stuff I was buying from the salon.</li>

            <li> Its my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I am still looking for something else but for now I do love the New Loreal line.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few years ago and it worked great.</li>
            <li> This is most likely FAKE, not Argan Oil at all, more like coconut oil at best.</li>
            <li> There is nothing herbal, or fruity, or fresh smelling about this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Tried a sample at our local mall and thought the product was good....to be honest</li>
            <li> I recently received a nice Herstyler flat iron for reviewing purposes on my blog, and decided to buy this shampoo / conditioner set to help my hair to be more smooth and silky when using the flat iron, and it sure has!</li>
            <li> RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t go raising the prices sky high please!!</li>
            <li> I received my first shampoo and conditioner set when I purchased a Herstyler hair straighter at the mall, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li> I had first tried this shampoo and conditioner when it was given to me as a gift... and when I went to purchase it, I realized how much it retailed for!</li>
            <li> Make your hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and makes my hair very silky!</li>
            <li> The only thing redeeming about this is it came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> You have to look close when purchasing certain types of items.</li>
            <li> Leaves my dry, damaged hair soft, shiny and manageable right out of the shower, and the scent is wonderful and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> But fortunately I found the items much cheaper online, so I only buy the shampoo &amp; conditioner online now.</li>
            <li> My hair responded VERY well to this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I came across the HerStyler brand at my local mall &amp; bought a straightener, &amp; the woman threw in shampoo &amp; conditioner for free.</li>
            <li> When I am stressed it really shows in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I got it very inexpensively at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s straight up synthetic and offensive.  </li>
            <li> I can get this in our mall, but it is much cheaper on here.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was having hair issues and this product has really helped her alot.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Herstyler flat iron and hair dryer and the sales guy gave me these free to try.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these product to everyone, regardless of hair type or styling habits.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> IT FEELS SMOOTH AND LEAVES NO FRIZZ WHEN U STRAIGHTEN HAIR WITH FLAT IRON STAYS SOFT AND MANAGEBLE</li>
            <li> I loved how the shampoo lathers and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally pretty straight anyway, so I can&#x27;t say everyone would have the same experience.</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair cleansed and very soft.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this line and his hair feels like a baby chicks fur, very soft..</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t strip color and it leaves your hair so soft!</li>
            <li> My middle daughter just moved back in and tried them for the first time, and she loves them, too!</li>
            <li> I also use a leave in conditioner (Nexus humectress) and that helps to keep my wild frizzy hair under control.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> They make my feel so soft after washing it, &amp; I don&#x27;t even feel like I need to straighten my hair when I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft without stripping the color.  </li>
            <li> Completely eliminates the frizzyness.</li>
            <li> Smell is a subjective character trait, and I don&#x27;t consider myself to be overly sensitive to perfumes and scents, but</li>
            <li> wow, this shampoo/conditioner STINKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product keeps it soft and silky through out the day no matter the weather conditions.</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot of good things about this shampoo and conditioner, well I feel they are all wrong.</li>
            <li> I now bought the new LOreal line and use 2 different styles shampoo for rebuilding and conditioner for moisture.</li>
            <li> The content felt very dilute and made my hair dry and tangle.</li>
            <li> Even Flat Iron Experts company whom I received the flat iron from agreed that these helped make my hair so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to buy them as needed as long as the price doesn&#x27;t increase too much.</li>
            <li> Cleans like a clarifying shampoo and the conditioner left my hair feeling soft and  moisturized.</li>
            <li> Really helps with dry winter hair coming into spring and summer!!</li>
            <li> I once only used only  the shampoo and it made my hair soft and shiny without conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I needed to find a new shampoo and conditioner that would moisturize my very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> so it might weigh your hair down too much.</li>
            <li> Really like it better than the very expensive stuff I was buying from the salon.</li>
            <li> I am confused because a though it has the same texture as the original,  and this one has no scent.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles arrived broken (with a hole in the bottle) more than half of the product was all waisted in the package.</li>
            <li> I also have the flat iron, which works well.</li>
            <li> But no, weird smell, feel heavy on hair, feel like it does not clean my hair at all.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m going back to my Brilliant Brunette or Suave shampoos, because at least they don&#x27;t leave my head smelling like crap all day</li>
            <li> I never had a problem like this with various other shampoos.</li>
            <li> But after a week of using it my hair started looking dry and felt like straw.</li>
            <li> Even my husband said did you color your hair cause it looks dry.</li>
            <li> I usually use 100% natural products without carcinogens, and this line is not at all.  </li>
            <li> Smells bad, contains many chemicals, made in china.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that the mall can sell these for SO much more.  </li>
            <li> One of them got to my house almost empty</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy blonde hair and after I use it, it helps tame the wild beast at my stylist says!</li>
            <li> Very little product is required to accomplish the desired effect, so these last quite a while.</li>
            <li> so I can switch to other products.</li>
            <li> She had tried lots of other products but none of them have helped her hair as this one has.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was broken open at the seam (opposite the cap) and it had leaked out into the plastic.  </li>
            <li> I even use a little of the conditioner throughout the week on my ends.  </li>
            <li> This Shampoo and Consitioner set totally dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> mine is thick, tends to curl, can be a little wild...and</li>
            <li> not able to brush my curly hair through after conditioner.</li>
            <li> Cleans my thick tresses so well.</li>
            <li> If you see it at a mall, they want to charge you serious dollars for it.  </li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> These came from China, the caps were loose and didn&#x27;t snap shut properly and when the product got in my eyes it stung so bad!!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is a litle weak in comparison to the hair mask</li>
            <li> and this is the cheapest product they could find to replace with; bad for your hair, will leave it dry and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> total crap on humid or rainy days.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have thin hair, you might not like it as it is an oil</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the shampoo and cond</li>
            <li> Very, very poor shipping and no way to return material.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that bad.  </li>
            <li> the smell is what I hate.  </li>
            <li> INSANE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently received a nice Herstyler flat iron for reviewing purposes on my blog, and decided to buy this shampoo / conditioner set to help my hair to be more smooth and silky when using the flat iron, and it sure has! Even Flat Iron Experts company whom I received the flat iron from agreed that these helped make my hair so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Herstyler makes my hair so soft and smooth, and it has a great smell! Pairs great with the serum. I also have the flat iron, which works well.</li>
            <li> You have to look close when purchasing certain types of items. These came from China, the caps were loose and didn&#x27;t snap shut properly and when the product got in my eyes it stung so bad!! I just threw them away.</li>
            <li> I love the herstyler shampoo and conditioner!  They work great and I love the way they smell!  Ordering was easy, it arrived in a timely manner!  I will definately order again!</li>
            <li> I am happier with the shampoo than I am with the conditioner..  The conditioner is a litle weak in comparison to the hair mask</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a brown box which was open on one end (not sealed) and the tubes were inside wedged into a corner in plastic bags.  The shampoo was broken open at the seam (opposite the cap) and it had leaked out into the plastic.  I reviewed all the shipping paperwork to see who I could call and complain to and there was no information.  I went online to my order and all it showed was shipping details, not feedback section.  Very, very poor shipping and no way to return material.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Always looking for a great shampoo and conditioner.  A friend recommended this to me.  I love them both.  I even use a little of the conditioner throughout the week on my ends.  It helps to keep the ends from becoming frizzy and breaking.</li>
            <li> The product busted open when it arrived</li>
            <li> It is so nourishing for the hair.  Really like it better than the very expensive stuff I was buying from the salon.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different....mine is thick, tends to curl, can be a little wild...and total crap on humid or rainy days.  My hair responded VERY well to this product.  It is my FAVORITE shampoo/conditioner.  I never write reviews, but I&#x27;m just seriously impressed.  I&#x27;m supposed to get my hair cut/colored tomorrow but it&#x27;s &amp;#34;behaving&amp;#34; so well and looking so good, I&#x27;m thinking about kicking the appointment.  I also use a leave in conditioner (Nexus humectress) and that helps to keep my wild frizzy hair under control.  But the shampoo and conditioner def make a difference.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of stuff....this is the best.  Now don&#x27;t go raising the prices sky high please!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Leaves my hair cleansed and very soft. Retail price in mall about $100 for both.</li>
            <li> I am confused because a though it has the same texture as the original,  and this one has no scent.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this line so I use when I&#x27;m going on a date something. I like the conditioner most, but felt the shampoo too drying for my hair so I threw it out.  I usually use 100% natural products without carcinogens, and this line is not at all.  I love the scent so much though that I use it every once in awhile and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Gotta get it to have it!</li>
            <li> Not rhe same stuff. It even smells differnt .. and the smell is the only reason i ordered it</li>
            <li> I love this product. it makes my hair soft and shiny. :) wish I had more conditioner. I have very kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot of good things about this shampoo and conditioner, well I feel they are all wrong. It is probably good if you are coming from something you get at the drug store but I don&#x27;t, I use a really good shampoo and conditioner and feel like this has done nothing special. This is made in china (ugh!) and it has sulfates which my current stuff does not. I would not order this again. The only thing redeeming about this is it came in a very timely manner. Save your money and buy some pravana</li>
            <li> Everything was great!  I love the product!!</li>
            <li> Buyer beware! This is most likely FAKE, not Argan Oil at all, more like coconut oil at best. Contents not as advertised, container is filled with air and when opened you can tell contents are at 60% at best. Been using this product for a while now and this is the cheapest product they could find to replace with; bad for your hair, will leave it dry and lifeless. Not good at all.</li>
            <li> I received my first shampoo and conditioner set when I purchased a Herstyler hair straighter at the mall, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. Very little product is required to accomplish the desired effect, so these last quite a while. They make my hair smooth and shiny with no frizzing, and it smells divine! Every time I give someone a hug I get a compliment on how great my hair smells! My middle daughter just moved back in and tried them for the first time, and she loves them, too! We have very different hair and have never been able to use the same products, so I was very glad to learn that we wouldn&#x27;t be adding another set of products to the line up in the shower! I would highly recommend these product to everyone, regardless of hair type or styling habits.</li>
            <li> I use the vitamin E serum in this brand - a must have !! I was skeptical about the shampoo and cond but I love this shampoo and conditioner! I loved how the shampoo lathers and a little goes a long way. Cleans like a clarifying shampoo and the conditioner left my hair feeling soft and  moisturized.</li>
            <li> I came across the HerStyler brand at my local mall &amp; bought a straightener, &amp; the woman threw in shampoo &amp; conditioner for free. I absolutely loved all of it! But fortunately I found the items much cheaper online, so I only buy the shampoo &amp; conditioner online now. They make my feel so soft after washing it, &amp; I don&#x27;t even feel like I need to straighten my hair when I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner. My hair is naturally pretty straight anyway, so I can&#x27;t say everyone would have the same experience. But I would definitely recommend this brand of products to any woman!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, love the smell and the feel, I have bright red hair and this stuff dosent strip my hair or make it dry. Its my new favorite.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo and Consitioner set totally dried out my hair.  It sisn&#x27;t provide any nourisment for my hair at all.  I like the serum and will continue to use that, but never the shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the serum but hair feels silky after use</li>
            <li> I would rather it without the oil as well but I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather it without the oil as well but I am using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few years ago and it worked great. So I bought this again, and it wasn&#x27;t as good as the last time I used. The content felt very dilute and made my hair dry and tangle. I never had a problem like this with various other shampoos. I&#x27;m never buying this again.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I was amazed at how great my hair felt and how easy it was to straighten it after. But after a week of using it my hair started looking dry and felt like straw. Even my husband said did you color your hair cause it looks dry. RIGHT AWAY I new it was this shampoo and conditioner cause that&#x27;s the only thing I had changed. I now bought the new LOreal line and use 2 different styles shampoo for rebuilding and conditioner for moisture. My hair feels and looks great and STAYS that way.. I am still looking for something else but for now I do love the New Loreal line. My husband loves this line and his hair feels like a baby chicks fur, very soft.. SO I like it for him but I will never use it again for me..</li>
            <li> I love it my hair has never been more smooth and shiny i deffinetly recommend it you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> I like the serum so I try this combo. But no, weird smell, feel heavy on hair, feel like it does not clean my hair at all. Hope to finish them soon so I can switch to other products.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  When I am stressed it really shows in my hair.  This set leaves my hair rejuvenated, extremely soft, and smells wonderful.  When I can get it as an add on item I do.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love is all I have to say. Adds moisture to the hair.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this moisturizer. Great value. Will buy from the seller again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve never tried anything like it, my hair feels, looks, and smells great!  I had my daughter try it and she just loved it, We are both so happy that we finally found a product thats makes our hair look healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I had first tried this shampoo and conditioner when it was given to me as a gift... and when I went to purchase it, I realized how much it retailed for! INSANE! I was beyond excited when I found it for so cheap... this smells amazing and makes my hair feel amazing~</li>
            <li> I needed to find a new shampoo and conditioner that would moisturize my very dry hair.  This does the trick and I am super happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair so I need something to smooth it out when I straighten it.  This stuff is awesome!  If you see it at a mall, they want to charge you serious dollars for it.  I got it very inexpensively at Amazon.  I highly recommend it.  However, if you have thin hair, you might not like it as it is an oil so it might weigh your hair down too much.</li>
            <li> I loved the shampoo and conditioner it&#x27;s my all time favorite. I will be buying from you again because the price is just right :)</li>
            <li> Very good product for price.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo.  I once only used only  the shampoo and it made my hair soft and shiny without conditioner too. Also like the nice smell it has.  The Conditioner is really nice as well.</li>
            <li> Thought it was great. Left my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft without stripping the color.  Smells clean and styles easy without drying my hair out anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought the Herstyler flat iron and hair dryer and the sales guy gave me these free to try.  I love the product it&#x27;s moisturizing and smells wonderful.  Cleans my thick tresses so well.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Make your hair soft and smooth.  Completely eliminates the frizzyness. I received this item very quickly. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Smell is a subjective character trait, and I don&#x27;t consider myself to be overly sensitive to perfumes and scents, but wow, this shampoo/conditioner STINKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I will admit, I am a man, but I frequently purchase female hygiene products because they smell better or work better to make my hair look healthy.  But because I&#x27;m a man, and since it&#x27;s mostly women that use this product, I think I&#x27;m qualified to have an opinion about this product.  Let me just say that if I were to smell a woman&#x27;s hair that had recently used these products, I would want to GAG.  It&#x27;s that bad.  There is nothing herbal, or fruity, or fresh smelling about this shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s straight up synthetic and offensive.  If you want to smell good, and have people compliment you about how your hair smells, I would advise AGAINST purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 2/5 because after one use it did leave my hair feeling and looking glossier and moisturized.  But I&#x27;m going back to my Brilliant Brunette or Suave shampoos, because at least they don&#x27;t leave my head smelling like crap all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware...</li>
            <li> I love it.  I&#x27;m never disappointed and more than likely will continue to order it, as it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair felt after using it. I just wish it came in bigger bottles!! I can get this in our mall, but it is much cheaper on here.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I makes my hair shinny, soft and it smell great!  The mask is great too.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY IT FEELS SMOOTH AND LEAVES NO FRIZZ WHEN U STRAIGHTEN HAIR WITH FLAT IRON STAYS SOFT AND MANAGEBLE ALL DAY</li>
            <li> One of them got to my house almost empty cause there was a hole in it.&lt;br /&gt;not happy about it</li>
            <li> This is some of the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I can safely say that I&#x27;ve tried just about everything under the sun, and at all price points. Leaves my dry, damaged hair soft, shiny and manageable right out of the shower, and the scent is wonderful and very long lasting. When used in conjunction with the mask, my hair is shiny, soft, full of body and smells amazing. This is my HG hair product!</li>
            <li> Smells bad, contains many chemicals, made in china.</li>
            <li> Love these hair products</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner I will buy!!!!! It smells so good an it doesn&#x27;t strip color and it leaves your hair so soft! I have very thick wavy blonde hair and after I use it, it helps tame the wild beast at my stylist says! Really helps with dry winter hair coming into spring and summer!! MUST BUY! It&#x27;s so cheap too!!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  The smell is great too.  The Amazon price is phenomenal compared to what I was paying at the mall</li>
            <li> One of the bottles arrived broken (with a hole in the bottle) more than half of the product was all waisted in the package. So I got only a third of shampoo only.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome!!!!! and makes my hair very silky! :) Great Product!! i would definately order this product again! Thank You!</li>
            <li> My hair is waist length and reacts to humid weather making it frizzy.  This product keeps it soft and silky through out the day no matter the weather conditions.</li>
            <li> This Herstyler shampoo and conditioner is definately my favorite. It makes my hair come out nice, soft, shiny, and just very healthy looking in general. With 5 stars, I love it.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample at our local mall and thought the product was good....to be honest the smell is what I hate.  Product keeps hair shiny but ended up tossing it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up quite a bit and you don&#x27;t have to use much.  I don&#x27;t like conditioner that makes my hair extremely soft because it won&#x27;t take to any heat styling, but this conditioner is great.  It does make your hair soft and very manageable.  I am shocked that the mall can sell these for SO much more.  I was worried that this brand wasn&#x27;t going to be any good, but was worth trying for the price.  I will definitely continue to buy them as needed as long as the price doesn&#x27;t increase too much.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I smell amazing.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s all I keep thinking.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, my hair is clean...and shiny...and easier to straighten... That&#x27;s nice, and all.&lt;br /&gt;But really - I smell amazing.</li>
            <li> not able to brush my curly hair through after conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was tackled by a kiosk operator at the mall, who talked me into buying this product.  I have since purchased these items online.  Retail is $25 per tube...online is 1/2 the price!  My fine hair is now sleek, shiny and moves! when I shake my head.  Get it!</li>
            <li> My daughter was having hair issues and this product has really helped her alot.  She had tried lots of other products but none of them have helped her hair as this one has.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner.</li>
