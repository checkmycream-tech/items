    <ol>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>(so don&#x27;t expect your face to look perfectly poreless), but it does make a visible difference, the pump does get clogged sometimes</li>

            <li>The Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing is great!</li>
            <li>It works, it is the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to be applied before you moisturize!  </li>

            <li>Wonderful product and prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>Minimizing Lotion is an excellent product for my face.</li>
            <li>and It smells so good!!!!</li>
            <li>But in terms reducing the appearance of pores--it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job with that.</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It looks incredibly smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am look&#x27;n good - all day!</li>
            <li>IT FEELS THAT GOOD!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why good products get discontinued all the time!  </li>
            <li>People like me with porous skin are always battling for that beautiful skin our friends have.</li>
            <li>and now I understand why they win consumer awards every year.  </li>
            <li>This is great to apply on before makeup</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Works great with the Pore Minimizing Gel Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have used it almost 2 months and it has helped greatly with my pore size.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great addition to my skincare routine and it does help with pores.</li>
            <li>it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It does what it says, great product.</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>so I searched Amazon and this seemed like a great product.</li>
            <li>Works great on reducing pores.</li>
            <li>delivery was was great.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job of reducing the size of my pores.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many pore minimizing products and so for Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle is the best.</li>
            <li>The price was awesome compared to what I paid when I used to be able to find it at Walgreens</li>
            <li>Very happy will surely buy it again.</li>
            <li>All the Producks are reall good</li>
            <li>Leave&#x27;s the face with a smooth flawless look</li>
            <li>so I figured another L&#x27;Oreal product would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li>However, it has a good smell that is something good I can say about this product.</li>
            <li>I use under my makeup can work as a good primer too.</li>
            <li>Best thing out there (better than the more pricey stuff).</li>
            <li>very pleased.</li>
            <li>A very famous make up artist in LA recommended it to me, so it may work for someone else.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice texture- lightweight and good smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than any product I have ever used and gives me flawless, airbrushed apperance, baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>able to achieve a more flawless look for most of the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have never paid more than $8 per bottle!</li>
            <li>This Pore minimizer was much more then that!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how amazing this stuff is.</li>
            <li>now after a week my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>So if you have pores that kind of embarrass you</li>
            <li>and my parents are making me pay for my own stuff now</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smell nice and feel like silk.  </li>
            <li>its a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice.</li>
            <li>I also liked the matte finish and oil control.  </li>
            <li>I put my moisturizer on over this and that also seemed to blend in nicely.  </li>
            <li>The product smells nice but it doesn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li>Use at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Might work nicely</li>
            <li>can - it makes my skin look so nice that I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation.</li>
            <li>I should have know that the price was too good to be true!</li>
            <li>I found there to be a very strong fragrance to this product.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful for pricky, sensitive, and oil prone skin.</li>
            <li>and I am very impressed so far.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>It is very light and absorbs into my skin immediately ( the texture is like the original Oil of Olay lotions )and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>After I got it , I just used it twice and feel not bad or good</li>
            <li>The fragrance was nice but a bit too strong and lingered longer than I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was good, it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Even better, it retains softness.  </li>
            <li>I started using the L&#x27;Oreal - Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Skin Re-Smoother Serum mostly to minimize my pores but what I found out it does for me is keep in check my oil production.</li>
            <li>Smoothing Priming Powder &amp; Finishing veil (more oil control &amp; smoothing)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product.</li>
            <li>I prided the top off and had to dip my finger into the cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used MANY products over the years, at every price range, that claim to minimize pores and resurface skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it works better just after I&#x27;ve gotten out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I had to remove the top of the mechanism and use my finger to extract the lotion.  </li>
            <li>But I have found a way to make it work even better.</li>
            <li>It works better for me this way.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if this minimizes pores or not as I could not use it more than one time.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to order it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it to minimize my pores but it is a nice light lotion.</li>
            <li>That said, I have yet to find a better inexpensive pore-minimizing face cream.</li>
            <li>I used this pore minimizer at night because in the mornings I tend to wake up with the most oily skin ever (for some reason) but when I used this product on my face</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars if there was more of it in the tube.  </li>
            <li>This product is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>Love this Product, and Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I LOVE how this makes my skin feel after just one use.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>okay .</li>
            <li>The product itself is ok.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>This is not a miracle cream like I have read, but it does work better than anything else I have used.  </li>
            <li>My skin looked smoother and more even toned.  </li>
            <li>This is nothing more than spackle.  </li>
            <li>I would be glad to recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product but it had been discontinued.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and texture of the product.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say, if I was too keep talking about it</li>
            <li>My skin is much more smoother and even toned, and even though my pores are not like when I was 20...</li>
            <li>they have shrunk and I look much better and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Ok, ladies, listen up.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so smooth after using this, I just can&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad that amazon is selling it.  </li>
            <li>but it did make my skin feel better than before i used it</li>
            <li>pores look so much better</li>
            <li>It looks like your product was manufactured more than 3 years</li>
            <li>It also made my blackheads stand out more.....</li>
            <li>I have used many products and nothing comes close to this one, it&#x27;s more than just a pore minimizing cream, it&#x27;s a skin perfecter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hesitated writing a review on this as it is one of my beauty secrets :)</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Very powerful!</li>
            <li>HAPPY HOLIDAYS &amp; NEW YEAR!</li>
            <li>I recommend to use this with a very good facial scrub product....</li>
            <li>I have also experienced far fewer breakouts during the time of the month when my hormones go nuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light and has a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle product, but it really does a good job.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t good for winter as it really isn&#x27;t a moisturizer</li>
            <li>far, this L&#x27;Oreal product is doing some pretty great things for my skin - for a pretty great price as well.</li>
            <li>so your foundation or bb cream spreads easily on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>For a person with allergies, this has an extremely strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I have used for a couple years, but Loreal has apparently discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>This has been the over-all best product - hands down for me.</li>
            <li>Washed it off, and everything was fine.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it truly help with your pore size in the long-term, it&#x27;s the first PERFECT PRODUCT I&#x27;ve ever found in my life - no complaints, whatsoever!   </li>
            <li>The best thing about it is it cost me less to buy it here including the shipping, then it did out of the store.  </li>
            <li>Yet I must admits if used in conjunction with a pore less face primer and flawless finish powder .Im</li>
            <li>It seems to leave a fine layer on your skin that disguises and covers pores.  </li>
            <li>also had a 2009 expired coupon and there is no expiration date, but the smell and color seem fine, so I am using it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge bottle, but the price was around $65</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast the smell of this stuff is AMAZING</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was available at one of the stores close by.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to smooth my skin and reduce my pores.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li>I use this product primarily on my nose</li>
            <li>To be totally honest, I don&#x27;t really think this does anything to \\&quot;minimize\\&quot; your pores.</li>
            <li>I have been able to purchase it on Amazon for a greatly reduced price - including shipping - and it has arrived well-packed within the expected timeframe.  </li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the lotion is perfumey, but that&#x27;s L&#x27;Oreal, may not be good for people with sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week or two - right on my T-zone, and on top of the Booster Serum.  </li>
            <li>This product hasn&#x27;t caused any problems, in fact, my skin is much better when I use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>Okay at first....</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>I love this product because it does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>I use it as directed on the bottle: On clean skin and moisturize afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It is magic for my oily skin with large pore around the nose.</li>
            <li>My pores look like they have been airbrushed right out of my face!</li>
            <li>I really Like it don&#x27;t have any More</li>
            <li>The container it comes in looks cool,</li>
            <li>Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Well, the product itself is very light, so the bottle kind of feels empty to begin with.</li>
            <li>a mild face-lotion.</li>
            <li>product feels nice on my face and it has a nice but not over powering scent, but I can&#x27;t speak towards the effects as I have only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>If applied before make-up it positively gives the skin a smooth even appearance.</li>
            <li>This is the first pore minimizer that has ever worked on my face!</li>
            <li>But not a big deal now because I am so much better!  </li>
            <li>THIS PORE MINIMISER DOES EXACTLY TAT!  </li>
            <li>THANK YOU again &amp; will not only recommend but most deff purchase from again!</li>
            <li>For anyone who has large pores, or acne scars, this product fills and gives skin a smooth appearance under make-up.</li>
            <li>I am sooooo happy that I had a \\&quot;little faith\\&quot; to give it a try</li>
            <li>I really liked this product because one bottle has lasted me forever, and I use it daily.  </li>
            <li>this is worth a shot, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My skin looked young -- i will buy more of this item</li>
            <li>While I love this item, I was surprised to find a coupon in the box that had an expiration date of 2009.</li>
            <li>Making it an additional expense, but one that is affordable and beyond worth it.</li>
            <li>Even with this being i said i can still say with 100% confidence THIS ITEM WAS SHIPPED FAST and WAS EXACTLY AS THE PICTURE and DESCRIPTION showed --- AS WELL as I LOVED THE product which let me say I HAVE USED A LOT OF SKIN CARE RELATED CREAMS &amp; PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>I have very large pore&#x27;s and this product works  </li>
            <li>Not only does it reduce the size of your pores, and give your skin a healthier more even tone in the long-run, it&#x27;s also amazing in the short term!</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>it also serves as a very light weight moisturizer, I only have to use it once a day....</li>
            <li>well, you can see it has a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The smell is very intense.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I used Loreal</li>
            <li>So for the cost of this product, anyone interested should just try it to see for themselves.  </li>
            <li>Only two pumps, at most, are needed per application.  </li>
            <li>Still, I do not recommend anyone skip the moisturizing step -- just because your skin feels soft, smooth, and moisturized</li>
            <li>and I can still use the product, but I found that pretty strange.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can definitely take a trip to Sephora and spend $35 for a better product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Loreal Skin Genesis Pore for over a year and have noticed that it really does minimize pores!  </li>
            <li>The problem is when it arrived, my first suspicion was the CVS sticker on it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews but when there is a product I repurchase, I actually will take the time to.  </li>
            <li>am experiencing a similar sensation with this L&#x27;Oreal product, and I do love the smell of this product too - it actually reminds me of that great Estee Lauder product of long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time using SKin Genesis Pore Minizing.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a larger container and more for the money, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel super smooth and does help my pores look smaller.  </li>
            <li>It does make my pores smaller and my skin super smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty large pores on my nose that were always prominent, but this cream has definitely diminished them.</li>
            <li>: This works great to minimize pores BUT EVEN MORE SO making a general clear up of my face without getting flakey skin, drying out, or irritation that typical acne lines/products cause!!</li>
            <li>The good news is you only need about 1 pump a day to keep your results and it last about 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that has achieved really noticeable results, bar none.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if this product was good or not, because I was not able to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately it&#x27;s fairly easy to open it up</li>
            <li>This products really didn&#x27;t do much to help the appearance of my pores, it would work for maybe the first 15 minutes of wearing it, but then my pores looked just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who has a problem with large pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried astringents but they just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything to reduce the appearance of large pores.  </li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews and was excited to find an over the counter product that had such a high success rate for achieving smoother skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much and use it so regularly that I find I have to buy a new bottle about every month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week and there is a HUGE difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>SO, I chose this because even if it really didn&#x27;t work, it didn&#x27;t hurt my wallet too</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know where they came from</li>
            <li>when I do, I really like the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li>That said, I think this cream goes on really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT ..</li>
            <li>so I ad to pop it off and just go straight from the jar.</li>
            <li>I also have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I was very depressed about my Rosacea and using this</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really seem to make an effect on my pores...</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this prodect!</li>
            <li>Really hoped this product would work but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li>It really does minimize my pores.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for everything.</li>
            <li>However, I really did not notice any difference after using it.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks sleek and can take a real beating because I&#x27;ve dropped it a lot.</li>
            <li>But really the product just makes me look ghost-like and feels like it sits on my skin like a sheet.</li>
            <li>It worked as advertised and really improved the look of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This, however, which isn&#x27;t even really a primer or a mattifier, does what nothing else</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-oily and fast drying.</li>
            <li>However, I feel that sometimes when it is extra hot and humid out, the moisturizing step is not necessary because it feels as though this product does a good enough job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Actually using the product is much less pleasant.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, nor does it irritate it like many other products.     </li>
            <li>I recently moved to the hot and humid Florida, and the weather has made my pores more visible, especially on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my pores have been visibly smaller and stay clean through out my use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had visible pores, and since having children, my skin has broken out more and been more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels noticeably softer and I have hopes that my pores will get a bit less prominent with usage of this over time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you simply twist the top of the tube (the white part, the lip of the dispenser)in the direction the arrow indicates.</li>
            <li>I bought two Neutrogena Skin Primers and they do the same sort of thing only better.  </li>
            <li>and like them a lot, particularly the one with color.  </li>
            <li>Also, it dries really quickly and if you rub your skin, the lotion actually clumps up and rubs off.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product for pore reduction and smoother skin, and have realistic expectations, I would suggest you try this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>(I only used it there), completely matte all day long even on the most hot, humid summer days.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Note - I do not have sensitive skin!  Yikes!</li>
            <li>I was shocked that it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>and so far I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I will have to wait a few more weeks to purchase this because I&#x27;m 18 now</li>
            <li>OVER ALL MY FACE IS MORE FIRM AM</li>
            <li>The package was like new.</li>
            <li>Were I  live they stopped getting it in all the store&#x27;s in my area</li>
            <li>And with that comes a new found confidence.</li>
            <li>the product was brand new in the box, but when i opened it, there was a coupon in there that expired about 3 years ago, so  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never liked the serums, the roll-on mumbo-jumbo, mostly because (lets get real)</li>
            <li>If you think it is empty, before you throw it out, make sure you crack the lid off (it wasn&#x27;t made to come off) because you may have a lot left.</li>
            <li>I see a very clear difference when I use this product.</li>
            <li>The product I received was over 5 years old!</li>
            <li>At first I applied this lotion on my T-zone, my nose, and my cheeks, then I started noticing that my forehead started itching, with lil red spots.</li>
            <li>when many of my other beauty products will often last longer.</li>
            <li>and i could tell after the first day of use that my pores were smaller.</li>
            <li>Shipment was made overnight and payment is so simple with no filling out of timely registrations after first purchase.</li>
            <li>so i apologize for doing a review 1 year old!</li>
            <li>You should just buy whipped cream, it&#x27;s cheaper and it will have the exact same effect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have large pores, but sometimes in the summer, my pores will look bigger because of all the sweat from the heat</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for something that really shows results , and this does.</li>
            <li>My pores and fine lines are so much improved , I can hardly believe it when I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li>but I have oily skin, slightly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>and I discover that the tube connecting to the pump is completely missing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m assuming it is because of how old the \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; one I received was.</li>
            <li>I am a 49 year old women.</li>
            <li>When I start using l&#x27;oreal skin genesis pore minimizing gel cleanser, I was surprised by its usage.</li>
            <li>I finally found a product that has worked to get rid of my acne on my forehead which i get because of how much oil I produce there.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out from it and it leaves your face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell by the weight of the container how much you may have left at any given time.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft, supple and poreless.</li>
            <li>and I have had no luck finding a product that I could use every day without becoming an oil slick</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old, and have tried every pore minimizer on the market.</li>
            <li>the cream must be about 3 years old</li>
            <li>I have no idea the residual quality of the product if it is three or four years old.</li>
            <li>The box was completely in tact.</li>
            <li>As far as pores (which is why I bought it)  </li>
            <li>It smells like a mixture of alcohol, hairspray, and old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beginning to think I received one of the old, expired ones.</li>
            <li>I purchased this facial lotion several times and then suddenly wasn&#x27;t able to find it in any of my local stores.</li>
            <li>Normally by now, all the bad spots on my face are trying to peel up and look rough,  so far all good, my face feels smooth and not rought.  </li>
            <li>It takes very little, feels good on my face, lays a good base for my foundation and never makes me oily.  </li>
            <li>I like it, not sure if I notice smaller pores, but it is refreshing and softening to my skin</li>
            <li>I caught my reflection in a mirror the other day and for the first time in years I was actually pleasantly surprised by the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>After one month my swollen , red oily nose is completely normal looking.</li>
            <li>I had pretty high hopes for this little tube.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a nice pump that pumps out just a little at a time, unlike some pumpers that makes you waste product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks [in combination with Origins Clear Improvement Mask] and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>Would deff try for anyone young or old for overall skin care, clarity, upkeep or one timers!</li>
            <li>It really helped my poes not necessarily dimish but make smaller!</li>
            <li>I looked at some other pore-minizing treatments as well (from Sephora), and though the reviews consistently reflected that the product worked, I just didn&#x27;t want to shell out $100.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft, and so silky, that it&#x27;s hard NOT to touch, thought I try since that&#x27;s never good for your skin :p  </li>
            <li>The cosmetics had expired.\\&quot;General shelf life: 36 months   </li>
            <li>I have noticed that the pores on my cheeks near my nose are bigger than I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>The only downside is after not using it for a while the results Will reverse and bring you back to your normal condition.</li>
            <li>But what I do know about this product is that at first I was very skeptical but I was at the supermarket isle looking for a particular product to smooth out my skin complexion when I came across this.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need more than 2 to 3 pumps to cover your whole face, a very small amount - if you apply it too thickly it&#x27;ll actually feel too thick as it dries, so you&#x27;ll know; it&#x27;s not hard to figure out your \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; amount.</li>
            <li>The next was the old coupon in the box that expired in 2009 when it&#x27;s mid 2012!  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a month now, and my pores look extremely visibly smaller, even though they weren&#x27;t very noticeable to anyone except myself to begin with.  </li>
            <li>But this is a review on my first few uses and the experience of receiving.  </li>
            <li>have combination skin where my cheeks can be really dry and without this my makeup looks very powdery and dry.</li>
            <li>Even on my first application, I applied a thin layer over my whole face and noticed the pores on my nose were already definitely smaller.  </li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, large pores and an uneven texture, this is for you.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just a mask for your pores and will actually rub off into little rolls if you put on even a dab too much.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> (so don&#x27;t expect your face to look perfectly poreless), but it does make a visible difference, the pump does get clogged sometimes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly perfect.</li>
            <li> what makes this product so perfect!</li>
            <li> Is this product the best?</li>
            <li> Wonderfully minimizes pores.</li>
            <li> , my skin looks flawless, like a baby skin.</li>
            <li> Any unwary consumer will read all the wonderful reviews and then PAY $25 for an OUNCE!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> has made all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!!  </li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have used.</li>
            <li> The Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing is great!</li>
            <li> It works, it is the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to be applied before you moisturize!  </li>
            <li> this product was marvelous at reducing shine.</li>
            <li> and I am happy about that!  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product and prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li> Minimizing Lotion is an excellent product for my face.</li>
            <li> and It smells so good!!!!</li>
            <li> But in terms reducing the appearance of pores--it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job with that.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It looks incredibly smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am look&#x27;n good - all day!</li>
            <li> IT FEELS THAT GOOD!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why good products get discontinued all the time!  </li>
            <li> People like me with porous skin are always battling for that beautiful skin our friends have.</li>
            <li> and now I understand why they win consumer awards every year.  </li>
            <li> This is great to apply on before makeup</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great with the Pore Minimizing Gel Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used it almost 2 months and it has helped greatly with my pore size.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a great addition to my skincare routine and it does help with pores.</li>
            <li> it is a great product.  </li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It does what it says, great product.</li>
            <li> Great price too.</li>
            <li> so I searched Amazon and this seemed like a great product.</li>
            <li> Works great on reducing pores.</li>
            <li> delivery was was great.  </li>
            <li> and it does a great job of reducing the size of my pores.  </li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many pore minimizing products and so for Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle is the best.</li>
            <li> The price was awesome compared to what I paid when I used to be able to find it at Walgreens</li>
            <li> Very happy will surely buy it again.</li>
            <li> All the Producks are reall good</li>
            <li> Leave&#x27;s the face with a smooth flawless look</li>
            <li> so I figured another L&#x27;Oreal product would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li> However, it has a good smell that is something good I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> I use under my makeup can work as a good primer too.</li>
            <li> Best thing out there (better than the more pricey stuff).</li>
            <li> very pleased.</li>
            <li> A very famous make up artist in LA recommended it to me, so it may work for someone else.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice texture- lightweight and good smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any product I have ever used and gives me flawless, airbrushed apperance, baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> able to achieve a more flawless look for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have never paid more than $8 per bottle!</li>
            <li> This Pore minimizer was much more then that!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how amazing this stuff is.</li>
            <li> now after a week my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> So if you have pores that kind of embarrass you</li>
            <li> and my parents are making me pay for my own stuff now</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smell nice and feel like silk.  </li>
            <li> its a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice.</li>
            <li> I also liked the matte finish and oil control.  </li>
            <li> I put my moisturizer on over this and that also seemed to blend in nicely.  </li>
            <li> The product smells nice but it doesn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li> Use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Might work nicely</li>
            <li> can - it makes my skin look so nice that I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation.</li>
            <li> I should have know that the price was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> I found there to be a very strong fragrance to this product.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful for pricky, sensitive, and oil prone skin.</li>
            <li> and I am very impressed so far.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> It is very light and absorbs into my skin immediately ( the texture is like the original Oil of Olay lotions )and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> After I got it , I just used it twice and feel not bad or good</li>
            <li> The fragrance was nice but a bit too strong and lingered longer than I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was good, it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Even better, it retains softness.  </li>
            <li> I started using the L&#x27;Oreal - Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Skin Re-Smoother Serum mostly to minimize my pores but what I found out it does for me is keep in check my oil production.</li>
            <li> Smoothing Priming Powder &amp; Finishing veil (more oil control &amp; smoothing)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product.</li>
            <li> I prided the top off and had to dip my finger into the cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used MANY products over the years, at every price range, that claim to minimize pores and resurface skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it works better just after I&#x27;ve gotten out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I had to remove the top of the mechanism and use my finger to extract the lotion.  </li>
            <li> But I have found a way to make it work even better.</li>
            <li> It works better for me this way.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this minimizes pores or not as I could not use it more than one time.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to order it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it to minimize my pores but it is a nice light lotion.</li>
            <li> That said, I have yet to find a better inexpensive pore-minimizing face cream.</li>
            <li> I used this pore minimizer at night because in the mornings I tend to wake up with the most oily skin ever (for some reason) but when I used this product on my face</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars if there was more of it in the tube.  </li>
            <li> This product is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> Love this Product, and Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how this makes my skin feel after just one use.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> okay .</li>
            <li> The product itself is ok.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle cream like I have read, but it does work better than anything else I have used.  </li>
            <li> My skin looked smoother and more even toned.  </li>
            <li> This is nothing more than spackle.  </li>
            <li> I would be glad to recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product but it had been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and texture of the product.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say, if I was too keep talking about it</li>
            <li> My skin is much more smoother and even toned, and even though my pores are not like when I was 20...</li>
            <li> they have shrunk and I look much better and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Ok, ladies, listen up.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so smooth after using this, I just can&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad that amazon is selling it.  </li>
            <li> but it did make my skin feel better than before i used it</li>
            <li> pores look so much better</li>
            <li> It looks like your product was manufactured more than 3 years</li>
            <li> It also made my blackheads stand out more.....</li>
            <li> I have used many products and nothing comes close to this one, it&#x27;s more than just a pore minimizing cream, it&#x27;s a skin perfecter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hesitated writing a review on this as it is one of my beauty secrets :)</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> Very powerful!</li>
            <li> HAPPY HOLIDAYS &amp; NEW YEAR!</li>
            <li> I recommend to use this with a very good facial scrub product....</li>
            <li> I have also experienced far fewer breakouts during the time of the month when my hormones go nuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s light and has a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle product, but it really does a good job.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t good for winter as it really isn&#x27;t a moisturizer</li>
            <li> far, this L&#x27;Oreal product is doing some pretty great things for my skin - for a pretty great price as well.</li>
            <li> so your foundation or bb cream spreads easily on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> For a person with allergies, this has an extremely strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have used for a couple years, but Loreal has apparently discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> This has been the over-all best product - hands down for me.</li>
            <li> Washed it off, and everything was fine.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it truly help with your pore size in the long-term, it&#x27;s the first PERFECT PRODUCT I&#x27;ve ever found in my life - no complaints, whatsoever!   </li>
            <li> The best thing about it is it cost me less to buy it here including the shipping, then it did out of the store.  </li>
            <li> Yet I must admits if used in conjunction with a pore less face primer and flawless finish powder .Im</li>
            <li> It seems to leave a fine layer on your skin that disguises and covers pores.  </li>
            <li> also had a 2009 expired coupon and there is no expiration date, but the smell and color seem fine, so I am using it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a huge bottle, but the price was around $65</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast the smell of this stuff is AMAZING</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was available at one of the stores close by.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to smooth my skin and reduce my pores.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this product primarily on my nose</li>
            <li> To be totally honest, I don&#x27;t really think this does anything to \\&quot;minimize\\&quot; your pores.</li>
            <li> I have been able to purchase it on Amazon for a greatly reduced price - including shipping - and it has arrived well-packed within the expected timeframe.  </li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the lotion is perfumey, but that&#x27;s L&#x27;Oreal, may not be good for people with sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week or two - right on my T-zone, and on top of the Booster Serum.  </li>
            <li> This product hasn&#x27;t caused any problems, in fact, my skin is much better when I use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> Okay at first....</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I use it as directed on the bottle: On clean skin and moisturize afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It is magic for my oily skin with large pore around the nose.</li>
            <li> My pores look like they have been airbrushed right out of my face!</li>
            <li> I really Like it don&#x27;t have any More</li>
            <li> The container it comes in looks cool,</li>
            <li> Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Well, the product itself is very light, so the bottle kind of feels empty to begin with.</li>
            <li> a mild face-lotion.</li>
            <li> product feels nice on my face and it has a nice but not over powering scent, but I can&#x27;t speak towards the effects as I have only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> If applied before make-up it positively gives the skin a smooth even appearance.</li>
            <li> This is the first pore minimizer that has ever worked on my face!</li>
            <li> But not a big deal now because I am so much better!  </li>
            <li> THIS PORE MINIMISER DOES EXACTLY TAT!  </li>
            <li> THANK YOU again &amp; will not only recommend but most deff purchase from again!</li>
            <li> For anyone who has large pores, or acne scars, this product fills and gives skin a smooth appearance under make-up.</li>
            <li> I am sooooo happy that I had a \\&quot;little faith\\&quot; to give it a try</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because one bottle has lasted me forever, and I use it daily.  </li>
            <li> this is worth a shot, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My skin looked young -- i will buy more of this item</li>
            <li> While I love this item, I was surprised to find a coupon in the box that had an expiration date of 2009.</li>
            <li> Making it an additional expense, but one that is affordable and beyond worth it.</li>
            <li> Even with this being i said i can still say with 100% confidence THIS ITEM WAS SHIPPED FAST and WAS EXACTLY AS THE PICTURE and DESCRIPTION showed --- AS WELL as I LOVED THE product which let me say I HAVE USED A LOT OF SKIN CARE RELATED CREAMS &amp; PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> I have very large pore&#x27;s and this product works  </li>
            <li> Not only does it reduce the size of your pores, and give your skin a healthier more even tone in the long-run, it&#x27;s also amazing in the short term!</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> it also serves as a very light weight moisturizer, I only have to use it once a day....</li>
            <li> well, you can see it has a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The smell is very intense.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used Loreal</li>
            <li> So for the cost of this product, anyone interested should just try it to see for themselves.  </li>
            <li> Only two pumps, at most, are needed per application.  </li>
            <li> Still, I do not recommend anyone skip the moisturizing step -- just because your skin feels soft, smooth, and moisturized</li>
            <li> and I can still use the product, but I found that pretty strange.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can definitely take a trip to Sephora and spend $35 for a better product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Loreal Skin Genesis Pore for over a year and have noticed that it really does minimize pores!  </li>
            <li> The problem is when it arrived, my first suspicion was the CVS sticker on it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but when there is a product I repurchase, I actually will take the time to.  </li>
            <li> am experiencing a similar sensation with this L&#x27;Oreal product, and I do love the smell of this product too - it actually reminds me of that great Estee Lauder product of long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first time using SKin Genesis Pore Minizing.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a larger container and more for the money, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel super smooth and does help my pores look smaller.  </li>
            <li> It does make my pores smaller and my skin super smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty large pores on my nose that were always prominent, but this cream has definitely diminished them.</li>
            <li> : This works great to minimize pores BUT EVEN MORE SO making a general clear up of my face without getting flakey skin, drying out, or irritation that typical acne lines/products cause!!</li>
            <li> The good news is you only need about 1 pump a day to keep your results and it last about 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that has achieved really noticeable results, bar none.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if this product was good or not, because I was not able to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately it&#x27;s fairly easy to open it up</li>
            <li> This products really didn&#x27;t do much to help the appearance of my pores, it would work for maybe the first 15 minutes of wearing it, but then my pores looked just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who has a problem with large pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried astringents but they just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything to reduce the appearance of large pores.  </li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews and was excited to find an over the counter product that had such a high success rate for achieving smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much and use it so regularly that I find I have to buy a new bottle about every month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week and there is a HUGE difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> SO, I chose this because even if it really didn&#x27;t work, it didn&#x27;t hurt my wallet too</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know where they came from</li>
            <li> when I do, I really like the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li> That said, I think this cream goes on really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks a million.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT ..</li>
            <li> so I ad to pop it off and just go straight from the jar.</li>
            <li> I also have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I was very depressed about my Rosacea and using this</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really seem to make an effect on my pores...</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this prodect!</li>
            <li> Really hoped this product would work but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> It really does minimize my pores.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> However, I really did not notice any difference after using it.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks sleek and can take a real beating because I&#x27;ve dropped it a lot.</li>
            <li> But really the product just makes me look ghost-like and feels like it sits on my skin like a sheet.</li>
            <li> It worked as advertised and really improved the look of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This, however, which isn&#x27;t even really a primer or a mattifier, does what nothing else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-oily and fast drying.</li>
            <li> However, I feel that sometimes when it is extra hot and humid out, the moisturizing step is not necessary because it feels as though this product does a good enough job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Actually using the product is much less pleasant.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, nor does it irritate it like many other products.     </li>
            <li> I recently moved to the hot and humid Florida, and the weather has made my pores more visible, especially on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my pores have been visibly smaller and stay clean through out my use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had visible pores, and since having children, my skin has broken out more and been more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels noticeably softer and I have hopes that my pores will get a bit less prominent with usage of this over time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you simply twist the top of the tube (the white part, the lip of the dispenser)in the direction the arrow indicates.</li>
            <li> I bought two Neutrogena Skin Primers and they do the same sort of thing only better.  </li>
            <li> and like them a lot, particularly the one with color.  </li>
            <li> Also, it dries really quickly and if you rub your skin, the lotion actually clumps up and rubs off.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product for pore reduction and smoother skin, and have realistic expectations, I would suggest you try this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> (I only used it there), completely matte all day long even on the most hot, humid summer days.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Note - I do not have sensitive skin!  Yikes!</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> and so far I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I will have to wait a few more weeks to purchase this because I&#x27;m 18 now</li>
            <li> OVER ALL MY FACE IS MORE FIRM AM</li>
            <li> The package was like new.</li>
            <li> Were I  live they stopped getting it in all the store&#x27;s in my area</li>
            <li> And with that comes a new found confidence.</li>
            <li> the product was brand new in the box, but when i opened it, there was a coupon in there that expired about 3 years ago, so  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked the serums, the roll-on mumbo-jumbo, mostly because (lets get real)</li>
            <li> If you think it is empty, before you throw it out, make sure you crack the lid off (it wasn&#x27;t made to come off) because you may have a lot left.</li>
            <li> I see a very clear difference when I use this product.</li>
            <li> The product I received was over 5 years old!</li>
            <li> At first I applied this lotion on my T-zone, my nose, and my cheeks, then I started noticing that my forehead started itching, with lil red spots.</li>
            <li> when many of my other beauty products will often last longer.</li>
            <li> and i could tell after the first day of use that my pores were smaller.</li>
            <li> Shipment was made overnight and payment is so simple with no filling out of timely registrations after first purchase.</li>
            <li> so i apologize for doing a review 1 year old!</li>
            <li> You should just buy whipped cream, it&#x27;s cheaper and it will have the exact same effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have large pores, but sometimes in the summer, my pores will look bigger because of all the sweat from the heat</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for something that really shows results , and this does.</li>
            <li> My pores and fine lines are so much improved , I can hardly believe it when I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> but I have oily skin, slightly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> and I discover that the tube connecting to the pump is completely missing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m assuming it is because of how old the \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; one I received was.</li>
            <li> I am a 49 year old women.</li>
            <li> When I start using l&#x27;oreal skin genesis pore minimizing gel cleanser, I was surprised by its usage.</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that has worked to get rid of my acne on my forehead which i get because of how much oil I produce there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out from it and it leaves your face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell by the weight of the container how much you may have left at any given time.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft, supple and poreless.</li>
            <li> and I have had no luck finding a product that I could use every day without becoming an oil slick</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old, and have tried every pore minimizer on the market.</li>
            <li> the cream must be about 3 years old</li>
            <li> I have no idea the residual quality of the product if it is three or four years old.</li>
            <li> The box was completely in tact.</li>
            <li> As far as pores (which is why I bought it)  </li>
            <li> It smells like a mixture of alcohol, hairspray, and old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to think I received one of the old, expired ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this facial lotion several times and then suddenly wasn&#x27;t able to find it in any of my local stores.</li>
            <li> Normally by now, all the bad spots on my face are trying to peel up and look rough,  so far all good, my face feels smooth and not rought.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little, feels good on my face, lays a good base for my foundation and never makes me oily.  </li>
            <li> I like it, not sure if I notice smaller pores, but it is refreshing and softening to my skin</li>
            <li> I caught my reflection in a mirror the other day and for the first time in years I was actually pleasantly surprised by the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> After one month my swollen , red oily nose is completely normal looking.</li>
            <li> I had pretty high hopes for this little tube.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice pump that pumps out just a little at a time, unlike some pumpers that makes you waste product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks [in combination with Origins Clear Improvement Mask] and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> Would deff try for anyone young or old for overall skin care, clarity, upkeep or one timers!</li>
            <li> It really helped my poes not necessarily dimish but make smaller!</li>
            <li> I looked at some other pore-minizing treatments as well (from Sephora), and though the reviews consistently reflected that the product worked, I just didn&#x27;t want to shell out $100.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft, and so silky, that it&#x27;s hard NOT to touch, thought I try since that&#x27;s never good for your skin :p  </li>
            <li> The cosmetics had expired.\\&quot;General shelf life: 36 months   </li>
            <li> I have noticed that the pores on my cheeks near my nose are bigger than I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> The only downside is after not using it for a while the results Will reverse and bring you back to your normal condition.</li>
            <li> But what I do know about this product is that at first I was very skeptical but I was at the supermarket isle looking for a particular product to smooth out my skin complexion when I came across this.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need more than 2 to 3 pumps to cover your whole face, a very small amount - if you apply it too thickly it&#x27;ll actually feel too thick as it dries, so you&#x27;ll know; it&#x27;s not hard to figure out your \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; amount.</li>
            <li> The next was the old coupon in the box that expired in 2009 when it&#x27;s mid 2012!  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now, and my pores look extremely visibly smaller, even though they weren&#x27;t very noticeable to anyone except myself to begin with.  </li>
            <li> But this is a review on my first few uses and the experience of receiving.  </li>
            <li> have combination skin where my cheeks can be really dry and without this my makeup looks very powdery and dry.</li>
            <li> Even on my first application, I applied a thin layer over my whole face and noticed the pores on my nose were already definitely smaller.  </li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, large pores and an uneven texture, this is for you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just a mask for your pores and will actually rub off into little rolls if you put on even a dab too much.</li>
            <li> (you have to tap it on the counter a few times before you push the pump), and the cost is a little high for how much you get.  </li>
            <li> The farthest I&#x27;ve usually gone is to use a gentle cream-cleanser am and pm</li>
            <li> As long as you aren&#x27;t leaving it open, it won&#x27;t clog - never been a problem for me</li>
            <li> I do not generally use these types of products.</li>
            <li> I picked up this product at my local drugstore with little to no expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised.     </li>
            <li> The bottle also doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> face did begin to dry out after about 3 weeks of daily use, however so I would suggest either using it less frequently or using a moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> Since I only use this product on the areas I&#x27;m targeting [which is not a large area], it seems that this bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li> It makes my face so soft and tight.  </li>
            <li> I defiantly recommend the L&#x27;Oreal - Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Skin Re-Smoother Serum, if your skin is not sensitive to any of the ingredients this is a product that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and have seen a difference in my \\&quot;stress lines\\&quot; and wrinkles on my 29 year old face.</li>
            <li> And as long as you \\&quot;close\\&quot; the bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I returned this, so I can&#x27;t give long term results.  </li>
            <li> After this product, my skin stays matte all day long</li>
            <li> How strange!</li>
            <li> It has noticeably reduced the size and appearance of my pores, and unlike almost every other serum/lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, it doesn&#x27;t ever leave my skin feeling greasy - quite the opposite.</li>
            <li> and I unfortunately haven&#x27;t experience a significant decrease in pore size .</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you defiantly will need to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I am sorry that it is not available in the stores but am glad I can still order on line.</li>
            <li> and then MAYBE (if my skin is feeling dry)</li>
            <li> It seems to just dry out your skin, but for the price I guess I got what I paid for</li>
            <li> I apply the product morning and night, let it dry and then apply my L&#x27;Oreal mousse foundation.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t claim this to be a miracle worker for my pores; this single product doesn&#x27;t take care of all my pore problems by itself.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less clogging in my pores, and my skin is overall healthier.  </li>
            <li> my pores are smaller and less noticeable</li>
            <li> I give it five stars, though, because it is the only product I have ever found that has kept my face from being a total oil slick.</li>
            <li> I have probably the most oily skin possible, and every so-called mattifying primer that I&#x27;ve tried has been a total failure, not to mention that almost every primer makes me break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> It helps a little with lines - but just minimum/fine - so don&#x27;t count on it as a big line eraser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gross and feels heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> I think they sent me an empty container.</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on products and would have never thought a \\&quot;drug</li>
            <li> The pump also doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom of the bottle, and considering this is only 1 oz of of cream, it begins to feel empty after just a few days of use.</li>
            <li> The daily serum produces better, brighter results as a base without the spackle feel.</li>
            <li> but when i start working I will never live without this product ever again!!</li>
            <li> I read one other review where the person mentioned that the bottle would clog or something, and then feel like it was empty when it wasn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> During the day I use a face sunscreen and sometimes the too faced liquid primer, then I apply my base, Clinique Redness Solutions in #3 Ivory (Medium+ Coverage - slight yellow based, most lt-med shades out there are too pink) and</li>
            <li> but I believe my enlarged pores have emerged due to years of wearing make-up, genetics, etc.  </li>
            <li> I was reading a review on Yahoo the other day, and this product was recommended.</li>
            <li> My skin always ended up looking the same if not more shiny by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on the number of \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; reviews by other Amazon shoppers.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it made my pores smaller</li>
            <li> Layering the two together felt even worse, especially with a 3rd layer of moisturizer, so don&#x27;t even bother with that idea.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it, and I certainly never wish to do so again!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that slightly acid pull that other pore minimizers do.  </li>
            <li> The lotion has absolutely helped to make my skin look smoother in the troubled areas.</li>
            <li> The results are not worth the price, the clogging, or the dulling effect.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean it necessarily is!      </li>
            <li> and it only takes a very small amount</li>
            <li> Besides, it does seem to be closing my pores and leaving my skin less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not cool, Amazon.</li>
            <li> A little is all you need.</li>
            <li> If used in the AM before applying makeup it tends to make my face seem a little oily, so I suggest using it in the evening.     </li>
            <li> but it is definitely not worth the price!</li>
            <li> It is all dried out and past due product.</li>
            <li> And once again, they have not let me down!</li>
            <li> In the colder few days here in the Fl winter I may have to apply a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical about these products, but I was happily surprised this time.</li>
            <li> My skin lightens and tightens visibly within a few days.</li>
            <li> It was also dried up.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding it in the stores, so I hoped Amazon would have it.</li>
            <li> I am 17 and have battled with shiny skin for a few years now.</li>
            <li> If used everyday it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been very pleasantly surprised that I barely have any oil buildup on my forehead now, a little around the base of my nose.</li>
            <li> decided to try it anyway, it seemed a little dried up (probably because it was expired) but managed to get a couple small clumps.  </li>
            <li> , Well I received it with a broken cap and half way empty.</li>
            <li> There is so little in a bottle!</li>
            <li> Sorry to have to say this product failed me in two ways; right out of the package the pumping mechanism did not work.</li>
            <li> but my skin always looked sort of loose and tired to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 a non sunbather with very little wrinkles (PTL)</li>
            <li> : this cream is a little thick and it often clogs the pump.</li>
            <li> I have used pore minimizers before (Estee Lauder&#x27;s pore minimizing serum, witch hazel, nose strips, etc.), yet this one did very little to reduce pore size.</li>
            <li> and I apply a small amount.</li>
            <li> I feel a small tingle for a couple of seconds</li>
            <li> I bought this product to assist in minimizing some pores on each side of my nose which have cropped up in the past year.  </li>
            <li> It made my foundation slick and goopy, so I was just using it at night.  </li>
            <li> so I often skip the moisturizer, usually on accident.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get it out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in desperate need of a gylcolic peel but cannot afford it currently.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shrink pores like it says it does, or at least not for me.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal - Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Skin Re-Smoother Serum has a med thick creamy constancy, not runny.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out this bad since high school.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find the coupon enclosed had an expiration date of 2009, so this \\&quot;new\\&quot; product must be at least 3 years old.</li>
            <li> You used to be on the side of the consumer but lately are letting the retailer get away with stealing the hard earned money of your customers!  </li>
            <li> I have used other pore minimizing products in the past, like dr brandt which was very expensive and yielded no difference in the appearance of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using skin genesis</li>
            <li> Too bad Loreal made a big mistake.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> but I get such dry awful areas on my face.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy expensive pore minimizing products and end out throwing them out</li>
            <li> I had to open it up and have been digging out with my finger:(</li>
            <li> Overall, I would not recommend this product :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally addicted to this product, use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> but I have always had pores that approximately resemble potholes in size...</li>
            <li> And my pump was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> So tired of getting ripped off.</li>
            <li> and I will, I hate when people say the will write back later...and don&#x27;t!!  </li>
            <li> And by expensive, I mean it was priced like a street drug.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say this product went into the trash.</li>
            <li> I have always been extreeeeemely skeptical of any products like this, because there are literally hundreds of them when you walk into that intimidating section of the store for skin-care items.</li>
            <li> but I use another product for that, which, sadly yes, has been discontinued as well.  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> I have such terrible skin,  and at age 55 I need help of course!  </li>
            <li> This item was so disappointing.</li>
            <li> The smell was so bad I had to wash this off my face within 30 minutes of applying.</li>
            <li> I was embarrassed when my sister called me out on mny pores -- i didn&#x27;t reaized it was so bad till i bought this</li>
            <li> I have been using the Loreal cream for a couple of weeks, &amp; I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. :(</li>
            <li> If L&#x27;Oreal stopped making it, I would be distraught!</li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
            <li> So if you have insanely oily skin like I do, I recommend you try it before it becomes impossible to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated wearing make-up (like foundation, concealer, etc.)</li>
            <li> While the pump is awful, I would defintiely by this product again for its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I threw this away as the scent was awful.  </li>
            <li> BUT, it contains Cyclohexasiloxane, which is a NASTY, toxic chemical.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is all dried out and past due product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more expensive pore minimizers.  And by expensive, I mean it was priced like a street drug.  This was the first time I used Loreal and now I understand why they win consumer awards every year.  After using this product, my pores have been visibly smaller and stay clean through out my use.  Even better, it retains softness.  It doesn&#x27;t have that slightly acid pull that other pore minimizers do.  So for the cost of this product, anyone interested should just try it to see for themselves.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it worked perfectly. This doesn&#x27;t happen to me often!  I usually buy expensive pore minimizing products and end out throwing them out&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> All the Producks are reall good Need Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Mininizing I really Like it don&#x27;t have any More</li>
            <li> This has been the over-all best product - hands down for me. This is the first pore minimizer that has ever worked on my face! I have stopped using the Smashbox anti-shine primer because I don&#x27;t need it now like I did before. I started using the L&#x27;Oreal - Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Skin Re-Smoother Serum mostly to minimize my pores but what I found out it does for me is keep in check my oil production. Who-Hoo! I have been very pleasantly surprised that I barely have any oil buildup on my forehead now, a little around the base of my nose. I probably could dab a bit of Smashbox&#x27;s anti-shine there! But not a big deal now because I am so much better!  The L&#x27;Oreal - Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Skin Re-Smoother Serum has a med thick creamy constancy, not runny. The bottle is a nice pump that pumps out just a little at a time, unlike some pumpers that makes you waste product. I just wish it had a see through window/line that lets you know how much is left. I wash my face or rewet it and I apply a small amount. A little is all you need. I feel a small tingle for a couple of seconds then my face is tighter and smoother feeling - all day too! It helps a little with lines - but just minimum/fine - so don&#x27;t count on it as a big line eraser. If you have dry skin you defiantly will need to moisturize. I do moisturize at night as I don&#x27;t care if I get oily then. In the colder few days here in the Fl winter I may have to apply a moisturizer.  I have been using it now for almost a year and have had no break outs or allergic reactions to it. I&#x27;m 50 a non sunbather with very little wrinkles (PTL) but I have oily skin, slightly sensitive.  During the day I use a face sunscreen and sometimes the too faced liquid primer, then I apply my base, Clinique Redness Solutions in #3 Ivory (Medium+ Coverage - slight yellow based, most lt-med shades out there are too pink) and then over that I dust with Too Faced Primed &amp; Poreless Skin Smoothing Priming Powder &amp; Finishing veil (more oil control &amp; smoothing) and I am look&#x27;n good - all day! (I also apply eye make up of course &amp; Too Faced bronzer sometimes)  I defiantly recommend the L&#x27;Oreal - Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Skin Re-Smoother Serum, if your skin is not sensitive to any of the ingredients this is a product that works. Just don&#x27;t count on it as a big wrinkle fixer or give you any moisturizing. It&#x27;s a treatment type product and you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot for it to work either.  I hope L&#x27;oreal keeps making this! It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 6 months now and my skin has improved a lot.  I am sorry that it is not available in the stores but am glad I can still order on line. This is my favorite product.</li>
            <li> For a person with allergies, this has an extremely strong fragrance. I don&#x27;t see a difference in my pores yet, but I&#x27;ve been only using it for 2 days. I was disappointed to find the coupon enclosed had an expiration date of 2009, so this \\&quot;new\\&quot; product must be at least 3 years old. I&#x27;ve tried many pore minimizing products and so for Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle is the best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have large pores, but sometimes in the summer, my pores will look bigger because of all the sweat from the heat and we all know what that leads to: clogged pores.  This summer was no exception.  I picked up this product at my local drugstore with little to no expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised.     I really liked this product because one bottle has lasted me forever, and I use it daily.  Only two pumps, at most, are needed per application.  I use it as directed on the bottle: On clean skin and moisturize afterwards.  However, I feel that sometimes when it is extra hot and humid out, the moisturizing step is not necessary because it feels as though this product does a good enough job of moisturizing.  Still, I do not recommend anyone skip the moisturizing step -- just because your skin feels soft, smooth, and moisturized doesn&#x27;t mean it necessarily is!      It is not a miracle product, but it really does a good job.  I have used this product for about a month now, and my pores look extremely visibly smaller, even though they weren&#x27;t very noticeable to anyone except myself to begin with.  I have noticed less clogging in my pores, and my skin is overall healthier.  I have also experienced far fewer breakouts during the time of the month when my hormones go nuts.</li>
            <li> overnight my pores disappear!</li>
            <li> Should be called a Pore Clogger not a Pore Minimizer! I haven&#x27;t broken out this bad since high school. I&#x27;m still trying to get the acne to go away. Needless to say this product went into the trash. I should have know that the price was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> Sorry to have to say this product failed me in two ways; right out of the package the pumping mechanism did not work. I prided the top off and had to dip my finger into the cream.  I rubbed the solution on my cheeks and nose and waited for the cream to minimize my pores as promised. It did not happen.  I&#x27;m going to stick with Clinique pore minimizer it does work.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Loreal cream for a couple of weeks, &amp; I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. :(</li>
            <li> I just received this product today. I tried to use it, but lo and behold, nothing would come out! How strange! So I open it up and I discover that the tube connecting to the pump is completely missing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately it&#x27;s fairly easy to open it up and I can still use the product, but I found that pretty strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product feels nice on my face and it has a nice but not over powering scent, but I can&#x27;t speak towards the effects as I have only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> This is great to apply on before makeup so your foundation or bb cream spreads easily on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin where my cheeks can be really dry and without this my makeup looks very powdery and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used MANY products over the years, at every price range, that claim to minimize pores and resurface skin.  This is the first one that has achieved really noticeable results, bar none.  My skin feels smoother and pores look tighter, even when I see them magnified in my makeup mirror!  Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and have seen a difference in my \\&quot;stress lines\\&quot; and wrinkles on my 29 year old face. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, nor does it irritate it like many other products.     I&#x27;ve noticed it works better just after I&#x27;ve gotten out of the shower. If used in the AM before applying makeup it tends to make my face seem a little oily, so I suggest using it in the evening.     This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve always had visible pores, and since having children, my skin has broken out more and been more sensitive.  This product hasn&#x27;t caused any problems, in fact, my skin is much better when I use it consistently.  I only use it in the morning (I use Oil of Olay 7-1 Anti-aging serum at night), before I put on moisturizer.  It makes my skin feel super smooth and does help my pores look smaller.  I only gave it 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t a miracle serum (so don&#x27;t expect your face to look perfectly poreless), but it does make a visible difference, the pump does get clogged sometimes and it&#x27;s hard to get it out (you have to tap it on the counter a few times before you push the pump), and the cost is a little high for how much you get.  Works great with the Pore Minimizing Gel Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to assist in minimizing some pores on each side of my nose which have cropped up in the past year.  The lotion has absolutely helped to make my skin look smoother in the troubled areas. It worked instantly.  The only drawback is that the pump does not work at all. I had to remove the top of the mechanism and use my finger to extract the lotion.  While the pump is awful, I would defintiely by this product again for its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a seller through Amazon. The product I received was over 5 years old! However I know that is not this products fault, maybe it does work? It just didn&#x27;t work for me and I&#x27;m assuming it is because of how old the \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; one I received was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week or two - right on my T-zone, and on top of the Booster Serum.  It made my foundation slick and goopy, so I was just using it at night.  Okay at first....then it started to sting a bit (hey, I figured it was working), then 2 nights ago...OOOOOWWW! Got up to look in the mirror and my entire T-zone looked cooked! Washed it off, and everything was fine.  Last night, I applied just the Booster Serum, and all was well again. Note - I do not have sensitive skin!  Yikes!</li>
            <li> The package was like new. It arrived very fast. I am happy with my purchase. I noticed visible results after using continually for 2 weeks(African-American skin). I definitely intend to reorder as soon as the bottle runs out</li>
            <li> This does work. I have used it almost 2 months and it has helped greatly with my pore size. But I have found a way to make it work even better. I mix 2 pumps of this with an equal amount of 10% AHA and use it morning and evening on face and throat/chest after cleansing. It works better for me this way. My pores and fine lines are so much improved , I can hardly believe it when I look in the mirror. Please L&#x27;Oreal do not stop making this. I have searched high and low for something that really shows results , and this does. I give this a 10!</li>
            <li> I found there to be a very strong fragrance to this product. The smell was so bad I had to wash this off my face within 30 minutes of applying. I have no idea if this minimizes pores or not as I could not use it more than one time. What a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I do not generally use these types of products. The farthest I&#x27;ve usually gone is to use a gentle cream-cleanser am and pm and then MAYBE (if my skin is feeling dry) a mild face-lotion. I&#x27;ve never liked the serums, the roll-on mumbo-jumbo, mostly because (lets get real) it&#x27;s just a fancy container.  Then I discovered this product;  It&#x27;s truly perfect. It has noticeably reduced the size and appearance of my pores, and unlike almost every other serum/lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, it doesn&#x27;t ever leave my skin feeling greasy - quite the opposite. My skin feels so soft, and so silky, that it&#x27;s hard NOT to touch, thought I try since that&#x27;s never good for your skin :p  I&#x27;ve always hated wearing make-up (like foundation, concealer, etc.) because it feels gross, and you can literally feel it clog up your pores. But then, when I get a pimple or a blemish, I almost can&#x27;t stand to NOT wear SOMETHING because it always looks so obvious on my otherwise clear-skin. And THATS what makes this product so perfect! Not only does it reduce the size of your pores, and give your skin a healthier more even tone in the long-run, it&#x27;s also amazing in the short term! Just a minute or two after you apply it, when it dries, the product actually seems to \\&quot;cover\\&quot; and \\&quot;fade\\&quot; any blemishes you currently have!   I&#x27;m totally addicted to this product, use it morning and night. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it, and I certainly never wish to do so again! If L&#x27;Oreal stopped making it, I would be distraught! That&#x27;s how amazing this stuff is. Not only does it truly help with your pore size in the long-term, it&#x27;s the first PERFECT PRODUCT I&#x27;ve ever found in my life - no complaints, whatsoever!   I read one other review where the person mentioned that the bottle would clog or something, and then feel like it was empty when it wasn&#x27;t? Well, the product itself is very light, so the bottle kind of feels empty to begin with. And as long as you \\&quot;close\\&quot; the bottle once you&#x27;ve applied it, the pump does NOT clog! You don&#x27;t need more than 2 to 3 pumps to cover your whole face, a very small amount - if you apply it too thickly it&#x27;ll actually feel too thick as it dries, so you&#x27;ll know; it&#x27;s not hard to figure out your \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; amount. To \\&quot;close\\&quot; it (there&#x27;s no actual \\&quot;lid\\&quot;) you simply twist the top of the tube (the white part, the lip of the dispenser)in the direction the arrow indicates. As long as you aren&#x27;t leaving it open, it won&#x27;t clog - never been a problem for me and I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle, been using it for around 7 months now.  I don&#x27;t plan to ever stop - I hope I don&#x27;t ever have to.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have used for a couple years, but Loreal has apparently discontinued it.  I have been able to purchase it on Amazon for a greatly reduced price - including shipping - and it has arrived well-packed within the expected timeframe.  I would definitely purchase from this dealer again.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to the hot and humid Florida, and the weather has made my pores more visible, especially on my nose and cheeks. I looked at some other pore-minizing treatments as well (from Sephora), and though the reviews consistently reflected that the product worked, I just didn&#x27;t want to shell out $100. SO, I chose this because even if it really didn&#x27;t work, it didn&#x27;t hurt my wallet too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the lotion is perfumey, but that&#x27;s L&#x27;Oreal, may not be good for people with sensitive nose. At first I applied this lotion on my T-zone, my nose, and my cheeks, then I started noticing that my forehead started itching, with lil red spots. So I stopped applying it to my forehead and just focused on my nose and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, 2 weeks later, although my pores are still visible, I do feel that my skin has become smoother, softer, and the pores are slightly smaller than before, and the area I used don&#x27;t get as greasy. So I&#x27;ll keep using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I also started using a different/lighter moisturizer that&#x27;s SPF-free for evening, and moisturizes without feeling heavy/greasy.</li>
            <li> This is no gimmick I have noticed I am starting to get enlarged pores for the last year literally \\&quot;out of no where\\&quot;.  I really don&#x27;t know where they came from but I believe my enlarged pores have emerged due to years of wearing make-up, genetics, etc.  But what I do know about this product is that at first I was very skeptical but I was at the supermarket isle looking for a particular product to smooth out my skin complexion when I came across this.  I am sooooo happy that I had a \\&quot;little faith\\&quot; to give it a try because \\&quot;IT WORKED\\&quot;.  I have used other pore minimizing products in the past, like dr brandt which was very expensive and yielded no difference in the appearance of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using skin genesis my pores are smaller and less noticeable it also serves as a very light weight moisturizer, I only have to use it once a day....It is not greasy or filmy..... never broke my skin out.  The results are achieved almost instantly, you don&#x27;t have to use it for a month to see a difference.  i often get breakouts but not with this product.  i felt compelled to  write a review.....I recommend to use this with a very good facial scrub product....LOVE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find product in stores. Glad I was able to order it. Thought I don&#x27;t remember to use it daily, when I do, I really like the way my skin feels after using it. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this pore minimizing cream(lotion?) for about 1 month.  I am a 49 year old women. I don&#x27;t have a big pore problem but I can see my pores on my nose in my magnifying mirror. I wanted to diminish them. I have not seen any difference at all in my pores since using this cream.    That said, I think this cream goes on really well. It is very light and absorbs into my skin immediately ( the texture is like the original Oil of Olay lotions )and it smells so good. It makes my skin feel smooth. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it to minimize my pores but it is a nice light lotion.</li>
            <li> Is this product the best? No. You can definitely take a trip to Sephora and spend $35 for a better product. That said, I have yet to find a better inexpensive pore-minimizing face cream. I have pretty large pores on my nose that were always prominent, but this cream has definitely diminished them. I&#x27;m usually skeptical about these products, but I was happily surprised this time.</li>
            <li> When I start using l&#x27;oreal skin genesis pore minimizing gel cleanser, I was surprised by its usage. It works like, constantly, so I decided to buy another item in the same line. And I bought this item, and it works too! However, the company should consider selling something newer since the coupon I got along with the container is said to be expired by 2009 December 31st. Like wth? Anyway, it still works so I think I&#x27;m still using it...</li>
            <li> I have always been extreeeeemely skeptical of any products like this, because there are literally hundreds of them when you walk into that intimidating section of the store for skin-care items. It always seemed like a lot of bull to me but I have always had pores that approximately resemble potholes in size... I&#x27;m 25 but my skin always looked sort of loose and tired to me. So I figured why not... and this stuff actually seems to work. I\\&quot;ve been using it for about a month now, and not only does it not irritate my \\&quot;everything makes me break out\\&quot; skin, but it actually reduced the appearance of my pores. I caught my reflection in a mirror the other day and for the first time in years I was actually pleasantly surprised by the appearance of my skin.  So if you have pores that kind of embarrass you this is worth a shot, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on January and I just ran out about 4 weeks ago. I used this pore minimizer at night because in the mornings I tend to wake up with the most oily skin ever (for some reason) but when I used this product on my face I saw a drastic change on my face. My face was not getting clogged by the oil it produces and as a result I wasn&#x27;t breaking out!!! I finally found a product that has worked to get rid of my acne on my forehead which i get because of how much oil I produce there. I love this product so much! I wish i could buy this again but I will have to wait a few more weeks to purchase this because I&#x27;m 18 now and my parents are making me pay for my own stuff now lol but when i start working I will never live without this product ever again!! I recommend this to anyone who breaks out because of oily skin.</li>
            <li> Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described. Thanks a million.</li>
            <li> This product instantly makes my pores look smaller.  I would have given 5 stars if there was more of it in the tube.  It evens out skin tone and is truly the only product to make my pores look smaller.  I&#x27;m in desperate need of a gylcolic peel but cannot afford it currently.  This product is the next best thing.  It makes my skin smell nice and feel like silk.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Loreal Skin Genesis Pore for over a year and have noticed that it really does minimize pores!  I am faithful with twice daily applications and have recommended  this product to my two daughters!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully minimizes pores. Love it! Love it! Love it! I use it under make up and it makes such a difference, my skin looks flawless, like a baby skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to just dry out your skin, but for the price I guess I got what I paid for</li>
            <li> I have been useing  Loreal Skin Genesis  for years. I have very large pore&#x27;s and this product works  so well. I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out from it and it leaves your face feeling soft. Were I  live they stopped getting it in all the store&#x27;s in my area, so I went to Amazon.com and behold; they have it.  The best thing about it is it cost me less to buy it here including the shipping, then it did out of the store.  Love this Product, and Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week and there is a HUGE difference in the texture of my skin.  It is smoother and pores are smaller..it is even softening wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Pros:     I won&#x27;t claim this to be a miracle worker for my pores; this single product doesn&#x27;t take care of all my pore problems by itself. But it&#x27;s a great addition to my skincare routine and it does help with pores. It says you should put on a moisturizer afterwards, but it makes my skin feel so smoooooth so I often skip the moisturizer, usually on accident. I LOVE how this makes my skin feel after just one use. The texture of my skin feels so youthful. You also can&#x27;t even feel it on your skin which is another bonus.    Cons:     The container it comes in looks cool, but it&#x27;s a joke: this cream is a little thick and it often clogs the pump. The pump also doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom of the bottle, and considering this is only 1 oz of of cream, it begins to feel empty after just a few days of use. Perhaps I use it too generously. If you think it is empty, before you throw it out, make sure you crack the lid off (it wasn&#x27;t made to come off) because you may have a lot left. You can&#x27;t tell by the weight of the container how much you may have left at any given time. With that said, I wish this stuff did last longer. I love this stuff so much and use it so regularly that I find I have to buy a new bottle about every month when many of my other beauty products will often last longer.</li>
            <li> its a nice moisturizer. i cant tell if it minimizes my pores though.. i dont think it does. maybe you should scrub once a week and then use this product.</li>
            <li> i bought this based on the reviews.  it is a great product.  very pleased. smoothed out skin, still have visible pores but my skin looks smoother and silkier.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just a mask for your pores and will actually rub off into little rolls if you put on even a dab too much. It&#x27;s like \\&quot;Blur\\&quot;...  It has no actual effect on the pores.  I bought two Neutrogena Skin Primers and they do the same sort of thing only better.  One has a touch of color and one is for oilier skin and similar to this L&#x27;Oreal product.  I use both and like them a lot, particularly the one with color.  I don&#x27;t even use foundation over it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT .. I HAVE ORDERED IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.. AS SOON AS I PUT IT ON MY FACE ITS LIKE MY FACE IS SAYING.. OHH THANK YOU.. IT FEELS THAT GOOD!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It mattifies my oily skin and shrinks my pores.  It also clears my complexion of blemishes.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works okay . It gives a matte finish and I unfortunately haven&#x27;t experience a significant decrease in pore size . Yet I must admits if used in conjunction with a pore less face primer and flawless finish powder .Im able to achieve a more flawless look for most of the day.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice. I like it. The product itself is ok. It reduces my oil production a bit. But in terms reducing the appearance of pores--it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job with that. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes since I started using it 2 months ago. The bottle also doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast the smell of this stuff is AMAZING and i could tell after the first day of use that my pores were smaller. now after a week my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft, supple and poreless. I would recommend this product to all of my friends! Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> This works okay but it is definitely not worth the price! There is so little in a bottle! And my pump was broken when I received it so I ad to pop it off and just go straight from the jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have never paid more than $8 per bottle! Shop around! This is highway robbery. You are not Ebay, Amazon. You used to be on the side of the consumer but lately are letting the retailer get away with stealing the hard earned money of your customers!  Any unwary consumer will read all the wonderful reviews and then PAY $25 for an OUNCE! Not cool, Amazon. IF L&#x27;Oreal did rais the price to $20 an ounce then why? Used to be $5ish a bottle OTC.  So tired of getting ripped off. Sigh...</li>
            <li> I like the product alot. But... the product didn&#x27;t come with the inner straw that makes the pump work. I had to open it up and have been digging out with my finger:( hopefully the next one i buy Isent like this:/</li>
            <li> I see a very clear difference when I use this product. My skin lightens and tightens visibly within a few days. When I go without it, my skin regresses. Very powerful!</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle cream like I have read, but it does work better than anything else I have used.  I have oily skin and large pores and I have had no luck finding a product that I could use every day without becoming an oil slick and then I found this.  It takes very little, feels good on my face, lays a good base for my foundation and never makes me oily.  I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product yesterday so have only used it twice but here is what I think...    This product works for me!!  I am 41 and have always had larger pores on my nostrils.  I also have very oily skin.  Even on my first application, I applied a thin layer over my whole face and noticed the pores on my nose were already definitely smaller.  I also liked the matte finish and oil control.  My skin looked smoother and more even toned.  I put my moisturizer on over this and that also seemed to blend in nicely.  This product definitely does what it says it does and I am hooked!</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than spackle.  It only makes my pores look slightly smaller, and feels like it is actually clogging them. My forehead broke out after 3 days of use. The results are not worth the price, the clogging, or the dulling effect. The daily serum produces better, brighter results as a base without the spackle feel. Layering the two together felt even worse, especially with a 3rd layer of moisturizer, so don&#x27;t even bother with that idea.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily under moisturizer and have noticed a difference in my pore size and skin smoothness. Great product!</li>
            <li> The product smells nice but it doesn&#x27;t do its job. I have used pore minimizers before (Estee Lauder&#x27;s pore minimizing serum, witch hazel, nose strips, etc.), yet this one did very little to reduce pore size. Also, it dries really quickly and if you rub your skin, the lotion actually clumps up and rubs off. It&#x27;s really gross and feels heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> I do not know if this product was good or not, because I was not able to use it. WHY?, Well I received it with a broken cap and half way empty. It was also dried up.</li>
            <li> THIS PORE MINIMISER DOES EXACTLY TAT!  AFTER ABOUT 1 1/2 WEEKS TIME, MY PORES  &#x27;SHRUNK&#x27; IN SIZE.  GREAT PRODUCT, THAT I TRULY RECOMMEND.  TY L&#x27;OREAL!</li>
            <li> Why do cosmetics manufacturers put scent in their products?  I threw this away as the scent was awful.  Use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy using it. I don&#x27;t see a change.</li>
            <li> It is magic for my oily skin with large pore around the nose. AND! IT HAS BEEN THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT HAS PUT MY ROSACEA COMPLETLY UNDER CONTROL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to write to the company about this. After one month my swollen , red oily nose is completely normal looking. I apply the product morning and night, let it dry and then apply my L&#x27;Oreal mousse foundation. It looks incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not discontinue this product. I was very depressed about my Rosacea and using this has made all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!!  I would be glad to recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Helen J MacDonald</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really seem to make an effect on my pores...</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  It seems to leave a fine layer on your skin that disguises and covers pores.  Your skin will have a bit of a matte appearance after it dries.  Make up goes on well over it.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does exactly what it claims to do.People like me with porous skin are always battling for that beautiful skin our friends have.I can truly say that this product comes the closest to that look without having to go through a medical procedure.If applied before make-up it positively gives the skin a smooth even appearance.And with that comes a new found confidence.I recommend this product for male or female of all ages that suffer porous skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I saw any changes with this product either. I used it until it was gone. Would I order it again? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It does make my pores smaller and my skin super smooth.  I am on my second bottle.  The price is so affordable and it does what it says it will do!  I highly recommend this prodect!</li>
            <li> Love this product but it had been discontinued. Works wonderful for pricky, sensitive, and oil prone skin. Best moisturizer I have used.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and texture of the product.  Shipment was made overnight and payment is so simple with no filling out of timely registrations after first purchase.</li>
            <li> The Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing is great! I bought this product because of the raving reviews I read. So I decided to try it myself. It works, it is the best I have ever tried. It smooths and closes pores and stays on so it does not fade away. Easy to use.  I just wish it was available at one of the stores close by. Thank you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference when using this pore minimizing cream. Additionally, it leaves a film on my face, which can be seen if it is not aggressively rubbed in. Overall, I would not recommend this product :(</li>
            <li> The pump does not dispense product. I think they sent me an empty container.</li>
            <li> I was embarrassed when my sister called me out on mny pores -- i didn&#x27;t reaized it was so bad till i bought this item-- wow in two weeks, i can tell my face looks younger and tighter.  My skin looked young -- i will buy more of this item&lt;br /&gt;Reena Smiles</li>
            <li> Really hoped this product would work but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t bother if I were you.</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews and was excited to find an over the counter product that had such a high success rate for achieving smoother skin.  The problem is when it arrived, my first suspicion was the CVS sticker on it. The next was the old coupon in the box that expired in 2009 when it&#x27;s mid 2012!  That made me wonder if the product was expired itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find the expiration date ANYWHERE on the box or on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it anyway, it seemed a little dried up (probably because it was expired) but managed to get a couple small clumps.  The fragrance was nice but a bit too strong and lingered longer than I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I returned this, so I can&#x27;t give long term results.  But this is a review on my first few uses and the experience of receiving.  I will continue looking for another product.</li>
            <li> The price was awesome compared to what I paid when I used to be able to find it at Walgreens</li>
            <li> This is a great product to be applied before you moisturize!  Leave&#x27;s the face with a smooth flawless look</li>
            <li> (I forgot about this account of mine since last christmas time so i apologize for doing a review 1 year old! Even with this being i said i can still say with 100% confidence THIS ITEM WAS SHIPPED FAST and WAS EXACTLY AS THE PICTURE and DESCRIPTION showed --- AS WELL as I LOVED THE product which let me say I HAVE USED A LOT OF SKIN CARE RELATED CREAMS &amp; PRODUCTS: This works great to minimize pores BUT EVEN MORE SO making a general clear up of my face without getting flakey skin, drying out, or irritation that typical acne lines/products cause!! Would deff try for anyone young or old for overall skin care, clarity, upkeep or one timers! THANK YOU again &amp; will not only recommend but most deff purchase from again! TYSM!!!! HAPPY HOLIDAYS &amp; NEW YEAR!</li>
            <li> It does what it says, great product. I will order it again. Great price too. What more can I say, if I was too keep talking about it then I wouldn&#x27;t have anything too talk about</li>
            <li> OVER ALL MY FACE IS MORE FIRM AM SOW PLEASE.&lt;br /&gt;IT VERY GOOD PRODUCT IF ALL YOU WANT IS TO REDUCE YOUR PORES...</li>
            <li> I like it, not sure if I notice smaller pores, but it is refreshing and softening to my skin, I used as needed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but when there is a product I repurchase, I actually will take the time to.  I don&#x27;t really like moisturizers because they are heavy and make me break out. With that said, being over 40 I wanted something to smooth my skin and reduce my pores. This product works! My skin is much more smoother and even toned, and even though my pores are not like when I was 20...they have shrunk and I look much better and refreshed. If you are looking for a product for pore reduction and smoother skin, and have realistic expectations, I would suggest you try this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, ladies, listen up. I have finally found the miracle product! If you have oily skin, large pores and an uneven texture, this is for you. I just received this product 2 days ago, and I have already seen a difference!! I am 56 years old, and have tried every pore minimizer on the market. I have spent a fortune on products and would have never thought a \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; item would do the trick. My skin looks so smooth after using this, I just can&#x27;t believe it! My pores look like they have been airbrushed right out of my face! I was reading a review on Yahoo the other day, and this product was recommended. I had trouble finding it in the stores, so I hoped Amazon would have it. And once again, they have not let me down! Give this product a try. I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
            <li> the product was brand new in the box, but when i opened it, there was a coupon in there that expired about 3 years ago, so  the cream must be about 3 years old</li>
            <li> Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing packagings had been opened, one of them has only 1/3 content left.it sucks!!I have already returned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 23 but I&#x27;m already concerned about the size of my pores. I have noticed that the pores on my cheeks near my nose are bigger than I&#x27;d like so I searched Amazon and this seemed like a great product. I already use L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code as part of my skin regimen so I figured another L&#x27;Oreal product would be a good place to start. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks [in combination with Origins Clear Improvement Mask] and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the size of my pores. I highly recommend using this product. Since I only use this product on the areas I&#x27;m targeting [which is not a large area], it seems that this bottle will last me a while. [I would like to let people know that I purchased mine from DailyCheckout, not &#x27;my trading&#x27;]</li>
            <li> Works great on reducing pores. I wish it was still on the market. I do not know if it has been replaced with a newer product.</li>
            <li> I am 17 and have battled with shiny skin for a few years now. My pores have also gotten much larger, so I was looking for a product to reduce the size of my pores. This products really didn&#x27;t do much to help the appearance of my pores, it would work for maybe the first 15 minutes of wearing it, but then my pores looked just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER this product was marvelous at reducing shine. All products that I have tried before that claim to keep skin matte all day long--and they never work. My skin always ended up looking the same if not more shiny by the end of the day. After this product, my skin stays matte all day long and I no longer have to apply powder throughout the day. Thank you for this product, I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It goes on smooth not greasy. And I see a difference within a couple of days</li>
            <li> Noticed no difference in my pore size using this.  A very famous make up artist in LA recommended it to me, so it may work for someone else.  Just not me.</li>
            <li> This item was so disappointing. I used it for over one month and literally there is no change on my pores. However, it has a good smell that is something good I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> While I love this item, I was surprised to find a coupon in the box that had an expiration date of 2009. I have no idea the residual quality of the product if it is three or four years old. The box was completely in tact.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my face so soft and tight.  It shouldn&#x27;t be off the market.  Too bad Loreal made a big mistake.  But I&#x27;m glad that amazon is selling it.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on the number of \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; reviews by other Amazon shoppers.  I just got the product this week and I am very impressed so far.  My skin feels noticeably softer and I have hopes that my pores will get a bit less prominent with usage of this over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, Estee Lauder had a skin treatment lotion that came in a cobalt blue pump bottle.  It wasn&#x27;t a huge bottle, but the price was around $65+ - 20 years ago.  I bought it when I could because it made my skin look and feel fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am experiencing a similar sensation with this L&#x27;Oreal product, and I do love the smell of this product too - it actually reminds me of that great Estee Lauder product of long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this L&#x27;Oreal product is doing some pretty great things for my skin - for a pretty great price as well.</li>
            <li> Might work nicely BUT, it contains Cyclohexasiloxane, which is a NASTY, toxic chemical.  When will the U.S. STOP allowing all these poisonous chemicals into our beauty products?!?</li>
            <li> this product did not do anything except block pores ,it is not a treatment or a primer,</li>
            <li> I only used it once because I got a rash all over my face. I think I was allergic to it. Have not tried it again..</li>
            <li> This is my first time using SKin Genesis Pore Minizing. I have seen adiffernce with my pores (smaler) I like that.</li>
            <li> not sure if it made my pores smaller but it did make my skin feel better than before i used it</li>
            <li> It really does minimize my pores.  I use it regularly.  I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who has a problem with large pores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why good products get discontinued all the time!  This Pore minimizer was much more then that!  It kept the only oily part of my face, my forehead (I only used it there), completely matte all day long even on the most hot, humid summer days.  It wasn&#x27;t good for winter as it really isn&#x27;t a moisturizer but I use another product for that, which, sadly yes, has been discontinued as well.  That was a Bliss product.</li>
            <li> I was trying to give this product the benefit of the doubt but I&#x27;ve used it now for over six months and nada. It doesn&#x27;t shrink pores like it says it does, or at least not for me. I would not recommend this product but you&#x27;ll have to be the judge as we all have different skin.</li>
            <li> This product delivers what it says it will do.  If used everyday it works.&lt;br /&gt;My pores look so much better and it only takes a very small amount so it lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was was great.  Thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference whatsoever. I read reviews and people were raving about it so I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. No results on my skin... bummer!</li>
            <li> Useless. You should just buy whipped cream, it&#x27;s cheaper and it will have the exact same effect.</li>
            <li> I use this product primarily on my nose and it does a great job of reducing the size of my pores.  I&#x27;ve tried astringents but they just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything to reduce the appearance of large pores.  This works wonders.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> well, you can see it has a very reasonable price. After I got it , I just used it twice and feel not bad or good</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture- lightweight and good smell. However, I really did not notice any difference after using it.</li>
            <li> I see immediately results with this cream. Very happy will surely buy it again. I use under my makeup can work as a good primer too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and so far I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and has a refreshing feeling. Besides, it does seem to be closing my pores and leaving my skin less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a 2009 expired coupon and there is no expiration date, but the smell and color seem fine, so I am using it.</li>
            <li> this product was out of date</li>
            <li> The cosmetics had expired.\\&quot;General shelf life: 36 months   It looks like your product was manufactured more than 3 years ago\\&quot;That is what I found on [...]</li>
            <li> I have such terrible skin,  and at age 55 I need help of course!  but I get such dry awful areas on my face.  Washed my face, put some on last night, got up this morning, I could see a difference.  So put some on again this morning, put on some primer and then my makeup.  Normally by now, all the bad spots on my face are trying to peel up and look rough,  so far all good, my face feels smooth and not rought.  As far as pores (which is why I bought it)  I will of course will let you know back...and I will, I hate when people say the will write back later...and don&#x27;t!!  But we shall  see folks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok getting back,  I actually have seen a difference in the pore size showing on my nose.....and I am happy about that!  and in a short time too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and prompt delivery.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a larger container and more for the money, but it does the job.  Best thing out there (better than the more pricey stuff).</li>
            <li> I had pretty high hopes for this little tube. The presentation and price are the only reasons this didn&#x27;t get a 1 star rating by the way. The bottle looks sleek and can take a real beating because I&#x27;ve dropped it a lot. Actually using the product is much less pleasant. The smell is very intense. It smells like a mixture of alcohol, hairspray, and old lady perfume. And it doesn&#x27;t dissipate! I continued to smell is for quite a while after the application. I guess I would say it gives a somewhat matte effect. But really the product just makes me look ghost-like and feels like it sits on my skin like a sheet. It also made my blackheads stand out more.....so that&#x27;s not good. I&#x27;m beginning to think I received one of the old, expired ones.</li>
            <li> Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Lotion is an excellent product for my face. It worked as advertised and really improved the look of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My face did begin to dry out after about 3 weeks of daily use, however so I would suggest either using it less frequently or using a moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any product I have ever used and gives me flawless, airbrushed apperance, baby smooth skin. The only downside is after not using it for a while the results Will reverse and bring you back to your normal condition. The good news is you only need about 1 pump a day to keep your results and it last about 4-6 weeks. Making it an additional expense, but one that is affordable and beyond worth it. I have used many products and nothing comes close to this one, it&#x27;s more than just a pore minimizing cream, it&#x27;s a skin perfecter. I&#x27;ve hesitated writing a review on this as it is one of my beauty secrets :)</li>
            <li> This actually does work!!! It really helped my poes not necessarily dimish but make smaller! Love this product and It smells so good!!!!</li>
            <li> To be totally honest, I don&#x27;t really think this does anything to \\&quot;minimize\\&quot; your pores. I give it five stars, though, because it is the only product I have ever found that has kept my face from being a total oil slick. I have probably the most oily skin possible, and every so-called mattifying primer that I&#x27;ve tried has been a total failure, not to mention that almost every primer makes me break out like crazy. This, however, which isn&#x27;t even really a primer or a mattifier, does what nothing else can - it makes my skin look so nice that I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation. AND it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, because it&#x27;s a holy grail, it&#x27;s been discontinued. So if you have insanely oily skin like I do, I recommend you try it before it becomes impossible to find.</li>
            <li> I purchased this facial lotion several times and then suddenly wasn&#x27;t able to find it in any of my local stores. For anyone who has large pores, or acne scars, this product fills and gives skin a smooth appearance under make-up. It&#x27;s non-oily and fast drying. The price was good, it was delivered quickly.</li>
