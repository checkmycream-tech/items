            <li>After receiving it, I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>

            <li>Lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Glad to have the sample size to try before committing to full size</li>
            <li>It not too strong and not too light</li>
            <li>a sample&lt;br /&gt;it says on the bottom of the box, FREE SAMPLE NOT FOR RESALE.  </li>
            <li>This is the first perfume I have purchased in more than three years.  </li>
            <li>if you liked the sample card, you will love the actual perfume.  </li>
            <li>IT smells clean and somewhat sweet -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, clean and not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>This very well could be my new favorite!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>However, when I first got a whiff of this perfume from an ad in a magazine, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li>It exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I first smelled Bottega Veneta from a sample in Vogue.</li>
            <li>you are going on a first date or are in need of a lil somethin&#x27; somethin&#x27; from your man.....</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this perfume</li>
            <li>The aroma is wonderful--not heavy, but very lingering and pleasant to all when I am wearing this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>How much fun it is to find a new &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent!</li>
            <li>This was a magazine foldout sample, and I usually ignore those, but the soft breath of this beautiful scent happened to drift out of the sample as I turned the page, and I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.  </li>
            <li>I received the product very promptly.  </li>
            <li>I tried this from an insert in a magazine at my salon, and I really wanted it.  </li>
            <li>Very calming.</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely enchanted with it.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried it I thought it was old</li>
            <li>It suits my particular set of senses like it was made for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the funds for the larger bottle, so this size was just right, and travel-friendly as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing a larger bottle, as this beautiful small one will not last long.</li>
            <li>and it had that old, kept smell to it.  </li>
            <li>It has just a few simple layers, and warms up a bit after a few minutes, but is wholly feminine and flirty, but not silly or trendy.  </li>
            <li>It was expensive, so I was hesitant to order it without really knowing for sure what it would smell like on me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it seems to last a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected!!!</li>

            <li> I worked for an organization that would not allow you to use perfume so I have gotten use to it.  However, when I first got a whiff of this perfume from an ad in a magazine, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  This is the first perfume I have purchased in more than three years.  I get so many compliments when I wear it.  It&#x27;s a fresh, clean and not overpowering at all.  I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
            <li> Fast service.  Great price for the size.</li>

            <li> It was exactly what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> I received the product very promptly.  It is as described.  I tried this from an insert in a magazine at my salon, and I really wanted it.  I didn&#x27;t have the funds for the larger bottle, so this size was just right, and travel-friendly as well.</li>
            <li> gorgeous scent, shipped in 2days. will purchase larger size!!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! Smells subdued but sensual. When you move after a couple of hours you get a wiff of the fragrance lingering. Very calming.</li>
            <li> Really loved it when compared with others we have tried.  Glad to have the sample size to try before committing to full size</li>
            <li> It exactly what I wanted and I love it.  It not too strong and not too light and I plan to always keep a supply.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it I thought it was old and it had that old, kept smell to it.  I thought it would be lighter.  The only thing I am glad about is that I didn&#x27;t buy a regular bottle as it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> I first smelled Bottega Veneta from a sample in Vogue. I looked for the perfume everywhere but could only find it online. It was expensive, so I was hesitant to order it without really knowing for sure what it would smell like on me.  After receiving it, I&#x27;m so glad I did.  IT smells clean and somewhat sweet - if you liked the sample card, you will love the actual perfume.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it seems to last a decent amount of time.  More importantly, my boyfriend liked it too.  This very well could be my new favorite!</li>
            <li> This perfume is ORGASMIC!!&lt;br /&gt;If you are going on a first date or are in need of a lil somethin&#x27; somethin&#x27; from your man..... Buy this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> No fragrance, until now, has compelled me to add to my very few absolute favorites.  This was a magazine foldout sample, and I usually ignore those, but the soft breath of this beautiful scent happened to drift out of the sample as I turned the page, and I was hooked.  It suits my particular set of senses like it was made for me. I haven&#x27;t purchased a different scent in years, and usually wear Estee Lauder Private Collection, or 4711...preferring green backgrounds with subtle florals or citrus.  I don&#x27;t know what combination was used for this one, but I can&#x27;t pass by without lifting the lid off the bottle for a whiff. It has just a few simple layers, and warms up a bit after a few minutes, but is wholly feminine and flirty, but not silly or trendy.  I&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing a larger bottle, as this beautiful small one will not last long. How much fun it is to find a new &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent!</li>
            <li> the fragrance  itself  is very very  light  no fragrance, I paid fifty dollars for a sample&lt;br /&gt;it says on the bottom of the box, FREE SAMPLE NOT FOR RESALE.  I GOT THE VERY SAME FOR FREE&lt;br /&gt;AT I NEIMAN MARCUS  when  I purchased Boucheron,&lt;br /&gt;I intend to call the company and ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> Itty bitty and perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent. SO happy to find this in travel size. Never, ever fail to get compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this scent. I am constantly writing down the name of this fragrance for people who want to try it.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this perfume and I am absolutely enchanted with it.  The aroma is wonderful--not heavy, but very lingering and pleasant to all when I am wearing this fragrance.  Well worth the money.</li>
