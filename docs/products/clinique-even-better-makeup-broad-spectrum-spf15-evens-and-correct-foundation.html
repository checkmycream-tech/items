            <li> really nice make-up, covers nicely, spreads easily, I do put lotion or cream on first.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this make up. I would choose one shade lighter though. However, the summer is coming up and will probably correct this problem.</li>
            <li> This is great make up. Nice color, great coverage and my skin is clear and feels good. I love being able to order it online.  highly recommended.</li>

            <li> I use this exclusively !!! The best coverage. It totally evens out skin color. Not oily. Stays on. I order a  shade darker for the summer.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much I liked it. Have been using Dior and this really is just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I hsve senditive eyes and it really burns. Need to use separste product by eyes. Need to check out what is in it so problem doesn&#x27;t occur.</li>
            <li> love this makeup, have bought the last 3 times and will continue too- skin tone has improved in my opinion Thanks!</li>
            <li> Gives me smooth coverage without caking, streaking, or settling.  Doesn&#x27;t result in a heavy, overly made up appearance.  After application, skin has an even tone; product isn&#x27;t greasy or drying.  Have used this product for several years and really like it.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy this at the store, but glad to see it here. Made it much easier to purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin love it and will not use any other product. Lorial and maybe-line give me out breaks so i love this one and you need only a little so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be beat.. .love it</li>
            <li> I really like this makeup.  My teenage daughter was borrowing from me so bought her some for herself. It doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Clinique is a brand you can always trust. This makeup doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking shiny, and hides all of those slight imperfections</li>
            <li> Since i found this makeup i keep ordering it . It is very light weight if you have normal to oily skin. evens out skin tone in a natural way  and very smooth looking . Last for very long hours. I even exercise with it sometimes and it never clogged my pores . Amazing !</li>
            <li> this makeup has really helped my face clear up from my dark marks, I also use the even better moisturizer, great combo</li>
            <li> Love it! Covers well, and not heavy. I definitely will purchase again. Will purchase a shade darker for the summer.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and I she would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it for years. It has good coverage for unevenly colored skin.  It looks like you&#x27;re wearing make up.  It&#x27;s not invisible, but there a time for that when you need to even out the color.  It&#x27;s not the invisible look for young people, but it&#x27;s not painted on looking either.</li>
            <li> This has been my makeup for many years. Love it.</li>
            <li> Fairly good foundation.....many colors to pick from.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
