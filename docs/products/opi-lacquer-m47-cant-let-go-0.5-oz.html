            <li>I love the shade of purple</li>
            <li>I LOVE this polish...</li>
            <li>I love purple</li>
            <li>and I love glitter</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use a top coat.</li>
            <li>I used this twice now since I received it and love my nails.</li>
            <li>I love the color and texture.</li>
            <li>When I wear this polish, I can&#x27;t stop touching my nails.</li>
            <li>i got so many compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li>Everything from ordering to shipping and receiving was very smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>First, the good.  </li>
            <li>I loved the color of this nail polish and it really does feel like liquid sand!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a darker purple than the one in the picture and not glossy, the texture is fun and it looks nice, it has some glittery shine in there too</li>
            <li>the Liquid Sand effect IS SO COOL!  </li>
            <li>GOES ON EASY</li>
            <li>And I love the full coverage with just two coats.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much already!!</li>
            <li>Its just as pretty as pictured I will be buying more colors &amp; would recommend</li>
            <li>I love this color but there are extra glitter chunks (kind if like sequins) in this liquid sand polish.</li>
            <li>This is a true rich purple shade with the texture of liquid sand.</li>
            <li>TO CHIP.THE WIFE WANTS MORE COLORS NOW.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve absolutely fallen in love with the OPI Liquid Sand polishes.</li>
            <li>I have other sand colors that are great</li>
            <li>This is more purple than blue, but I love the sandy texture.</li>
            <li>The texture was fun though.  </li>
            <li>I would say it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is such a pretty color... if you love purple!</li>
            <li>The purple is just the right intermediate shade and combines a matt finish with the glittery &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The sand in the Polish makes it chip less on your nails, so it lasts longer, which is always good.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly like the picture and as it was described.</li>
            <li>but it is really pretty.</li>
            <li>other than that, get it, its amazing</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this color only because I wanted a more vibrant color.</li>
            <li>The polish literally only takes a minute to dry which was surprising.</li>
            <li>So much bling.  </li>
            <li>It really makes the color explode.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I took it off in 3 weeks but really didn&#x27;t need</li>
            <li>All of that being said, I liked the formula enough to buy a second color.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to remove, not like other glitter polishes that you need sandpaper to get the polish off.</li>
            <li>It does take a little more work to remove it all traces of this polish, but I personally think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a fun color and texture, I constantly get compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty purple too.</li>
            <li>Additionally, because of the rough texture and the large bits of sparkle, removing this polish is time consuming, even with straight acetone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had luck with acetone as well as non-acetone polish removers, both remove it equally as well and as fast</li>
            <li>I use a similar basic purple color first, then the Liquid Sand.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend you follow the directions provided with it about not using clear coats over the final coating.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the sand polishes, but if you don&#x27;t like rough feeling polish, then it isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>the color is a little darker and less shiny than the picture, but other than that it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Normal liquid sand is hard to get off the normal way</li>
            <li>There are good and bad things about this polish.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Usually I abhor glitters because of the difficulty in removing, but this comes off relatively easy with a cotton round and polish remover.</li>
            <li> She loves the purple, and the black has become my new fave shade for the toes...</li>
            <li> to so it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> but when you use the little cup of remover with the sponge in it and let it soak in there for a few seconds, it comes right off.</li>
            <li> A LONG TIME LOOKS</li>
            <li> I apply two coats over a base coat and with some touch-ups (which are very easy with this texture), can make the polish last an entire work week.  </li>
            <li> that the other regular polishes but still lasted 5-6 days.</li>
            <li> I tried both without a topcoat like they recommend and with one, you don&#x27;t loose the texture at all</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to apply it without a base or a top coat, and I am 100% blown away by it&#x27;s lasting power.</li>
            <li> The clear coat is completely unnecessary with how the polish looks and feels after it dries.</li>
            <li> all u haven&#x27;t let me down yet</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to buy the other colors!</li>
            <li> Just another bland dark purple.  </li>
            <li> I got it in purple for my BFF and black for me-</li>
            <li> Actually MUCH less gloss look than pictured-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally had to hand pick off every little sequin to get if off.</li>
            <li> it comes out a little darker than the picture, it is also a pain in the butt to take off too.</li>
            <li> it takes a few coats to get it that color</li>
            <li> I make one small change...</li>
            <li> I am not sure why</li>
            <li> I type all day at work, and usually chip my nails (even with topcoat) within a day, unless I do gels.</li>
            <li> These liquid sand polishes have had lasting power up to a week - and that&#x27;s usually when I get bored with my color and change it...</li>
            <li> (It usually takes me about 10 minutes for both hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now for the bad, the sand texture is rough, and will snag or catch on some fabrics (satin etc).  </li>
            <li> it is extremely hard to take off, so if you are someone who changes their nail polish a lot it is very difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> It took two coats to reach the opacity I wanted (no visible nail line), and this polish is TOUGH!</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t they r wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;Removal isn&#x27;t as difficult as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this color but there are extra glitter chunks (kind if like sequins) in this liquid sand polish. Normal liquid sand is hard to get off the normal way but when you use the little cup of remover with the sponge in it and let it soak in there for a few seconds, it comes right off. This polish however, does not. I&#x27;ve literally had to hand pick off every little sequin to get if off.</li>
            <li> So much bling.  Wow!  I make one small change...I use a similar basic purple color first, then the Liquid Sand.  I do that with all of the LS colors.  It really makes the color explode.  Just did my nails and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> When I got the opi nail polish I used it wright away it was grate if anyone ever tell u it isn&#x27;t they r wrong I love product I get from yall u haven&#x27;t let me down yet</li>
            <li> it comes out a little darker than the picture, it is also a pain in the butt to take off too. but it goes on nicely &amp; still looks good.</li>
            <li> There are good and bad things about this polish.  First, the good.  The sand in the Polish makes it chip less on your nails, so it lasts longer, which is always good.  Now for the bad, the sand texture is rough, and will snag or catch on some fabrics (satin etc).  Additionally, because of the rough texture and the large bits of sparkle, removing this polish is time consuming, even with straight acetone.  All of that being said, I liked the formula enough to buy a second color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to look like the photo but it just was ehhh.  Just another bland dark purple.  The texture was fun though.  I have other sand colors that are great but this one just doesn&#x27;t measure up in my opinion.  I tried both without a topcoat like they recommend and with one, you don&#x27;t loose the texture at all but I do like the added protection from chipping.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this color only because I wanted a more vibrant color.</li>
            <li> This is a great color looks like purple stardust. I have had lots of compliments and people ask me what color and brand polish.</li>
            <li> Both the seller and the item itself were great. I ordered this for my girlfriend after we both took a look at it and it arrived at my house 3 days later. The polish itself has a very nice look to it as well. I would recommend you follow the directions provided with it about not using clear coats over the final coating. The clear coat is completely unnecessary with how the polish looks and feels after it dries.</li>
            <li> This is more purple than blue, but I love the sandy texture. It covers well and lasts without chipping as easily as regular polish.</li>
            <li> I love the color, texture, and how well it stays on! I definitely recommend since it&#x27;s at such a low price!</li>
            <li> I like this purple shade and the glitter/sand make a nice effect.  I love OPI nail polish and this one is a good one.  It did seem to chip easier that the other regular polishes but still lasted 5-6 days.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the sand effect. It glitters nicely.</li>
            <li> feels like sand paper.</li>
            <li> This nail polish looks great - I love the look of the liquid sand.  The purple is just the right intermediate shade and combines a matt finish with the glittery &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; pieces.  I really like the feel of the sand polishes, but if you don&#x27;t like rough feeling polish, then it isn&#x27;t for you.  I apply two coats over a base coat and with some touch-ups (which are very easy with this texture), can make the polish last an entire work week.  It does take a little more work to remove it all traces of this polish, but I personally think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a true rich purple shade with the texture of liquid sand. Wears well and looks amazing! I have received a lot of compliments on this one. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday and I love it so much already!! I love the shade of purple it is and the matte look. I was going to do a topcoat but there is no need. The polish literally only takes a minute to dry which was surprising. And I love the full coverage with just two coats. I would say it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this polish... I got it in purple for my BFF and black for me- the Liquid Sand effect IS SO COOL!  It&#x27;s sparkly without being &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; or glossy... Actually MUCH less gloss look than pictured- they must have used a topcoat.  Mine went on with an overall matte look, BUT matte sparkles, if that makes any sense...  She loves the purple, and the black has become my new fave shade for the toes...</li>
            <li> THE WIFE LOVES THIS STUFF. GOES ON EASY LASTS A LONG TIME LOOKS GREAT!.HARD TO CHIP.THE WIFE WANTS MORE COLORS NOW.</li>
            <li> Love this polish opi has great color and they wear nice. Marich Carey collection has great colors. Everyone should try them.</li>
            <li> I love purple and I love glitter so this was perfect for me. Fast delivery too. You only need 2 coats for this and the color is as shown.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Got here in two days! Also cheaper then going to Target or Ulta for it. The OPI is now $9.00. I paid $7.00 for it. Works awesome. Don&#x27;t use a top coat. Worth the buy. This is an awesome color for the summer. Nice and bright!</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the picture and as it was described. I used this twice now since I received it and love my nails. Everything from ordering to shipping and receiving was very smooth and easy. Five stars!</li>
            <li> I LOVE OPI! I loved the color of this nail polish and it really does feel like liquid sand! I took it off in 3 weeks but really didn&#x27;t need to so it does last a long time. I can&#x27;t wait to buy the other colors!</li>
            <li> it takes a few coats to get it that color but it is really pretty. I like the OPI Mariah Carey Collection. well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a darker purple than the one in the picture and not glossy, the texture is fun and it looks nice, it has some glittery shine in there too but I wish the color was lighter.</li>
            <li> I love the color and texture. Its just as pretty as pictured I will be buying more colors &amp; would recommend</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the color is beautiful.  But, it is not for me.  I am not sure why and it is not the polish - it is a preference.  if you like a different texture, a deep color and something that does stay on your nails try this- liquid sand.</li>
            <li> When I wear this polish, I can&#x27;t stop touching my nails. It&#x27;s such a pretty purple too. Fairly easy to remove, not like other glitter polishes that you need sandpaper to get the polish off. yeah, i love this Liquid Sand collection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve absolutely fallen in love with the OPI Liquid Sand polishes. This gorgeous grape-soda colored purple is no exception. It took two coats to reach the opacity I wanted (no visible nail line), and this polish is TOUGH! You&#x27;re supposed to apply it without a base or a top coat, and I am 100% blown away by it&#x27;s lasting power. I type all day at work, and usually chip my nails (even with topcoat) within a day, unless I do gels. These liquid sand polishes have had lasting power up to a week - and that&#x27;s usually when I get bored with my color and change it... they may even last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal isn&#x27;t as difficult as you&#x27;d expect. Usually I abhor glitters because of the difficulty in removing, but this comes off relatively easy with a cotton round and polish remover. I&#x27;ve had luck with acetone as well as non-acetone polish removers, both remove it equally as well and as fast (It usually takes me about 10 minutes for both hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a fun color and texture, I constantly get compliments on it. I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone&#x27;s collection!</li>
            <li> this nail polish is amazing! it looks beautiful on your nails and looks just like purple liquid sand. i got so many compliments on my nails. the color is a little darker and less shiny than the picture, but other than that it is amazing. it is extremely hard to take off, so if you are someone who changes their nail polish a lot it is very difficult to take off. other than that, get it, its amazing</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty color... if you love purple! I use two coats to get the color I like which is a beautiful bright purple that shimmers in the sunlight.  I love it!</li>
