            <li> These are a great starter set. They smell amazing! They came beautifully packaged, and each bottle is a great size. Since you only use a few drops of oil at a time, these bottles last a very long time. If you&#x27;re on the fence about whether or not to get these, just go for it! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>

            <li> These are fantastic essential oils. It comes with all the most popular ones for you to try and see what&#x27;s your favorite. You only use drops at a time, so this kit will last me forever. I use them in the ZAQ diffuser, which I also bought on Amazon, they work great together.</li>
            <li> I bought these oils for a diffuser-scents are nice but not overpowering. Would buy again. Delivery was quick and product just like the picture&amp;#62; Thanks</li>
            <li> Loved the individual scents, usually there are a bunch of horrible smelling things and then one you like.  Wasn&#x27;t the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oils seemed to be good quality, scents were strong, no need to overuse.  Worked well in my water based air purifier.  Totally would recommend this to aromatherapy enthusiasts!</li>

            <li> I have enjoyed the bottles of oils I have opened.  Each have been a delight to experience.  I did have one bottle that came broken.  I think it weas a very cold day when it was delivered and I believe the package had been dropped.  The box smelled heavenly.  I bet the UPS truck did too.</li>
            <li> oils not as strong as I thought they would be - not such a good value for the price - nice packaging</li>
            <li> great variety and definitely something that works great with your home diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is preferred over chemical ones from the body shop, although they do carry therapeutic grade ones as well at high prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only wish is if this set has more fruit variety, but mixing and matching does the job</li>
            <li> WOW this pack it such a great deal. You get all kinds of great useful oils and you don&#x27;t have to spend $250.00 like with Doterra</li>
