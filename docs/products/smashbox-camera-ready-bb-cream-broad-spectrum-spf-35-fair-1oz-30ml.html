    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Looks like it&#x27;s designed for woman with perfect skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it is spf 35!!!!</li>
            <li>Best foundation on the market.</li>
            <li>What a wonderful product this is.  </li>
            <li>Not having to put moisturizer and primer on is brilliant.  </li>
            <li>Photos are great too.&lt;br /&gt;7.</li>
            <li>This is a great primer.  </li>
            <li>The Fair tone is really fair -</li>
            <li>Good sunscreen power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a BB cream closer to my complexion and this one had good reviews</li>
            <li>I never wear foundation because I&#x27;ve never found one that both feels good and looks good on my combination skin.</li>
            <li>So light and covers great!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s already my favorite product!</li>
            <li>I love that it has SPF in it!</li>
            <li>Although the color was a bit light for my skin tone it still looks great.  </li>
            <li>I tried applying this after moisturizing, but it just didn&#x27;t spread as nicely as the Lab Series, it clumped up on every pore, stubble and skin imperfection.</li>
            <li>When I tried this BB cream, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>Perfect weight and color for my fair, freckled skin (inherited from the Irish side of the family).</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that this product was SPF 35, rather than the lower SPF 15 of the Healthy FX.  </li>
            <li>Very light, almost too light for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light coverage...</li>
            <li>Very smooth and doesn&#x27;t get into all of the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is way better in coverage, look and</li>
            <li>I do it with my fingers and more with patting movements.</li>
            <li>but all in all, it was ok.</li>
            <li>I love smash box.</li>
            <li>Even better makeup and after buying smashbox eyeshadow decided to give this a try...</li>
            <li>Smashbox discontinued their wonderful tinted sheer moisturizer so this was the next best option.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a better product from smashbox.</li>
            <li>I apply it after moisturizing and top with concealer (as needed) and that&#x27;s it -- no powder or anything.</li>
            <li>Price is a bit high, as is the price for most good make up.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use -</li>
            <li>I have no problems with Smashbox BB Cream or their Light Primer.  </li>
            <li>o I get light non occlusive coverage with this combination.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other BB creams that claim to \\&quot;adapt\\&quot; to match your skin tone, but I&#x27;m very fair with pinkish undertones and always found myself looking orange.</li>
            <li>The high SPF is also a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick, cakey, or runny, it evens out my complexion nicely.</li>
            <li>The Healthy FX applies so well that you can use very little, has a great finish, and wears comfortably.  </li>
            <li>For me it looks good, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li>/creamy that I have to really rub it in and make sure it&#x27;s been spread evenly, but it&#x27;s also not too liquid-y that I have to apply a lot.</li>
            <li>Smashbox BB Cream in Fair is the only one I&#x27;ve found that actually matches my skin tone, plus it provides gorgeous light coverage that&#x27;s perfect for a natural everyday look.</li>
            <li>I have tried other BB creams but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Light and perfect for pale sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is more of a primer kind, but it did not fit my purposes.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth getting the Smashbox Primer product to go under it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so light in texture that I forget that it&#x27;s on my face but at the same time offers good coverage.</li>
            <li>Plus... you get SPF35 built right in.  </li>
            <li>And this gives just the right amount of coverage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right color, but when applying it I couldn&#x27;t get it to spread out evenly across my face.</li>
            <li>I find this very easy to apply with a flat foundation brush.</li>
            <li>Even my current powder (from Smashbox by the way) has better coverage.</li>
            <li>if you want more, you&#x27;ll probably prefer a different product.</li>
            <li>Going back to my Tarte BB cream for sure</li>
            <li>I will be switching back to the Healthy FX.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased and plan to continue using this for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and natural (not cakey) while still covering and even skin.  </li>
            <li>A little too liquid like for my tastes other then that its perfect.</li>
            <li>And I do not require something heavy, mostly I can do with powder only, but it&#x27;s nice to have some coverage when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>It comes easily off with regular make-up remover.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As others say, the \\&quot;Fair\\&quot; shade is very pale and more on the cool (bluish) side than warm (pink).</li>
            <li>It blends very well into my skin</li>
            <li>This color works very well to blend in despite that.</li>
            <li>I am glad I spent the money on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as much coverage as a foundation</li>
            <li>(though I do dilute it a bit with regular moisturizer when I apply it), but it goes on smoothly, brightens me up and evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I immediately did research (using the EWG Skin Deep site) and found a nice all natural self-tanner lotion with low toxicity (True Natural Self Tanner) and today is my first time trying it.</li>
            <li>It feels light (I really don&#x27;t feel or notice it at all throughout the day), lasts all day easily (even though I take hour long walks at lunch in sunny SoCal), and the sunscreen seems effective (again - long walks, sunny SoCal, and I&#x27;m quite pale), and does not look cake-y.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far more expensive and has an spf of 35 -- which makes me feel like I&#x27;m applying waxy sunscreen every day instead of a nice tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I typically purchase the tinted moisturizer or Healthy FX foundation.  </li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and smoothly and tames any pores or fine lines you might have while also providing serious SPF 35 protection.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this along with the primer has really helped my skin calm down and become more moisturized.</li>
            <li>You also get very little product for the money, because you have to use more because it doesn&#x27;t apply/spread well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, and have been using the Lab Series BB Cream ever since it came out, but it&#x27;s only available in a single shade.</li>
            <li>High price is offset by the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use much, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>(I just started my third tube of itâ€”a little goes a long way) and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I either get too much coverage or not enough.</li>
            <li>I have allergic, sensitive skin which is also prone to acne.  </li>
            <li>It also gives a flawless base for your makeup.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this stuff, especially with the major price tag</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t get through even half this bottle before giving it away, makes my fave super oily and doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a major fan of Smashbox and this BB cream is no exception.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin is a very pale olive, meaning it&#x27;s fair but with small gold tones to it.</li>
            <li>I need to use very little - just a pea-sized amount - for full coverage.</li>
            <li>and I expected too much.</li>
            <li>This product does not apply well, has a very dull/matte finish, and doesn&#x27;t feel good on my face-very heavy, uncomfortable feeling.  </li>
            <li>I mean it is pale without pink or orange undertones, which is great.</li>
            <li>even if the bottle is small it&#x27;s not going to run out quickly.</li>
            <li>I hate all those pump and aerosol stuff, I really prefer good old simple tubes.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>It felt pretty heavy</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It felt pretty heavy</li>
            <li> and it really didn&#x27;t conceal the darkness under my eyes like my usual cream does.</li>
            <li> After a week of use it caused minor break-out - nothing to panic about, but no such effect from Shiseido foundation or when I used powder only.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> It covers minor imperfections, evens out my complexion and photographs like a dream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really wear / learn to wear makeup growing up and have been slowly figuring it out as I go.</li>
            <li> It is quite dry for a cream, so you need to learn how to apply -</li>
            <li> I either look too dry and caky or too shiny.</li>
            <li> But my main complaint is - it has almost no coverage.</li>
            <li> I end up having to use less concealers and makeup overall.  </li>
            <li> but it is the one product that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes (no I dont use it near my eyes but all sunscreen based products somehow seep into my very sensitive eyes its weird).</li>
            <li> and I only need to use a little of it.</li>
            <li> Tiny pinkish spots are not covered and slight spots become visible by end of day (no break-out, just messed up tone due to stress and fatigue).</li>
            <li> Just a little of this goes a long way so</li>
            <li> I use this by itself without any other makeup and it covers my redness and pimples/blemishes.</li>
            <li> By noon it&#x27;s drooling down my face...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a year now</li>
            <li> I just have to use a little powder</li>
            <li> Rally enhances my everyday look.  </li>
            <li> It does not look unnatural on my pale skin and no contrast with my neck.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have used smashbox products for the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick</li>
            <li> Maybe I had wrong expectations from the start, but I wanted to have something for everyday use, which could even out my tone and not scream of makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing very hard though.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> the bad part:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Maybe I had wrong expectations from the start, but I wanted to have something for everyday use, which could even out my tone and not scream of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will start with pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The Fair tone is really fair - I mean it is pale without pink or orange undertones, which is great. It does not look unnatural on my pale skin and no contrast with my neck.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not feel creamy or oily - even by the end of day. I have oily skin and that shows with makeup, but this one leaves me without the shiny nose and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is easy to use - I hate all those pump and aerosol stuff, I really prefer good old simple tubes.&lt;br /&gt;4. It has not caused any allergic reactions - even around eyes, sometimes in the morning (when I am not sufficiently woken up) I happen to put it around eyes. No puffing or swelling.&lt;br /&gt;5. It comes easily off with regular make-up remover.&lt;br /&gt;6. You can not tell you are wearing makeup - any at all. Photos are great too.&lt;br /&gt;7. Good sunscreen power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad part:&lt;br /&gt;1. The price - I have Shiseido dual balancing foundation for the same price. It is way better in coverage, look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is quite dry for a cream, so you need to learn how to apply - I do it with my fingers and more with patting movements. Nothing very hard though.&lt;br /&gt;3. But my main complaint is - it has almost no coverage. Even my current powder (from Smashbox by the way) has better coverage. Tiny pinkish spots are not covered and slight spots become visible by end of day (no break-out, just messed up tone due to stress and fatigue). And I do not require something heavy, mostly I can do with powder only, but it&#x27;s nice to have some coverage when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;3. After a week of use it caused minor break-out - nothing to panic about, but no such effect from Shiseido foundation or when I used powder only.&lt;br /&gt;4. When I tried to build up (for some coverage) it started to look a bit smudgy and cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was my fault and I expected too much. Maybe it is more of a primer kind, but it did not fit my purposes. I will return to Shiseido + powder for coverage and my regular day cream for oily skin + powder for daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and have been using the Lab Series BB Cream ever since it came out, but it&#x27;s only available in a single shade. I was looking for a BB cream closer to my complexion and this one had good reviews so I thought I would try it. I tried applying this after moisturizing, but it just didn&#x27;t spread as nicely as the Lab Series, it clumped up on every pore, stubble and skin imperfection. Looks like it&#x27;s designed for woman with perfect skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect weight and color for my fair, freckled skin (inherited from the Irish side of the family). Definitely worth getting the Smashbox Primer product to go under it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a major fan of Smashbox and this BB cream is no exception. Definitely recommended! This is the only BB cream I use.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like Smashbox products and their BB cream is no exception. It goes on evenly and smoothly and tames any pores or fine lines you might have while also providing serious SPF 35 protection. Zero fragrance. High price is offset by the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use much, so it lasts a long time. As others say, the \\&quot;Fair\\&quot; shade is very pale and more on the cool (bluish) side than warm (pink). It&#x27;s also very light coverage...if you want more, you&#x27;ll probably prefer a different product. For me it looks good, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so light in texture that I forget that it&#x27;s on my face but at the same time offers good coverage. It blends very well into my skin and I only need to use a little of it. Just a little of this goes a long way so even if the bottle is small it&#x27;s not going to run out quickly. Also, my skin is a very pale olive, meaning it&#x27;s fair but with small gold tones to it. This color works very well to blend in despite that. Price is a bit high, as is the price for most good make up. I am glad I spent the money on it.</li>
            <li> Although the color was a bit light for my skin tone it still looks great.  Very smooth and doesn&#x27;t get into all of the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t get through even half this bottle before giving it away, makes my fave super oily and doesn&#x27;t stay. By noon it&#x27;s drooling down my face... Going back to my Tarte BB cream for sure</li>
            <li> I have used smashbox products for the past 5 years.  I typically purchase the tinted moisturizer or Healthy FX foundation.  However, after reading the reviews for this product, I decided to try it.  I also liked the fact that this product was SPF 35, rather than the lower SPF 15 of the Healthy FX.  Unfortunately, I am disappointed.  This product does not apply well, has a very dull/matte finish, and doesn&#x27;t feel good on my face-very heavy, uncomfortable feeling.  You also get very little product for the money, because you have to use more because it doesn&#x27;t apply/spread well.  The Healthy FX applies so well that you can use very little, has a great finish, and wears comfortably.  I will be switching back to the Healthy FX.</li>
            <li> I never wear foundation because I&#x27;ve never found one that both feels good and looks good on my combination skin. I either get too much coverage or not enough. I either look too dry and caky or too shiny. When I tried this BB cream, I was thrilled. It&#x27;s not as much coverage as a foundation (though I do dilute it a bit with regular moisturizer when I apply it), but it goes on smoothly, brightens me up and evens out my skin tone. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a year now (I just started my third tube of itâ€”a little goes a long way) and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> works as described. Very light, almost too light for my fair skin. But I like it. It doesn&#x27;t get oily and holds up well on sweaty days.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff, especially with the major price tag but all in all, it was ok. It felt pretty heavy and it really didn&#x27;t conceal the darkness under my eyes like my usual cream does. It also didn&#x27;t last nearly as long. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really wear / learn to wear makeup growing up and have been slowly figuring it out as I go. I find this very easy to apply with a flat foundation brush. I need to use very little - just a pea-sized amount - for full coverage. It feels light (I really don&#x27;t feel or notice it at all throughout the day), lasts all day easily (even though I take hour long walks at lunch in sunny SoCal), and the sunscreen seems effective (again - long walks, sunny SoCal, and I&#x27;m quite pale), and does not look cake-y. I&#x27;m quite pleased and plan to continue using this for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> This is a great primer.  I use it after applying moisturizer or sunscreen or serum.  Then I apply my mineral makeup (glominerals brand).  I LOVE that it is spf 35!!!! but it is the one product that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes (no I dont use it near my eyes but all sunscreen based products somehow seep into my very sensitive eyes its weird). It also gives a flawless base for your makeup.  Rally enhances my everyday look.  I end up having to use less concealers and makeup overall.  I would use this by itself at the beach or running errands.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have allergic, sensitive skin which is also prone to acne.  I have no problems with Smashbox BB Cream or their Light Primer.  In fact, I&#x27;ve stopped buying foundation b/o I get light non occlusive coverage with this combination.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what they say - lighter weight makeup actually makes you look younger.&lt;br /&gt;Great makeup and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> Same as buying it at sephora, came with box. Best foundation on the market. Not greasy or caulky. I love smash box.</li>
            <li> So light and covers great!  I&#x27;ve always used Clinque... Even better makeup and after buying smashbox eyeshadow decided to give this a try... I really like it!  It goes on smooth and natural (not cakey) while still covering and even skin.  Plus... you get SPF35 built right in.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick, cakey, or runny, it evens out my complexion nicely. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have make up on!</li>
            <li> Smashbox discontinued their wonderful tinted sheer moisturizer so this was the next best option. It&#x27;s far more expensive and has an spf of 35 -- which makes me feel like I&#x27;m applying waxy sunscreen every day instead of a nice tinted moisturizer. I immediately did research (using the EWG Skin Deep site) and found a nice all natural self-tanner lotion with low toxicity (True Natural Self Tanner) and today is my first time trying it. I hope it works so I can ditch the BB cream altogether.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product this is.  I have tried other BB creams but this is by far the best.  Not having to put moisturizer and primer on is brilliant.  And this gives just the right amount of coverage.  I just have to use a little powder and I&#x27;m all done for the foundation routine. FIVE STARS!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to blend in well. It&#x27;s the right color, but when applying it I couldn&#x27;t get it to spread out evenly across my face. Was expecting a better product from smashbox.</li>
            <li> Light and perfect for pale sensitive skin. I have dry skin and this along with the primer has really helped my skin calm down and become more moisturized.</li>
            <li> A little too liquid like for my tastes other then that its perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and it&#x27;s already my favorite product! I use this by itself without any other makeup and it covers my redness and pimples/blemishes. It&#x27;s not too thick/creamy that I have to really rub it in and make sure it&#x27;s been spread evenly, but it&#x27;s also not too liquid-y that I have to apply a lot. I love that it has SPF in it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other BB creams that claim to \\&quot;adapt\\&quot; to match your skin tone, but I&#x27;m very fair with pinkish undertones and always found myself looking orange. Smashbox BB Cream in Fair is the only one I&#x27;ve found that actually matches my skin tone, plus it provides gorgeous light coverage that&#x27;s perfect for a natural everyday look. I apply it after moisturizing and top with concealer (as needed) and that&#x27;s it -- no powder or anything. It covers minor imperfections, evens out my complexion and photographs like a dream. The high SPF is also a nice bonus. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
