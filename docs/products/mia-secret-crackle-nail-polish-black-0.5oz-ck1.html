            <li>Great crackle nail polish, even better price.</li>
            <li>im very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It also had a very strong smell which was pleasant.</li>
            <li>I will be on the lookout for more colors to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my nails!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it is so easy to do and looks really good</li>
            <li>This product was fantastic and very easy to use!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it comes out nicely with more gaps between the colors.</li>
            <li>Try to put on just one coat for more crackle.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the response time on this order.  </li>
            <li>It only takes one coat and &#x27;cracks&#x27; beautifully!  </li>
            <li>She cannot wait for me to buy more colors.</li>
            <li>I have this as well as the OPI Shatter and I like this one way better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on purchasing most if not all the colors.  </li>
            <li>then most nail polish, but</li>
            <li>better to apply one even coat so it can crackle cooler.  </li>
            <li>so I thought I better remove it.  </li>
            <li>Way better than OPI&#x27;s crackle polish.</li>
            <li>This kind doesn&#x27;t get chunky over time and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I love how the crackle looks on my nails, can use any any color beneath it.</li>
            <li>Crackle by China Glaze is a bit better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use this.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the katy perry version was sold out everywhere, it had pretty good reviews</li>
            <li>It came faster than expected great product!</li>
            <li>easy to use.  </li>
            <li>However, since then it works fine</li>
            <li>Great product, ordered it on a Friday night, the following Monday was a holiday &amp; received it in the mail on Friday.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase no complaints.</li>
            <li>and I think the brush is far superior as well.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this nailpolish, it worked exactly how it should</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this product...</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to be wearing acrylics to get the full benefit.  </li>
            <li>i recieved it very quickly, it was nice and simple.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty pleased with my results at first.</li>
            <li>You will be lucky to get one application from this product line.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t thicken up as quickly -</li>
            <li>I was so excited I opened it right away</li>
            <li>Finished it off with a clear top coat</li>
            <li>It looked pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Its salon quality and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I get so much compliments on my nails and the price is just right!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t crackle</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>this nail polish is really more like a regular nail</li>
            <li>was very upset!</li>
            <li>and chipped off within the first day of wearing.</li>
            <li>and i was very disapointed!</li>
            <li>Hello  nail polish what is not to love all colors different sizes</li>
            <li>But it does make a nice matte black polish.</li>
            <li>I have only tried the black since thats a great polish</li>
            <li>If you buy the product, figure you&#x27;ll be lucky to get more then 1 use from it, especially if you are polishing your nails yourself, not by a professional (who should be able to polish your nails much quicker, so polish in bottle has less time to harden).</li>
            <li>It did not &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; very well.</li>
            <li>Very important***After</li>
            <li>I couldnt believe my eyes that is really works.</li>
            <li>Mine always come out fantastic (especially the silver/black &amp; red/black) and always get people asking me where I got my nails done.</li>
            <li>It is fast drying and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crackle&amp;#34; very well.  </li>
            <li>even though it took over a week to get here, I thought I found a real bargain.</li>
            <li>I put on some bubble gum pink nail polish and then some silver crackle on top.</li>
            <li>but it still thicken&#x27;s up much faster</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much because it comes out looking streaky.</li>
            <li>When it all works properly, its very fun to use.</li>
            <li>You have to put a color on your nails first, then this black over top.  </li>
            <li>(You can actually see it cracking right after you apply it!)</li>
            <li>It is better quality although it is a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>It looks great, crackles into small parts with a thin layer :)</li>
            <li>I love this polish its not to thick its just right.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn crackle in a long time and it&#x27;s probably been longer since I wore black nail polish, but this was good stuff.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed manicurist and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The pink one worked fine.</li>
            <li>I dont get how other people cant \\&quot;get this to work\\&quot; since it&#x27;s as easy as it comes.</li>
            <li>so glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on the OPI one</li>
            <li>then normal nail polish.</li>
            <li>However, I did not personally like this crackle very much.</li>
            <li>The only thing I recommend is to allow it to dry completly and maybe using the Mia brand nail polish underneath but other than that your good.</li>
            <li>You place the bottom color, add a clear coat!</li>
            <li>So it looks cool, but you better love the look because that stuff is darn near impossible to get off!</li>
            <li>This product really did not dry well</li>
            <li>no problems at all but the secret is after your first coat put a clear coat then use the crackle the clear coat again :)</li>
            <li>I personally think OPI is highly overrated and highly overpriced</li>
            <li>I never heard of this particular brand, but it had the same cool effect as the more expensive OPI Crackle Polish Brand.</li>
            <li>But overall i really like this product</li>
            <li>i suggest applying it as fast as possible to keep the nail polish from thickening in the bottle.</li>
            <li>and wow the marble effect</li>
            <li>Then, I had a professional meeting at work coming up</li>
            <li>And, the Crackle by China Glaze actually \\&quot;cracked much better\\&quot; then this product.</li>
            <li>, the only down side is it dries matte, so you have to apply a clear coat over it to get it shiney, and it dries VERY quickly, so</li>
            <li>Compaired to the 8 bucks a bottle for the OPI stuff and other \\&quot;big\\&quot; brands, this stuff cracks right away, and you can even control the pattern a little with inteligent brush strokes, don&#x27;t use a super heavy coat, and not too light either, after about two different uses</li>
            <li>this polish barely crackled!</li>
            <li>but I get only clear polish...</li>
            <li>this nail polish makes the tiniest cracks so you can barely see the polish underneath.</li>
            <li>You do have to have a pretty good nail color base (double coat if you have too) but thats with any of these crackle nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I did an orange base with the black coat and had the best Halloween nails.  </li>
            <li>It does crackle a little bit but not as much as stated.</li>
            <li>and you just get tiny little cracks, too much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> takes a few tries to get it right.    </li>
            <li> You can get large or small cracks</li>
            <li> Product was dry and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Half hour later, the polish was barely smudged.</li>
            <li> but you have to be very careful with how much you apply, too little</li>
            <li> I have two other colors of this same brand and have had the same issue with all three.</li>
            <li> I used it on my natural nails over gold nail polish and a clear base, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Will definitely try other colors.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s because the other polish wasn&#x27;t dry enough.</li>
            <li> Once dry, put an overcoat on it.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing away every single bottle (7 unused bottles) because they hardened up by the time I got to them (only a matter of a few months).</li>
            <li> but ya the black would turn like a matte grey when it was dry..</li>
            <li> so I spent all that money for somthing that I didn&#x27;t even want..</li>
            <li> But seriously, not worth the headaches it caused over the long run.</li>
            <li> (can&#x27;t compare it to any other brand though)</li>
            <li> i applied the 1 coat of this to my other nail polish color</li>
            <li> I was extremely bummed.</li>
            <li> I bought a black and a pink one.</li>
            <li> Usually, by the time I got to finishing up the 2nd hand on the same client (2-3 minutes), the product had become so thick -</li>
            <li> It is like totally bad, not working how it is supposed to and is getting gross fast, the lid even like got all deformed somehow</li>
            <li> it looks like your nails are just painted black.</li>
            <li> Works so well and costs much less than the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I wanted the black crakle nail polish, and that is what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The black one didnt crackle at all.</li>
            <li> and i got it in black.</li>
            <li> I wish i didn&#x27;t waste a penny on this product.</li>
            <li> Mia Secret Crackle...was such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it looked like just a plain black polish on my nail!</li>
            <li> and when it did dry it was not a great cracked look.</li>
            <li> This brand works just as well if not better then the OPI stuff.</li>
            <li> wasted my $5.00 on this product!</li>
            <li> All you do is put on your base coat and wait for it to dry (completely)</li>
            <li> After I failed miserably at getting my hands on OPI&#x27;s Black Shatter, I realized that they weren&#x27;t the first and only company to make a crackle polish.  </li>
            <li> No matter how thin of a layer you apply to your nails, it looks like black nail polish.</li>
            <li> hard to found when it came out</li>
            <li> I mean, on crackles you cant over coat it, on any brand you buy.</li>
            <li> and it smells a bit stronger than regular nail polish, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> terrible doesn&#x27;t crackle right  </li>
            <li> Looks sloppy when finished.  </li>
            <li> Gave it away, tried it with different colors still looked ugly!</li>
            <li> This stuff is damn near impossible to remove!!!  </li>
            <li> nothing went wrong in the shipping.</li>
            <li> After I purchased this product, I thought I was using this wrong but must have gotten a dud because it never crackled.</li>
            <li> then I heard of OPI shatter...too expensive...</li>
            <li> Although, I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when i received this product I bought the black one</li>
            <li> I was so mad there was no receipt</li>
            <li> It looked ugly and nothing like magazines or on line.</li>
            <li> Trying the Sallys brand i was very disappointing and decided that the crackle thing was not for me until i was recommended Mia.  </li>
            <li> and i HATE it.</li>
            <li> so I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it looked terrible!</li>

            <li> Product was dry and didn&#x27;t last long. It did not &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; very well.</li>
            <li> this nail polish makes the tiniest cracks so you can barely see the polish underneath. it looks like your nails are just painted black.</li>
            <li> This nail polish gives the same effect as the katie perry shatter nail polish by opi which I could not find in stores and didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 on here for.  It came faster than expected great product!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t crackle but I think it&#x27;s because the other polish wasn&#x27;t dry enough. However, since then it works fine and I like it.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.  I absolutely loved it.  You don&#x27;t need to be wearing acrylics to get the full benefit.  Just put the color of polish you want to &#x27;crackle&#x27; through.  Very important***After You place the bottom color, add a clear coat!*** then proceed with the &#x27;crackle polish&#x27; we achieved perfect results.  Finished it off with a clear top coat and it looked amazing!</li>
            <li> it works great! (can&#x27;t compare it to any other brand though) it acts very quickly which is awesome, as soon as you glide it on it starts to crackle and it instantly dries.  Try to put on just one coat for more crackle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Works so well and costs much less than the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot;.  I will be on the lookout for more colors to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> I wanted the black crakle nail polish, and that is what I ordered. I rec&#x27;d the package in the mail I was so excited I opened it right away and it was BLUE!! I was so mad there was no receipt so I could not return it so I spent all that money for somthing that I didn&#x27;t even want.. so I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product, ordered it on a Friday night, the following Monday was a holiday &amp; received it in the mail on Friday. It looks great, crackles into small parts with a thin layer :)</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the response time on this order.  Everything was done and rec&#x27;d in a week.  Great impression.</li>
            <li> I never heard of this particular brand, but it had the same cool effect as the more expensive OPI Crackle Polish Brand. I am a licensed manicurist and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I couldnt believe my eyes that is really works. It showed up on time. nothing went wrong in the shipping.</li>
            <li> I dont get how other people cant \\&quot;get this to work\\&quot; since it&#x27;s as easy as it comes. Its a polish, not rocket science. You do have to have a pretty good nail color base (double coat if you have too) but thats with any of these crackle nail polishes. I personally think OPI is highly overrated and highly overpriced and I know my polish. This brand works just as well if not better then the OPI stuff. I mean, on crackles you cant over coat it, on any brand you buy. Just get enough on the brush and do one coat. It will crackle, just some fingers might do it faster then others. Once dry, put an overcoat on it. Mine always come out fantastic (especially the silver/black &amp; red/black) and always get people asking me where I got my nails done. I have only tried the black since thats a great polish and you can put almost any color under it. I would recommend this to anyone who doesnt want to pay up to $15 simply for nail polish.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when i received this product I bought the black one and when I opened it to me it smelled like paint and when I put it on my nails it didnt crackle at all wasted my $5.00 on this product!</li>
            <li> Trying the Sallys brand i was very disappointing and decided that the crackle thing was not for me until i was recommended Mia.  It only takes one coat and &#x27;cracks&#x27; beautifully!  I plan on getting the white too!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this nailpolish, it worked exactly how it should (You can actually see it cracking right after you apply it!) but you have to be very careful with how much you apply, too little and you just get tiny little cracks, too much and it doesn&#x27;t crack at all. takes a few tries to get it right.    But overall i really like this product, the only down side is it dries matte, so you have to apply a clear coat over it to get it shiney, and it dries VERY quickly, so i suggest applying it as fast as possible to keep the nail polish from thickening in the bottle. and it smells a bit stronger than regular nail polish, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> Both my sister and I LOVED the nail polish. Its salon quality and dries pretty quickly. She cannot wait for me to buy more colors.</li>
            <li> this nail polish is really more like a regular nail polish.when i applied the 1 coat of this to my other nail polish color,it didnt even crackle up for me!i was very upset!</li>
            <li> Great crackle nail polish, even better price. Compaired to the 8 bucks a bottle for the OPI stuff and other \\&quot;big\\&quot; brands, this stuff cracks right away, and you can even control the pattern a little with inteligent brush strokes, don&#x27;t use a super heavy coat, and not too light either, after about two different uses - you&#x27;ll get the hang of it quick!!!</li>
            <li> now this works great we loved it use it all the time no problems at all but the secret is after your first coat put a clear coat then use the crackle the clear coat again :)</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! All you do is put on your base coat and wait for it to dry (completely) and then ad one regular coat of the crakle. it is so easy to do and looks really good and you dont have to spend $10 a bottle like you would for opi! Works great!!</li>
            <li> Nail polish came before date set to come which was great.  However, I did not personally like this crackle very much. It doesn&#x27;t work that well-which isn&#x27;t the seller&#x27;s fault-but I would recommend spending a couple extra dollars on the OPI-Katy Perry, Crackle/Shatter. It is better quality although it is a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> After I purchased this product, I thought I was using this wrong but must have gotten a dud because it never crackled. But it does make a nice matte black polish.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this. I bought a black and a pink one. The black one didnt crackle at all. I was extremely bummed. I tried 3 different times using this and it didnt crackle. and chipped off within the first day of wearing. The pink one worked fine.</li>
            <li> This product works well!!  I did an orange base with the black coat and had the best Halloween nails.  The effects were even visible on my toe nails also.  Will definitely try other colors.</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic and very easy to use! I used it on my natural nails over gold nail polish and a clear base, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I have this as well as the OPI Shatter and I like this one way better.  The formula is thinner and easier to apply than Shatter.  You can get large or small cracks and I think the brush is far superior as well.</li>
            <li> I get my nails done every 2 weeks in the nail salon and I always ask to have a marble design...it comes out great...but it does not look like marble...then I heard of OPI shatter...too expensive...then I found this...purchased it and wow the marble effect I wanted!I still get my nails done...but I get only clear polish...go home and polish my nails then I put on crackle...I get so much compliments on my nails and the price is just right! wish I could post a pic!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn crackle in a long time and it&#x27;s probably been longer since I wore black nail polish, but this was good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I bought it for my daughter and we both painted our nails with it. It is fast drying and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> hard to found when it came out my daughter had to have it so I purchase this item for her and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Dried up fast in the bottle, color seperated in the bottle.  Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crackle&amp;#34; very well.  Looks sloppy when finished.  I have two other colors of this same brand and have had the same issue with all three.</li>
            <li> After I failed miserably at getting my hands on OPI&#x27;s Black Shatter, I realized that they weren&#x27;t the first and only company to make a crackle polish.  It crackles within seconds of application.  I&#x27;m planning on purchasing most if not all the colors.  Although, I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before.  The smell is stronger then most nail polish, but then again what smells to me might not bother you.  It&#x27;s no unbearable, just be in well ventilated area so the smell won&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the katy perry version was sold out everywhere, it had pretty good reviews so i thought i&#x27;d give it a try and i HATE it. No matter how thin of a layer you apply to your nails, it looks like black nail polish. You can&#x27;t even see the color underneath.  I wish i didn&#x27;t waste a penny on this product. Never will i buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this product...even though it took over a week to get here, I thought I found a real bargain. Well let me tell you, I should have bought the brand by Opi. This product really did not dry well and when it did dry it was not a great cracked look. My nails looked like I had polished them a week ago. It also had a very strong smell which was pleasant. I will spend my money and try the Opi brand..hopefully it will give me the results that I want. Mia Secret Crackle...was such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> You have to put a color on your nails first, then this black over top.  It does crackle a little bit but not as much as stated.</li>
            <li> It is like totally bad, not working how it is supposed to and is getting gross fast, the lid even like got all deformed somehow</li>
            <li> i recieved it very quickly, it was nice and simple.  easy to use.  better to apply one even coat so it can crackle cooler.  im very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> terrible doesn&#x27;t crackle right  i only worked on 2 of my fingers. i&#x27;ll spend the extra and buy a brand name OPI shatter next time</li>
            <li> I love this polish its not to thick its just right. The only thing I recommend is to allow it to dry completly and maybe using the Mia brand nail polish underneath but other than that your good. Great product and its cheaper than the OPI brand. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase no complaints.</li>
            <li> This polish crackles perfectly!! I had no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on the OPI one, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my nails!</li>
            <li> so i bought the mia crackle nail polish and i was very disapointed! this polish barely crackled! it looked like just a plain black polish on my nail! oh and i got it in black. but ya the black would turn like a matte grey when it was dry..it looked terrible! do not reccomend this brand of crackle polish!</li>
            <li> I was pretty pleased with my results at first. I put on some bubble gum pink nail polish and then some silver crackle on top. It looked pretty cool. Then, I had a professional meeting at work coming up so I thought I better remove it.  Half hour later, the polish was barely smudged. This stuff is damn near impossible to remove!!!  So it looks cool, but you better love the look because that stuff is darn near impossible to get off!</li>
            <li> Hello  nail polish what is not to love all colors different sizes and they are the best there is and more</li>
            <li> This polish works great. Way better than OPI&#x27;s crackle polish. This kind doesn&#x27;t get chunky over time and goes on smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> My nails look great.  I love how the crackle looks on my nails, can use any any color beneath it.</li>
            <li> You will be lucky to get one application from this product line. I purchased a dozen bottles (different colors) at the same time. Usually, by the time I got to finishing up the 2nd hand on the same client (2-3 minutes), the product had become so thick - it was unusable. I ended up throwing away every single bottle (7 unused bottles) because they hardened up by the time I got to them (only a matter of a few months). Crackle by China Glaze is a bit better. Doesn&#x27;t thicken up as quickly - but it still thicken&#x27;s up much faster then normal nail polish. And, the Crackle by China Glaze actually \\&quot;cracked much better\\&quot; then this product. When it all works properly, its very fun to use. But seriously, not worth the headaches it caused over the long run. If you buy the product, figure you&#x27;ll be lucky to get more then 1 use from it, especially if you are polishing your nails yourself, not by a professional (who should be able to polish your nails much quicker, so polish in bottle has less time to harden).</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as the OPI</li>
            <li> Did not like this crackle look! It looked ugly and nothing like magazines or on line. Gave it away, tried it with different colors still looked ugly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I don&#x27;t use it much because it comes out looking streaky. Sometimes it comes out nicely with more gaps between the colors.</li>
