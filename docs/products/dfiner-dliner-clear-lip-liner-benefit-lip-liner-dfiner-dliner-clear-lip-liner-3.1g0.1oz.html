            <li>This product is a great one time wonder, it is used to prevent your lipstick from bleeding onto your skin.</li>
            <li>sharpen it each time, the tip would fall off , this one is great.</li>
            <li>My joy with it ended when I attempted to sharpen it.</li>
            <li>Happy to find this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great transparent lip liner.</li>
            <li>but none of my many excellent lipstick/eyebrow pencil sharpeners could sharpen this pencil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it all over my lips under lipstick, as a kind of primer, and it works beautifully that way, keeping lipstick on for hours, even with drinking and eating.</li>
            <li>Delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product</li>
            <li>Great lip liner and at a much better price than the well known brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Above was my review written after I had tried it on my lips and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>An amazing product.</li>
            <li>I have vertical lines in my lips and it is amazing for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Although I have used Duwop which is a better product, this D&#x27;liner is good and a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of wood they used</li>
            <li>So worth it!!!</li>
            <li>It works wonderful and a decent price.</li>
            <li>It is my new best friend, I hope</li>
            <li>Glad to see I can still buy it on Amazon</li>
            <li>So glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Keeps lipstick from bleeding and holds it better on your lips.</li>
            <li>I love love love this pencil.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lip liner.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>The tiny product box was smooshed when it arrived, but the lip pencil itself was perfect.</li>
            <li>I just hope I can find more of these lip liners when this one gets used up, because this has turned into one of my makeup</li>
            <li>Love this product and my order was filled perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Benefit</li>
            <li>I think that some cheap beige/natural/light/whatever eyeliner would do the job better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This lip liner, on the other hand, is wonderful through and through.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace another reverse lip liner that I really found effective.  </li>
            <li>lip liner is clear, soft, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth application and will definitely buy more.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought at Sephora....have been using it years.  </li>
            <li>I usually just use it as the intended liner, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked for it in my local Sephora, and they don&#x27;t carry it any more, so I was quite pleased to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li>I have used several others but this one is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>I love this product and can only find it now on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Really keeps</li>
            <li>It does the trick well.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline also works and is cheaper still, but it takes much longer to receive in the mail.  </li>
            <li>This lip liner is allows for lipstick to stay in place much for much longer while defining my lips.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It actually does what it is expected to do; that is to allow a clean lip line with no running in fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a terrific product, and absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li>You can use it several times before sharpening,&lt;br /&gt;it sharpens fine, you need the big opening.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and keeps lipstick in it&#x27;s place!  </li>
            <li>It looks beige but not to worry it goes on clear.  </li>
            <li>I totally eliminates vertical lines above lips that start when you get older.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t really get the 5 star reviews on this one, if it makes any difference it must be either subtle or maybe really mature lips?</li>
            <li> It was cheap, but ultimately not worth even the few dollars I spent on</li>
            <li> It really stops lipstick from bleeding past lip line and is invisible once applied.</li>
            <li> The Maybelline clear liner stick did as well and cost a lot less.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this BENEFIT LIP LINER quite a while ago (it lasted long), so when I used it all,&lt;br /&gt;and went to buy it again from BENEFIT @ULTA, they said that it&#x27;s a discontinued</li>
            <li> I also wear red lipstick all the time, and little red bleeding streaks working their way upwards is the polar opposite of sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays on for hours, it isn&#x27;t drying, and there is absolutely no bleeding, even with my lipsticks that tend to go that way.</li>
            <li> On the other side of the pencil,the wood was still intact all the way to the tip.</li>
            <li> In my view this lip liner does not really replace an ordinary lipliner.</li>
            <li> keeps your lipstick on longer and stops your lipstick from feathering.&lt;br /&gt;i sometimes wear it alone or with a little lip gloss over it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that this product is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> This one to me was no better than a colored lip liner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an invisible lip liner in the past that was extremely disappointing (Revlon LipLiner): it was chalky, waxy, drying, and broke under the slightest pressure.</li>
            <li> Completely useless for lip gloss.</li>
            <li> have just started discovering those horrible lines on my upper lip, and they are a magnet for bleeding lipstick.</li>
            <li> I had bought a very expensive one from Dior</li>
            <li> I pair this with Mac Lip base for lipstick that never feathers.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When this product disappeared from Sephora I was bummed.  I totally eliminates vertical lines above lips that start when you get older.  Glad to see I can still buy it on Amazon and I&#x27;m stocking up!</li>
            <li> The description of this product made it seem comparable to Aveda Mint-nourish lipliner, but it does not compare in its ability to deter the feathering or \\&quot; bleeding \\&quot; effect of lipstick application.</li>
            <li> Love this product and my order was filled perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Benefit has discontinued this product and I am upset by this.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Really keeps you&#x27;re lipstick from bleeding up you&#x27;re lip!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Although I have used Duwop which is a better product, this D&#x27;liner is good and a lot cheaper.  It does the trick well.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline also works and is cheaper still, but it takes much longer to receive in the mail.  So I think this D&#x27;liner is the&lt;br /&gt;best option all things considered.</li>
            <li> An amazing product. Stops lipstick/gloss feathering. I love this product and can only find it now on Amazon. Thanks for making this available.</li>
            <li> It definitely works as advertised.  I am very pleased with the product and I would certainly recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I purchased this BENEFIT LIP LINER quite a while ago (it lasted long), so when I used it all,&lt;br /&gt;and went to buy it again from BENEFIT @ULTA, they said that it&#x27;s a discontinued item.&lt;br /&gt;So I found it on Amazon and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;This keeps your lipstick on longer and stops your lipstick from feathering.&lt;br /&gt;i sometimes wear it alone or with a little lip gloss over it.</li>
            <li> If you have lipstick bleeding into the vertical lines around your mouth you should be using this.  You outline your lips with this invisible pencil and it stops lipstick bleed.  Takes years off your face when your lipline is defined.  So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> The Maybelline clear liner stick did as well and cost a lot less.  I wish I could still find it.</li>
            <li> Keeps lipstick from bleeding and holds it better on your lips.</li>
            <li> This product is a great one time wonder, it is used to prevent your lipstick from bleeding onto your skin. I love the product and will be a continual user!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace another reverse lip liner that I really found effective.  This one to me was no better than a colored lip liner.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love love love this pencil. I outline my lips, put it on my eyelid and under eye area to stop cosmetics from bleeding. Does a great job!</li>
            <li> I will always have one of these on hand now. I had bought a very expensive one from Dior, it was awful, you had&lt;br /&gt;to sharpen it each time, the tip would fall off , this one is great. You can use it several times before sharpening,&lt;br /&gt;it sharpens fine, you need the big opening. It works wonderful and a decent price. It is my new best friend, I hope&lt;br /&gt;they keep it around.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip liner. It keeps the lipstick from feathering. Glad I was able to find this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keeps the lipstick from feathering</li>
            <li> Finally got around to using this liner after a different brand was used up.  Nice and smooth application and will definitely buy more.  Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This lip liner is allows for lipstick to stay in place much for much longer while defining my lips. I love it.</li>
            <li> My lipstick doesn&#x27;t bleed. I have vertical lines in my lips and it is amazing for that purpose. It is the only one I have ever purchased that works.</li>
            <li> Great lip liner and at a much better price than the well known brand. It actually does what it is expected to do; that is to allow a clean lip line with no running in fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above was my review written after I had tried it on my lips and was very pleased with it. My joy with it ended when I attempted to sharpen it. I don&#x27;t know what kind of wood they used but none of my many excellent lipstick/eyebrow pencil sharpeners could sharpen this pencil. It literally split the wood over one inch up on one side and pieces of chunky wood shards fell from it. On the other side of the pencil,the wood was still intact all the way to the tip. I wish I could include a picture of it. This is about a five time use pencil. Once it needs sharpening, its to the trash!</li>
            <li> In my view this lip liner does not really replace an ordinary lipliner. It is a bit too oily and therefore does not hold the lipstick well. Completely useless for lip gloss. I think that some cheap beige/natural/light/whatever eyeliner would do the job better.</li>
            <li> Originally bought at Sephora....have been using it years.  Finally found on Amazon....thanks Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It stops feathering and bleeding of lipstick and lip gloss.  I never miss using it especially in the morning before I leave for work.  What a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> Need a liner that keeps my lipstick from \\&quot;feathering.\\&quot;  Found it on Amazon!  D&#x27;Finer D&#x27;Liner by Benefit.  It&#x27;s clear and keeps lipstick in it&#x27;s place!  Happy to find this product.</li>
            <li> I needed something to stop my lipstick from feathering and this exceeded my expectations, because it also makes my lipstick last longer.  It looks beige but not to worry it goes on clear.  So worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I used it for a few months and haven&#x27;t seen any difference, other than it tends to mess up my lipliner (makes it more smudgy). I don&#x27;t really get the 5 star reviews on this one, if it makes any difference it must be either subtle or maybe really mature lips?</li>
            <li> I love this item. It really stops lipstick from bleeding past lip line and is invisible once applied. I pair this with Mac Lip base for lipstick that never feathers.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this product is so hard to find. The Benefit counters never seem to have it, and I have looked for it in several different states. Delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an invisible lip liner in the past that was extremely disappointing (Revlon LipLiner): it was chalky, waxy, drying, and broke under the slightest pressure. It was cheap, but ultimately not worth even the few dollars I spent on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip liner, on the other hand, is wonderful through and through. I&#x27;ve looked for it in my local Sephora, and they don&#x27;t carry it any more, so I was quite pleased to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just started discovering those horrible lines on my upper lip, and they are a magnet for bleeding lipstick. I also wear red lipstick all the time, and little red bleeding streaks working their way upwards is the polar opposite of sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip liner is clear, soft, and works perfectly. It stays on for hours, it isn&#x27;t drying, and there is absolutely no bleeding, even with my lipsticks that tend to go that way. I&#x27;ve used it all over my lips under lipstick, as a kind of primer, and it works beautifully that way, keeping lipstick on for hours, even with drinking and eating. I usually just use it as the intended liner, and it works perfectly. It isn&#x27;t self sharpening, which I don&#x27;t like, because when I sharpen it some of the product gets lost in the shavings, but this isn&#x27;t a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a terrific product, and absolutely worth the price. The tiny product box was smooshed when it arrived, but the lip pencil itself was perfect. The seller shipped within the allotted time. I just hope I can find more of these lip liners when this one gets used up, because this has turned into one of my makeup Must Have items.</li>
            <li> This is a great transparent lip liner. I have used several others but this one is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve found so far. It prevents lipstick from bleeding and does not leave a white line around your lips.</li>
