            <li>I dilute it and apply with cotton pad and that seems to be perfect.  </li>
            <li>&amp; yes beofre anyone asked I followed the direction to a T bcuz I wanted the best results</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Ilove those glycolic s its result awesome its better to follow the manufacturer direction</li>
            <li>its really good for pigmentation problems</li>

            <li>Great experience on many levels.</li>
            <li>Excited to try this percentage!!</li>
            <li>this product is very strong.</li>
            <li>I love that after i use the peel my skin looks healthier and more refreshed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works better to apply with a brush than a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more products from this fabulous company!</li>
            <li>Make sure you ease into the chemical peels by leaving it on for the required amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Maybe someone else will have better luck with this...</li>
            <li>I think the hyper pigmentation is more noticeable than others, as I&#x27;ve mentioned to 2 friends that I want to get some treatments done for my acne &#x27;scars&#x27; and they comment that they can&#x27;t see them.  </li>
            <li>I scheduled this on a Monday to not interfere with my weekend :)  </li>
            <li>Top of the line, I use it once a week and look twenty again.</li>
            <li>after use please make sure you use something to counter act the acid.</li>
            <li>but I just got this in the mail today and was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Also you must use sun screen to protect you skin after using this ,product because you will easily burn .In  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t super severe for me and is mostly covered with makeup.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good</li>
            <li>My products arrived quickly and who can beat the free shipping on any order?  </li>
            <li>but the burn dissipates relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>they were not bad and you had to get  pretty close to me to notice .Maybe  </li>
            <li>I have only done one peel, but already my skin looks more glowy and fresh!  </li>
            <li>Immediately after, my skin wasreddish, but it faded pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed my vitamin serum is absorbing into my skin far better.</li>
            <li>Be careful with this stuff-it burns the skin right off your face-and have a baking soda paste handy for any mishaps.</li>
            <li>This product is actually working better as time goes on.</li>
            <li>The first time I&lt;br /&gt;did</li>
            <li>Also I have read that consistent exfoliation at a lower % is far&lt;</li>
            <li>I have used higher strength, but had to dilute.</li>
            <li>I hung in there for 2.5 minutes the first time.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any immediate results with the hyper pigmentation, but I think that would be asking too much for one application of a 25% formula!  </li>
            <li>NOW you would think I would peel being that this is my first time to ever do one.  </li>
            <li>I used a pre-peel product by Image Perfect and stopped all other &#x27;harsh&#x27; chemicals leading up to this.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever peel &amp; after doing much research chose Glycolic</li>
            <li>Full strength would burn my skin, but then again I am sensitive to things like this.  </li>
            <li>I cover my face, being super conscientious near the eyes.  </li>
            <li>and it feels super soft</li>
            <li>The second time I experienced no peeling and no rough patches, left it on for 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>product is also very drying on the skin.</li>
            <li>You really have to follow the instructions and have some patience.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have used it twice at this point and really do see a bit of difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I also made the baking soda mix to counteract as a post treatment and got some gentle moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal loves.</li>
            <li>I had a 5% peel, but it really didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I simply fill the lid with product and kind of squeeze the corners of the brush in, but it saturates it enough to work.  </li>
            <li>also recently found out that this is really effective at smoothing out my keritis pilaris on my upper arms.</li>
            <li>Love this product but careful if you are new to using it.</li>
            <li>The next morning, I had some slightly rough patches around the chin and light, light peeling.  </li>
            <li>the last time a got a facial the girl told me that I was breaking out so much on my cheeks and chin because I needed to exfoliate more.</li>
            <li>next day I notice I had mild surface burn.</li>
            <li>This is very weak in my opinion, I think its a great start if your scared of peels.</li>
            <li>: pores are looking clearer,scars look smaller and my skin looks fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li>Is this normal??</li>
            <li>I wear a sun block everyday which is imperative to keep from damaging the new healthy skin.</li>
            <li>if  I  use this product again it will  only be  in the winter and fall when the sun is not as hot.</li>
            <li>bought this 25% peel, and started using it by mixing 3/4 water and 1/4 acid in a separate bottle, and then adding more acid (not more water) to the container after each use so my skin could get used to the intensity of the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a natural glow.</li>
            <li>This is gentle enough to do weekly.  </li>
            <li>I use it about twice a week to keep my arms soft.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t see results in the hyper pigmentation, I will get a more serious peel this winter.  </li>
            <li>at 25% and minimal stinging than do a higher concentration and burn my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to chemical peels, so I chose a relatively low concentration to get started (25%) as I&#x27;m terrified of melting my face off!  </li>
            <li>and I live in southern California, so</li>
            <li>great from my chronically bad skin.</li>

            <li> so please know what youre doing and do not leave it on too long...</li>
            <li> YOU after the tightness &amp; sunburn look made my face break out with little white dots along with red splotty round deep acne &amp; my pores</li>
            <li> I applied the product and left it on less than 2 minutes .The  </li>
            <li> As the day passed my skin started to peel and became very dry.</li>
            <li> But as I did subsequent treatments I could leave the peel on for a few minutes longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never really write reviews</li>
            <li> Use carefully....</li>
            <li> I used my clarisonic and the rough patches softened up within another day.  </li>
            <li> I also had one open pimple and it dried it up immediately!  </li>
            <li> I had instant results my skin was softer, feels great,and  no longer looks dull.</li>
            <li> this is because of my dark complexion.</li>
            <li> It ruins marble.</li>
            <li> like less than 5 minutes..  </li>
            <li> You would waste a ton of product with a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> I know results usually take time to notice, so I was patient.</li>

            <li> I wasted my money &amp; sadly I don&#x27;t have it to throw away like this.</li>
            <li> , what a waste, I want to cry!!!</li>
            <li> , I thought it was to enhance my skin not make it worse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong there or not...</li>
            <li> It would be impossible for me to keep it on my skin longer than the 2 minutes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ilove those glycolic s its result awesome its better to follow the manufacturer direction its really good for pigmentation problems im an aesthetician and cosmotologist ilove it.</li>
            <li> I love that after i use the peel my skin looks healthier and more refreshed. It has a natural glow. The peel is used once a week and i noticed it helps remove acne scars. I also use it when i feel like i am going to get a breakout. I apply it to the area and it works too.</li>
            <li> this product is very strong. I have never use Glycolic acid before. this product will burn your skin if you do not know how to use it. I applied the product and left it on less than 2 minutes .The  next day I notice I had mild surface burn. they were not bad and you had to get  pretty close to me to notice .Maybe  this is because of my dark complexion. As the day passed my skin started to peel and became very dry. Also you must use sun screen to protect you skin after using this ,product because you will easily burn .In  my  opinion the product does work ,but if  I  use this product again it will  only be  in the winter and fall when the sun is not as hot. product is also very drying on the skin.</li>
            <li> I just finished my 4th once a week peel. This product is actually working better as time goes on. I have thick oily skin,large pores and some minor&lt;br /&gt;acne scarring and I can see the difference now: pores are looking clearer,scars look smaller and my skin looks fresh and glowing. The first time I&lt;br /&gt;did the peel I had it on for 2 minutes and it does sting a bit. But as I did subsequent treatments I could leave the peel on for a few minutes longer.&lt;br /&gt;It works better to apply with a brush than a cotton ball. You really have to follow the instructions and have some patience. I would rather do this&lt;br /&gt;peel at 25% and minimal stinging than do a higher concentration and burn my skin. Also I have read that consistent exfoliation at a lower % is far&lt;br /&gt;better for your skin-less damaging and thinning over time. I will stop the treatments in April,when the sun gets stronger. I wear a sun block everyday which is imperative to keep from damaging the new healthy skin. There is plenty in the bottle,so I will also peel my decollete, tops of feet and hands.&lt;br /&gt;Also I have noticed my vitamin serum is absorbing into my skin far better. All around I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used higher strength, but had to dilute. Excited to try this percentage!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and already see a difference in my skin. It even feels firm to the touch!! Can&#x27;t wait to order more products from this fabulous company!</li>
            <li> i only used it once - but so far so good</li>
            <li> This seller is awesome!  This product doesn&#x27;t have any extra fillers and the product it just as described.  Make sure you ease into the chemical peels by leaving it on for the required amount of time.  I have only done one peel, but already my skin looks more glowy and fresh!  YES!  My products arrived quickly and who can beat the free shipping on any order?  Great experience on many levels.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions diligently. I know results usually take time to notice, so I was patient. I was hoped to see at least a little difference, but unfortunately I did not. Maybe someone else will have better luck with this...</li>
            <li> Works great. Shipping was fact.</li>
            <li> I never really write reviews but I just got this in the mail today and was very excited to try it. I had instant results my skin was softer, feels great,and  no longer looks dull. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this product!!!</li>
            <li> Use carefully....especially if you are just starting with peels.  I dilute it and apply with cotton pad and that seems to be perfect.  Full strength would burn my skin, but then again I am sensitive to things like this.  That being said, I have used it twice at this point and really do see a bit of difference in my skin.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks after 3-6 months!</li>
            <li> I will update as I go along.  I bought this item with the intent of removing some relatively minor post acne hyper pigmentation on my chin.  This isn&#x27;t super severe for me and is mostly covered with makeup.  I think the hyper pigmentation is more noticeable than others, as I&#x27;ve mentioned to 2 friends that I want to get some treatments done for my acne &#x27;scars&#x27; and they comment that they can&#x27;t see them.  They&#x27;re definitely visible, I just thing they&#x27;re not distracting.  I mention all of this to let you know where I&#x27;m starting.  I&#x27;m new to chemical peels, so I chose a relatively low concentration to get started (25%) as I&#x27;m terrified of melting my face off!  I used a pre-peel product by Image Perfect and stopped all other &#x27;harsh&#x27; chemicals leading up to this.  It&#x27;s summer and I live in southern California, so I scheduled this on a Monday to not interfere with my weekend :)  I also made the baking soda mix to counteract as a post treatment and got some gentle moisturizer.  I applied this to my face, timer on standby, with a fan brush.  I swear, this bottle will last forever using a fan brush.  You would waste a ton of product with a cotton ball.  Get a brush!  I simply fill the lid with product and kind of squeeze the corners of the brush in, but it saturates it enough to work.  I cover my face, being super conscientious near the eyes.  It will burn.  It burns immediately upon application. I hung in there for 2.5 minutes the first time.  I dipped a washcloth in the baking soda water and washed it off afterwards.  It burned to wash off, even with the baking soda, so I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong there or not...but the burn dissipates relatively quickly.  Results: I didn&#x27;t see any immediate results with the hyper pigmentation, but I think that would be asking too much for one application of a 25% formula!  I will say it made my skin appear tighter and pores appear smaller.  I also had one open pimple and it dried it up immediately!  Immediately after, my skin wasreddish, but it faded pretty quickly.  The next morning, I had some slightly rough patches around the chin and light, light peeling.  I used my clarisonic and the rough patches softened up within another day.  This is gentle enough to do weekly.  I have done this twice.  The second time I experienced no peeling and no rough patches, left it on for 3 minutes.  It still burned like heck!  I&#x27;m going to try this weekly until the bottle runs out.  If I don&#x27;t see results in the hyper pigmentation, I will get a more serious peel this winter.  I will continue to  update with my progress.</li>
            <li> Top of the line, I use it once a week and look twenty again. This is the real deal loves.</li>
            <li> the last time a got a facial the girl told me that I was breaking out so much on my cheeks and chin because I needed to exfoliate more. I had a 5% peel, but it really didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this 25% peel, and started using it by mixing 3/4 water and 1/4 acid in a separate bottle, and then adding more acid (not more water) to the container after each use so my skin could get used to the intensity of the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how people are getting burns from this stuff because it HURTS and BURNS. It would be impossible for me to keep it on my skin longer than the 2 minutes. I only use it on my face once a week and it feels super soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recently found out that this is really effective at smoothing out my keritis pilaris on my upper arms. I use it about twice a week to keep my arms soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product but careful if you are new to using it.</li>
            <li> This is very weak in my opinion, I think its a great start if your scared of peels. I am upgrading to the 50 percent.</li>
            <li> UGH I wish I didn&#x27;t get this. This is my first ever peel &amp; after doing much research chose Glycolic bcuz I didn&#x27;t want napalm with flesh falling from my face so i stuck with this lower %. Well this did nothing but made my face MIND YOU after the tightness &amp; sunburn look made my face break out with little white dots along with red splotty round deep acne &amp; my pores look even bigger, it almost looks like I have prickly heat on my face &amp; NO PEELING what so ever &amp; it&#x27;s been 4 days. NOW you would think I would peel being that this is my first time to ever do one.  Is this normal?? I am scared to even attempt to use it again bcuz what if the same thing happens?? I wasted my money &amp; sadly I don&#x27;t have it to throw away like this. &amp; yes beofre anyone asked I followed the direction to a T bcuz I wanted the best results, common this IS MY FACE why would I want to have it messed up?? That defeats the purpose of me even getting this, I thought it was to enhance my skin not make it worse. I even stayed in the house for 3 days with no sun exposure, what a waste, I want to cry!!!</li>
            <li> great from my chronically bad skin. this is acid and can burn your skin terribly so please know what youre doing and do not leave it on too long...like less than 5 minutes..  after use please make sure you use something to counter act the acid. I prefer olive oil and hydrocortisone 1%.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff-it burns the skin right off your face-and have a baking soda paste handy for any mishaps. It ruins marble.</li>
