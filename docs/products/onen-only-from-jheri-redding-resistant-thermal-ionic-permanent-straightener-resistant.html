            <li>My hair looks and feels great!</li>
            <li>Makes amazing results!!!  </li>
            <li>Great price and shipping time!</li>
            <li>This is so much better than a relaxer!!!</li>
            <li>so the curls get pulled out and my hair doesn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
            <li>Words can&#x27;t describe how happy I am with the results. :D</li>
            <li>perfect, product works as advertised, for a change lol</li>
            <li>solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed that kit even included the shampoo and that there was a good amount of the product.  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy that they came along.</li>
            <li>Kind of time consuming but a great product!!</li>
            <li>Also great for getting rid of frizz.</li>
            <li>The result of strengthening is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product for people like me who refuse to embrace the curls we were \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I will honestly say that if you follow the directions step by step you will get the best results.</li>
            <li>I had a great experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>But, surprising, the chemicals greatly improved hair texture, quality, it now holds moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took her advice because my hair turned out wonderful!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;ve done what she did in the comfort of my own bathroom at home!</li>
            <li>if you have put relaxers in your hair you can do it yourself but it would be wise to have someone help you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it looks really good now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has now been almost 2 weeks and her hair is still gorgeous and no sign of damage to the hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried name brands like Matrix and they are not so good for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li>I loved how my hair looked afterwards though</li>
            <li>Good Luck</li>
            <li>My hair didnt feel all that good</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people go into these treatments thinking they will have perfectly styled hair right after stepping out of the shower...</li>
            <li>Trust me good product if the right person does it for you!!!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>so impressed that Julie R. did this herself - it really is a two-man job!</li>
            <li>once that is done and I can use the after-care products on it, I am sure it will be even silkier and shinier!</li>
            <li>Anywho, this is an amazing product....</li>
            <li>My hair looks amazing    </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to do my own hair though</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to do my own hair though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product on my own hair more times than I can count with great success, and I&#x27;ve used it to successfully straighten friends&#x27; hair as well.</li>
            <li>I can literally wash my hair and walk out the door and have perfectly straightened, soft, shiny, frizz-free hair.  </li>
            <li>I can literally wash my hair and walk out the door and have perfectly straightened, soft, shiny, frizz-free hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit time consuming to process it, but when done right, accompanied with good maintenance products and care, you can achieve better than salon looks every day!   </li>
            <li>This product did not work the way it was advertised, but I was still pretty happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Ok Im done rambling</li>
            <li>:) peace out.</li>
            <li>it just looks more damaged now.</li>
            <li>My hair is way softer, shiny and tangle free!</li>
            <li>I Just used this product and I have to say I am quite satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li>and her hair has never been better.  </li>
            <li>It shouldn&#x27;t be too overwhelming, though, if you&#x27;re A:</li>
            <li>so I recommend purchasing more than one at a time</li>
            <li>After reading some reviews, I knew to expect my hair to stink and be kinda funky until I would be able to wash it</li>
            <li>hair looks FANTASTIC now!</li>
            <li>hair is softer, has more shine, and about 90% of the frizz is gone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am so glad a found this and will be ordering more in 4-6 months to use again.</li>
            <li>I truly love this thing, I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it</li>
            <li>:-)br /&gt;Rinse your hair for 5 to 7 mins.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m just doing my part :-)</li>
            <li>will prob pay $20 - $40 because some money is better than no money for them</li>
            <li>My hair had mostly grown out since then</li>
            <li>I followed the directions step by step so that I would get the best results, however when I opened the container it had several brown crud rings around it.</li>
            <li>I used this on myself last week and I am VERY happy with the results.</li>
            <li>On top of that the stylist gave me the impression it wouldn&#x27;t cost more than $300 -</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep your hair moist!&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>you will be extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I would use this again although I sure do wish I knew why it never passed that knot test...</li>
            <li>Works great, even better than those higher price brands and strongly reccomend this product, easy for non-profeesionale home care use..</li>
            <li>They are very smooth easily.     </li>
            <li>The product itself is pretty good, it worked on my hair.</li>
            <li>One &#x27;N Only had some great looking reviews and an amazingly affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more reviews I read the more excited</li>
            <li>my hair is very healthy, VERY straight.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about your hair becoming \\&quot;too straight\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Pretty awesome for a busy mom.</li>
            <li>Much better than the salon straightening and caused no damage and left it even looking more healthy!!  </li>
            <li>Completely honest review: My hair is straight and 3/4 of it feels incredibly soft and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow instructions         </li>
            <li>I received the product very quickly.     </li>
            <li>For a temporary solution, keratin treatments are good, just gotta apply them more frequently</li>
            <li>An easy solution to not do what I did is, one:do the strand test closer to your roots</li>
            <li>This stuff is as strong if not stronger then the salon product.</li>
            <li>If you can, get the newer Thermal Ionic - the chemicals don&#x27;t smell as strong.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, if you have long hair a shower cap isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, if you have long hair a shower cap isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
            <li>She has tight kinky curly hair and it did an  awesome job!!  </li>
            <li>Its been months and my hair is still silky smooth from root to tip.</li>
            <li>I used to straighten my hair every day and found that the Japanese straightening treatment was a great substitute and time saver.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product for people like me who refuse to embrace the curls we were \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with.</li>
            <li>I used Enjoy Hydrating Shampoo, Hydrating Conditioner and Hair Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used Enjoy Hydrating Shampoo, Hydrating Conditioner and Hair Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really happy with the results; It works just the same.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to leave it on until you can tell your hair&#x27;s bondage is gone.  </li>
            <li>No way in hell I&#x27;d ever pay to have thermal reconditioning done at a salon when this is easily available and works so well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, plainly put.</li>
            <li>so she could make sure this was done right.</li>
            <li>did my hair 1 month ago and my hair is still sleek and straight without any damage.&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re not expecting thermal reconditioning like you&#x27;d get in a salon this is a great product for the money.  </li>
            <li>For those familiar with the hair typing system, my hair would fall into the 3c/4a category.</li>
            <li>It took me three hours, but was totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I hit it quickly with a straightening iron just to smooth it a bit</li>
            <li>I just wanted it to be straight and more manageable.</li>
            <li>It is shiny, silky, and full of body.</li>
            <li>There were a few wavy strands in the very back which I am going to blame my own straightening job for, but otherwise my hair looked perfect.</li>
            <li>It took several hours and the result was not as good as I</li>
            <li>I GENTLY combed my hair every once in a while to be sure it was all covered.  </li>
            <li>or you won&#x27;t get the full effect of the chemical.</li>
            <li>But after watching my niece and following Julie R.&#x27;s great directions, I&#x27;m inspired to try it on my own next time.</li>
            <li>and I will need a trim, but overall, it&#x27;s pretty nice!</li>
            <li>This will help to better ensure that every inch of your hair has been treated with high heat to lock in</li>
            <li>This will help to better ensure that every inch of your hair has been treated with high heat to lock in the product.    </li>
            <li>Very pleased with one &#x27;n only!</li>
            <li>but others have said they use a very hot setting anyways).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have somebod that can easily stand up (while you sit) and blow dry and straighten for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have somebod that can easily stand up (while you sit) and blow dry and straighten for you.</li>
            <li>I wonder though, why my hair still sprung back with pretty good vigor when doing the knot test..</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what it said it would!  </li>
            <li>I miss my stylist but am grateful for such a patient and generous niece, for this phenomenal product, and for not having to spend 4 hours and $300+ every 5 months at the salon!</li>
            <li>Enjoy your new hair!!</li>
            <li>Six years ago, I found an amazing stylist who convinced me to try Thermal Ionic and well, if six years later I&#x27;m still using it, what does that tell you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>And defiantly worth the money</li>
            <li>It will feel thicker since the shaft of the hair has opened, absorbed the product and grown in size (or so the interwebs tells me)&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Destroyed my hair like other people have stated, i have had good experience with One&#x27;n</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve ever colored your own hair and can use a flat iron, you can do this yourself at home!  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve ever colored your own hair and can use a flat iron, you can do this yourself at home!  </li>
            <li>the past after every sitting (3.5-4hrs)at the salon, I came home with incredibly sleek straight shiny conditioned hair.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re like me and order double of hair products because of how much hair you have, this box comes with way more than plenty!</li>
            <li>That being said, I have had the curliest, most unimaginably thick, and grown long, monstrous amounts of hair, two bottles of dye kind of hair, HAVE to wash twice kind of hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff was just about as easy to use as anything else I&#x27;ve tried, none of which has worked nearly this well.</li>
            <li>straight and most parts feel soft..</li>
            <li>It almost looks as if the actual texture of my hair has changed and its very light and bouncy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;~My hair is also very, very, VERY thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tons and tons of hard to manage hair lol.</li>
            <li>This is even more low maintnence than my dreads.</li>
            <li>Ive tried hot rollers, curling irons...</li>
            <li>I used this product once and it worked pretty well</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a hot enough hot iron.  </li>
            <li>It burnt my hair to a crisp</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fairly straight!  </li>
            <li>We just covered my hair with plastic wrap to make sure it was kept back and out of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We just covered my hair with plastic wrap to make sure it was kept back and out of my face.     </li>
            <li>I first found out about this product from an article on instructables.com entitled \\&quot;How to do Thermal Reconditioning Treatment at Home\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Only works better on her hair.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s humid or raining or hot it will lose a lot of its straightness by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>many products, I can tell this product can make the same result as hair salon does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It turned out pretty well, but I feel like my hair could&#x27;ve been straighter.</li>
            <li>I now have straight hair without having to straighten it!</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly as written</li>
            <li>bought the Thermal Ionic from Amazon, printed off Julie R.&#x27;s review (one of the first ones listed in the reviews and a 5 star) and had my niece home for vaca from college</li>
            <li>My hair is now pretty pin</li>
            <li>Now its almost completely straight right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Well, except when I repeatedly burned myself with the flat iron. :-)</li>
            <li>By the time I got to the front of my hair, it was crimped from the clips, so I touched it up with the flat iron before applying Step 2, just to be sure it didn&#x27;t stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>The results are amazing and now I can sleep in an extra 20-30 minutes without having to stress over getting my hair fixed in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results are amazing and now I can sleep in an extra 20-30 minutes without having to stress over getting my hair fixed in time.     </li>
            <li>It has never dried out and is lovely soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>(I have VERY porous and resistant hair) but afterward, my hair was straight and resistant to humidity!</li>
            <li>and Im not sure how good the chemicals are on your skin.</li>
            <li>I GENTLY combed my hair every once in a while to be sure it was all covered.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to cover your hair with plastic wrap (while keeping it as straight as possible) while it processes, but I didn&#x27;t have any</li>
            <li>I still have to run a flat iron over my hair to completely smooth it after blow drying but the result is so much better and last longer.</li>
            <li>I decided against getting the formula for highlighted hair as I was worried it would not be strong enough.  </li>
            <li>When I used to go to the salon for these treatments, they&#x27;d leave the treatment in until they were certain my hair&#x27;s curl was no longer there.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to be certain).  </li>
            <li>And since the price is less than what most women spend on a hair cut by itself, I think it&#x27;s highly worth it.nd</li>
            <li>And since the price is less than what most women spend on a hair cut by itself, I think it&#x27;s highly worth it.</li>
            <li>But that is hardly the problem, who cares if it smells if it works good?</li>
            <li>If you follow the instruction well, you will get such a sleek, straight, and smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;Trying</li>
            <li>My hair is kinky in some places, straight in some, wavy in others...</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t that straight when I woke up today</li>
            <li>After about a week or so the texture started to even out, and now my hair is still curly, but much easier to comb, style, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- my hair is now much straighter, but still has body.</li>
            <li>Everytime I decide on a permanent straight look, this is the product I will always buy.</li>
            <li>and it was VERY pricey.</li>
            <li>the rest of it was stick straight.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really been wanting to get it done again...</li>
            <li>Your hair has to stay straight while the product is setting...</li>
            <li>Your hair has to stay straight while the product is setting...</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>worked very well.</li>
            <li>I did it myself,the whole thing took about 3.5 hours.</li>
            <li>Then gently comb that through your hair.</li>
            <li>This is the step that determines how straight your hair comes out at the end.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product not expecting much</li>
            <li>My hair is straight like I want it and feels healthier  </li>
            <li>it works really well</li>
            <li>and my curly hair become straight.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it made it stick straight.  </li>
            <li>I can now cut my hair short and not have it go to frizz, but a fabulous hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still straight...</li>
            <li>did I apply too much conditioner?</li>
            <li>I used Matrix Opti-smooth the first time and it came out okay (not super straight).  </li>
            <li>Just heat protectant serum or spray when I flat iron it...and its feather light and blows in the wind.  </li>
            <li>every other day(I straighten it more for convenience than style).  </li>
            <li>After using One &#x27;n Only Resistant Thermal Ionic Permanent Straightener, my hair is stick straight and very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well on my hair, I was a little surprised to be honest.</li>
            <li>I used the One and Only brand and my hair is super straight.</li>
            <li>I had a Japanese straightening treatment done on my hair about a year and a half ago and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>No matter what the regulations are on that stuff,  the less processing, the better.   </li>
            <li>and it was soft, pin straight and very</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who has resistant, super curly hair.</li>
            <li>After using this product, however, my hair dries in gentle waves if I let it dry naturally, and I can hit it with a flat iron and be ready to run out the door with sleek, smooth hair in under 10 minutes (as opposed to the full hour</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to subject it to more high heat than necissary</li>
            <li>Am I able to straighten my hair with a flat iron without my hair being I think 20% wet like the directions say, or can I just wait for my hair to be completely dry and then straighten it because I feel like it wouldve worked better</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that this product has worked so well for other people but for me it was nothing but a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re more on the curly side and want pin-straight hair with little to no effort, you might not want to try this stuff.  </li>
            <li>By the way I have natural wavy hair and straight in the roots.</li>
            <li>turn into a huge fluff ball.</li>
            <li>I did this about 2 weeks ago and my hair is just more dead than before I did it</li>
            <li>I can actually manage my hair and it is pretty straight .</li>
            <li>I read several reviews and thought for $30 it was worth the risk.</li>
            <li>I have wasted many hours and a lot of money on products that don&#x27;t work...until this one.</li>
            <li>I purchased the normal formula..</li>
            <li>I believe this is due to the fact that the hair won&#x27;t hold a curl after this procedure, which is fine with me as I&#x27;ve never worn my hair curly anyways</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the resistant formula on bleached hair, don&#x27;t leave the product on your hair too long, and make sure your flat iron is a ceramic that gets up to 450 degrees</li>
            <li>You may want to curl your ends in a little bit to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;~The loop method of strand testing was new to us; we might have over/under processed some spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes it so easy to style my hair and takes me a lot less time in the mornings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The results were much better than any relaxers I&#x27;d used in the past.</li>
            <li>My hair looks EXACTLY THE SAME.</li>
            <li>I was anxious to try this out but after looking through the directions I decided I better get somebody to help me.</li>
            <li>I corresponded with the author and she recommended this product over Rusk Str8, the system she first used, not only because this one is cheaper but according to her, One&#x27;n</li>
            <li>It was a long process for me at about five hours, but it was completely worth it.</li>
            <li>When I woke up each morning, I would touch it up with a flat iron to keep it straight, but don&#x27;t overdo it since too much heat/tugging could damage it at this point.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s been about 9 months since my first time using it, and now that my curls have grown back quite a bit I want to do another treatment.  </li>
            <li>My ends are kind of dry/split, but they needed help before this process since I haven&#x27;t gotten a hair cut in about 9 months and dried and flat</li>
            <li>My ends are kind of dry/split, but they needed help before this process since I haven&#x27;t gotten a hair cut in about 9 months and dried and flat</li>
            <li>and I can let it air dry without it looking like a hot mess for the first time ever in my life!!!</li>
            <li>flat iron might not have been quite hot enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the moment my hair looks soft and very straight after using the product and the flat iron.</li>
            <li>half Sicilian, and my natural hair looks like the bride of Frankenstein got into a fight with a vindictive light socket and lost.</li>
            <li>It took me about three and a half hours to do it myself, without help, but it was well worth it!  </li>
            <li>It took me about four hours to complete the process.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is probably as course as they come.    </li>
            <li>got my mom to help me as she helps me with the old kits as well.  </li>
            <li>Here are some of my theories of why it didn&#x27;t completely work:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and it didn&#x27;t burn one bit.  </li>
            <li>I let my hair airdry after the final step of the process and much to my suprise</li>
            <li>I have a friend who is a professional stylist</li>
            <li>This is the process that I used (wear gloves and an old towel/salon cape for the Step 1 and Step 2 processes):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(try to keep it as straight as possible, even though this seems contradictory)&lt;br /&gt;Taking</li>
            <li>a professional first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a professional first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it completely destroyed my hair</li>
            <li>It took me 5 hours to complete my hair done</li>
            <li>I have NEVER liked my hair and have many times cut it almost boy-short because of how unmanageable it is...</li>
            <li>((((( The process with Rusk reminds me of the old over-the-counter straighteners (with lye) that anyone could do.</li>
            <li>I brought this product in when I saw a professional hair dresser</li>
            <li>I love how thick the formula is so it didn&#x27;t drip all over the place.  </li>
            <li>I notice a little hairspary on the roller works a little better when hot rolling, but it still drops after a while.</li>
            <li>and it was still straight and used the flat iron on it</li>
            <li>I have pin straight hair for the first time since I was little.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy/curly and looks nice when it&#x27;s short, but my hair is long (half-way down my back)</li>
            <li>but the results are totally worth the tiny bit of dry ends that I will trim...</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to use the normal formula and then have to go back and redo it if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>it normally takes to flat iron my hair in its natural state).</li>
            <li>$30 and a full day wasted</li>
            <li>so she didn&#x27;t move super fast and my hair got a little dry while waiting to get flat-ironed.</li>
            <li>provided)&lt;br /&gt;Get out of the shower and towel dry and gently comb your hair</li>
            <li>I did use some dry shampoo in the morning since my hair gets very oily.  </li>
            <li>I did use some dry shampoo in the morning since my hair gets very oily.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to bite the bullet and pay the big bucks to get it straightened at a salon but decided to try this as a last ditch effort for afforadable permanent</li>
            <li>Blow drying hair as thick as mine can take easily 30 minutes and longer.</li>
            <li>After this treatment, air drying is not only faster but it doesn&#x27;t dry and turn into a huge fluff ball.</li>
            <li>1/4\\&quot; sections again, flat iron your hair at a 90 degree angle from your head and get it as straight as possible.  </li>
            <li>(I made this mistake a couple times - if you feel like this isn&#x27;t straightening your hair very well or the curl comes back before the hair grows out, check the max temperature of the flat iron you used to process it.</li>
            <li>She wasn&#x27;t familar with the product but the instructions were clear enough for us to easiy follow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took about 5 hours total, but I think I could shave some time off of that because I do not have a sensitive scalp and can massage the product in rather than sectioning.</li>
            <li>We finally figured out that it was the relaxers when I was 30 years old.</li>
            <li>I used my Remington Wet 2 Straight on its hottest setting.  </li>
            <li>Well I read some reviews saying that takes at least 5 hours but took me almost 3 hours; maybe I should had left the product more time in my hair but it will be next time.</li>
            <li>I had a considerable amount of grow out since the last treatment, so the hair growing in was wavy and</li>
            <li>it was very runny for some reason, so be careful when pouring it out)</li>
            <li>but it is the most frustrating process trying to find who to contact</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty straight after a wash, and it takes no more than 20 mins to thoroughly straighten my hair with a flat iron (as opposed to the 2 hours it used to take)</li>
            <li>I wasted 8 hours because i wanted to make sure each section of hair was meticulously straitened and i was doing this alone and have pretty thick and long hair.</li>
            <li>a hot mess.  </li>
            <li>my hair texture is very curly african american, white and native american mixed hair type.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking Carrot top or Polamalu after a football game - not his commercial hair.</li>
            <li>and I now have the whole process down to 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>then again where the damage from previous products is and two:when the bottom&#x27;s ready, you just spray it with water to deactivate it while the rest of your hair is still doing its thing.</li>
            <li>Continue to perform knot tests on different sections of hair until knots in all different parts of your hair stay closed (back, front, bangs, near the root, near the ends, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>it is thick, curly, and SUPER frizzy...</li>
            <li>The bad smell is worth it !!!!</li>
            <li>This step is a little runny, so I poured it onto my gloved hand and gently rubbed/blotted it onto my hair.  </li>
            <li>It probably would have gone a little faster with help from a friend, but none of my friends are as much of a perfectionist as I am.  </li>

            <li> Makes amazing results!!!  </li>
            <li> Great price and shipping time!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than a relaxer!!!</li>
            <li> so the curls get pulled out and my hair doesn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t describe how happy I am with the results. :D</li>
            <li> perfect, product works as advertised, for a change lol</li>
            <li> solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed that kit even included the shampoo and that there was a good amount of the product.  </li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy that they came along.</li>
            <li> Kind of time consuming but a great product!!</li>

            <li> Amazing!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took her advice because my hair turned out wonderful!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;ve done what she did in the comfort of my own bathroom at home!</li>
            <li> if you have put relaxers in your hair you can do it yourself but it would be wise to have someone help you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it looks really good now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has now been almost 2 weeks and her hair is still gorgeous and no sign of damage to the hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried name brands like Matrix and they are not so good for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li> I loved how my hair looked afterwards though</li>

            <li> My hair didnt feel all that good</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> so impressed that Julie R. did this herself - it really is a two-man job!</li>

            <li> It is a bit time consuming to process it, but when done right, accompanied with good maintenance products and care, you can achieve better than salon looks every day!   </li>
            <li> This product did not work the way it was advertised, but I was still pretty happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Ok Im done rambling</li>

            <li> and her hair has never been better.  </li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t be too overwhelming, though, if you&#x27;re A:</li>
            <li> so I recommend purchasing more than one at a time</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews, I knew to expect my hair to stink and be kinda funky until I would be able to wash it</li>
            <li> hair looks FANTASTIC now!</li>
            <li> hair is softer, has more shine, and about 90% of the frizz is gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am so glad a found this and will be ordering more in 4-6 months to use again.</li>
            <li> I truly love this thing, I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it</li>
            <li> :-)br /&gt;Rinse your hair for 5 to 7 mins.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just doing my part :-)</li>
            <li> will prob pay $20 - $40 because some money is better than no money for them</li>
            <li> My hair had mostly grown out since then</li>
            <li> I followed the directions step by step so that I would get the best results, however when I opened the container it had several brown crud rings around it.</li>
            <li> I used this on myself last week and I am VERY happy with the results.</li>
            <li> On top of that the stylist gave me the impression it wouldn&#x27;t cost more than $300 -</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep your hair moist!&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> you will be extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I would use this again although I sure do wish I knew why it never passed that knot test...</li>
            <li> Works great, even better than those higher price brands and strongly reccomend this product, easy for non-profeesionale home care use..</li>
            <li> They are very smooth easily.     </li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty good, it worked on my hair.</li>
            <li> One &#x27;N Only had some great looking reviews and an amazingly affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The more reviews I read the more excited</li>
            <li> my hair is very healthy, VERY straight.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about your hair becoming \\&quot;too straight\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome for a busy mom.</li>
            <li> Much better than the salon straightening and caused no damage and left it even looking more healthy!!  </li>
            <li> Completely honest review: My hair is straight and 3/4 of it feels incredibly soft and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions         </li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly.     </li>
            <li> For a temporary solution, keratin treatments are good, just gotta apply them more frequently</li>
            <li> An easy solution to not do what I did is, one:do the strand test closer to your roots</li>
            <li> This stuff is as strong if not stronger then the salon product.</li>
            <li> If you can, get the newer Thermal Ionic - the chemicals don&#x27;t smell as strong.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if you have long hair a shower cap isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if you have long hair a shower cap isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
            <li> She has tight kinky curly hair and it did an  awesome job!!  </li>
            <li> Its been months and my hair is still silky smooth from root to tip.</li>
            <li> I used to straighten my hair every day and found that the Japanese straightening treatment was a great substitute and time saver.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product for people like me who refuse to embrace the curls we were \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with.</li>
            <li> I used Enjoy Hydrating Shampoo, Hydrating Conditioner and Hair Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Enjoy Hydrating Shampoo, Hydrating Conditioner and Hair Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the results; It works just the same.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to leave it on until you can tell your hair&#x27;s bondage is gone.  </li>
            <li> No way in hell I&#x27;d ever pay to have thermal reconditioning done at a salon when this is easily available and works so well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, plainly put.</li>
            <li> so she could make sure this was done right.</li>
            <li> did my hair 1 month ago and my hair is still sleek and straight without any damage.&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not expecting thermal reconditioning like you&#x27;d get in a salon this is a great product for the money.  </li>
            <li> For those familiar with the hair typing system, my hair would fall into the 3c/4a category.</li>
            <li> It took me three hours, but was totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I hit it quickly with a straightening iron just to smooth it a bit</li>
            <li> I just wanted it to be straight and more manageable.</li>
            <li> It is shiny, silky, and full of body.</li>
            <li> There were a few wavy strands in the very back which I am going to blame my own straightening job for, but otherwise my hair looked perfect.</li>
            <li> It took several hours and the result was not as good as I</li>
            <li> I GENTLY combed my hair every once in a while to be sure it was all covered.  </li>
            <li> or you won&#x27;t get the full effect of the chemical.</li>
            <li> But after watching my niece and following Julie R.&#x27;s great directions, I&#x27;m inspired to try it on my own next time.</li>
            <li> and I will need a trim, but overall, it&#x27;s pretty nice!</li>
            <li> This will help to better ensure that every inch of your hair has been treated with high heat to lock in</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have somebod that can easily stand up (while you sit) and blow dry and straighten for you.</li>

            <li> I wonder though, why my hair still sprung back with pretty good vigor when doing the knot test..</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what it said it would!  </li>
            <li> I miss my stylist but am grateful for such a patient and generous niece, for this phenomenal product, and for not having to spend 4 hours and $300+ every 5 months at the salon!</li>
            <li> Enjoy your new hair!!</li>
            <li> Six years ago, I found an amazing stylist who convinced me to try Thermal Ionic and well, if six years later I&#x27;m still using it, what does that tell you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> And defiantly worth the money</li>
            <li> It will feel thicker since the shaft of the hair has opened, absorbed the product and grown in size (or so the interwebs tells me)&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Destroyed my hair like other people have stated, i have had good experience with One&#x27;n</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve ever colored your own hair and can use a flat iron, you can do this yourself at home!  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve ever colored your own hair and can use a flat iron, you can do this yourself at home!  </li>
            <li> the past after every sitting (3.5-4hrs)at the salon, I came home with incredibly sleek straight shiny conditioned hair.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re like me and order double of hair products because of how much hair you have, this box comes with way more than plenty!</li>
            <li> That being said, I have had the curliest, most unimaginably thick, and grown long, monstrous amounts of hair, two bottles of dye kind of hair, HAVE to wash twice kind of hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff was just about as easy to use as anything else I&#x27;ve tried, none of which has worked nearly this well.</li>
            <li> straight and most parts feel soft..</li>
            <li> It almost looks as if the actual texture of my hair has changed and its very light and bouncy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~My hair is also very, very, VERY thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tons and tons of hard to manage hair lol.</li>
            <li> This is even more low maintnence than my dreads.</li>
            <li> Ive tried hot rollers, curling irons...</li>
            <li> I used this product once and it worked pretty well</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have a hot enough hot iron.  </li>
            <li> It burnt my hair to a crisp</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fairly straight!  </li>
            <li> We just covered my hair with plastic wrap to make sure it was kept back and out of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We just covered my hair with plastic wrap to make sure it was kept back and out of my face.     </li>
            <li> I first found out about this product from an article on instructables.com entitled \\&quot;How to do Thermal Reconditioning Treatment at Home\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Only works better on her hair.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s humid or raining or hot it will lose a lot of its straightness by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> many products, I can tell this product can make the same result as hair salon does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It turned out pretty well, but I feel like my hair could&#x27;ve been straighter.</li>
            <li> I now have straight hair without having to straighten it!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly as written</li>
            <li> bought the Thermal Ionic from Amazon, printed off Julie R.&#x27;s review (one of the first ones listed in the reviews and a 5 star) and had my niece home for vaca from college</li>
            <li> My hair is now pretty pin</li>
            <li> Now its almost completely straight right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Well, except when I repeatedly burned myself with the flat iron. :-)</li>
            <li> By the time I got to the front of my hair, it was crimped from the clips, so I touched it up with the flat iron before applying Step 2, just to be sure it didn&#x27;t stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> The results are amazing and now I can sleep in an extra 20-30 minutes without having to stress over getting my hair fixed in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It has never dried out and is lovely soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> (I have VERY porous and resistant hair) but afterward, my hair was straight and resistant to humidity!</li>
            <li> and Im not sure how good the chemicals are on your skin.</li>
            <li> I GENTLY combed my hair every once in a while to be sure it was all covered.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to cover your hair with plastic wrap (while keeping it as straight as possible) while it processes, but I didn&#x27;t have any</li>
            <li> I still have to run a flat iron over my hair to completely smooth it after blow drying but the result is so much better and last longer.</li>
            <li> I decided against getting the formula for highlighted hair as I was worried it would not be strong enough.  </li>
            <li> When I used to go to the salon for these treatments, they&#x27;d leave the treatment in until they were certain my hair&#x27;s curl was no longer there.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to be certain).  </li>
            <li> And since the price is less than what most women spend on a hair cut by itself, I think it&#x27;s highly worth it.nd</li>
            <li> And since the price is less than what most women spend on a hair cut by itself, I think it&#x27;s highly worth it.</li>
            <li> But that is hardly the problem, who cares if it smells if it works good?</li>
            <li> If you follow the instruction well, you will get such a sleek, straight, and smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;Trying</li>
            <li> My hair is kinky in some places, straight in some, wavy in others...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that straight when I woke up today</li>
            <li> After about a week or so the texture started to even out, and now my hair is still curly, but much easier to comb, style, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - my hair is now much straighter, but still has body.</li>
            <li> Everytime I decide on a permanent straight look, this is the product I will always buy.</li>
            <li> and it was VERY pricey.</li>
            <li> the rest of it was stick straight.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really been wanting to get it done again...</li>
            <li> Your hair has to stay straight while the product is setting...</li>
            <li> Your hair has to stay straight while the product is setting...</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> worked very well.</li>
            <li> I did it myself,the whole thing took about 3.5 hours.</li>
            <li> Then gently comb that through your hair.</li>
            <li> This is the step that determines how straight your hair comes out at the end.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product not expecting much</li>
            <li> My hair is straight like I want it and feels healthier  </li>
            <li> it works really well</li>
            <li> and my curly hair become straight.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it made it stick straight.  </li>
            <li> I can now cut my hair short and not have it go to frizz, but a fabulous hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still straight...</li>
            <li> did I apply too much conditioner?</li>
            <li> I used Matrix Opti-smooth the first time and it came out okay (not super straight).  </li>
            <li> Just heat protectant serum or spray when I flat iron it...and its feather light and blows in the wind.  </li>
            <li> every other day(I straighten it more for convenience than style).  </li>
            <li> After using One &#x27;n Only Resistant Thermal Ionic Permanent Straightener, my hair is stick straight and very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well on my hair, I was a little surprised to be honest.</li>
            <li> I used the One and Only brand and my hair is super straight.</li>
            <li> I had a Japanese straightening treatment done on my hair about a year and a half ago and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> No matter what the regulations are on that stuff,  the less processing, the better.   </li>
            <li> and it was soft, pin straight and very</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who has resistant, super curly hair.</li>
            <li> After using this product, however, my hair dries in gentle waves if I let it dry naturally, and I can hit it with a flat iron and be ready to run out the door with sleek, smooth hair in under 10 minutes (as opposed to the full hour</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to subject it to more high heat than necissary</li>
            <li> Am I able to straighten my hair with a flat iron without my hair being I think 20% wet like the directions say, or can I just wait for my hair to be completely dry and then straighten it because I feel like it wouldve worked better</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that this product has worked so well for other people but for me it was nothing but a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re more on the curly side and want pin-straight hair with little to no effort, you might not want to try this stuff.  </li>
            <li> By the way I have natural wavy hair and straight in the roots.</li>
            <li> turn into a huge fluff ball.</li>
            <li> I did this about 2 weeks ago and my hair is just more dead than before I did it</li>
            <li> I can actually manage my hair and it is pretty straight .</li>
            <li> I read several reviews and thought for $30 it was worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I have wasted many hours and a lot of money on products that don&#x27;t work...until this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the normal formula..</li>
            <li> I believe this is due to the fact that the hair won&#x27;t hold a curl after this procedure, which is fine with me as I&#x27;ve never worn my hair curly anyways</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the resistant formula on bleached hair, don&#x27;t leave the product on your hair too long, and make sure your flat iron is a ceramic that gets up to 450 degrees</li>
            <li> You may want to curl your ends in a little bit to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~The loop method of strand testing was new to us; we might have over/under processed some spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes it so easy to style my hair and takes me a lot less time in the mornings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The results were much better than any relaxers I&#x27;d used in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair looks EXACTLY THE SAME.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try this out but after looking through the directions I decided I better get somebody to help me.</li>
            <li> I corresponded with the author and she recommended this product over Rusk Str8, the system she first used, not only because this one is cheaper but according to her, One&#x27;n</li>
            <li> It was a long process for me at about five hours, but it was completely worth it.</li>
            <li> When I woke up each morning, I would touch it up with a flat iron to keep it straight, but don&#x27;t overdo it since too much heat/tugging could damage it at this point.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been about 9 months since my first time using it, and now that my curls have grown back quite a bit I want to do another treatment.  </li>
            <li> My ends are kind of dry/split, but they needed help before this process since I haven&#x27;t gotten a hair cut in about 9 months and dried and flat</li>

            <li> and I can let it air dry without it looking like a hot mess for the first time ever in my life!!!</li>
            <li> flat iron might not have been quite hot enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the moment my hair looks soft and very straight after using the product and the flat iron.</li>
            <li> half Sicilian, and my natural hair looks like the bride of Frankenstein got into a fight with a vindictive light socket and lost.</li>
            <li> It took me about three and a half hours to do it myself, without help, but it was well worth it!  </li>
            <li> It took me about four hours to complete the process.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is probably as course as they come.    </li>
            <li> got my mom to help me as she helps me with the old kits as well.  </li>
            <li> Here are some of my theories of why it didn&#x27;t completely work:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it didn&#x27;t burn one bit.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair airdry after the final step of the process and much to my suprise</li>
            <li> I have a friend who is a professional stylist</li>
            <li> This is the process that I used (wear gloves and an old towel/salon cape for the Step 1 and Step 2 processes):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (try to keep it as straight as possible, even though this seems contradictory)&lt;br /&gt;Taking</li>
            <li> a professional first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a professional first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it completely destroyed my hair</li>
            <li> It took me 5 hours to complete my hair done</li>
            <li> I have NEVER liked my hair and have many times cut it almost boy-short because of how unmanageable it is...</li>
            <li> ((((( The process with Rusk reminds me of the old over-the-counter straighteners (with lye) that anyone could do.</li>
            <li> I brought this product in when I saw a professional hair dresser</li>
            <li> I love how thick the formula is so it didn&#x27;t drip all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I notice a little hairspary on the roller works a little better when hot rolling, but it still drops after a while.</li>
            <li> and it was still straight and used the flat iron on it</li>
            <li> I have pin straight hair for the first time since I was little.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy/curly and looks nice when it&#x27;s short, but my hair is long (half-way down my back)</li>
            <li> but the results are totally worth the tiny bit of dry ends that I will trim...</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to use the normal formula and then have to go back and redo it if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> it normally takes to flat iron my hair in its natural state).</li>
            <li> $30 and a full day wasted</li>
            <li> so she didn&#x27;t move super fast and my hair got a little dry while waiting to get flat-ironed.</li>
            <li> provided)&lt;br /&gt;Get out of the shower and towel dry and gently comb your hair</li>
            <li> I did use some dry shampoo in the morning since my hair gets very oily.  </li>
            <li> I did use some dry shampoo in the morning since my hair gets very oily.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to bite the bullet and pay the big bucks to get it straightened at a salon but decided to try this as a last ditch effort for afforadable permanent</li>
            <li> Blow drying hair as thick as mine can take easily 30 minutes and longer.</li>
            <li> After this treatment, air drying is not only faster but it doesn&#x27;t dry and turn into a huge fluff ball.</li>
            <li> 1/4\\&quot; sections again, flat iron your hair at a 90 degree angle from your head and get it as straight as possible.  </li>
            <li> (I made this mistake a couple times - if you feel like this isn&#x27;t straightening your hair very well or the curl comes back before the hair grows out, check the max temperature of the flat iron you used to process it.</li>
            <li> She wasn&#x27;t familar with the product but the instructions were clear enough for us to easiy follow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took about 5 hours total, but I think I could shave some time off of that because I do not have a sensitive scalp and can massage the product in rather than sectioning.</li>
            <li> We finally figured out that it was the relaxers when I was 30 years old.</li>
            <li> I used my Remington Wet 2 Straight on its hottest setting.  </li>
            <li> Well I read some reviews saying that takes at least 5 hours but took me almost 3 hours; maybe I should had left the product more time in my hair but it will be next time.</li>
            <li> I had a considerable amount of grow out since the last treatment, so the hair growing in was wavy and</li>
            <li> it was very runny for some reason, so be careful when pouring it out)</li>
            <li> but it is the most frustrating process trying to find who to contact</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty straight after a wash, and it takes no more than 20 mins to thoroughly straighten my hair with a flat iron (as opposed to the 2 hours it used to take)</li>
            <li> I wasted 8 hours because i wanted to make sure each section of hair was meticulously straitened and i was doing this alone and have pretty thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> a hot mess.  </li>
            <li> my hair texture is very curly african american, white and native american mixed hair type.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking Carrot top or Polamalu after a football game - not his commercial hair.</li>
            <li> and I now have the whole process down to 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> then again where the damage from previous products is and two:when the bottom&#x27;s ready, you just spray it with water to deactivate it while the rest of your hair is still doing its thing.</li>
            <li> Continue to perform knot tests on different sections of hair until knots in all different parts of your hair stay closed (back, front, bangs, near the root, near the ends, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> it is thick, curly, and SUPER frizzy...</li>
            <li> The bad smell is worth it !!!!</li>
            <li> This step is a little runny, so I poured it onto my gloved hand and gently rubbed/blotted it onto my hair.  </li>
            <li> It probably would have gone a little faster with help from a friend, but none of my friends are as much of a perfectionist as I am.  </li>

            <li> My 13 year old daughter has naturally thick, frizzy and very unruly hair</li>
            <li> I do get some frizz after blow or air drying, but it usually calms down after a few hours or I can run a flat iron through it quickly if I need to go somewhere right away.</li>
            <li> but it cut my overall get ready time from about an hour to a half hour!  </li>
            <li> and the other was my fault, completely.</li>
            <li> It takes me ten minutes to blowdry, 15-30min to flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s manageable enough to run the flat iron</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s manageable enough to run the flat iron</li>
            <li> The only thing I can think is that they were not generous enough with applying the product, or they didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.  </li>
            <li> My flat iron only allows me to increase the temp in 50 degree increments.  </li>
            <li> If I blow dry it with a round brush, in sections, it gets pretty straight, but very fluffy</li>
            <li> would suggest if you are considering using this product to have somebody that has had experience with these or similar treatments help you...at least for the first time through.</li>

            <li> I am a guy and had long curly coarse hair, it was totally unmanageable (even straightened!)</li>

            <li> You don&#x27;t want to undo all that flat ironing that you just did!&lt;br /&gt;Taking 1/4\\</li>
            <li> your hair with a blow dryer again and point it downwards.&lt;br /&gt;Touch up any areas that need it with a flat</li>
            <li> your hair with a blow dryer again and point it downwards.&lt;br /&gt;Touch up any areas that need it with a flat</li>
            <li> So when a regular person does it takes them too long to put the product on and that&#x27;s why the hair burns.</li>
            <li> The highlighted part of my hair finally passed the knot test, but after an almost an hour, and getting worried that I was leaving the product on for too long (the directions said it would process in 7-30 minutes)</li>
            <li> and it wanted to tangle while I was selecting sections to flat iron..</li>
            <li> anyways, I plunged forward and flat ironed it all out then</li>
            <li> , it is very flat to my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had slightly wavy, very frizzy hair that had to be straightened daily and while I can&#x27;t just jump out of the shower and go I can blow dry quickly (no flat or round brush needed)</li>
            <li> It is not super curly, but if I put some product in it and let it air dry, it gets pretty wavy/curly and a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li> it was hard to figure out how much to use of the runny stuff..</li>
            <li> It is a little more complicated than the standard home-relaxer kit, and it takes a heck of a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> The smell is BAD when you put it on, and kind of smells like hair perm.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid I would end up bald :)</li>
            <li> I am shocked more African American women are not using this product.</li>
            <li> It took a long time</li>
            <li> and I had to process almost twice as long as recommended</li>
            <li> Use enough to get the hair completely wet, but not dripping.  </li>
            <li> the next 48 hours, don&#x27;t let your hair get wet, don&#x27;t wash it,</li>

            <li> Very disappointing product, My hair isn&#x27;t even that curly or wavy I just wanted it to be straight and more manageable. Smells awful and takes forever. But that is hardly the problem, who cares if it smells if it works good? But it doesn&#x27;t so don&#x27;t bother. I did this about 2 weeks ago and my hair is just more dead than before I did it but not more manageable. I got 10 inches cut off because it made it so dry!</li>
            <li> I am that person who dries and flat irons my hair, using several anti frizz smoothing products and then walking outside and not even a minute later my hair is a frizzy, curly, nasty mess. I&#x27;m talking Carrot top or Polamalu after a football game - not his commercial hair. No product has ever worked no matter what they promise - salon quality or not. This stuff is awesome, plainly put. I had to leave it in for over an hour (I have VERY porous and resistant hair) but afterward, my hair was straight and resistant to humidity! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I do get some frizz after blow or air drying, but it usually calms down after a few hours or I can run a flat iron through it quickly if I need to go somewhere right away. But I can now go to the beach and no frizzing or curling and I can let it air dry without it looking like a hot mess for the first time ever in my life!!! Also, you girls with thick hair, you know how you get that line in your hair when you put your hair in a ponytail? Well, I get the line and not even 15 minutes after I&#x27;ve taken the hair tie out, it smooths back out! Amazing! I believe this is due to the fact that the hair won&#x27;t hold a curl after this procedure, which is fine with me as I&#x27;ve never worn my hair curly anyways (even curl products, mousse or gel couldn&#x27;t get rid of the frizz without making my hair look greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 5 hours total, but I think I could shave some time off of that because I do not have a sensitive scalp and can massage the product in rather than sectioning. It says to keep it away from your scalp, but I wanted my roots done,so got all the way down to my scalp in some places and didn&#x27;t have any problems. Not saying that everyone can do this by any means at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also dye my hair with demi permanent dye (to minimize damage) and it did strip almost all of the color, so you want to keep that in mind. I redyed it a week later with no problems. I have dyed my hair with permanent dye in the past and that area did not get stripped out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added pics of how my hair looked after,  I have the long dark hair. My before hair looks very similar to the other lady&#x27;s except way frizzier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!!area did not get stripped out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added pics of how my hair looked after,  I have the long dark hair.

            <li> I used this product a few months ago. my hair texture is very curly african american, white and native american mixed hair type.  My hair is kinky in some places, straight in some, wavy in others...a hot mess.  I got tired of combing my hair so I cut it all of and grew dread locks and wore them for 5 years.  After combing out my dreads, I decided to straighten my hair, but did not want to use a typical no lye relaxer. Also because of the combing out I did not want to loose any hair length. It took me about four hours to complete the process. I was afraid I would end up bald :)but I still have all my hair. The results were much better than any relaxers I&#x27;d used in the past. I am shocked more African American women are not using this product. Its been months and my hair is still silky smooth from root to tip. It takes me ten minutes to blowdry, 15-30min to flat iron.  I actually had to get use to not having to constantly comb my hair.  Im used to being in the bathroom for hours...now im in and out. This is even more low maintnence than my dreads. It has dramatically cut down my morning routine.  my hair is very healthy, VERY straight.  and I use little product.  Just heat protectant serum or spray when I flat iron it...and its feather light and blows in the wind.  I highly recommend this product.  if you have put relaxers in your hair you can do it yourself but it would be wise to have someone help you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con for me is that curling the hair is very difficult.  Ive tried hot rollers, curling irons...and my hair will not hold a curl.  I notice a little hairspary on the roller works a little better when hot rolling, but it still drops after a while. Ok Im done rambling :) peace out.</li>
            <li> it just dryed my hair out. my hair is still wavey it just looks more damaged now.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever! Well.....I don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;EVER\\&quot; but, you know what I mean. I am a african american woman and I stopped relaxing my hair about a year ago because I was totally tired of the breakage and the unnatural flat look it gave me. I needed something because my hair was getting out of control and I decided to try this after seeing similar product on youtube. This is so much better than a relaxer!!! My hair is way softer, shiny and tangle free! It almost looks as if the actual texture of my hair has changed and its very light and bouncy. lol. I love it! And I don&#x27;t believe for a second that it will last 8 months but I shall see. Also.....Its never burned! At ALL! Well, except when I repeatedly burned myself with the flat iron. :-) But that was totally my fault. Anywho, this is an amazing product....I love it! OH! and I didn&#x27;t even use the shampoo and conditioner provided. I washed my hair the night before with Carol&#x27;s Daughter Shampoo and braided it until the next morning. And it still worked great!     Pro&#x27;s: About $500 cheaper than going to the salon         Easy to follow instructions         My hair looks amazing    Con&#x27;s: IT SMELLS AWFUL!!!         You need at least 4 hours to complete         Box says it has 2 applications, no! definitely only one use.</li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty good, it worked on my hair. However, hated the company sleek hair took forever to ship out my order. I ordered on 05/18/2010 and didnt get the product for more than 10 days !!!!</li>
            <li> I Just used this product and I have to say I am quite satisfied with the outcome. I am a guy and had long curly coarse hair, it was totally unmanageable (even straightened!) I used this product once and it worked pretty well I can actually manage my hair and it is pretty straight . It wasn&#x27;t that straight when I woke up today but I straightened it back down and it looks really good now. The instructions are a bit hard but I got through it quite well. The only complaint I have is that the step 1 lotion smells HORRIBLE but it was worth it. And defiantly worth the money</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter has naturally thick, frizzy and very unruly hair and she hates it.  I tried other hair straighteners but didn&#x27;t work.  I was ready to bite the bullet and pay the big bucks to get it straightened at a salon but decided to try this as a last ditch effort for afforadable permanent solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed that kit even included the shampoo and that there was a good amount of the product.  I thought that I would use all of the product as her hair is really thick but I only used half and when it was rinsed off and neuralised it was still straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dried the hair with a hairdryer and it was still straight and used the flat iron on it and it was soft, pin straight and very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been almost 2 weeks and her hair is still gorgeous and no sign of damage to the hair and she loves it, especially as it now takes her only 30 mins to wash, dry and flat iron her hair and if she doesn&#x27;t have time to flat iron her hair it is still straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has resistant hair.  It has saved me a fortune at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2 years since I bought this product and I have straightened my daughters&#x27; hair twice a year using it and her hair has never been better.  It has never dried out and is lovely soft and shiny.  I have ordered another 2 for the next year and I now have the whole process down to 4 hours.  I thought that I would add to my review.  Hope this helps anyone who is thinking about it, this product is wonderful and works.</li>
            <li> I had been using hair relaxers up until around 3 years ago because we finally discovered that relaxers were causing my allergic reactions. I started with relaxers around the age of 15, however, at the age of 16, I started having allergic reactions to \\&quot;something\\&quot; but my dermatologist could not determine the cause.  We finally figured out that it was the relaxers when I was 30 years old. My face, and upper body broke-out with red welts and did not go away until I stopped getting the relaxers. The problem was that my hair is so course, that I need some type of straightener. My natural hair is probably as course as they come.    I finally discovered the thermal straighteners 1 year ago. I used Matrix Opti-smooth the first time and it came out okay (not super straight).  The second time (last week) I used the One and Only brand and my hair is super straight. It is shiny, silky, and full of body. This makes it so easy to style my hair and takes me a lot less time in the mornings. I am amazed.      I do not have allergic reactions to the chemicals in the thermal straighteners and I am so happy that they came along.</li>
            <li> At the base, I have curly hair and slightly \\&quot;Crépu\\&quot; in french.     They are very smooth easily.     I received the product very quickly.     I knew how to handle, but I prefer to follow the letter leaflet in the box of the product.     Despite having followed to the letter, my hair has not budged a bit: still curly, always the same volume.     I am disappointed acr I bought quite expensive and therefore nothing.     I sent an email to customer service and after sales service the day after use (about one and a half months) ... I am still awaiting a response.     Produces very poor quality.</li>
            <li> This product did not work the way it was advertised, but I was still pretty happy with the results.  I&#x27;ve been using store-bought no-lye relaxer kits for years.  I bought this after reading the reviews, hoping it would eliminate the need for me to flat iron/ touch up my hair every other day(I straighten it more for convenience than style).  It is a little more complicated than the standard home-relaxer kit, and it takes a heck of a lot longer.  It shouldn&#x27;t be too overwhelming, though, if you&#x27;re A: used to doing these things yourself, or B: have someone to help you that has at least basic idea of what they&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my mom to help me as she helps me with the old kits as well.  Here are some of my theories of why it didn&#x27;t completely work:&lt;br /&gt;~I might not have blow-dried/ flat ironed my hair enough.&lt;br /&gt;~The flat iron might not have been quite hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;~The loop method of strand testing was new to us; we might have over/under processed some spots.&lt;br /&gt;~I have multi-racial hair (black/white), and this product might not have been made for my hair type in mind.&lt;br /&gt;~My hair is also very, very, VERY thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The End Result:&lt;br /&gt;I used this product in early-to mid June.  For the first few weeks, my hair turned out straight and vaguely wavy in the front, and curly in the back/bottom section.  After about a week or so the texture started to even out, and now my hair is still curly, but much easier to comb, style, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re more on the curly side and want pin-straight hair with little to no effort, you might not want to try this stuff.  If you&#x27;re like me and just want to make your morning routine a little easier, I would still definitely recommend it.u&#x27;re like me and just want to make your morning routine a little easier, I would still definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used this product on my sisters hair that had previously been straightened using a reverse perm in a salon. She also colors her hair. (not bleach, just tint) She has tight kinky curly hair and it did an  awesome job!!  Much better than the salon straightening and caused no damage and left it even looking more healthy!!  She has short hair and we only used about a third of the product. Kind of time consuming but a great product!!</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what it said it would!  I have pin straight hair for the first time since I was little.  It took me about three and a half hours to do it myself, without help, but it was well worth it!  I have sensitive skin, and it didn&#x27;t burn one bit.  I love how thick the formula is so it didn&#x27;t drip all over the place.  I definitely have plenty left for touch ups in a few months, too!  Just make sure you have a hot enough hot iron.  You don&#x27;t have to have one of their kinds listed, but it has to be around 400 degrees F or hotter.  I used my Remington Wet 2 Straight on its hottest setting.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who has resistant, super curly hair.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have curly/wavy, caucasian hair. I decided to use the resistant formula without much guidance, because I knew my hair had been resistant to chemical processes in the past. I let my hair airdry after the final step of the process and much to my suprise it was shiny and pin-straight. There were a few wavy strands in the very back which I am going to blame my own straightening job for, but otherwise my hair looked perfect. I have yet to wash it after the 48 hours, but only hope that my hair looks the same as it did after the neutralizer point. Best straightening product I have ever tried! Also, my split ends were worsened, but I have not cut my hair in a year so that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Followed the instructions. It burnt my hair to a crisp</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I had curly/frizzy/unmanageable hair. I wish I would have known about this product years ago. Don&#x27;t worry about your hair becoming \\&quot;too straight\\&quot; - my hair is now much straighter, but still has body. Also great for getting rid of frizz. I highly recommend this product - it is difficult to find sometimes so I recommend purchasing more than one at a time (you need to touch roots up every 6-8 months). Definately a great product that does not damage your hair!</li>
            <li> Well I read some reviews saying that takes at least 5 hours but took me almost 3 hours; maybe I should had left the product more time in my hair but it will be next time. Anyways I have my hair colored (blonde) with highlights. At the moment my hair looks soft and very straight after using the product and the flat iron. I&#x27;ll have to wait 48 hours to see the final result. By the way I have natural wavy hair and straight in the roots.</li>
            <li> Everytime I decide on a permanent straight look, this is the product I will always buy. I&#x27;ve tried name brands like Matrix and they are not so good for my hair type. Im a hispanic with very curly, yet thin hair.  with a weekly treament of V05 and ALterna shampoos, I had the shiniest straightest, volumest hair than even the \\&quot;blondes\\&quot; that try for that same look.  It is a bit time consuming to process it, but when done right, accompanied with good maintenance products and care, you can achieve better than salon looks every day!   For a temporary solution, keratin treatments are good, just gotta apply them more frequently and Im not sure how good the chemicals are on your skin. No matter what the regulations are on that stuff,  the less processing, the better.   I was adviced \\&quot;If you cant eat it, probably shouldnt put it on your skin\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The result of strengthening is great. One missing star is for the lack of conditioner. It still works without it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading a lot of good reviews. I had a Japanese straightening treatment done on my hair about a year and a half ago and absolutely loved it. My hair is naturally wavy/curly and looks nice when it&#x27;s short, but my hair is long (half-way down my back) so the curls get pulled out and my hair doesn&#x27;t look very good. I used to straighten my hair every day and found that the Japanese straightening treatment was a great substitute and time saver. Anyway, I got that treatment done a year and a half ago and it was VERY pricey. I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try instead. I had a considerable amount of grow out since the last treatment, so the hair growing in was wavy and the rest of it was stick straight. I used this product and followed the instructions 100%. I just washed my hair after waiting 48 hours aaannnnd NOTHING. My hair looks EXACTLY THE SAME. The only thing different is that about 5 inches off of my ends will need to be cut because this product damaged my hair. I am extremely disappointed. I wasted my Labor Day weekend applying the product and then avoiding any activities that would interfere with the process (swimming, going to the gym, showering, etc). I&#x27;m happy that this product has worked so well for other people but for me it was nothing but a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not expecting thermal reconditioning like you&#x27;d get in a salon this is a great product for the money.  It took a long time and I had to process almost twice as long as recommended so stick with the knot test and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had slightly wavy, very frizzy hair that had to be straightened daily and while I can&#x27;t just jump out of the shower and go I can blow dry quickly (no flat or round brush needed) and it&#x27;s fairly straight!  I hit it quickly with a straightening iron just to smooth it a bit but it cut my overall get ready time from about an hour to a half hour!  Pretty awesome for a busy mom.</li>
            <li> Destroyed my hair like other people have stated, i have had good experience with One&#x27;n Only but not with this product</li>
            <li> I few years ago I splurged on one of those japanese thermal straightener treatments at a local salon. It cost me just over $500. I loved how my hair looked afterwards though and I&#x27;ve really been wanting to get it done again...but my finances just weren&#x27;t going to allow it. A friend of mine suggested I check out Amazon for salon quality products for keratin treatments and such. The more reviews I read the more excited I got about trying this. One &#x27;N Only had some great looking reviews and an amazingly affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my kit on a Tuesday and it showed up that Friday. I was anxious to try this out but after looking through the directions I decided I better get somebody to help me. I have a friend who is a professional stylist so I asked her if she could apply it for me. She wasn&#x27;t familar with the product but the instructions were clear enough for us to easiy follow. We applied the product the following Friday. After reading some reviews, I knew to expect my hair to stink and be kinda funky until I would be able to wash it so I wanted to do it Friday after work so I wouldn&#x27;t have to sit at work with stinky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks FANTASTIC now! I posted some before/after pics in the customer image section on the product page. It&#x27;s very soft and manageable. I know a lot of people go into these treatments thinking they will have perfectly styled hair right after stepping out of the shower...that&#x27;s no a realistic expectation. What this product does do is transform the texture of your hair which, in turn, makes brushing, drying and styling about 10x faster and easier. I prefer to let my hair air dry so I don&#x27;t have to subject it to more high heat than necissary but if I didn&#x27;t get into the shower and wash my hair within about an hour of getting home from work, I&#x27;d have to blow dry...I don&#x27;t go to bed with wet hair. Blow drying hair as thick as mine can take easily 30 minutes and longer. After this treatment, air drying is not only faster but it doesn&#x27;t dry and turn into a huge fluff ball. It&#x27;s manageable enough to run the flat iron [[ASIN:B002LIXTFC Remington S9951 Shine Therapy Frizz Control, Humidity Resistant Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron, 1 Inch]] over it a few times and my styling is DONE. I wash my hair at night so that way all I have to do is wake up in the morning and freshen it up with my flat iron. The results are amazing and now I can sleep in an extra 20-30 minutes without having to stress over getting my hair fixed in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest if you are considering using this product to have somebody that has had experience with these or similar treatments help you...at least for the first time through. I wouldn&#x27;t want to do my own hair though because trying to reach the back of my hair is literally a pain. It&#x27;s nice to have somebod that can easily stand up (while you sit) and blow dry and straighten for you. This will help to better ensure that every inch of your hair has been treated with high heat to lock in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after the stage one stuff had to sit in my hair the instructions recommend covering your hair with a shower cap or something. HOWEVER, if you have long hair a shower cap isn&#x27;t ideal. Your hair has to stay straight while the product is setting...any curls or kinks that occur from shoving your hair into the shower cap can get stuck into that kink after the final step. We just covered my hair with plastic wrap to make sure it was kept back and out of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product for people like me who refuse to embrace the curls we were \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with. And since the price is less than what most women spend on a hair cut by itself, I think it&#x27;s highly worth it.nd turn into a huge fluff ball.

            <li> Hair started out so thick and frizzy, damaged severely (naturally) all my life. Could not put hair in any pony tail, so thick. One use of One &#x27;n Only and the hair is straight, I mean looks almost thin. So manageable. Never thought my hair would do this. Never thought to even put a chemical on my hair, as damaged as it was (from birth). But, surprising, the chemicals greatly improved hair texture, quality, it now holds moisture. Amazing. Would have never imagined chemicals would improve hair quality. In my 50&#x27;s and was always afraid to use blow dryer as it dries hair. My hair was so extremely damaged looking and thick, I had no hope, so at this point in my life, what is there to lose - extremely short hair was the next step. Took the risk and was totally amazed at the difference. Should have done this as a teenager!</li>
            <li> I am a biracial girl with thick,coarse curly hair. For those familiar with the hair typing system, my hair would fall into the 3c/4a category. Last year I started researching Thermal Reconditioning treatments that could be done at home.I first found out about this product from an article on instructables.com entitled \\&quot;How to do Thermal Reconditioning Treatment at Home\\&quot;. I corresponded with the author and she recommended this product over Rusk Str8, the system she first used, not only because this one is cheaper but according to her, One&#x27;n Only works better on her hair. I&#x27;m glad I took her advice because my hair turned out wonderful! It was a long process for me at about five hours, but it was completely worth it.Now I don&#x27;t have to fix my hair every morning-- I can just run my fingers through it and go! My hair no longer takes an hour to wash either all it takes is 10 minutes at the max. Words can&#x27;t describe how happy I am with the results. :D</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well. Makes my hair look gorgeous!!!!</li>
            <li> It took several hours and the result was not as good as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my friend the result was even worse than mine.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I read several reviews and thought for $30 it was worth the risk. I have very thick curly frizzy colored hair. I was so tired of straightening it only to have it frizz and curl in MS humidity. I have spoken to my stylist about having a straightener done but couldn&#x27;t Make myself spend $200 for it. I saw this product at Sally&#x27;s and read the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It worked very well. I watched a few videos on YouTube on doing a thermal straightener (they were for different products but it helped give me a visual of the process). I did it myself,the whole thing took about 3.5 hours. I didn&#x27;t do the \\&quot;knot test\\&quot;, I just left step 1 in my hair for 35 minutes. Other than that, I followed the instructions exactly.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is softer, has more shine, and about 90% of the frizz is gone. My ends are a little dry now so I would suggest getting a trim after the treatment. I still have to run a flat iron over my hair to completely smooth it after blow drying but the result is so much better and last longer. I didn&#x27;t do 5 stars because the one down side is my hair doesn&#x27;t have any volume now, it is very flat to my head.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am so glad a found this and will be ordering more in 4-6 months to use again.</li>
            <li> I truly love this thing, I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it but mine just stopped working out of the blue the other day after just one year. there is a deccent warranty but it is the most frustrating process trying to find who to contact</li>
            <li> It worked very well on my hair, I was a little surprised to be honest. It took about 3.5 hours to do the process (with help from my mom) but I&#x27;m very happy with the results! My hair is pretty straight after a wash, and it takes no more than 20 mins to thoroughly straighten my hair with a flat iron (as opposed to the 2 hours it used to take) Very pleased with one &#x27;n only!</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this product years ago! I have thick, wavy, frizzy, fluffy, just-past-shoulder-length hair.  It is not super curly, but if I put some product in it and let it air dry, it gets pretty wavy/curly and a little frizzy.  If I blow dry it with a round brush, in sections, it gets pretty straight, but very fluffy so I flat iron it.  If it&#x27;s humid or raining or hot it will lose a lot of its straightness by the end of the day.  After using One &#x27;n Only Resistant Thermal Ionic Permanent Straightener, my hair is stick straight and very soft and smooth.  I used the resistant formula just because my hair is so thick and I didn&#x27;t want to use the normal formula and then have to go back and redo it if it didn&#x27;t work.  This is the process that I used (wear gloves and an old towel/salon cape for the Step 1 and Step 2 processes):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash your hair with the clarifying shampoo (provided)&lt;br /&gt;Get out of the shower and towel dry and gently comb your hair&lt;br /&gt;Put in the leave-in conditioner (also provided. it was very runny for some reason, so be careful when pouring it out) Then gently comb that through your hair. The directions didn&#x27;t specify whether to dry your hair or leave it wet, but I left it wet.&lt;br /&gt;Section hair into 6 sections and clip each section up&lt;br /&gt;Starting in the back, take one section out of the clip, separate out a 1/4\\&quot; section (clip the rest of the section back up) and apply Step 1 with a tint brush.  I started just below the root and pulled it through to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Continue doing this for the remaining sections of hair until all the hair is covered with Step 1.  I GENTLY combed my hair every once in a while to be sure it was all covered.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to cover your hair with plastic wrap (while keeping it as straight as possible) while it processes, but I didn&#x27;t have any so I skipped this step.&lt;br /&gt;After 5 minutes, do the knot test.  Take a small section of hair (a little thinner than a pencil) and gently tie it in a knot.  Let go of the end opposite from the root and if it opens back up, let it keep processing.  If it stays closed, it&#x27;s fully processed. Continue to perform knot tests on different sections of hair until knots in all different parts of your hair stay closed (back, front, bangs, near the root, near the ends, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Once all of your hair is processed (mine took about 20 mins), rinse your hair for 5 to 7 mins.  It will feel thicker since the shaft of the hair has opened, absorbed the product and grown in size (or so the interwebs tells me)&lt;br /&gt;Using a blow dryer pointing downwards, tousle hair with your fingers and dry until it&#x27;s about 80% dry.  You should notice a difference in the straightness and manageability of your hair at this point.&lt;br /&gt;Section your hair into 6 sections and clip up (try to keep it as straight as possible, even though this seems contradictory)&lt;br /&gt;Taking 1/4\\&quot; sections again, flat iron your hair at a 90 degree angle from your head and get it as straight as possible.  Go over each section 2 or 3 times.  This is the step that determines how straight your hair comes out at the end.  You may want to curl your ends in a little bit to make it look more natural. I used a Conair Infiniti Flat Iron on 446 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;Once all of your hair has been flat ironed, section it into 6 sections again and very carefully clip it out of the way.  You don&#x27;t want to undo all that flat ironing that you just did!&lt;br /&gt;Taking 1/4\\&quot; sections, pour Step 2 onto the hair.  Use enough to get the hair completely wet, but not dripping.  This step is a little runny, so I poured it onto my gloved hand and gently rubbed/blotted it onto my hair.  I GENTLY combed my hair every once in a while to be sure it was all covered.  By the time I got to the front of my hair, it was crimped from the clips, so I touched it up with the flat iron before applying Step 2, just to be sure it didn&#x27;t stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;Once all your hair is covered with Step 2, allow it to process for 5 mins.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse your hair for 5 to 7 mins. Do not shampoo or condition (I may be wrong about the conditioner, but definitely don&#x27;t shampoo)&lt;br /&gt;Dry your hair with a blow dryer again and point it downwards.&lt;br /&gt;Touch up any areas that need it with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;For the next 48 hours, don&#x27;t let your hair get wet, don&#x27;t wash it, don&#x27;t crimp/curl it, don&#x27;t clip it, don&#x27;t tuck it behind your ears, just let it hang straight down.  Any bumps you get in your hair at this point could stay in it since it&#x27;s still processing.  When I woke up each morning, I would touch it up with a flat iron to keep it straight, but don&#x27;t overdo it since too much heat/tugging could damage it at this point.  I did use some dry shampoo in the morning since my hair gets very oily.  Not sure if this will affect the process, but I couldn&#x27;t NOT do something for 2 days.  Gross.&lt;br /&gt;After the 48 hours is up, shampoo with a product intended for processed hair (preferably with a low pH) and deep conditioner.  I used Enjoy Hydrating Shampoo, Hydrating Conditioner and Hair Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with the results.  I seriously cannot believe I got the same results that I would have gotten in the salon for $300+ less.  The total time it took me was 5 hours.  It probably would have gone a little faster with help from a friend, but none of my friends are as much of a perfectionist as I am.  I can literally wash my hair and walk out the door and have perfectly straightened, soft, shiny, frizz-free hair.  My ends are kind of dry/split, but they needed help before this process since I haven&#x27;t gotten a hair cut in about 9 months and dried and flat ironed my hair almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever colored your own hair and can use a flat iron, you can do this yourself at home!  Don&#x27;t let people scare you into paying hundreds of dollars at a salon for the same results (unless your hair has been bleached or is damaged, then I would definitely recommend seeing a professional first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this is so long, but I always appreciate when people take the time to write these reviews so I&#x27;m just doing my part :-)br /&gt;Rinse your hair for 5 to 7 mins. Do not shampoo or condition (I may be wrong about the conditioner, but definitely don&#x27;t shampoo)&lt;br /&gt;Dry your hair with a blow dryer again and point it downwards.&lt;br /&gt;Touch up any areas that need it with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;For the next 48 hours, don&#x27;t let your hair get wet, don&#x27;t wash it, don&#x27;t crimp/curl it, don&#x27;t clip it, don&#x27;t tuck it behind your ears, just let it hang straight down.

My ends are kind of dry/split, but they needed help before this process since I haven&#x27;t gotten a hair cut in about 9 months and dried and flat ironed my hair almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever colored your own hair and can use a flat iron, you can do this yourself at home!  Don&#x27;t let people scare you into paying hundreds of dollars at a salon for the same results (unless your hair has been bleached or is damaged, then I would definitely recommend seeing a professional first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this is so long, but I always appreciate when people take the time to write these reviews so I&#x27;m just doing my part :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually reordering this for a second time today.  It&#x27;s been about 9 months since my first time using it, and now that my curls have grown back quite a bit I want to do another treatment.  I have very very thick (sicilian) curly hair and last year I decided to try this instead of paying hundreds at the salon.  I was really happy with the results; It works just the same.  I have no idea what went wrong with the women who gave this product poor reviews.  The only thing I can think is that they were not generous enough with applying the product, or they didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.  It&#x27;s important to leave it on until you can tell your hair&#x27;s bondage is gone.  When I used to go to the salon for these treatments, they&#x27;d leave the treatment in until they were certain my hair&#x27;s curl was no longer there.  To test, they&#x27;d take a strand of my hair and tie it in a knot.  they&#x27;d then let go and watch the knot, if the knot released at all even just a little,  they knew my curl was still there, and they&#x27;d leave it on longer.  As boring as it is, it&#x27;s worth it.  Yes, it smells like eggs, but all of these treatments do, even the crazy exspensive ones....it is what it is.  Good Luck</li>
            <li> A few years back I had Brazilian and Japanese straightening done for $400 and it completely destroyed my hair I have really thin hair and was worried it would burn my hair. I bought this product not expecting much but it surpassed my expectations. If you read the bad reviews they are true too and the reason is because they use a regular person to  help them with it I had my aunt who is a hair dresses do it and who does straightening for a living . This stuff is as strong if not stronger then the salon product. The reason other peoples hair got damaged is because it took them too long to put the product in. For a pro its a breeze and you are supposed to leave it on 5 minute at a time and then rinse until you get the result you want I did it twice my aunt told me for my hair  that&#x27;s the max allowed time. So when a regular person does it takes them too long to put the product on and that&#x27;s why the hair burns. Try going to a salon where they don&#x27;t do keratin or Japanese straightening in the morning that&#x27;s when its usually quiet for hair dressers and see if they will do it for you will prob pay $20 - $40 because some money is better than no money for them its very time consuming took my aunt about 1:30 min to 2 hr to get it done on thin hair. Trust me good product if the right person does it for you!!! My hair is straight like I want it and feels healthier  than it was before.</li>
            <li> Completely honest review: My hair is straight and 3/4 of it feels incredibly soft and looks beautiful. I did this myself, just being too hasty. I had died my hair long long ago and used an Olgivie (I think) straightener in my hair. My hair had mostly grown out since then so I used the time on all my hair for untreated to color or other chemicals, and I fried the ends a little. It doesn&#x27;t look awful, but it&#x27;ll look better after I get a trim. That being said, I have had the curliest, most unimaginably thick, and grown long, monstrous amounts of hair, two bottles of dye kind of hair, HAVE to wash twice kind of hair. Tons and tons of hard to manage hair lol. This stuff was just about as easy to use as anything else I&#x27;ve tried, none of which has worked nearly this well. The flat ironing in the middle is the part that can get to you if you&#x27;re doing this yourself, just arms getting tired and wanting to not be up in the air anymore. Though if your hair isn&#x27;t longer than past your shoulders, it wouldn&#x27;t take too long. And if you&#x27;re like me and order double of hair products because of how much hair you have, this box comes with way more than plenty! Overall, the part of my hair I followed the directions on looks perfect, product works as advertised, for a change lol and the other was my fault, completely. An easy solution to not do what I did is, one:do the strand test closer to your roots then again where the damage from previous products is and two:when the bottom&#x27;s ready, you just spray it with water to deactivate it while the rest of your hair is still doing its thing. (In the directions, like I said, too hasty) Enjoy your new hair!!</li>
            <li> my hair is about 40CM long. i use half of the product. it works really well and my curly hair become straight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I didn&#x27;t want to relax my hair. In all honesty I could smell it threw the packaging it came in before opening it. I followed the directions step by step so that I would get the best results, however when I opened the container it had several brown crud rings around it. I will honestly say that if you follow the directions step by step you will get the best results. However the smell doesn&#x27;t go away instantly once container is closed. My bathroom smelled HORRID for at least 2 weeks, and I mean HORRID. No matter what I did, or sprayed the smell still lingered something awful. Overall the product does work, however I won&#x27;t order it again. The pros DON&#x27;T out weigh the cons in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instruction well, you will get such a sleek, straight, and smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;Trying many products, I can tell this product can make the same result as hair salon does.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick and naturally curly hair which is not well manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, folks. It took me 5 hours to complete my hair done but it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I did my hair 1 month ago and my hair is still sleek and straight without any damage.&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I used this on myself last week and I am VERY happy with the results. I actually bought it at my local Sallys when I was picking up combs (I am a barber). I have tried every product on the market, professional and non, that claims to tame frizzy, curly hair...including Keratin smoothing treatments. I have wasted many hours and a lot of money on products that don&#x27;t work...until this one. I have what I call &amp;#34;Italian afro&amp;#34; hair...it is thick, curly, and SUPER frizzy...like I stuck my fingers into an electrical outlet.  Not now!  Even in humidity and rain!..Wish I would have tried this year&#x27;s ago.  Was afraid of damaging my hair..but the results are totally worth the tiny bit of dry ends that I will trim...I have NEVER liked my hair and have many times cut it almost boy-short because of how unmanageable it is...Finally...success!</li>
            <li> It turned out pretty well, but I feel like my hair could&#x27;ve been straighter. Am I able to straighten my hair with a flat iron without my hair being I think 20% wet like the directions say, or can I just wait for my hair to be completely dry and then straighten it because I feel like it wouldve worked better but maybe theres a reason it has to be wet.</li>
            <li> Decided to go through my old orders and realized I never got a few of my products including this one.</li>
            <li> I had curly hair. It took me three hours, but was totally worth it! I now have straight hair without having to straighten it!</li>
            <li> Works great, even better than those higher price brands and strongly reccomend this product, easy for non-profeesionale home care use..</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly as written and it did not work. I wasted 8 hours because i wanted to make sure each section of hair was meticulously straitened and i was doing this alone and have pretty thick and long hair. This product actually made my hair frizzier than when i started. It smells awful also, like rotten eggs. I am very disappointed. $30 and a full day wasted and i now have frizzier hair and really dead ends.</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver and a miracle worker. I&#x27;m half Irish, half Sicilian, and my natural hair looks like the bride of Frankenstein got into a fight with a vindictive light socket and lost. After using this product, however, my hair dries in gentle waves if I let it dry naturally, and I can hit it with a flat iron and be ready to run out the door with sleek, smooth hair in under 10 minutes (as opposed to the full hour it normally takes to flat iron my hair in its natural state). For the people complaining - yes, it&#x27;s a harsh chemical, and yes, you can damage your hair with it if you&#x27;re not careful. Don&#x27;t use the resistant formula on bleached hair, don&#x27;t leave the product on your hair too long, and make sure your flat iron is a ceramic that gets up to 450 degrees or you won&#x27;t get the full effect of the chemical. (I made this mistake a couple times - if you feel like this isn&#x27;t straightening your hair very well or the curl comes back before the hair grows out, check the max temperature of the flat iron you used to process it.) I&#x27;ve used this product on my own hair more times than I can count with great success, and I&#x27;ve used it to successfully straighten friends&#x27; hair as well. No way in hell I&#x27;d ever pay to have thermal reconditioning done at a salon when this is easily available and works so well.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting with my east-to-west, Rosanne Rossannadanna hair since puberty!(A looooooooooooooooong time ago!) Six years ago, I found an amazing stylist who convinced me to try Thermal Ionic and well, if six years later I&#x27;m still using it, what does that tell you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past after every sitting (3.5-4hrs)at the salon, I came home with incredibly sleek straight shiny conditioned hair. Nothing interrupted its straightness - moisture (and good grief, I live in Portland, Oregon where it rains 360 days a year!), humidity (visits to the midwest and other muggy places!), pony tails - NOTHING. Every 4.5-5 months I would go back to my stylist who&#x27;d do roots-to-ends and my hair would look shiny, feel silky, and again, be straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist is no longer styling unfortunately. She retired!! &#x3D;( I called all over Portland for a stylist who used the Thermal Ionic product. One salon told me to come in, there was someone there who used the product. So I went in, we got going, and she pulled out Rusk Shiny Str8. I decided to stay and try it (I was desperate!). What a mistake! The product was AWFUL! I had little tumbleweeds on the ends of my hair by the time she was done (and a week later, had to get an inch cut off my hair) and waves here and there. On top of that the stylist gave me the impression it wouldn&#x27;t cost more than $300 - I had a first time 20% off coupon and had come with my hair washed and dried - but she STILL charged me $400! The kicker? I couldn&#x27;ve done what she did in the comfort of my own bathroom at home! &gt;&#x3D;((((( The process with Rusk reminds me of the old over-the-counter straighteners (with lye) that anyone could do. (Expensive lesson for me to learn!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Thermal Ionic from Amazon, printed off Julie R.&#x27;s review (one of the first ones listed in the reviews and a 5 star) and had my niece home for vaca from college be my stylist. My hair looks and feels great! But a couple of learning points from me and my niece:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to be generous and liberal with the product!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Like Julie R. said, be careful not to leave clips in too long or a little wave will develop.&lt;br /&gt;3.  My niece is not a professional so she didn&#x27;t move super fast and my hair got a little dry while waiting to get flat-ironed. Make sure to keep your hair moist!&lt;br /&gt;4.  If you can, get the newer Thermal Ionic - the chemicals don&#x27;t smell as strong. (You can still smell the chemicals after a couple of washings with this stuff.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so impressed that Julie R. did this herself - it really is a two-man job! But after watching my niece and following Julie R.&#x27;s great directions, I&#x27;m inspired to try it on my own next time. I miss my stylist but am grateful for such a patient and generous niece, for this phenomenal product, and for not having to spend 4 hours and $300+ every 5 months at the salon! GO FOR IT, LADIES!</li>
            <li> I had a great experience with this product. My aunt is a hairdresser with a lot of experience in chemical treatments so she put the treatment on me. My hair is mixed with 3c curls. Now its almost completely straight right out of the shower. I should have done this years ago, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it by yourself since its a lot of work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair relaxers and paid big money at the salon.  Use this...you will be extremely satisfied.  I have curly hair and it made it stick straight.  I can now cut my hair short and not have it go to frizz, but a fabulous hairstyle.  The smell is BAD when you put it on, and kind of smells like hair perm.  Makes amazing results!!!  The bad smell is worth it !!!!</li>
            <li> I brought this product in when I saw a professional hair dresser so she could make sure this was done right. It didnt work. It&#x27;s like I never put anything in my hair..and my hair smelled bad for about a week</li>
            <li> Great price and shipping time!</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair. I decided against getting the formula for highlighted hair as I was worried it would not be strong enough.  I purchased the normal formula.. I applied the product generously and waited.. and waited and waited.  The highlighted part of my hair finally passed the knot test, but after an almost an hour, and getting worried that I was leaving the product on for too long (the directions said it would process in 7-30 minutes), I decided to take my chances and wash it off before the highlighted parts melted and turned gummy... I rinsed in the shower for 10 minutes to ensure it was all rinsed off (my hair isn&#x27;t that thick but I wanted to be certain).  My flat iron only allows me to increase the temp in 50 degree increments.  The directions said 338 to 356 F.  I decided to go with 400 (I think I had initially made a mistake converting celsius to farenheit but others have said they use a very hot setting anyways).  My hair didnt feel all that good and it wanted to tangle while I was selecting sections to flat iron.. Parts of it also seemed a little crunchy? anyways, I plunged forward and flat ironed it all out then did the neutralizer and rinsing.. I blew it dry (it still seemed a little dry and tangly).. My hair is now pretty pin straight and most parts feel soft.. The ends of the highlighted parts are a little fried and I will need a trim, but overall, it&#x27;s pretty nice! I can&#x27;t wait til th 48 hours are up and I can deep condition it before trimming.. and of course to see it it&#x27;s still straight... I wonder though, why my hair still sprung back with pretty good vigor when doing the knot test.. did I apply too much conditioner? it was hard to figure out how much to use of the runny stuff.. did I not saturate my hair enough in step 1? It seemed like I had put a lot on... should I have taken the risk and left it on even longer? should I have instead purchased the resistant formula? I dont know.. I do know that I like the results, even if I have to get aminor trim for the dry damaged ends.. once that is done and I can use the after-care products on it, I am sure it will be even silkier and shinier! I would use this again although I sure do wish I knew why it never passed that knot test...</li>
