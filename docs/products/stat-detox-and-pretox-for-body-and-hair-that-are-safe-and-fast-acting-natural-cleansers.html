            <li>but I used it anyways just to follow the instructions perfectly.</li>
            <li>My friend has used this product successfully 3 times now.</li>
            <li>I could not be more displeased with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li>Consider 1 product for every 3 inches of hair you are treating and apply more time to the heating phase.</li>
            <li>You must follow directions thoroughly, and avoid touching or smoking cigarettes after use.</li>
            <li>I just bought this for her as well, and I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;ll help her.</li>
            <li>, did it work, idk really ,might have just been good anyways</li>
            <li>It worked 1000% satisfaction guaranteed,easy application and easy instruction to follow.</li>
            <li>used every drop precisely as instructed....failed</li>
            <li>Did one full treatment by the directions</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad it has such distinctive packaging, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve been able to recognize it.</li>
            <li>The process takes a while (two applications and wrap your hair in saran wrap, nuke it with a blow dryer), but it&#x27;s WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this product will not allow you to pass a drug test even when the directions are followed exactly however sarken is a good source for urine screening supplies I have used stat flush several times always with excellent results I have requested a refund from sarken and will update this post when they answer</li>
            <li>I followed the directions EXACTLY.  </li>
            <li>It works, first of all.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions exactly and got the job.</li>
            <li>I was thinking maybe the positive reviews are from people with shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>He has long hair by the way and we were able to use it both days.</li>
            <li>I really depended on this Shampoo for my probation.</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Not very difficult</li>
            <li>We only had four days to clean his hair.</li>
            <li>But you must do exactly as the instructions direct.</li>
            <li>Waste of my money, for sure.</li>
            <li>I live in Denver, CO.</li>
            <li>But do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave your hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone for multiple purposes.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and even blow dried my hair for even longer than stated.</li>

            <li> I had high hopes for this because it looked like it had worked for a little over 50% of the people.  </li>
            <li> There is enough in the bottles to do that, but again only if your hair is under 2 inches long.</li>

            <li> I believed it worked for me, last used was about 3 and a half months before for smoke and 2 months for asprin, catch my drift, dont smoke ciggeretts, wash everything blackets, sheets anything that will touch your hiar after you use the product</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not worried about any weird reactions because it is all natural, I remember being surprised and skeptical the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li> Rosemary and a bunch of other herbs and stuff are the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Save your money don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or your money...cost me my job and 40</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> All instructions were used precisely.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot complain too much because 2 out of 3 isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I dont know if it has to do with the fact that I have longer hair (past my shoulders, at least).</li>
            <li> This stuff really sucks.......</li>
            <li> If you are in a bind and don&#x27;t have time to use one of the other methods that takes longer, I&#x27;m sorry to say but you are out of luck.</li>
            <li> When it came back, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad.</li>
            <li> AND, she used to have horrible dandruff, like serious flakes bordering on eczema, and after using this all natural stuff, it was gone for a year and a half.</li>
            <li> it says it&#x27;s guaranteed and gives you false hope.</li>
            <li> I counted on this product to live up to its claims, this product failed miserably.</li>
            <li> Hair test and fail.</li>
            <li> I failed for all of the toxins I had put in my body, and now am facing the repercussions.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I failed anyway.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I failed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I counted on this product to live up to its claims, this product failed miserably. I could not be more displeased with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst s*** I&#x27;ve ever tried...didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Save your money don&#x27;t waste your time. Had. Hair test and fail.</li>
            <li> Hello All! I live in Denver, CO. I really depended on this Shampoo for my probation. I bought two applications of STAT Shampoo for $32.50 each coming out to $70 total. I followed the directions exactly and even blow dried my hair for even longer than stated. I failed for all of the toxins I had put in my body, and now am facing the repercussions. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT DOES NOT WORK. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT DOES NOT WORK. Either don&#x27;t use drugs, or use one of the methods that takes longer to detox your hair. If you are in a bind and don&#x27;t have time to use one of the other methods that takes longer, I&#x27;m sorry to say but you are out of luck. But do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> My friend has used this product successfully 3 times now. But you must do exactly as the instructions direct. Also this person had short hair and did the treatment 3 times in the 2 days before the test. There is enough in the bottles to do that, but again only if your hair is under 2 inches long. Consider 1 product for every 3 inches of hair you are treating and apply more time to the heating phase.</li>
            <li> Def didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I used this product twice, and it worked both times. You must follow directions thoroughly, and avoid touching or smoking cigarettes after use. This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Did one full treatment by the directions and it didn&#x27;t work.  My hair is short and dark brown. I wouldn&#x27;t put your faith in this product working.</li>
            <li> This stuff really sucks.......don&#x27;t waste your time or your money...cost me my job and 40$ .... so please know it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I waited until I got my results back to write this review.  I had high hopes for this because it looked like it had worked for a little over 50% of the people.  I followed the directions EXACTLY.  Unfortunately I failed anyway.  I dont know if it has to do with the fact that I have longer hair (past my shoulders, at least). I was thinking maybe the positive reviews are from people with shorter hair.  Either way, I failed. Waste of my money, for sure. Too bad it says it&#x27;s guaranteed and gives you false hope.</li>
            <li> I believed it worked for me, last used was about 3 and a half months before for smoke and 2 months for asprin, catch my drift, dont smoke ciggeretts, wash everything blackets, sheets anything that will touch your hiar after you use the product, did it work, idk really ,might have just been good anyways but I know it helped, and I use two boxes four days before</li>
            <li> Follow the directions, take the time to do everything, and it will work.  It did for me.  Not very difficult</li>
            <li> It works, first of all. My ex got the job, and trust me, she shouldn&#x27;t have. AND, she used to have horrible dandruff, like serious flakes bordering on eczema, and after using this all natural stuff, it was gone for a year and a half. When it came back, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad. Just shampoo was enough to keep it under control. My mom&#x27;s been having scalp problems as a side effect of medications she&#x27;s been on, so I just bought this for her as well, and I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;ll help her. I&#x27;m not worried about any weird reactions because it is all natural, I remember being surprised and skeptical the first time I bought it. Rosemary and a bunch of other herbs and stuff are the ingredients. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone for multiple purposes. And I&#x27;m glad it has such distinctive packaging, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve been able to recognize it. The process takes a while (two applications and wrap your hair in saran wrap, nuke it with a blow dryer), but it&#x27;s WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Have 3/4 inch hair ....had not done anything for months....used every drop precisely as instructed....failed</li>
            <li> No THC found. No methamphetamines found.&lt;br /&gt;However, Lortab was detected. All instructions were used precisely.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot complain too much because 2 out of 3 isn&#x27;t bad considering!!&lt;br /&gt;It does leave your hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It works. Followed the instructions exactly and got the job. I have short dark brown hair. I probably didn&#x27;t need 1/2 a bottle per treatment but I used it anyways just to follow the instructions perfectly. Someone with long hair might need 2 kits.</li>
            <li> It worked 1000% satisfaction guaranteed,easy application and easy instruction to follow.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product will not allow you to pass a drug test even when the directions are followed exactly however sarken is a good source for urine screening supplies I have used stat flush several times always with excellent results I have requested a refund from sarken and will update this post when they answer</li>
            <li> Covered up one of two things so it&#x27;s a no go in my book.  Disappointing!!!  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> My husband had only stopped smoking weed for a month and a half and had to take a follicle test. We only had four days to clean his hair. so we used this shampoo and it worked! He has long hair by the way and we were able to use it both days.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
