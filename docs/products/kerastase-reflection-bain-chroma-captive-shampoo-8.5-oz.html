            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell too.  </li>
            <li>Therefore I was looking for a good color staying shampoo.</li>
            <li>it is a good product.</li>
            <li>but good.</li>
            <li>Good product for color processed hair.</li>
            <li>Works great for my hair, keeps it healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Cleans and shines hair - amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve read these reviews, I just looked and my own bottle does indeed contain sulfates.</li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo IF you get the genuine product and not a counterfeit version.  </li>
            <li>The genuine product is a good shampoo for color-treated hair because it doesn&#x27;t contain color-stripping sulfates.  </li>
            <li>Love the product makes hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo---first introduced at my salon.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my color-treated hair shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I needed more conditioning than it provided.</li>
            <li>Only the best!</li>
            <li>I have to say this shampoo is better than most of the store bought ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li>but it sure did mine.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love the results.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>It looks ok, but I am not so sure I want to use it since I&#x27;m allergic to mold.</li>
            <li>Overall, Kerastase products have greatly improved the texture of my hair, but I&#x27;m still in the process of trying different shampoos and conditioners in their line to see which I like best.  </li>
            <li>If you are buying this shampoo for the sulfate free properties then be sure to research which version/formula the sell is carrying.</li>
            <li>IMPOSTER, KERASTASE ( the true product) Contains no SULFATES and states so on the bottle!</li>
            <li>She did confirm that it says sulfate free on the website and that when they say that, they are specifically referring to lauryl sulfate.  </li>
            <li>and both this shampoo and conditioner makes it shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>Their conditioners are fabulous too.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s sulfate free, what I purchased through this seller isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>The bottle I received is not sulfate free.</li>
            <li>This has sulfates in it as opposed to the one sold in salons which is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>On a better note, the smell of the product is similar to most shampoo brands and it is very easy to work into the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my hair super silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended that I use this shampoo to help keep my blonde highlights bright.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many color enhancing shampoos, but this really works.</li>
            <li>By the time I got this product my hair was already for the most part faded so I was very upset about the shipping problems.</li>
            <li>Probably should have known better with this being priced so much lower than what the retail is.  </li>
            <li>I like it because she is happy, BUT men, it is a little costly.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend ordering this item if you are looking for the Kerastase sulfate free chroma captive.</li>
            <li>I like Bain Chroma Captive because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>The Bain Chroma Captive is good for preserving color, but the Chroma Riche left my hair softer, which is why I deducted one star.</li>
            <li>and I think the results are worth the price.</li>
            <li>sure if this is a knock-off or possibly an old version,</li>
            <li>I tried other Kerastase products and this is definitely one of the best.</li>
            <li>This one in particular works best for me, but they have several additional shampoos for different hair types.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered items even farther away than this one and their products came right on time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t only smells good but makes your hair soft even without conditioner yet.</li>
            <li>It was sulfate free, so because the name and appearance were the same I assumed the one I was buying was sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I ordered my bottle of this directly from the Kerastase company website because it was advertised as sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>The first 3 ingredients were water, sodium laureth sulfate, and sodium lauryl sulfate.  </li>
            <li>is not the real deal!  </li>
            <li>Haha!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review after reading all the other ones and checking my own bottle in my shower.</li>
            <li>Still unsure it&#x27;s the real deal or not some knockoff, but doesn&#x27;t damage my hair</li>
            <li>If you see &amp;#34;sodium lauryl sulfate&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sodium laureth sulfate&amp;#34; in the ingredient list, you&#x27;re not getting the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend the Chroma Captive Conditioner to go with it.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product because I just dyed my hair red and everyone knows red fades sooooo fast!!</li>
            <li>The real Kerastase product does not do this-</li>
            <li>Her hair is much softer and easier to manage since using this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels very clean, though it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;m used to seeing with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, long, color-treated hair and lots of it.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the price for sure.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist had highly recommended this brand and since I trust my stylist</li>
            <li>Many shampoos are either too drying or leave a heavy residue.  </li>
            <li>This is not the genuine Kerastase chroma captive shampoo that I previously bought at a salon.</li>
            <li>Originally for Brazil, my wife&#x27;s hair became very dry from living in Colorado.  </li>
            <li>I go right back to it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is supposed to be sulfate free, but the second and third ingredients listed are sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate.  </li>
            <li>My stylist introduced me to this brand nearly 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>The real thing is ONLY sold in salons!  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers note, if you look closely you will see that the bottle does not say &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; and even though the name is the same as the Kerastase sulfate free product, what you will get if you order this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo for those of you with blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>Lesson learned: I&#x27;m not buying high end hair products from the Internet again-- only from salons.</li>

            <li> Lesson learned: I&#x27;m not buying high end hair products from the Internet again-- only from salons.</li>
            <li> One thing I must complain about is how long it took to actually get here.</li>
            <li> It keeps the color in longer, but it does seem to dry my hair out a bit.</li>
            <li> so I am not saying it will dry your hair out</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo from Amazon.com to save myself roughly $15.</li>
            <li> I really hope Amazon reads these reviews and stops fulfilling orders from this seller with their false advertising &amp; fraudulent goods.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when ordering from vendors other than Kerastase and check the ingredients when you receive it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon because it was less expensive, but as far as I can tell, it is not real product.  </li>
            <li> After the first wash, I was very disappointed because it seemed so rundowned with water and didn&#x27;t lather very well at all.</li>
            <li> so I am not very sure if the shampoo has helped my hair or the biotin, but I will keep using the shampoo since it claims to preserve the color for a bit longer.</li>
            <li> So I checked on Amazon  and saved a few dollars from a salon price.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not to be confused with the same brand sold in salons!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying these products on Amazon for the typical reason, the lower prices!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone here got a fake product, I think everyone got the actual product and that it is being misadvertised by Kerastase.  </li>
            <li> I tried a different shampoo because this one was so expensive and my hair lost shininess and texture.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It was scheduled to arrive two weeks after purchasing it and it was stillll late 4 days.</li>
            <li> Because Kerastase is expensive, I have tried dozens of other brands but always return to Kerastase.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and sometimes gets stringy.</li>
            <li> Not GREAT...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong wit a bottle of shampoo</li>
            <li> This is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive to buy at the store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never order from here again. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase.  </li>

            <li> Still unsure it&#x27;s the real deal or not some knockoff, but doesn&#x27;t damage my hair</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo IF you get the genuine product and not a counterfeit version.  The genuine product is a good shampoo for color-treated hair because it doesn&#x27;t contain color-stripping sulfates.  Just be careful when ordering from vendors other than Kerastase and check the ingredients when you receive it.  If you see &amp;#34;sodium lauryl sulfate&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sodium laureth sulfate&amp;#34; in the ingredient list, you&#x27;re not getting the real deal.  Overall, Kerastase products have greatly improved the texture of my hair, but I&#x27;m still in the process of trying different shampoos and conditioners in their line to see which I like best.  The Bain Chroma Captive is good for preserving color, but the Chroma Riche left my hair softer, which is why I deducted one star.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong wit a bottle of shampoo</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo---first introduced at my salon. It&#x27;s the best! It holds my color longer, it keeps great body without being puffy---this works for me!</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair, keeps it healthy and shiny. I tried other Kerastase products and this is definitely one of the best.</li>
            <li> I ordered my bottle of this directly from the Kerastase company website because it was advertised as sulfate free.  The first 3 ingredients were water, sodium laureth sulfate, and sodium lauryl sulfate.  I immediately called Kerastase and was transferred to their consumer affairs department.  She did confirm that it says sulfate free on the website and that when they say that, they are specifically referring to lauryl sulfate.  I told her that was an ingredient on the bottle and all she said was, &amp;#34;oh, I&#x27;ll forward your comment.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t think anyone here got a fake product, I think everyone got the actual product and that it is being misadvertised by Kerastase.  This is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo twice and I love it.  It leaves my color-treated hair shiny and healthy looking.  I have been taking biotin supplements for 3 months now so I am not very sure if the shampoo has helped my hair or the biotin, but I will keep using the shampoo since it claims to preserve the color for a bit longer.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended that I use this shampoo to help keep my blonde highlights bright. I&#x27;ve tried many color enhancing shampoos, but this really works. I highly recommend this shampoo for those of you with blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  My hair feels very clean, though it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I&#x27;m used to seeing with other shampoos.  It has a pleasant smell too.  I don&#x27;t recommend the Chroma Captive Conditioner to go with it.  I felt like I needed more conditioning than it provided.</li>
            <li> Only the best! Made my hair super silky and smooth. I have thin hair and sometimes gets stringy. and both this shampoo and conditioner makes it shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product because I just dyed my hair red and everyone knows red fades sooooo fast!! Therefore I was looking for a good color staying shampoo. I have to say this shampoo is better than most of the store bought ones that I have tried. It keeps the color in longer, but it does seem to dry my hair out a bit. Everyone have different types of hair so I am not saying it will dry your hair out but it sure did mine. I have to use a color locking conditioner with it, but I do like this product and just might be purchasing it again. One thing I must complain about is how long it took to actually get here. It was scheduled to arrive two weeks after purchasing it and it was stillll late 4 days. I understand that it is coming from a different country but come on. I have ordered items even farther away than this one and their products came right on time. By the time I got this product my hair was already for the most part faded so I was very upset about the shipping problems. On a better note, the smell of the product is similar to most shampoo brands and it is very easy to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt; All and all it is a good product. Not GREAT... but good. Not worth the price for sure.</li>
            <li> Good product for color processed hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is supposed to be sulfate free, but the second and third ingredients listed are sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate.  I&#x27;ll never order from here again. :(</li>
            <li> I am using this shampoo for over 10 years now. Every time I try something else I go right back to it. It is very expensive to buy at the store but I found great deals on Amazon.</li>
            <li> IMPOSTER, KERASTASE ( the true product) Contains no SULFATES and states so on the bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product. Thank you</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to this brand nearly 10 years ago.  I have fine, long, color-treated hair and lots of it.  Many shampoos are either too drying or leave a heavy residue.  Because Kerastase is expensive, I have tried dozens of other brands but always return to Kerastase.  This one in particular works best for me, but they have several additional shampoos for different hair types.  Their conditioners are fabulous too.  I&#x27;m buying these products on Amazon for the typical reason, the lower prices!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love the results. I have colored treated hair and shampoo 3x a week.  I tried a different shampoo because this one was so expensive and my hair lost shininess and texture.  So I checked on Amazon  and saved a few dollars from a salon price.It is expensive but it lasts a long time and I think the results are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Cleans and shines hair - amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t only smells good but makes your hair soft even without conditioner yet. But of course you still need to put conditioner.</li>
            <li> Purchased this and after I received it, I compared it to the same bottle that I purchased from my salon, and also what is on the Kerastase website.  Both website and bottle state that it&#x27;s sulfate free, what I purchased through this seller isn&#x27;t.  The text/printing on the bottle is also different from what I purchased at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is a knock-off or possibly an old version, but I&#x27;m returning it.  Probably should have known better with this being priced so much lower than what the retail is.  Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> This is not the genuine Kerastase chroma captive shampoo that I previously bought at a salon. As other reviewers note, if you look closely you will see that the bottle does not say &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; and even though the name is the same as the Kerastase sulfate free product, what you will get if you order this is not the real deal!  Also I noticed that this shampoo only foams at the beginning and the suds rapidly vanish as you shampoo.  The real Kerastase product does not do this- it does produce lots of suds. I bought this from Amazon because it was less expensive, but as far as I can tell, it is not real product.  I would not recommend ordering this item if you are looking for the Kerastase sulfate free chroma captive.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase.  I like Bain Chroma Captive because it is sulfate free. There must be two formulation of this shampoo. The bottle I received is not sulfate free. If you are buying this shampoo for the sulfate free properties then be sure to research which version/formula the sell is carrying.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo. The bottle I received smells like mold. It looks ok, but I am not so sure I want to use it since I&#x27;m allergic to mold.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this shampoo and conditioner.  Originally for Brazil, my wife&#x27;s hair became very dry from living in Colorado.  Her hair is much softer and easier to manage since using this product.  I like it because she is happy, BUT men, it is a little costly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review after reading all the other ones and checking my own bottle in my shower. NO WONDER! I purchased this shampoo from Amazon.com to save myself roughly $15. My hair stylist had highly recommended this brand and since I trust my stylist (Sage advice: always trust your hair stylist! Haha!), I decided to switch brands. After the first wash, I was very disappointed because it seemed so rundowned with water and didn&#x27;t lather very well at all. Now that I&#x27;ve read these reviews, I just looked and my own bottle does indeed contain sulfates. Lesson learned: I&#x27;m not buying high end hair products from the Internet again-- only from salons. I really hope Amazon reads these reviews and stops fulfilling orders from this seller with their false advertising &amp; fraudulent goods.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not to be confused with the same brand sold in salons!  This has sulfates in it as opposed to the one sold in salons which is sulfate free.  The real thing is ONLY sold in salons!  Buyer beware....... you may not be getting what you think you are!</li>
            <li> I had bought this product before from my salon.  It was sulfate free, so because the name and appearance were the same I assumed the one I was buying was sulfate free.  When it arrived I realized the product had sulfates and therefore returned it.</li>
            <li> Love the product makes hair nice and shiny</li>
