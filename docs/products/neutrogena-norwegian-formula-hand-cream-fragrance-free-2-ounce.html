            <li>This is really good hand cream.</li>
            <li>This is the best hand cream I have ever used, and I have been using hand cream for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my Dermatologist and was pleasantly pleased to find it to be a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The best thing for hands, and priced right.  </li>
            <li>but when I tried it out I must say that I was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s packaged in a 4 pack because that&#x27;s about what I&#x27;ll need to get through a winter!</li>
            <li>and I just love it!</li>
            <li>I love this cream!  </li>
            <li>My favorite hand cream!</li>
            <li>Without this amazing hand cream, I probably would have got an infection or bled to death.</li>
            <li>it is an amazing product that i hope never changes.</li>
            <li>This hand cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>My husband has his own tubes.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute BEST lotion i have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use this cream at night, maybe even with some lotion gloves, it will keep your hands feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to others who have also been pleased with results and will continue to use it..</li>
            <li>We put it on nightly before going to sleep, being sure to rub it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I love to use it product.</li>
            <li>Mostly.</li>
            <li>I consistenly love Neutrogena products and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>On this part, I think I like L&#x27;occtaine better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried others, but this is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>longer time than most lotions/hand creams.</li>
            <li>This one is ok</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, but Neutrogena Norwegian Formula provides the best relief.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because it is almost more of a barrier cream than a lotion, and</li>
            <li>My wife love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years after trying so many others that claim to heal try skin but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is great!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>ok, I NEVER used hand cream, because I always considered that way too feminine for my tastes.</li>
            <li>I had already been using it for many years and love it.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Everyone who&#x27;s used some love it.  </li>
            <li>and my hands are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have never found a better hand lotion.</li>
            <li>My favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li>Glad we were able to get it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK for severe winter damage to my hands but is not something I use all the time.</li>
            <li>Great hand and foot moisturizer, absorbed quickly</li>
            <li>so it is even better than those products that has strong shea butter smell..</li>
            <li>Awesome lotion for anyone suffering from dry skin.</li>
            <li>Especially good in the winter for chapped, dry skin and hands.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is the best cure for dry lips that I have found.</li>
            <li>Great product, my dermatologist recommended it for my very sensitive hands.</li>
            <li>Best hand cream for very dry hands.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed at how cheap it is to buy, it is better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>, she loved it, she&#x27;s been getting this product for  a long time and just loved it.</li>
            <li>This product heals dry skin and is wonderfully odor free.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong for me</li>
            <li>Strong fragrancies make me sneeze and cough.  </li>
            <li>BUT, this is hands down the best product for my hands I have ever tried in my 40+ years.     </li>
            <li>Best hand lotion, hands down.  </li>
            <li>I have tried too many other products to count and was so glad to re-discover this great hand cream.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re good as new.</li>
            <li>I still have the skin condition, but I apply this lotion every night at bedtime and my hands have been fine.</li>
            <li>It has a perfect size (2oz, safe for airplane!), no strong smell, greasy when you first apply it</li>
            <li>so for this one it is great  and moisture enough to  protect my hands.</li>
            <li>but once you smooth it into your hands it absorbs.</li>
            <li>She has tried multiple products before but she is quite happy with this one.</li>
            <li>By the next day my hands had improved greatly.  </li>
            <li>My skin is silky smooth now all over.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free - I don&#x27;t like putting anything on my body with too much scent in it and prefer products that are fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands often, this is a rich, but not greasy lotion.</li>
            <li>:) Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the most effective cold-weather hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Hands down this is the most amazing Lotion Cream I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem like its absorbing, but once I keep working it I can get most of it in.  </li>
            <li>This is the only hand cream that seems to do any good at all for them.</li>
            <li>All I can say about this product is if you have really chapped hands you will fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>Since moving to this climate I&#x27;ve tried any number of approaches to solving the problem but this product seems to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and the price is quite reasonable.      </li>
            <li>this is very heavy-duty lotion, and it&#x27;s great for winter time when you need extra protection from the elements.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy feel or scent.</li>
            <li>I use it at home after work, it doesn&#x27;t take more than a drop and is absorbed straight away.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of hand creams for my dry skin and have found this, Neutrogena Norwegian Formula, to be the best.</li>
            <li>It is simply the best for dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li>My hands have made it clear they love this cream as well.</li>
            <li>enough to feel nice).</li>
            <li>My hands don&#x27;t look like they belong to a 120 year old woman any more either.    </li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>Keeps your hands soft and smooth even in Santa Ana winds!</li>
            <li>For overnight wear, it will give your hands a smooth, healthy feel the next day, or even longer.</li>
            <li>If you find that you need to moisturize your skin this is well worth a try.</li>
            <li>Hey, I never thought I would feel so strongly about a product, but this is hands down the most comfortable hand cream for a guy.</li>
            <li>but it gets absorbed right away.  </li>
            <li>I used to really like this item until I became more conscious of what I was putting on my skin, started reading the ingredients and was very dissapointed to find it&#x27;s full of parabens!</li>
            <li>it works great for very dry skin when lotion is too light to do the job; it is greasy enough to do the tough job, but your hands don&#x27;t feel greasy after it, they feel perfect</li>
            <li>Right size for my purse.  </li>
            <li>; highly recommend (and they have it fragrance free which I appreciate because I can&#x27;t tolerate some fragrances)</li>
            <li>Additionally, I&#x27;m sensitive to products with added scents, so I love that it really is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>Then, in the car, I put some on, a pretty generous amount.</li>
            <li>This product really does work!  </li>
            <li>First the product is called a \\&quot;hand cream\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The first day I believed I used it twice and that same day my hands felt much better.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice hand cream since I have really rough elbows.</li>
            <li>I use a fake tan make up on my body and this is a wonderful primer before application.</li>
            <li>Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>Can get it locally but not at this price  Love this handcream.</li>
            <li>A \\&quot;midwestern boy on his own\\&quot; in the desert of Arizona can find himself with dry skin very easily.  </li>
            <li>It does a very good job at relieving dry, rough skin.</li>
            <li>I use far less of it, which makes me happy.    </li>
            <li>However, in the dead of winter when your skin is so dry that it is painful,this stuff is the best!</li>
            <li>I have used the fragrance-free Neutrogena hand cream pretty much my whole life (over 50 years), and it keeps my hands in good shape year round.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream so much that I keep one everywhere - next to the kitchen sink, in the bathroom, diaper bag, purse and at my desk.  </li>
            <li>So it pretty much saved my life.  </li>
            <li>But as I said at the very beginning of this review, for its price, it works very well!</li>
            <li>I made my husband promise me that every Christmas for the rest of my life I&#x27;ll get a new tube in my stocking, because we&#x27;re exciting like that in our family.</li>
            <li>And as boys, they are happy that it has hardly any scent!</li>
            <li>I had some dry cracked skin on my heels and in one application my skin was better.</li>
            <li>Many hand lotions disappear leaving my hands feeling dry immediately after application, this does not.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist suggests strongly that his patients use Neutrogena Norwegian hand cream.</li>
            <li>I hope this is the case as the regular hand cream is very greasy &amp; not as easy to apply as the age shield.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry, and I have tried many moisturizers over the years.</li>
            <li>All in all, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a lotiony goop feeling on your hands either.</li>
            <li>Her skin is much smoother than before she started using this product.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly--you just don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>and it made my hands very sticky/slippery for quite some time .</li>
            <li>This winter has been really rough for my skin (which I know is the case for most people this year).  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena tells me that the age shield cream has not been discontinued but is either being reformulated,repackaged, etc &amp; should be available in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>My hands start to crack and bleed every winter and this really helps.</li>
            <li>Softens even the roughest skin I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>It works, it really does.  </li>
            <li>Will never get any better if your hands are truly chapped starting in the early Winter and beyond.</li>
            <li>Other lotions couldn&#x27;t even touch the dryness, and they would just sit on top of my skin and eventually wash off without really changing the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to put up with the thick coating feeling because it does an exceptional job of making my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>In the months before I discovered this amazing product, my hands were so chapped, dry, and sore that they the skin was breaking open and bleeding.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer lotions with no scent but this scent is really nice.  </li>
            <li>I found this product more or less by accident and had to try and do something.  </li>
            <li>Most of them leave me feeling slimy handed, and don&#x27;t actually seem to work, but this stuff is different.    </li>
            <li>I have always had dry skin and can rarely find a moisturizer that is strong enough.</li>
            <li>My skin was getting progressively drier with weather conditions and as I get older, but problem solved.</li>
            <li>If you use more than that, when it becomes an unmanageable mushy mess.   </li>
            <li>Regardless of price, this is highly effective product which is used in very small quantities, so the value is very high at almost any price.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews on this and Neutrogena was highly recommended by people with this problem.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So far, it has worked really well.</li>
            <li>I, like many others used to suffer through the winter with bleeding knuckles and slathered on lotion all day long to try and combat the inevitable.</li>
            <li>Been a few years now and could not recommend this stuff more...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like normal lotion for my hands</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and this has given me the skin of a 20 year old!!!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, last for hours, and great for the price.</li>
            <li>I always put this hand cream on right before going to bed, and have found that doing this daily is tremendous for helping prevent itchy dry hands/cracked hands/etc.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the most moisturizing, least greasy cream you can buy.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hands very soft.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing I&#x27;ve found that not only keeps my hands from cracking, but it helps to restore them to a semi-smooth state without feeling like I have gel all over my hands.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>My hands have never been so soft!</li>
            <li>It soaks in pretty quick, lasts a long time, and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely rough, dry, and cracking skin hands, but when I used this product, even the first time, my hands became smooth, soft, and moist.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working nicely, just a small application is enough for leaving the skin smoother and moist.</li>
            <li>At first it feels quite heavy, but it absorbs and protects better than any other.</li>
            <li>My hands and arms are almost entirely clear after using for two days and it doesn&#x27;t not burn my skin at all.    </li>
            <li>I was in so much pain, constantly.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands frequently and this cream still lasts.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, a tiny amount spreads on very well and the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; sensation goes away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Decided to order on line because it is so much easier than going to a physical store and finding that they are out if the product.</li>
            <li>my cracks were completely gone.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective hand cream for these bitter cold conditions.</li>
            <li>When I first applied this cream to my very dry hands, I noticed it was greasy and thought I&#x27;d dislike it.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it for everyone, especially people with skin problems like I have.</li>
            <li>, after it dried out some, everything was cool . ..</li>
            <li>It goes on a little like vaseline but quickly soaks up and does not leave any grease on my hands.</li>
            <li>This cream is not too greasy, but personally for me would be slightly too greasy to wear throughout the day (but that can be said about pretty much any hand cream for me).</li>
            <li>I live in what is technically considered an arctic desert.  </li>
            <li>so not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Great hand and foot moisturizer, absorbed quickly so not greasy.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li>No other hand cream makes my hands feel this soft after being in dishwater, and the moisturizing effect lasts much longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hands super soft and comfortable in cold weather.  </li>
            <li>This is great for when my hands are so neglected they&#x27;re painful.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear and I don&#x27;t have to worry about white streaks on my hands.   </li>
            <li>Within a couple applications I could open the palm of my hand completely and within a day or two</li>
            <li>I have really dry hands in the winter, and this really works, I only need to apply it once or twice a day, and it works immediately!</li>
            <li>My dry skin went from being rough and ,well, dry to smooth and moist (but not too moist .</li>
            <li>It is true that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Even though this lotion is pretty thick, I highly recommend it because it does what it claims.</li>
            <li>The dr. suggests putting it on the eyes at night, but you must use just a little and rub it around in your palm first.</li>
            <li>when first applied it feels wet ,but soaks in so quickly,best ever the itchy dry hands and red cracks are going away.</li>
            <li>After having my baby I developed a rash on my hands from overwashing and extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself does wonders on my hands and is not greasy at all; rather, it&#x27;s thick and absorbs relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason that the neutrogena takes so long to dry on your skin is because of the high percentage of glycerin in it.</li>
            <li>For my whole life I have struggled with extreme dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is not a daily hand cream but an extreme repair cream, and it works very well on dry, cracked, and chapped hands.</li>

            <li> This is the best hand cream I have ever used, and I have been using hand cream for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist and was pleasantly pleased to find it to be a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The best thing for hands, and priced right.  </li>
            <li> but when I tried it out I must say that I was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s packaged in a 4 pack because that&#x27;s about what I&#x27;ll need to get through a winter!</li>
            <li> and I just love it!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  </li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream!</li>
            <li> Without this amazing hand cream, I probably would have got an infection or bled to death.</li>
            <li> it is an amazing product that i hope never changes.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> My husband has his own tubes.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST lotion i have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to use this cream at night, maybe even with some lotion gloves, it will keep your hands feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to others who have also been pleased with results and will continue to use it..</li>
            <li> We put it on nightly before going to sleep, being sure to rub it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I love to use it product.</li>
            <li> Mostly.</li>
            <li> I consistenly love Neutrogena products and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> On this part, I think I like L&#x27;occtaine better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried others, but this is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li> longer time than most lotions/hand creams.</li>
            <li> This one is ok</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, but Neutrogena Norwegian Formula provides the best relief.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because it is almost more of a barrier cream than a lotion, and</li>
            <li> My wife love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years after trying so many others that claim to heal try skin but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> ok, I NEVER used hand cream, because I always considered that way too feminine for my tastes.</li>
            <li> I had already been using it for many years and love it.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Everyone who&#x27;s used some love it.  </li>
            <li> and my hands are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have never found a better hand lotion.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Glad we were able to get it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for severe winter damage to my hands but is not something I use all the time.</li>
            <li> Great hand and foot moisturizer, absorbed quickly</li>
            <li> so it is even better than those products that has strong shea butter smell..</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion for anyone suffering from dry skin.</li>
            <li> Especially good in the winter for chapped, dry skin and hands.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is the best cure for dry lips that I have found.</li>
            <li> Great product, my dermatologist recommended it for my very sensitive hands.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream for very dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at how cheap it is to buy, it is better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> , she loved it, she&#x27;s been getting this product for  a long time and just loved it.</li>
            <li> This product heals dry skin and is wonderfully odor free.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong for me</li>
            <li> Strong fragrancies make me sneeze and cough.  </li>
            <li> BUT, this is hands down the best product for my hands I have ever tried in my 40+ years.     </li>
            <li> Best hand lotion, hands down.  </li>
            <li> I have tried too many other products to count and was so glad to re-discover this great hand cream.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re good as new.</li>
            <li> I still have the skin condition, but I apply this lotion every night at bedtime and my hands have been fine.</li>
            <li> It has a perfect size (2oz, safe for airplane!), no strong smell, greasy when you first apply it</li>
            <li> so for this one it is great  and moisture enough to  protect my hands.</li>
            <li> but once you smooth it into your hands it absorbs.</li>
            <li> She has tried multiple products before but she is quite happy with this one.</li>
            <li> By the next day my hands had improved greatly.  </li>
            <li> My skin is silky smooth now all over.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free - I don&#x27;t like putting anything on my body with too much scent in it and prefer products that are fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands often, this is a rich, but not greasy lotion.</li>
            <li> :) Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the most effective cold-weather hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Hands down this is the most amazing Lotion Cream I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem like its absorbing, but once I keep working it I can get most of it in.  </li>
            <li> This is the only hand cream that seems to do any good at all for them.</li>
            <li> All I can say about this product is if you have really chapped hands you will fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> Since moving to this climate I&#x27;ve tried any number of approaches to solving the problem but this product seems to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and the price is quite reasonable.      </li>
            <li> this is very heavy-duty lotion, and it&#x27;s great for winter time when you need extra protection from the elements.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy feel or scent.</li>
            <li> I use it at home after work, it doesn&#x27;t take more than a drop and is absorbed straight away.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of hand creams for my dry skin and have found this, Neutrogena Norwegian Formula, to be the best.</li>
            <li> It is simply the best for dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li> My hands have made it clear they love this cream as well.</li>
            <li> enough to feel nice).</li>
            <li> My hands don&#x27;t look like they belong to a 120 year old woman any more either.    </li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Keeps your hands soft and smooth even in Santa Ana winds!</li>
            <li> For overnight wear, it will give your hands a smooth, healthy feel the next day, or even longer.</li>
            <li> If you find that you need to moisturize your skin this is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> Hey, I never thought I would feel so strongly about a product, but this is hands down the most comfortable hand cream for a guy.</li>
            <li> but it gets absorbed right away.  </li>
            <li> I used to really like this item until I became more conscious of what I was putting on my skin, started reading the ingredients and was very dissapointed to find it&#x27;s full of parabens!</li>
            <li> it works great for very dry skin when lotion is too light to do the job; it is greasy enough to do the tough job, but your hands don&#x27;t feel greasy after it, they feel perfect</li>
            <li> Right size for my purse.  </li>
            <li> ; highly recommend (and they have it fragrance free which I appreciate because I can&#x27;t tolerate some fragrances)</li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;m sensitive to products with added scents, so I love that it really is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> Then, in the car, I put some on, a pretty generous amount.</li>
            <li> This product really does work!  </li>
            <li> First the product is called a \\&quot;hand cream\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The first day I believed I used it twice and that same day my hands felt much better.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice hand cream since I have really rough elbows.</li>
            <li> I use a fake tan make up on my body and this is a wonderful primer before application.</li>
            <li> Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> Can get it locally but not at this price  Love this handcream.</li>
            <li> A \\&quot;midwestern boy on his own\\&quot; in the desert of Arizona can find himself with dry skin very easily.  </li>
            <li> It does a very good job at relieving dry, rough skin.</li>
            <li> I use far less of it, which makes me happy.    </li>
            <li> However, in the dead of winter when your skin is so dry that it is painful,this stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> I have used the fragrance-free Neutrogena hand cream pretty much my whole life (over 50 years), and it keeps my hands in good shape year round.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream so much that I keep one everywhere - next to the kitchen sink, in the bathroom, diaper bag, purse and at my desk.  </li>
            <li> So it pretty much saved my life.  </li>
            <li> But as I said at the very beginning of this review, for its price, it works very well!</li>
            <li> I made my husband promise me that every Christmas for the rest of my life I&#x27;ll get a new tube in my stocking, because we&#x27;re exciting like that in our family.</li>
            <li> And as boys, they are happy that it has hardly any scent!</li>
            <li> I had some dry cracked skin on my heels and in one application my skin was better.</li>
            <li> Many hand lotions disappear leaving my hands feeling dry immediately after application, this does not.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggests strongly that his patients use Neutrogena Norwegian hand cream.</li>
            <li> I hope this is the case as the regular hand cream is very greasy &amp; not as easy to apply as the age shield.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, and I have tried many moisturizers over the years.</li>
            <li> All in all, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a lotiony goop feeling on your hands either.</li>
            <li> Her skin is much smoother than before she started using this product.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly--you just don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> and it made my hands very sticky/slippery for quite some time .</li>
            <li> This winter has been really rough for my skin (which I know is the case for most people this year).  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena tells me that the age shield cream has not been discontinued but is either being reformulated,repackaged, etc &amp; should be available in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> My hands start to crack and bleed every winter and this really helps.</li>
            <li> Softens even the roughest skin I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> It works, it really does.  </li>
            <li> Will never get any better if your hands are truly chapped starting in the early Winter and beyond.</li>
            <li> Other lotions couldn&#x27;t even touch the dryness, and they would just sit on top of my skin and eventually wash off without really changing the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to put up with the thick coating feeling because it does an exceptional job of making my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> In the months before I discovered this amazing product, my hands were so chapped, dry, and sore that they the skin was breaking open and bleeding.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer lotions with no scent but this scent is really nice.  </li>
            <li> I found this product more or less by accident and had to try and do something.  </li>
            <li> Most of them leave me feeling slimy handed, and don&#x27;t actually seem to work, but this stuff is different.    </li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin and can rarely find a moisturizer that is strong enough.</li>
            <li> My skin was getting progressively drier with weather conditions and as I get older, but problem solved.</li>
            <li> If you use more than that, when it becomes an unmanageable mushy mess.   </li>
            <li> Regardless of price, this is highly effective product which is used in very small quantities, so the value is very high at almost any price.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews on this and Neutrogena was highly recommended by people with this problem.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far, it has worked really well.</li>
            <li> I, like many others used to suffer through the winter with bleeding knuckles and slathered on lotion all day long to try and combat the inevitable.</li>
            <li> Been a few years now and could not recommend this stuff more...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like normal lotion for my hands</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and this has given me the skin of a 20 year old!!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, last for hours, and great for the price.</li>
            <li> I always put this hand cream on right before going to bed, and have found that doing this daily is tremendous for helping prevent itchy dry hands/cracked hands/etc.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the most moisturizing, least greasy cream you can buy.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hands very soft.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing I&#x27;ve found that not only keeps my hands from cracking, but it helps to restore them to a semi-smooth state without feeling like I have gel all over my hands.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> My hands have never been so soft!</li>
            <li> It soaks in pretty quick, lasts a long time, and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely rough, dry, and cracking skin hands, but when I used this product, even the first time, my hands became smooth, soft, and moist.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working nicely, just a small application is enough for leaving the skin smoother and moist.</li>
            <li> At first it feels quite heavy, but it absorbs and protects better than any other.</li>
            <li> My hands and arms are almost entirely clear after using for two days and it doesn&#x27;t not burn my skin at all.    </li>
            <li> I was in so much pain, constantly.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands frequently and this cream still lasts.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, a tiny amount spreads on very well and the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; sensation goes away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Decided to order on line because it is so much easier than going to a physical store and finding that they are out if the product.</li>
            <li> my cracks were completely gone.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective hand cream for these bitter cold conditions.</li>
            <li> When I first applied this cream to my very dry hands, I noticed it was greasy and thought I&#x27;d dislike it.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it for everyone, especially people with skin problems like I have.</li>
            <li> , after it dried out some, everything was cool . ..</li>
            <li> It goes on a little like vaseline but quickly soaks up and does not leave any grease on my hands.</li>
            <li> This cream is not too greasy, but personally for me would be slightly too greasy to wear throughout the day (but that can be said about pretty much any hand cream for me).</li>
            <li> I live in what is technically considered an arctic desert.  </li>
            <li> so not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Great hand and foot moisturizer, absorbed quickly so not greasy.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li> No other hand cream makes my hands feel this soft after being in dishwater, and the moisturizing effect lasts much longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hands super soft and comfortable in cold weather.  </li>
            <li> This is great for when my hands are so neglected they&#x27;re painful.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear and I don&#x27;t have to worry about white streaks on my hands.   </li>
            <li> Within a couple applications I could open the palm of my hand completely and within a day or two</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands in the winter, and this really works, I only need to apply it once or twice a day, and it works immediately!</li>
            <li> My dry skin went from being rough and ,well, dry to smooth and moist (but not too moist .</li>
            <li> It is true that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Even though this lotion is pretty thick, I highly recommend it because it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> The dr. suggests putting it on the eyes at night, but you must use just a little and rub it around in your palm first.</li>
            <li> when first applied it feels wet ,but soaks in so quickly,best ever the itchy dry hands and red cracks are going away.</li>
            <li> After having my baby I developed a rash on my hands from overwashing and extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself does wonders on my hands and is not greasy at all; rather, it&#x27;s thick and absorbs relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason that the neutrogena takes so long to dry on your skin is because of the high percentage of glycerin in it.</li>
            <li> For my whole life I have struggled with extreme dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is not a daily hand cream but an extreme repair cream, and it works very well on dry, cracked, and chapped hands.</li>
            <li> Take note: if your hands are very dry and chapped, this cream may sting a little the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> my hand gets instantly moistured after applying it and stay that way for a long time(until</li>

            <li> The Costco model is \\&quot;Original\\&quot; which unfortunately means it has fragrance, but it normally sells for $6.99 for a 4 pack of 2 ounce tubes.  </li>

            <li> Needless to say once he tried it, He no longer has dry cracking skin on his hands.</li>
            <li> and it has cleared up the dry, uncomfortable sensation in my hands.  </li>
            <li> I am a little addicted to this hand cream.</li>
            <li> And once you use it, spreading regular lotion across your hands will be a disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really thick formula</li>
            <li> This lotion is extremely thick.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having problems with cracked heels just apply a thick layer before bed and don&#x27;t forget to put on some socks</li>
            <li> I was really doubtful that an over-the-counter product could do much to help them, but I was blown away.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> So, I have a confession to make... I am a little addicted to this hand cream. As in, I wear it EVERY day (yes, every day). I always put this hand cream on right before going to bed, and have found that doing this daily is tremendous for helping prevent itchy dry hands/cracked hands/etc. (and anyone who has ever had to put on bandaids on their finger tips because they cracked so badly knows how absolutely important that can be). My hands have made it clear they love this cream as well. Whenever I accidentally skip a day, they make it very clear they are not happy with me. This cream is not too greasy, but personally for me would be slightly too greasy to wear throughout the day (but that can be said about pretty much any hand cream for me). All in all, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Only lotion that seems to work for my severely chapped hands.</li>
            <li> This product definitely is very effective.  I have recommended it to others who have also been pleased with results and will continue to use it..</li>
            <li> This stuff is THE BEST. My grown kids and I all suffer from severely chapped hands during the winter. There is nothing like Norwegian Formula to take care of the condition. We put it on nightly before going to sleep, being sure to rub it in thoroughly. Problem solved.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product when I went to my dermatologist for a skin condition. I had patches of very dry skin and cuts from my skin splitting... very painful! After a couple of days, my dry patches and splits were healed. I still have the skin condition, but I apply this lotion every night at bedtime and my hands have been fine. Even though this lotion is pretty thick, I highly recommend it because it does what it claims. I give this lotion 5 Stars and will probably be using this the rest of my life for my skin condition... but hey, it beats going to the dermatologist and being prescribed $140.00 cortizone cream!</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of hand creams for my dry skin and have found this, Neutrogena Norwegian Formula, to be the best. I have skin that cracks easily in cold and dry weather and need something that will keep my skin from cracking. Neutrogena works very effectively for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the most effective cold-weather hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s greasy, but somehow not in the annoying slippery way after working it in a bit.</li>
            <li> I like skin care products with no perfume added,so for this one it is great  and moisture enough to  protect my hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my mother as a gift and she did NOT like it because she feels its too oily. She does not like the smell either.</li>
            <li> I live in what is technically considered an arctic desert.  It&#x27;s cold, really cold, and extremely dry.  Combine the two and you&#x27;ll get skin (especially hands) so dry that it will crack and bleed.  It requires constant hydration, and unfortunately moisturizing.  The problem is I hate lotions.  Most of them leave me feeling slimy handed, and don&#x27;t actually seem to work, but this stuff is different.    This is the first thing I&#x27;ve found that not only keeps my hands from cracking, but it helps to restore them to a semi-smooth state without feeling like I have gel all over my hands.  It soaks in pretty quick, lasts a long time, and goes a long way.  I use far less of it, which makes me happy.    If you&#x27;re looking for something to handle extremely dry skin in a cold/dry climate, this definitely should do the trick.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for me because I always have dry hands. Even after washing my hands and through long periods of time my hands never get dry. I love to use it product. Just a little dab does it. It&#x27;s a really thick formula but once you smooth it into your hands it absorbs. Doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a lotiony goop feeling on your hands either.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and she is very happy with the results. Her skin is much smoother than before she started using this product. She has tried multiple products before but she is quite happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious. Mostly. In the months before I discovered this amazing product, my hands were so chapped, dry, and sore that they the skin was breaking open and bleeding. I was in so much pain, constantly. I couldn&#x27;t even make a fist, I wanted to cry. Other lotions couldn&#x27;t even touch the dryness, and they would just sit on top of my skin and eventually wash off without really changing the condition of my skin.  Well, anyhow, a friend recommended this to me because she worked in a veterinarian&#x27;s office, and the vets swore by this. So I picked some up at the store--I was a little disappointed that the tube was so small. Then, in the car, I put some on, a pretty generous amount. Oh man. I could feel it just seeping into my skin. It was like my skin was just drinking in the moisture. I could bend my knuckles! Without pain or bleeding!  Without this amazing hand cream, I probably would have got an infection or bled to death. So it pretty much saved my life.  Oh, and don&#x27;t let the small size fool you. It lasts a long time. I use it regularly--you just don&#x27;t need much. I go through a 2 oz tube a year. I made my husband promise me that every Christmas for the rest of my life I&#x27;ll get a new tube in my stocking, because we&#x27;re exciting like that in our family.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream following the advice of my dermatologist. So far it&#x27;s working nicely, just a small application is enough for leaving the skin smoother and moist.</li>
            <li> Hello, my name is Mia and I&#x27;m a lotion-aholic.  I&#x27;m constantly buying and using lotion due to my extremely dry skin and desert locale.  I purchased this four pack through subscibe and save at a great price - $10.32 for a four pack.  This lotion is extremely thick.  It feels similar to having a coating of vaseline on your hands.  I prefer to put it on before I go to bed, so that the thickness doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;m willing to put up with the thick coating feeling because it does an exceptional job of making my skin soft.  The tubes are pretty small, but you only put a small amount on at a time.  I gave these to my kid&#x27;s teachers for an end-of-the-year teacher gift with a note attached that said, \\&quot;Hands down you&#x27;re the best teacher!\\&quot;  Easy, affordable, and not a coffee cup!  I consistenly love Neutrogena products and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Good hand cream for its price. It has a perfect size (2oz, safe for airplane!), no strong smell, greasy when you first apply it but it gets absorbed right away.  The healing effect is good, does make my hand softer and smoother. But it does not last if you don&#x27;t continuously apply it. On this part, I think I like L&#x27;occtaine better. But as I said at the very beginning of this review, for its price, it works very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for years and I&#x27;ve tried others, but this is still my favorite.  The bottle is a convenient size--I keep one in my desk at work, one in my purse, etc.  The lotion itself does wonders on my hands and is not greasy at all; rather, it&#x27;s thick and absorbs relatively quickly.  Additionally, I&#x27;m sensitive to products with added scents, so I love that it really is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I, like many others used to suffer through the winter with bleeding knuckles and slathered on lotion all day long to try and combat the inevitable. It wasn&#x27;t until a dermatologist handed me a tube of this stuff and stated \\&quot;a pea sized blob on the back of each hand after you get out of the shower and you should be good\\&quot;.  She wasn&#x27;t lying!  took about 4 days for my hands to heal and I&#x27;ve never touched anything else since.  Been a few years now and could not recommend this stuff more... it is an amazing product that i hope never changes.</li>
            <li> this product it great when first applied it feels wet ,but soaks in so quickly,best ever the itchy dry hands and red cracks are going away.</li>
            <li> This is better than expensive brand name hand creams that I used before. my hand gets instantly moistured after applying it and stay that way for a long time(until I wash it away). This has no fragrance so it is even better than those products that has strong shea butter smell..</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my dry hands.  Finding it in a local drug store has been a hit or miss affair.  I like the reliability and price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> WOW!  This product really does work!  I have extremely rough, dry, and cracking skin hands, but when I used this product, even the first time, my hands became smooth, soft, and moist.  This is an excellent product and I am hooked on this product.  This is the product I will buy from now on!</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion for anyone suffering from dry skin. It works especially well for dry cracked heels and feet.  If you&#x27;re having problems with cracked heels just apply a thick layer before bed and don&#x27;t forget to put on some socks, otherwise you&#x27;ll get the sheets all messy.&lt;br /&gt;The reason that the neutrogena takes so long to dry on your skin is because of the high percentage of glycerin in it. But that&#x27;s also what makes it so good for your skin.</li>
            <li> My mom started using this product and has been \\&quot;addicted\\&quot; to it ever since. She uses it when her hands are dry any time of the year. I was a little skeptical of this \\&quot;miracle cure\\&quot; (as said by my mom), but when I tried it out I must say that I was pretty impressed. My dry skin went from being rough and ,well, dry to smooth and moist (but not too moist . .just enough to feel nice). The only problem I had with this hand cream was that it was very thick and it made my hands very sticky/slippery for quite some time . .a longer time than most lotions/hand creams. . .But, after it dried out some, everything was cool . ..</li>
            <li> First the product is called a \\&quot;hand cream\\&quot; but I think Neutrogena should change the name to Moisturizer Cream because you can use this stuff on any part of the body - even your lips. As for the effectiveness this cream is very good. It does a very good job at relieving dry, rough skin. I love the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free - I don&#x27;t like putting anything on my body with too much scent in it and prefer products that are fragrance free. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the product is almost a little too thick and leaves my hands a little greasy and slippery.</li>
            <li> This winter has been really rough for my skin (which I know is the case for most people this year).  The dry and cold air has left my skin especially dry and my hands have even cracked and bled this season.  I am no stranger to dry skin...but this year I purchased a couple of different products hoping to find some relief.  I am so happy that I purchased this product.  The first day I believed I used it twice and that same day my hands felt much better.  By the next day my hands had improved greatly.  Even after washing my hands repeatedly throughout the day I do not have to continuously apply this lotion. I even purchased the lotion intended for the body...I was going to go back and pick up the cream for feet, but I no longer have to because the lotion has done the trick.  I usually prefer lotions with no scent but this scent is really nice.  I plan to stick with this product and will also purchase other Neutrogena products in the future.</li>
            <li> I have numerous skin problems including atopic eczema, extremely dry skin and an allergy to the sun. My hands were so dry and so covered with red bumps and tiny itchy painful blisters after being out in the sun last week.    Even water and olive oil burn my hands! My daughter suggested this cream and it is almost miraculous. My hands and arms are almost entirely clear after using for two days and it doesn&#x27;t not burn my skin at all.    My hands don&#x27;t look like they belong to a 120 year old woman any more either.    Well worth the price and I highly recommend it for everyone, especially people with skin problems like I have.</li>
            <li> After having my baby I developed a rash on my hands from overwashing and extremely dry skin. I visited a dermatologist who prescribed me a steroid cream to get rid of the rash and samples of this hand cream. He insisted I use this every time I wash my hands to keep them moisturized so I would not have another rash breakout. I have been using this for over a year now and do not have dry chapped skin. I still wash my hands about 20 times a day so this is a life saver!</li>
            <li> I have used the fragrance-free Neutrogena hand cream pretty much my whole life (over 50 years), and it keeps my hands in good shape year round.  I have tried countless others, and they always leave me disappointed and going back to the tried and true.  The best thing for hands, and priced right.  I only wish they offered it in subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hand cream as the Neutrogena age shield hand cream has been unavailable for months. Neutrogena tells me that the age shield cream has not been discontinued but is either being reformulated,repackaged, etc &amp; should be available in the future. I hope this is the case as the regular hand cream is very greasy &amp; not as easy to apply as the age shield. I hope they bring the age shield back. This is a poor substitute &amp; I regret I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I work with animals so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands.  This lotion is really great.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out after a few minutes and it keeps my hands feeling really soft.  The smell is a bit strong for me but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I used to really like this item until I became more conscious of what I was putting on my skin, started reading the ingredients and was very dissapointed to find it&#x27;s full of parabens! until they change they ingredients, I&#x27;m saying good bye to this!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice hand cream since I have really rough elbows. This one is ok and I like that it has a really good EWG rating but it&#x27;s ok. Elbows don&#x27;t seem significantly different in the morning if you use it before bed.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> My hands and legs get very dry especially in the winter. I have tried many products, but Neutrogena Norwegian Formula provides the best relief. Nothing comes close. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s packaged in a 4 pack because that&#x27;s about what I&#x27;ll need to get through a winter!</li>
            <li> this is very heavy-duty lotion, and it&#x27;s great for winter time when you need extra protection from the elements. I give it 4 stars because it is almost more of a barrier cream than a lotion, and so it feels like it leaves a coating on your skin, like it doesn&#x27;t totally soak in.</li>
            <li> My wife love it. She works as a register nurse and use it all the time. Will buy again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product, my dermatologist recommended it for my very sensitive hands. My hands her very dry and start peeling for even the slightest thing.  My dermatologist told me that I have to use this product several times every day to prevent this and to use gloves when I am doing chores around the house. So far, it has worked really well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my finger tips were cracking from dryness even though I always use hand lotions. I read some reviews on this and Neutrogena was highly recommended by people with this problem. All my cracks went away after using this and I just love it! You only have to use a little bit and it goes a long way. Highly recommend it. I will definitely keep using this forever.</li>
            <li> This is really good hand cream. It soaks into the skin without leaving a greasy film. I really like this.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  My hands have never been so soft! I use it at night and it lasts all day. I used to be ashamed of my dry hands but now they look great.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream for very dry hands.  A must have during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few hand creams that I can whole heartedly recommend. It is a concentrated formula so you only need to use a little bit. It&#x27;s best to use this cream at night, maybe even with some lotion gloves, it will keep your hands feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I have ever used, and I have been using hand cream for many, many years.  I buy this hand cream for Christmas gifts and everyone I give it to becomes a regular user.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem like its absorbing, but once I keep working it I can get most of it in.  This is great for when my hands are so neglected they&#x27;re painful.  Just one or two applications and they&#x27;re good as new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years after trying so many others that claim to heal try skin but don&#x27;t. This does.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hand cream for years now.  Especially good in the winter for chapped, dry skin and hands.  I like the scentless variety  It absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy feel or scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have really dry hands in the winter, and this really works, I only need to apply it once or twice a day, and it works immediately!</li>
            <li> I have several kids that work in the food industry and their hands are always in water. This is the only hand cream that seems to do any good at all for them. And as boys, they are happy that it has hardly any scent!</li>
            <li> I bought some on sale at Costco not knowing what to expect and found that it works extremely well.  Using only a small amount, dry skin is relieved nearly instantly.  The Costco model is \\&quot;Original\\&quot; which unfortunately means it has fragrance, but it normally sells for $6.99 for a 4 pack of 2 ounce tubes.  The current coupon has it for $1.50 off or about $5.49 for 4.  Not sure why the Amazon prices are so much higher.  Regardless of price, this is highly effective product which is used in very small quantities, so the value is very high at almost any price.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by my dermatologist because my eczema is the worst and my skin is the driest on my hands. This cream helps keep my skin hydrated without leaving a film. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent. Overall this product is great!</li>
            <li> This is the only hand cream I have found that keeps my hands from cracking and bleeding in the winter.</li>
            <li> One of the best hand creams available! My hands start to crack and bleed every winter and this really helps. I wash my hands frequently and this cream still lasts.</li>
            <li> I would not use this as an everyday moisturizer because it&#x27;s a bit much. However, in the dead of winter when your skin is so dry that it is painful,this stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the most amazing Lotion Cream I have ever used! Softens even the roughest skin I recommend it highly! I have tried literally 100 mof lotions for dry skin this goes a long way not to much, if you have any rough areas buy it, you will never be sorry you bought 4.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist and was pleasantly pleased to find it to be a great product. Try it you won&#x27;t regret your choice.</li>
            <li> I seemed like it just sat on the skin and felt very heavy for a hand cream</li>
            <li> My husband has to wash his hands often and has ever been complaining about the rough dry cracking skin he gets.  I have recommended Neutrogena to him off and on for quite a while. I finally just decided to order it for him. Needless to say once he tried it, He no longer has dry cracking skin on his hands.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Keeps your hands soft and smooth even in Santa Ana winds!</li>
            <li> My hand become so dry that sometimes they crack and bleed at the palms (Eczema).  This product has dramatically reduced the dryness without the harsh prescribed medications by doctors. A little goes a long way, last for hours, and great for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great hand cream - moisturizes well and is not greasy at all. Perfect for use at work.</li>
            <li> All I can say about this product is if you have really chapped hands you will fall in love with it. Moisturizes like no other. And once you use it, spreading regular lotion across your hands will be a disappointing experience. Don&#x27;t be afraid of the price; it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> ok, I NEVER used hand cream, because I always considered that way too feminine for my tastes. BUT, this is hands down the best product for my hands I have ever tried in my 40+ years.     Here&#x27;s why.    1. It has no odor, so I don&#x27;t smell like my grandmother.   2. it&#x27;s clear and I don&#x27;t have to worry about white streaks on my hands.   3. you only need a teeny tiny bit to work into your hands. If you use more than that, when it becomes an unmanageable mushy mess.   4. It keeps my hands super soft and comfortable in cold weather.  5. It also works great for my heels, elbows, and knees..     Mind you, I have tried Vaseline, now I consider that formula a joke compared to this. Hey, I never thought I would feel so strongly about a product, but this is hands down the most comfortable hand cream for a guy.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggests strongly that his patients use Neutrogena Norwegian hand cream. I had already been using it for many years and love it. I have a tube in my car, by my bed, by my couch, and in the kitchen. At first it feels quite heavy, but it absorbs and protects better than any other. The dr. suggests putting it on the eyes at night, but you must use just a little and rub it around in your palm first. No other hand cream makes my hands feel this soft after being in dishwater, and the moisturizing effect lasts much longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. My husband has his own tubes. He uses this after working in the yard, with cement or whatever.</li>
            <li> it works great for very dry skin when lotion is too light to do the job; it is greasy enough to do the tough job, but your hands don&#x27;t feel greasy after it, they feel perfect; highly recommend (and they have it fragrance free which I appreciate because I can&#x27;t tolerate some fragrances)</li>
            <li> For my whole life I have struggled with extreme dry skin. I have tried a lot of things but nothing works quite like this! I use it every day. I is literally the best product I have tried for my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I am amazed at how cheap it is to buy, it is better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. I have always had dry skin and can rarely find a moisturizer that is strong enough. I use this all over my body, not just my hands. A little bit goes a long way. My skin is silky smooth now all over. I am 51 years old and this has given me the skin of a 20 year old!!! I had some dry cracked skin on my heels and in one application my skin was better. I have never found it thick or greasy and it disappears instantly on my skin(but I put it on sparingly). I use a fake tan make up on my body and this is a wonderful primer before application. I have a lot of allergies and this product my skin loves. Definitely the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever discovered.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  Right size for my purse.  Everyone who&#x27;s used some love it.  Helps shield against drying weather and keeps moisture in.  Many hand lotions disappear leaving my hands feeling dry immediately after application, this does not.  I wash my hands often, this is a rich, but not greasy lotion. With the added benefit of sun protection.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream! It goes on a little like vaseline but quickly soaks up and does not leave any grease on my hands. It provides all day moisture for my hands even after I wash my hands I can tell a difference. I don&#x27;t like normal lotion for my hands its too greasy and doesn&#x27;t hydrate enough, especially the winter months. I keep it at my desk at work and put it on once and day and my hands are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff will heal and protect your cracked and dry hands. I have never found a better hand lotion. You only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, and I have tried many moisturizers over the years. Most are not only useless for extremely dry skin, but they often have an annoying fragrance. This product heals dry skin and is wonderfully odor free. Take note: if your hands are very dry and chapped, this cream may sting a little the first time you use it. But the relief from dryness and chapping is terrific. This is one of only a few creams my dermatologist recommends.</li>
            <li> I use this hand cream exclusively! It is simply the best for dry skin in winter. Small tube, but a little does the trick. I apply every night during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena hand cream is the only product that provides moisturizing for both my hands and even my face. I have tried too many other products to count and was so glad to re-discover this great hand cream. My skin was getting progressively drier with weather conditions and as I get older, but problem solved. Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> It is true that a little bit goes a long way. This is not a daily hand cream but an extreme repair cream, and it works very well on dry, cracked, and chapped hands. It doesn&#x27;t sting!</li>
            <li> When I first applied this cream to my very dry hands, I noticed it was greasy and thought I&#x27;d dislike it.  To my surprise, a tiny amount spreads on very well and the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; sensation goes away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once yesterday and twice today and it has cleared up the dry, uncomfortable sensation in my hands.  It also seems to provide long lasting protection even after I wash my hands.</li>
            <li> It will keep your hands from a dry weather. I have used different brands (khiel, origin, etc.) but this one is the best!</li>
            <li> This hand cream is petroleum gel based. For overnight wear, it will give your hands a smooth, healthy feel the next day, or even longer.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy or runny, and no scent. -1 star because of price, but I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using neutrogena for years. It is the only hand cream that works for my husband and me, especially in the winter. Decided to order on line because it is so much easier than going to a physical store and finding that they are out if the product.</li>
            <li> We have been buying Neutrogena hand cream for decades and there&#x27;s always a tube of this stuff in the house. It works really well and we wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a friend and she thought it was a great deal, when I sent the boxes to her, she loved it, she&#x27;s been getting this product for  a long time and just loved it. :) Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hand cream.  Could find it in normal stores and we use it everyday in the winter.  Glad we were able to get it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, especially during the winter, to prevent dry and cracked skin around the fingernails. Gave this as gifts to a number of people this Christmas.</li>
            <li> A \\&quot;midwestern boy on his own\\&quot; in the desert of Arizona can find himself with dry skin very easily.  Since moving to this climate I&#x27;ve tried any number of approaches to solving the problem but this product seems to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and the price is quite reasonable.      If you have problems with dry skin or chronic minor itches see a doctor to rule ou anything serious.  If you find that you need to moisturize your skin this is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life. I have severely dry hands that crack and bleed. My husband did some research and put this creme in my stocking last Christmas. I was really doubtful that an over-the-counter product could do much to help them, but I was blown away. Within a couple applications I could open the palm of my hand completely and within a day or two my cracks were completely gone. I still use this all the time and tell everyone I know about it. Amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy for lips, and it stays around until the morning. And I don&#x27;t need a sunscreen at night.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the most moisturizing, least greasy cream you can buy.  It is the best. You only need the smallest amount and it is deeply soothing.  Would 100% recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective hand cream for these bitter cold conditions. Chapped hands and finger tips benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST lotion i have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;My sensative skin loves it! I use it everyday. To make is less concentrated just dampen your hands before sqirting some out then you can use it as body lotion too. i also keep it in my purse for chaped lip season. Perfect excellent product Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much that I keep one everywhere - next to the kitchen sink, in the bathroom, diaper bag, purse and at my desk.  This is the only hand cream that I&#x27;ve used that keeps dry hands at bay in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. Best hand lotion I know of.......</li>
            <li> Makes your hands very soft. I have one in my car, work, home and in purse. Great lotion! If you have dry hands, I would invest in this lotion!</li>
            <li> Can get it locally but not at this price  Love this handcream.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is amazing. Also, it is the best cure for dry lips that I have found.</li>
            <li> There is simply nothing like this hand cream.  It&#x27;s thick enough to really last a long time, but it soaks in well enough (despite being thick) so that there is not a residual greasiness (if one does not put it on too liberally).</li>
            <li> This product is quite greasy feeling. It&#x27;s OK for severe winter damage to my hands but is not something I use all the time. A relative uses this all the time and I keep her supplied.</li>
            <li> The best hands cream ever! And great delivery service by our Amazon friends thank you happy 2015</li>
            <li> Best hand lotion, hands down.  Will never get any better if your hands are truly chapped starting in the early Winter and beyond.</li>
            <li> I work in an unheated warehouse.  The product I handle all day is dusty and greasy.  God knows what the liquid soap is in the restroom, but the ends of my fingers bleed around the nails and the skin on my hands gets so dry and rough it catches on my clothes.  Strong fragrancies make me sneeze and cough.  I found this product more or less by accident and had to try and do something.  It works, it really does.  I use it at home after work, it doesn&#x27;t take more than a drop and is absorbed straight away.  No grease, no smell lingering for hours.</li>
            <li> Great hand and foot moisturizer, absorbed quickly so not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Great hand and foot moisturizer, absorbed quickly so not greasy.</li>
            <li> The very best hand cream on the market... No exceptions!</li>
