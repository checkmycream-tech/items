            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review because I&#x27;m just that grateful to Neutrogena for making this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I found the product to be incredibly soothing on any surface used to shave (legs, face, etc), and of course the product absorbs immediately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for hands and feet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great deal for nice hands!</li>
            <li>Great handcream!!&lt;br /&gt;Works very good and leaves your hands feeling smooth not greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Neutrogen is good for the night before going to bed.</li>
            <li>but it works so good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that there is a fragrance free one that&#x27;s good!    </li>
            <li>It seems like a thicker cream than many others, but I think that&#x27;s because its also meant to protect, so its good that it does what it&#x27;s designed to do!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff, and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, you&#x27;re going to love how great your hands feel when you apply this hand cream.</li>
            <li>YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>During the day I use Weleda Skin Food because it moisturizes incredibly well but isn&#x27;t as concentrated as Neutrogena, so it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>This hand cream is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing -</li>
            <li>And the healing effects are amazing.</li>
            <li>Can warmly recommend.</li>
            <li>Being in Arizona, I am always having to apply some kind of creme to my heels and hands to combat dryness.</li>
            <li>I have used it for 20 years or more and my nails are in much, much better shape!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hand cream.  </li>
            <li>The cream is quite emollient, and I believe that most people will see dryness relief from use of this product.  </li>
            <li>We tried so many hand creams.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended this product and I&#x27;m so glad she did.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the Unscented for your lips because the scented tastes like a heathen&#x27;s taint and is better designed to cast evils out of your skin elsewhere.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a cream, but more like an ointment.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used this and ur looking for a god hand cream, dont look any further, u just found the best out there :)</li>
            <li>This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy or smeary like most lotions, either.</li>
            <li>This cream is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used their products on and off for a long time and am always happy to buy another one!</li>
            <li>This is the best hand cream for me and my dry hands.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress how perfect this product is for folks with dry</li>
            <li>What I like most about it is that it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I learned this is just the initial softness of your hands after applying this incredible cream.</li>
            <li>I like to keep it in my car and purse because it is compact and easy to take along.  </li>
            <li>The formula must have changed, or I am more intelligent and used it properly this time!</li>
            <li>Yes, it is more like an ointment than a cream, but it goes on creamy IF your skin is fresh from the shower or hand washing.</li>
            <li>This hand cream, however, is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free as I wanted, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to soften my hands as advertised.</li>
            <li>No stink, no sting, much smooth.</li>
            <li>It may feel better at first but</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous hand creams and lotions but this cream has been the best so far!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since told everyone about the Norwegian Formula because I honestly believe it is, hands down, the best hand cream on the market.</li>
            <li>Step right up!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing just two days of applying this cream and my fingers are nearly healed.  </li>
            <li>I have switched now to VASELINE Healthy Hands and Nails during the day which soaks into your hands much faster.</li>
            <li>For the most part, they were much too oily to leave on during the day.  </li>
            <li>This Neutrogena stuff is absolutely perfect for me, and I&#x27;m sure many others with the same problem I had/have (I still get very dried out during winter even though I finished my medication a couple years ago</li>
            <li>I have mild eczema</li>
            <li>However even there I feel like you wash a lot off first thing in the morning, so I am not so sure how much really goes into your hands rather than stays on the surface.</li>
            <li>No stinging, and it starts to feel better pretty much immediately.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena lotion showed up at exactly the right time!</li>
            <li>This cream is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have one in my purse, and others in various places in the house.    </li>
            <li>item was pricey, but well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>I keep tubes at home and at work and think it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well step right up here</li>
            <li>in mind that this formula appears to work best for very dry to severely dry hands.</li>
            <li>I also like the variety of this size because it can fit easily anywhere, especially for travel.</li>
            <li>But the good Lord intended it to be for SALVATION in other ways!</li>
            <li>i saw results right after the first application.</li>
            <li>I was even more surprised to see how fast it worked.</li>
            <li>No offensive odor or really any scent that I can detect, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>It leaves them feeling silky velvet and absorbs very fast, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This is hands down THE best product for dry hands!</li>
            <li>I have found that hand creams are even more subjective than facial creams.</li>
            <li>I personally think hand creams are much more a factor of how often you use it rather than which product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember exactly when it happened</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference from the first application.  </li>
            <li>There was no irritation, and for the first time my lips truly felt hydrated.</li>
            <li>Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t apply another lotion over top of it, simply because I&#x27;m unsure how the two would work together, but I do apply a scented lotion to my arms and</li>
            <li>so with all the water, my hands get chapped and dry very easily.  </li>
            <li>My tube does not last as long as one lucky lady reviewer, as I use a healthy dime-size dollop each night, but it does last a good 3 months.  </li>
            <li>A flip top would be an improvement, but this is a minor issue.</li>
            <li>First, it is VERY greasy.  </li>
            <li>Who wants to be the first to try it?</li>
            <li>It was the best five or so dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent because I finally have my hands back.</li>
            <li>use if you&#x27;re not experiencing rather dry skin, but it&#x27;s great for cracked and dry hands and feet, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I admit I haven&#x27;t tried many but working outside often with concrete</li>
            <li>It brings you hands back,  even from neglect very quickly.  </li>
            <li>A lot of hand lotions leave your hands feeling dry 5 minutes after you apply it, this stuff is more like a balm so it has staying power.</li>
            <li>Pure vitamin E oil also caused severe itching.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>I absolute</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>BzzAgent sent me Neutrogena&#x27;s Norwegian Hand Cream for free, to try, test and review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a product I treasure and plan to continue to use.</li>
            <li>I should note that I wish it were scented, because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m using very often.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t retract any stars for this, because it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>The feel of this product is very greasy and it leaves a residue.</li>
            <li>A dab is really all you need.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like how greasy it feels/is, but it&#x27;s working great on my poor skin.</li>
            <li>and my hands feel amazing, not greasy nor dry, and I find myself applying it maybe one more time, usually at bed.  </li>
            <li>This may sound insubstantial, but when your hands are greasy, it becomes near-impossible to try to screw the cap back on; most other hand creams that I have tried have a flip-top cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague.</li>
            <li>it works ok but stopped using it due to the two parabens it contains.</li>
            <li>I particularly appreciate that it comes in a fragrance-free formula and my hands feel much softer after use.</li>
            <li>Many years ago my dermatologist recommended that I keep my hands and nails soft using this product because letting one&#x27;s hands and nails dry out just aggravates the condition.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about five years since then, and now the eczema is starting to re-appear, luckily they haven&#x27;t really changed the formula aside from the packaging.</li>
            <li>I was first turned on to this stuff by a professional fishermen out in moro bay.  </li>
            <li>My hands were painfully dry during the winter, and ever since I started using this cream, they are smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>Regular lotions are super greasy, and I never wanted to touch anything after I put it on.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS</li>
            <li>Once it sets in hands are gentle, soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves</li>
            <li>I was able to open my hands without that dry, taut feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see how quickly the winter dryness had affect my hands -- and only my hands.</li>
            <li>It does not contain fragrance or petroleum, which both cause hundreds of new blisters the size of a pinpoint to appear overnight.  </li>
            <li>Applied correctly, it will leave your hands smooth and soft without feeling wet or greasy.</li>
            <li>I probably could skip the morning, because when I wake up my hands are still very soft, but I like the way it feels</li>
            <li>I know a lot of those other hand creams have various scents, but I&#x27;m very sensitive to most of those smells</li>
            <li>so make sure you use a small amount.  </li>
            <li>Works instantly and really makes your skin look healthier!</li>
            <li>It stays exactly where you put it and turns white as you rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is excellent in cold weather or when your hands have been in water too long.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers have said that the cream is too greasy or oily; this most likely means that their hands aren&#x27;t dry enough to warrant using this type of cream.</li>
            <li>and I decided to use a large enough amount to cover the affected area and fill the cracks in my palm.  </li>
            <li>Over time, I switched to fragrance free face washes and used CeraVe moisturizer, which did little to help the situation.</li>
            <li>Nearly all of the creams doctors tell you to use for excema I cannot use.  </li>
            <li>Within the first week of religious use, the skin was close to 80% back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Today my skin condition is truly and completely gone.  </li>
            <li>My hands feel soft and moisturized however too oily sometimes.</li>
            <li>Hands will feel very creamy for a period of ten minutes.</li>
            <li>My hands stay incredibly soft all day.</li>
            <li>I like my lotions to have a soft floral scent and this one has no scent.</li>
            <li>With highly sensitive skin that is prone to break out for any reason under the sun, this product continues to get an A+ from me and from those in my family that use the product as well.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my hands always feel so soft after using this.</li>
            <li>After a few days the cracks are fully healed and the skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I&#x27;ll have to continue my search for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>my hands would get pretty dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with dry hands, but my cuticles can become so dry that they start to flake and peel, so</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face, obviously, but anywhere you have itchy, cracked or super dry skin, go for it.</li>
            <li>but I believe it may have been sometime during Junior High when I developed a severe and chronic contact reaction on my left palm.  </li>
            <li>net wt.]]--this product is moisturizing, absorbs well, AND has a flip-top cap, so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly so that I don&#x27;t mess up the pages of the book that I am reading</li>
            <li>And what can I say, over night we saw a major difference!</li>
            <li>Nothing help, not to mention that some of them really burned his dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a moderate to severe fluctuating excema that weeps and oozes and forms visible blisters easily.  </li>
            <li>I started applying before bed and in the morning, and within a week, my hands were back to normal.  </li>
            <li>SUPER concentrated, a little greasy.</li>
            <li>Instead, an alternate product that I&#x27;ve tried recently and really like is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This creme is super heavy duty, but tends to disappear as it soaks in.  </li>
            <li>My hands and feet often have very dry skin and just one application of this moisturizer makes a visible difference and makes the skin feel much smoother.  </li>
            <li>This cream does not heal the excema but it does help the rough cracked skin to simply feel a little better.  </li>
            <li>I was always a hardcore science buff during my early teenage years.  </li>
            <li>For the two years I had eczema all on my arms, this was the only cream that managed to keep my skin remotely soft.</li>
            <li>I do this only before bed and the result is soft heels all night and day.</li>
            <li>True to its description, a small dab did indeed relieve my skin.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the smell (actually addicted to it..)</li>
            <li>However, it takes ages to absorb and I absolutely HATE the greasy feel, so I don&#x27;t really use it very often, which kind of defeats the purpose.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for dry chapped skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on thick and gel like, but it absorbs quickly and helps to soothe very irritated, cracked and dry hands.  </li>
            <li>This product did leave ,y hands feeling soft for a long while, however, it only makes your external skin feel soft</li>
            <li>However, several major downsides prevent me from using this product regularly.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who loves soft hands and/or has dry skin.oft hands</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it&#x27;s naturally soft condition.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, your skin might feel a little sticky after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well using it this way, and if I need to I can add a little extra and put on gloves.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy or smeary like most lotions, either.</li>
            <li> This cream is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their products on and off for a long time and am always happy to buy another one!</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream for me and my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress how perfect this product is for folks with dry</li>
            <li> What I like most about it is that it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I learned this is just the initial softness of your hands after applying this incredible cream.</li>
            <li> I like to keep it in my car and purse because it is compact and easy to take along.  </li>
            <li> The formula must have changed, or I am more intelligent and used it properly this time!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is more like an ointment than a cream, but it goes on creamy IF your skin is fresh from the shower or hand washing.</li>
            <li> This hand cream, however, is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free as I wanted, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to soften my hands as advertised.</li>
            <li> No stink, no sting, much smooth.</li>
            <li> It may feel better at first but</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous hand creams and lotions but this cream has been the best so far!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since told everyone about the Norwegian Formula because I honestly believe it is, hands down, the best hand cream on the market.</li>
            <li> Step right up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing just two days of applying this cream and my fingers are nearly healed.  </li>
            <li> I have switched now to VASELINE Healthy Hands and Nails during the day which soaks into your hands much faster.</li>
            <li> For the most part, they were much too oily to leave on during the day.  </li>
            <li> This Neutrogena stuff is absolutely perfect for me, and I&#x27;m sure many others with the same problem I had/have (I still get very dried out during winter even though I finished my medication a couple years ago</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema</li>
            <li> However even there I feel like you wash a lot off first thing in the morning, so I am not so sure how much really goes into your hands rather than stays on the surface.</li>
            <li> No stinging, and it starts to feel better pretty much immediately.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena lotion showed up at exactly the right time!</li>
            <li> This cream is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its nice to have one in my purse, and others in various places in the house.    </li>
            <li> item was pricey, but well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> I keep tubes at home and at work and think it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well step right up here</li>
            <li> in mind that this formula appears to work best for very dry to severely dry hands.</li>
            <li> I also like the variety of this size because it can fit easily anywhere, especially for travel.</li>
            <li> But the good Lord intended it to be for SALVATION in other ways!</li>
            <li> i saw results right after the first application.</li>
            <li> I was even more surprised to see how fast it worked.</li>
            <li> No offensive odor or really any scent that I can detect, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> It leaves them feeling silky velvet and absorbs very fast, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This is hands down THE best product for dry hands!</li>
            <li> I have found that hand creams are even more subjective than facial creams.</li>
            <li> I personally think hand creams are much more a factor of how often you use it rather than which product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember exactly when it happened</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference from the first application.  </li>
            <li> There was no irritation, and for the first time my lips truly felt hydrated.</li>
            <li> Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t apply another lotion over top of it, simply because I&#x27;m unsure how the two would work together, but I do apply a scented lotion to my arms and</li>
            <li> so with all the water, my hands get chapped and dry very easily.  </li>
            <li> My tube does not last as long as one lucky lady reviewer, as I use a healthy dime-size dollop each night, but it does last a good 3 months.  </li>
            <li> A flip top would be an improvement, but this is a minor issue.</li>
            <li> First, it is VERY greasy.  </li>
            <li> Who wants to be the first to try it?</li>
            <li> It was the best five or so dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent because I finally have my hands back.</li>
            <li> use if you&#x27;re not experiencing rather dry skin, but it&#x27;s great for cracked and dry hands and feet, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I admit I haven&#x27;t tried many but working outside often with concrete</li>
            <li> It brings you hands back,  even from neglect very quickly.  </li>
            <li> A lot of hand lotions leave your hands feeling dry 5 minutes after you apply it, this stuff is more like a balm so it has staying power.</li>
            <li> Pure vitamin E oil also caused severe itching.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.  </li>
            <li> I absolute</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> BzzAgent sent me Neutrogena&#x27;s Norwegian Hand Cream for free, to try, test and review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a product I treasure and plan to continue to use.</li>
            <li> I should note that I wish it were scented, because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m using very often.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t retract any stars for this, because it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> The feel of this product is very greasy and it leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> A dab is really all you need.  </li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how greasy it feels/is, but it&#x27;s working great on my poor skin.</li>
            <li> and my hands feel amazing, not greasy nor dry, and I find myself applying it maybe one more time, usually at bed.  </li>
            <li> This may sound insubstantial, but when your hands are greasy, it becomes near-impossible to try to screw the cap back on; most other hand creams that I have tried have a flip-top cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague.</li>
            <li> it works ok but stopped using it due to the two parabens it contains.</li>
            <li> I particularly appreciate that it comes in a fragrance-free formula and my hands feel much softer after use.</li>
            <li> Many years ago my dermatologist recommended that I keep my hands and nails soft using this product because letting one&#x27;s hands and nails dry out just aggravates the condition.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about five years since then, and now the eczema is starting to re-appear, luckily they haven&#x27;t really changed the formula aside from the packaging.</li>
            <li> I was first turned on to this stuff by a professional fishermen out in moro bay.  </li>
            <li> My hands were painfully dry during the winter, and ever since I started using this cream, they are smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> Regular lotions are super greasy, and I never wanted to touch anything after I put it on.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS</li>
            <li> Once it sets in hands are gentle, soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves</li>
            <li> I was able to open my hands without that dry, taut feeling.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how quickly the winter dryness had affect my hands -- and only my hands.</li>
            <li> It does not contain fragrance or petroleum, which both cause hundreds of new blisters the size of a pinpoint to appear overnight.  </li>
            <li> Applied correctly, it will leave your hands smooth and soft without feeling wet or greasy.</li>
            <li> I probably could skip the morning, because when I wake up my hands are still very soft, but I like the way it feels</li>
            <li> I know a lot of those other hand creams have various scents, but I&#x27;m very sensitive to most of those smells</li>
            <li> so make sure you use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Works instantly and really makes your skin look healthier!</li>
            <li> It stays exactly where you put it and turns white as you rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent in cold weather or when your hands have been in water too long.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have said that the cream is too greasy or oily; this most likely means that their hands aren&#x27;t dry enough to warrant using this type of cream.</li>
            <li> and I decided to use a large enough amount to cover the affected area and fill the cracks in my palm.  </li>
            <li> Over time, I switched to fragrance free face washes and used CeraVe moisturizer, which did little to help the situation.</li>
            <li> Nearly all of the creams doctors tell you to use for excema I cannot use.  </li>
            <li> Within the first week of religious use, the skin was close to 80% back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Today my skin condition is truly and completely gone.  </li>
            <li> My hands feel soft and moisturized however too oily sometimes.</li>
            <li> Hands will feel very creamy for a period of ten minutes.</li>
            <li> My hands stay incredibly soft all day.</li>
            <li> I like my lotions to have a soft floral scent and this one has no scent.</li>
            <li> With highly sensitive skin that is prone to break out for any reason under the sun, this product continues to get an A+ from me and from those in my family that use the product as well.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hands always feel so soft after using this.</li>
            <li> After a few days the cracks are fully healed and the skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ll have to continue my search for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> my hands would get pretty dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with dry hands, but my cuticles can become so dry that they start to flake and peel, so</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face, obviously, but anywhere you have itchy, cracked or super dry skin, go for it.</li>
            <li> but I believe it may have been sometime during Junior High when I developed a severe and chronic contact reaction on my left palm.  </li>
            <li> net wt.]]--this product is moisturizing, absorbs well, AND has a flip-top cap, so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly so that I don&#x27;t mess up the pages of the book that I am reading</li>
            <li> And what can I say, over night we saw a major difference!</li>
            <li> Nothing help, not to mention that some of them really burned his dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a moderate to severe fluctuating excema that weeps and oozes and forms visible blisters easily.  </li>
            <li> I started applying before bed and in the morning, and within a week, my hands were back to normal.  </li>
            <li> SUPER concentrated, a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Instead, an alternate product that I&#x27;ve tried recently and really like is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This creme is super heavy duty, but tends to disappear as it soaks in.  </li>
            <li> My hands and feet often have very dry skin and just one application of this moisturizer makes a visible difference and makes the skin feel much smoother.  </li>
            <li> This cream does not heal the excema but it does help the rough cracked skin to simply feel a little better.  </li>
            <li> I was always a hardcore science buff during my early teenage years.  </li>
            <li> For the two years I had eczema all on my arms, this was the only cream that managed to keep my skin remotely soft.</li>
            <li> I do this only before bed and the result is soft heels all night and day.</li>
            <li> True to its description, a small dab did indeed relieve my skin.  </li>
            <li> LOVE the smell (actually addicted to it..)</li>
            <li> However, it takes ages to absorb and I absolutely HATE the greasy feel, so I don&#x27;t really use it very often, which kind of defeats the purpose.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for dry chapped skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and gel like, but it absorbs quickly and helps to soothe very irritated, cracked and dry hands.  </li>
            <li> This product did leave ,y hands feeling soft for a long while, however, it only makes your external skin feel soft</li>
            <li> However, several major downsides prevent me from using this product regularly.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who loves soft hands and/or has dry skin.oft hands</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it&#x27;s naturally soft condition.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, your skin might feel a little sticky after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well using it this way, and if I need to I can add a little extra and put on gloves.</li>
            <li> so far i have tried multiple other brands and companies, but non of them reach close to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> The thick and greasy formula is obviously for when your skin needs emergency attention, and it took no more than two days for my skin to look and feel better.</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion a few years ago when I was taking some special anti-acne medication that dried my skin like cowhide.</li>
            <li> One tube lasts a long time because you use only a dab at a time.</li>
            <li> and it definitely soothes my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I finally found something that works too heal dry, chapped, bleeding fingers.</li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands and by the end of the day they are dry and sore from it.</li>
            <li> you have dry hands use it daily.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have no idea my skin was dry and flaky just last</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy this again if the dry skin returns.</li>
            <li> My hands are so dry that they crack and bleed, especially my knuckles.</li>
            <li> Throughout my entire life, during the winter months, my fingertips have peeled so severely that multiple layers of dead skin would fall off and expose a deep red layer of skin beneath.  </li>
            <li> but as I said I don&#x27;t believe the product matters as much as how often you use it and here the Neutrogena is hard because of its film residue.</li>
            <li> Another plus: it doesn&#x27;t smell strange like some fragrance-free lotions and creams do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I developed layers upon layers of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> i remember using this for as long as i can remember.</li>
            <li> Because only a drop is needed to get the optimal effect, the small bottle should last through winter and possibly beyond.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago for itchy dry winter hands</li>
            <li> My husband used to have really dry skin during the winter.</li>
            <li> It was so dry that it made him bleed.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested using this as a night time hand cream for my dry hands.</li>
            <li> and/or has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am 33 and I have a dry face condition.</li>
            <li> Neither kept my face from flaking and being dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working with money, paper and cardboard for years and years, and for years and years my hands have been incredibly dry, ashy, cracked...</li>
            <li> I get dry skin</li>
            <li> Just a few dollars will get you a tube of this magical salve that will succeed where others have failed.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very, very long</li>
            <li> You definitely need to rub it in well, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Suggestion: draw a short, thin line of product across the back of one hand and use one finger of the other hand to massage it in from wrist to fingertips; after the gel turns white and then disappears into your skin, repeat on the opposite hand; then rub your hands together to get any remaining gel onto the inside of your hands.</li>
            <li> but it is certainly better than the painful, chapped, dry, breaking damaged skin from before!    </li>
            <li> Winter was probably the most painful for me.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few, but after I tried this it&#x27;s been the only one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> After a few days only his skin felt like baby skin.  </li>
            <li> It is an extremely thick cream, and you really only need to use a tiny dab.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of annoying when it leaves your palms oily and eventually i wipe it on my shirt...</li>
            <li> so I can touch things without getting them all sloppy with lotion grease, but with this you don&#x27;t really have to worry.</li>
            <li> Like the description says, it only takes a small amount to keep your hands hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> I try to use my VASELINE after every other hand wash.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;You really only need a small dollop, then you rub the cream vigorously into both hands.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries.</li>
            <li> Usually, with other lotions I am having to constantly reapply.  </li>
            <li> It may be too heavy for some, but it has worked when nothing else did for my severe dry skin.</li>
            <li> Norwegian formula, as I mentioned, it quite thick.</li>
            <li> Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> For my money, at less than $5/tube, even at 3 months per tube</li>
            <li> I use about half the size of an eraser head</li>
            <li> It also doesnt fully absorb it&#x27;s a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Just use a little.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed, but bought it anyways.  </li>
            <li> This is unfortunate, as it generally limits my use of the product to before bed.  </li>
            <li> I looked like a clown for all of 6th grade (not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that!), and my lips still felt dry despite the ChapStick I applied religiously.</li>
            <li> He used a small amount one night.</li>
            <li> This small tube lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it like ordinary hand lotions/creams - it&#x27;s not like those products; it&#x27;s a one-of-a-kind product.</li>
            <li> Do you feel shame and embarrassment because you&#x27;re unable to sing your daily praise with leathery lips?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different hand creams over the years - from expensive luxury brands to discount ones.</li>
            <li> A small dab after drying washed hands will soften and replenish your hands.  </li>
            <li> Usually when I use lotions I have to use a rag or something on my palms</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy and it hardly has any scent at all.  </li>
            <li> And it seems hard to find.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I endured this condition well into my late 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I had used this years ago, and didn&#x27;t like it because it was too thick.</li>
            <li> A thick ointment.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking serious scales.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having some serious dryness issues, just get this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have found the Neutrogena not a good solution for me.</li>
            <li> In any event, the skin on my palm started to chap and dry so badly</li>
            <li> It leaves a residual film on the hands which makes it tough to work or even greet customers with a handshake.</li>
            <li> I deal with dry skin year round, but when the temperature drops it&#x27;s simply awful.</li>
            <li> When the weather turned cold, and the heat went on, my hands would start getting very dry and my fingertips would crack - very irritating and sometimes painful.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll show you an honest-to-God MIRACLE.</li>
            <li> When I woke up, the redness of my face had lessened and the flaking had dramatically decreased!</li>
            <li> The slightest movement would trigger bloody fissures stretching from the base of my finger to the middle of my palm.  </li>

            <li> I have a moderate to severe fluctuating excema that weeps and oozes and forms visible blisters easily.  It is a dishydrotic hand excema.  This is one of the only creams I can tolerate that does not cause the excema to flare up.  It does not contain fragrance or petroleum, which both cause hundreds of new blisters the size of a pinpoint to appear overnight.  Nearly all of the creams doctors tell you to use for excema I cannot use.  It may feel better at first but in an hour I am tearing the skin off my fingers and bleeding all over the place.  I also think it is helpful that this does not contain lanolin or vitamin E.  Pure vitamin E oil also caused severe itching.  This cream does not heal the excema but it does help the rough cracked skin to simply feel a little better.  I wear it with cotton gloves, too.  I also use cocoa butter occasionally but like this best.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is absolutely amazing. Like the description says, it only takes a small amount to keep your hands hydrated all day. It soaks in enough that it even lasts after a hand-washing or two. I would post a before and after video but I applied some this afternoon, have washed my hands AND used hand sanitizer since then and my hands look great! This morning I had alligator skin. We&#x27;re talking serious scales. Another plus: it doesn&#x27;t smell strange like some fragrance-free lotions and creams do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this formula appears to work best for very dry to severely dry hands. Some reviewers have said that the cream is too greasy or oily; this most likely means that their hands aren&#x27;t dry enough to warrant using this type of cream.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand cream.  It can be used anytime but is especially helpful to me because it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my obsession with reading just before sleeping.  It absorbs quickly so that I don&#x27;t mess up the pages of the book that I am reading and it definitely soothes my dry skin.  I particularly appreciate that it comes in a fragrance-free formula and my hands feel much softer after use.</li>
            <li> I have found that hand creams are even more subjective than facial creams. I wash my hands a lot during the day. I have found the Neutrogena not a good solution for me. It leaves a residual film on the hands which makes it tough to work or even greet customers with a handshake. I have switched now to VASELINE Healthy Hands and Nails during the day which soaks into your hands much faster. I personally think hand creams are much more a factor of how often you use it rather than which product. I try to use my VASELINE after every other hand wash. The Neutrogen is good for the night before going to bed. However even there I feel like you wash a lot off first thing in the morning, so I am not so sure how much really goes into your hands rather than stays on the surface. &lt;br /&gt;My next try will be the AVEENO hand cream but as I said I don&#x27;t believe the product matters as much as how often you use it and here the Neutrogena is hard because of its film residue.</li>
            <li> I was always a hardcore science buff during my early teenage years.  I can&#x27;t remember exactly when it happened but I believe it may have been sometime during Junior High when I developed a severe and chronic contact reaction on my left palm.  Perhaps it was a chemical that I accidentally touched?  In any event, the skin on my palm started to chap and dry so badly it would crack every time I opened my hand.  I developed layers upon layers of dead skin.  Winter was probably the most painful for me.  The slightest movement would trigger bloody fissures stretching from the base of my finger to the middle of my palm.  The ointments and creams and vasoline I used only offered temporary relief.  For the most part, they were much too oily to leave on during the day.  I endured this condition well into my late 20&#x27;s.  One day, while I was browsing through the shelves of my pharmacy, I discovered Neutrogena Hand Cream and decided to give it whirl.  I could feel the difference from the first application.  True to its description, a small dab did indeed relieve my skin.  However, my condition was way too severe for a simple dab and I decided to use a large enough amount to cover the affected area and fill the cracks in my palm.  After just one night, the suppleness miraculously returned to the afflicted area.  I was able to open my hands without that dry, taut feeling.  Cracks no longer bled or appeared.  Within the first week of religious use, the skin was close to 80% back to normal.  Today my skin condition is truly and completely gone.  I owe a debt of gratitude to the folks at Neutrogena for restoring usefulness to my hand.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago for itchy dry winter hands it works ok but stopped using it due to the two parabens it contains. I won&#x27;t use it again until the parabens are removed. It also doesnt fully absorb it&#x27;s a little greasy.</li>
            <li> It really does work.  My hands and feet often have very dry skin and just one application of this moisturizer makes a visible difference and makes the skin feel much smoother.  However, it takes ages to absorb and I absolutely HATE the greasy feel, so I don&#x27;t really use it very often, which kind of defeats the purpose.  Sadly, I&#x27;ll have to continue my search for a good moisturizer. If you can stand it, go for it.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I have ever used. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist, and I have never looked back. My hands were painfully dry during the winter, and ever since I started using this cream, they are smooth as silk. This cream is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all lip balms on the market, and they would leave me with red, swollen, irritated lips. I looked like a clown for all of 6th grade (not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that!), and my lips still felt dry despite the ChapStick I applied religiously. I tried Epilyt to no effect. Finally, I tried this product on my lips. There was no irritation, and for the first time my lips truly felt hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for about 6 years now, since discovering it while looking for something to help with my &#x27;winter hands&#x27;.  When the weather turned cold, and the heat went on, my hands would start getting very dry and my fingertips would crack - very irritating and sometimes painful.  I started applying before bed and in the morning, and within a week, my hands were back to normal.  I&#x27;ve used it nightly ever since, and have never had any problem with dryness in the last 6 years.    My tube does not last as long as one lucky lady reviewer, as I use a healthy dime-size dollop each night, but it does last a good 3 months.  For my money, at less than $5/tube, even at 3 months per tube it&#x27;s a great deal for nice hands!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers.  It goes on thick and gel like, but it absorbs quickly and helps to soothe very irritated, cracked and dry hands.  I like to keep it in my car and purse because it is compact and easy to take along.  A flip top would be an improvement, but this is a minor issue.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I am a teacher and my hands are constantly coming in contact with papers, etc.  I have tried numerous hand creams and lotions but this cream has been the best so far!  It&#x27;s not too greasy and it hardly has any scent at all.  The back of the box says the bottle has over 200 applications in it so make sure you use a small amount.  I use about half the size of an eraser head and my hands feel amazing, not greasy nor dry, and I find myself applying it maybe one more time, usually at bed.  I would encourage you to give it a try for a couple of weeks and see how you like it.  It can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis under my nails.  Many years ago my dermatologist recommended that I keep my hands and nails soft using this product because letting one&#x27;s hands and nails dry out just aggravates the condition.  I have used it for 20 years or more and my nails are in much, much better shape!  It&#x27;s great stuff, and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.</li>
            <li> this is the best cream for chapped skin. It works on overworked hands and feet. And it seems hard to find.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing it recommended in [[ASIN:B002PXW1IE Real Simple (1-year auto-renewal)]].  I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with dry hands, but my cuticles can become so dry that they start to flake and peel, so I try to remember to moisturize my hands for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does perform as advertised.  It is an extremely thick cream, and you really only need to use a tiny dab.  The cream is quite emollient, and I believe that most people will see dryness relief from use of this product.  However, several major downsides prevent me from using this product regularly.  First, it is VERY greasy.  I have found that it does NOT absorb into my skin, so after using it, I can&#x27;t touch anything with my hands!  This is unfortunate, as it generally limits my use of the product to before bed.  The second concern is somewhat related--I absolute HATE the screw cap!  This may sound insubstantial, but when your hands are greasy, it becomes near-impossible to try to screw the cap back on; most other hand creams that I have tried have a flip-top cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the above concerns, I will not be re-purchasing this product.  Instead, an alternate product that I&#x27;ve tried recently and really like is [[ASIN:B000TKK78G Mary Kay Satin Hands Hand Cream,3 oz. net wt.]]--this product is moisturizing, absorbs well, AND has a flip-top cap, so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I admit I haven&#x27;t tried many but working outside often with concrete my hands would get pretty dry and cracked.  I tried a few, but after I tried this it&#x27;s been the only one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My husband used to have really dry skin during the winter. It was so dry that it made him bleed. We tried so many hand creams. Nothing help, not to mention that some of them really burned his dry sensitive skin.  So we tried out this product. It was like a miracle. He used a small amount one night. I think I even bought him cotton gloves that he didn&#x27;t want to use, but agreed to wear them for one night. And what can I say, over night we saw a major difference! After a few days only his skin felt like baby skin.  It&#x27;s a great product. We keep using it every winter. This small tube lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This is hands down THE best product for dry hands! As it says on the front of the tube, \\&quot;just a dab\\&quot; rubbed into the back of each hand and, poof, scales, cracks, dryness, and pain are GONE. The effects last for several washings. It&#x27;s amazing. One tube lasts a long time because you use only a dab at a time. Don&#x27;t over-apply! Suggestion: draw a short, thin line of product across the back of one hand and use one finger of the other hand to massage it in from wrist to fingertips; after the gel turns white and then disappears into your skin, repeat on the opposite hand; then rub your hands together to get any remaining gel onto the inside of your hands. Apply sparingly. Don&#x27;t use it like ordinary hand lotions/creams - it&#x27;s not like those products; it&#x27;s a one-of-a-kind product. Applied correctly, it will leave your hands smooth and soft without feeling wet or greasy. It&#x27;s fragrance-free, so there&#x27;s no obnoxious perfume smell. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I had used this years ago, and didn&#x27;t like it because it was too thick. The formula must have changed, or I am more intelligent and used it properly this time! Yes, it is more like an ointment than a cream, but it goes on creamy IF your skin is fresh from the shower or hand washing. Just use a little. Do not glop it on. My dermatologist suggested using this as a night time hand cream for my dry hands. It works really well using it this way, and if I need to I can add a little extra and put on gloves.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I finally found something that works too heal dry, chapped, bleeding fingers. For years my fingers have been giving me problems. A friend of mine recommended this product and I&#x27;m so glad she did. It&#x27;s amazing just two days of applying this cream and my fingers are nearly healed.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHOSE HANDS CRACK AND BLEED! YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I know it&#x27;s hand cream. But the good Lord intended it to be for SALVATION in other ways! My friends, do your lips feel like the work of the DEVIL HIMSELF? Do you feel shame and embarrassment because you&#x27;re unable to sing your daily praise with leathery lips? Well step right up here and I&#x27;ll show you an honest-to-God MIRACLE. Just a few dollars will get you a tube of this magical salve that will succeed where others have failed. The tube that will HEAL your lips like Jesus on the Sabbath. Just apply it to your lips before your nightly prayers. In minutes, you&#x27;ll feel the power and warmth in your lips. Leave it on overnight, and in the morning you&#x27;ll never know you had a problem the day before. Yes, my friends, I&#x27;m here to tell you to BELIEVE! Be sure to get the Unscented for your lips because the scented tastes like a heathen&#x27;s taint and is better designed to cast evils out of your skin elsewhere. Who wants to be the first to try it? Step right up!</li>
            <li> The best. Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> As someone who used to have severe eczema resulting from a staph infection, this stuff saved my life. For the two years I had eczema all on my arms, this was the only cream that managed to keep my skin remotely soft. It&#x27;s been about five years since then, and now the eczema is starting to re-appear, luckily they haven&#x27;t really changed the formula aside from the packaging. Works wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different hand creams over the years - from expensive luxury brands to discount ones. This is the best hand cream for me and my dry hands. It leaves them feeling silky velvet and absorbs very fast, not greasy at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years now and I still love it. Can warmly recommend.</li>
            <li> This cream is pretty good. My hands feel soft and moisturized however too oily sometimes. I would probably recommend it just because of the price.</li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands and by the end of the day they are dry and sore from it. Regular lotions are super greasy, and I never wanted to touch anything after I put it on. This hand cream, however, is fantastic. It&#x27;s not greasy, it soothes my hands, and works great!</li>
            <li> Just like all Neutrogena Products... it&#x27;s great!    What I like most about it is that it&#x27;s fragrance free. I know a lot of those other hand creams have various scents, but I&#x27;m very sensitive to most of those smells and I can&#x27;t put them on. I&#x27;m so happy that there is a fragrance free one that&#x27;s good!    I also like the variety of this size because it can fit easily anywhere, especially for travel. I&#x27;ve used their products on and off for a long time and am always happy to buy another one! Its nice to have one in my purse, and others in various places in the house.    I constantly wash my hands all the time... so with all the water, my hands get chapped and dry very easily.  Highly recommended for dry chapped skin. I hate it when my hands feel like sandpaper, now they don&#x27;t have to!    It seems like a thicker cream than many others, but I think that&#x27;s because its also meant to protect, so its good that it does what it&#x27;s designed to do! I know some people don&#x27;t like that but it is certainly better than the painful, chapped, dry, breaking damaged skin from before!    Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> I works. Really. On hand AND FOOD AND EVERYWEHRE!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s kind of annoying when it leaves your palms oily and eventually i wipe it on my shirt... but it works so good i cannot resist putting it on</li>
            <li> I have ultra-dry skin in the colder months. I deal with dry skin year round, but when the temperature drops it&#x27;s simply awful. My skin flakes, dries, itches and everything else that&#x27;s awful about having dry skin. BzzAgent sent me Neutrogena&#x27;s Norwegian Hand Cream for free, to try, test and review. I&#x27;m so thankful for this product.&lt;br /&gt;You really only need a small dollop, then you rub the cream vigorously into both hands. Hands will feel very creamy for a period of ten minutes. This isn&#x27;t a transferable creaminess or film. I learned this is just the initial softness of your hands after applying this incredible cream. Once it sets in hands are gentle, soft and hydrated. I can&#x27;t stress how perfect this product is for folks with dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;I keep the Norwegian Hand Cream on my bedside table and use it twice - once in the morning and once in the evening before bed. My hands stay incredibly soft all day. I probably could skip the morning, because when I wake up my hands are still very soft, but I like the way it feels so I apply it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I also apply this cream to the heels of my feet, another area that dries in the cold months. I do this only before bed and the result is soft heels all night and day. It&#x27;s really a product I treasure and plan to continue to use. I should note that I wish it were scented, because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m using very often. I like my lotions to have a soft floral scent and this one has no scent. I didn&#x27;t retract any stars for this, because it doesn&#x27;t really matter. I wouldn&#x27;t apply another lotion over top of it, simply because I&#x27;m unsure how the two would work together, but I do apply a scented lotion to my arms and that works.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you&#x27;re going to love how great your hands feel when you apply this hand cream. It&#x27;s perfect for softening cuticles for manicures. Because only a drop is needed to get the optimal effect, the small bottle should last through winter and possibly beyond. I recommend this product to anyone who loves soft hands and/or has dry skin.oft hands and/or has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am 33 and I have a dry face condition. Don&#x27;t know what it is, though. Have been to dermatologists and been given protopic, elidel, and who knows what else. Neither kept my face from flaking and being dry. Over time, I switched to fragrance free face washes and used CeraVe moisturizer, which did little to help the situation. I had skin allergy patch and prick tests, but no oral medication or allergy shots helped. I had a tube of Norwegian hand cream sitting around and decided to try it one night. When I woke up, the redness of my face had lessened and the flaking had dramatically decreased! I don&#x27;t go a day without using this on my face. It may be too heavy for some, but it has worked when nothing else did for my severe dry skin.</li>
            <li> The feel of this product is very greasy and it leaves a residue. It&#x27;s not a cream, but more like an ointment. A thick ointment. It is fragrance free as I wanted, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to soften my hands as advertised. I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> **Updated review--I&#x27;ve continued to use this product daily and found that it also works on razor burn. I found the product to be incredibly soothing on any surface used to shave (legs, face, etc), and of course the product absorbs immediately. With highly sensitive skin that is prone to break out for any reason under the sun, this product continues to get an A+ from me and from those in my family that use the product as well.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was pricey, but well worth every penny. First of all, this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very, very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it&#x27;s naturally soft condition. I found that it is best used at nighttime. I&#x27;ve tried using it with nighttime gloves, and that works well too. I just prefer to rub it on my hands and go to bed. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves so you don&#x27;t chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries. I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this takes longer to absorb, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this as a daily lotion you might leave by the soap dish by the bathroom next to the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily, and because it&#x27;s so concentrated, that&#x27;s all I need to maintain smoother skin. It&#x27;s no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague. For every diaper change, sneeze, runny nose and shared food, I am washing my hands A LOT! This product works as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works wonders on cracked elbows, heels and is soothing for skin conditions like Eczema.</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent in cold weather or when your hands have been in water too long. It protects them and &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; the redness and soreness.</li>
            <li> This product did leave ,y hands feeling soft for a long while, however, it only makes your external skin feel soft (slippery?) but I don&#x27;t think it helps softens calluses or gets rid of them.</li>
            <li> I was first turned on to this stuff by a professional fishermen out in moro bay.  He swore by the stuff and I have been hooked ever since.  It brings you hands back,  even from neglect very quickly.  It&#x27;s a dream!</li>
            <li> Great handcream!!&lt;br /&gt;Works very good and leaves your hands feeling smooth not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry hands use it daily.</li>
            <li> Amazing - and I&#x27;ve tried thm all!</li>
            <li> i remember using this for as long as i can remember. so far i have tried multiple other brands and companies, but non of them reach close to Neutrogena. LOVE the smell (actually addicted to it..) and my hands always feel so soft after using this. If you&#x27;ve never used this and ur looking for a god hand cream, dont look any further, u just found the best out there :)</li>
            <li> This creme is super heavy duty, but tends to disappear as it soaks in.  Great for hands and feet. Being in Arizona, I am always having to apply some kind of creme to my heels and hands to combat dryness. I&#x27;ve run through about a dozen, high-end and low-end, but nothing works quite like the Norwegian Formula. Must be all the glycerin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face, obviously, but anywhere you have itchy, cracked or super dry skin, go for it.</li>
            <li> While traveling in Europe during the winter, my hands became like sandpaper.  While in Switzerland, I could no longer take it.  I went to the pharmacy and the only lotion they carried was this lotion.  I was super disappointed, but bought it anyways.  Little did I know that this lotion was a miracle worker.  I assumed I could only get this in Europe, but was ecstatic when I found this state side.  I carry this wherever I go.  I have mild eczema and I only use this and Cerave (for face).  A dab is really all you need.  Usually, with other lotions I am having to constantly reapply.  Whenever friends need to use some, I always preface it with telling them that they are about to try the best lotion out there.</li>
            <li> Works instantly and really makes your skin look healthier! i saw results right after the first application. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how quickly the winter dryness had affect my hands -- and only my hands. The Neutrogena lotion showed up at exactly the right time! I was even more surprised to see how fast it worked. The thick and greasy formula is obviously for when your skin needs emergency attention, and it took no more than two days for my skin to look and feel better. You&#x27;d have no idea my skin was dry and flaky just last week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norwegian formula, as I mentioned, it quite thick. It looks like a translucent gel in the bottle. It stays exactly where you put it and turns white as you rub it into your skin. You definitely need to rub it in well, and a little goes a long way. If you use too much, your skin might feel a little sticky after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for every day use if you&#x27;re not experiencing rather dry skin, but it&#x27;s great for cracked and dry hands and feet, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy this again if the dry skin returns.</li>
            <li> If you work with your hands, then you should carry this around with you at all times.  A small dab after drying washed hands will soften and replenish your hands.  In the winter, I also use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Throughout my entire life, during the winter months, my fingertips have peeled so severely that multiple layers of dead skin would fall off and expose a deep red layer of skin beneath.  It was painful.  I endured this every winter.  I tried a variety of moisturizers, but none of them worked.  I even saw a dermatoligst.  I thought it was incurable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently discovered Neutrogena Norweigan Formula and I am cured.  Just a dab once or twice a day has caused all of the skin on each of my fingertips to grow back, and I am no longer in pain.  I hope this product exists for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working with money, paper and cardboard for years and years, and for years and years my hands have been incredibly dry, ashy, cracked...sometimes they&#x27;d even bleed. I have tried every lotion in the book - every lotion that promised a cure after just a couple uses. Every time I was disappointed. Money down the drain. My husband worked with a girl at an ad agency and she swore by this stuff. My husband suggested it and without any thought, I got on Amazon and immediately ordered it. It was the best five or so dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent because I finally have my hands back. I&#x27;m not at all exaggerating. In fact, I haven&#x27;t had to go get a manicure in months because this lotion has also cured my cuticles from splitting, cracking, bleeding, you name it. I&#x27;ve since told everyone about the Norwegian Formula because I honestly believe it is, hands down, the best hand cream on the market. I will never, never, never go back to using anything else. That&#x27;s a promise.</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion a few years ago when I was taking some special anti-acne medication that dried my skin like cowhide. When winter hit the effects of the medication were twice as bad. My lips started cracking and bleeding, as were my hands. Regular lotion actually made it worse by stinging the jesus out of my hands and doing nothing to sooth or smooth them. This Neutrogena stuff is absolutely perfect for me, and I&#x27;m sure many others with the same problem I had/have (I still get very dried out during winter even though I finished my medication a couple years ago, I guess it&#x27;s permanent?). No fragrance is great because I hate the smell of lotions. This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy or smeary like most lotions, either. Usually when I use lotions I have to use a rag or something on my palms so I can touch things without getting them all sloppy with lotion grease, but with this you don&#x27;t really have to worry. And the healing effects are amazing. No stinging, and it starts to feel better pretty much immediately. After a few days the cracks are fully healed and the skin is smooth. No stink, no sting, much smooth. It&#x27;s a miracle. I&#x27;m writing this review because I&#x27;m just that grateful to Neutrogena for making this wonderful product. If you&#x27;re having some serious dryness issues, just get this stuff. It works.</li>
            <li> I use this concentrated cream on my hands at night before bed (it can a tad bit greasy, but what do you expect) because it LASTS. A lot of hand lotions leave your hands feeling dry 5 minutes after you apply it, this stuff is more like a balm so it has staying power. During the day I use Weleda Skin Food because it moisturizes incredibly well but isn&#x27;t as concentrated as Neutrogena, so it absorbs quickly and I can go about my day without slimy lotion hands (save that for bed-time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr- SUPER concentrated, a little greasy.</li>
            <li> This has become the only hand cream I will use. No offensive odor or really any scent that I can detect, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy. I use this anywhere I get dry skin and it heals in some cases after just one application. I keep tubes at home and at work and think it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My hands are so dry that they crack and bleed, especially my knuckles. I didn&#x27;t like how greasy it feels/is, but it&#x27;s working great on my poor skin. I recommend this product for anyone with very dry skin.</li>
