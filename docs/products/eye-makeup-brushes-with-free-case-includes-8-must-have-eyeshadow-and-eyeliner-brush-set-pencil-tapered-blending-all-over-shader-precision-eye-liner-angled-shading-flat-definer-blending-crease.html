            <li>Was interested in trying brushes from this brand ever since Samantha from youtube always talks about them.</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying gel eyeliner and the brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush, not as stiff or dense as I would like</li>
            <li>I love this brush, very thin and good quality.</li>
            <li>I have seen some that aren&#x27;t so great, that don&#x27;t apply evenly, and are just downright frustrating.</li>
            <li>price is reasonable and they have a money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those are my trusted one, but I cant still seem to have much control when I use those brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The angled eyeliner brush is straight and thin, very nicely constructed.</li>
            <li>It does the job perfectly which most brushes have a hard time with this kind of product , I have used a really expensive brush before to achieve what I&#x27;m looking for and just end up a mess but not with using this brush .I</li>

            <li>Next time I need a new brush, I know who I am going to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing that really annoys me about other make-up brushes is when they shed hairs.</li>
            <li>has a great angle Not to thin or thick.</li>
            <li>Can make a thin line easily.</li>

            <li> has a great angle Not to thin or thick.</li>
            <li> Can make a thin line easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using their flat kabuki brush for several months...</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, yet just the right density to pick up and distribute product evenly, and doesn&#x27;t splay when you push down hard on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick and stiff but not overly stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristles stay in line even when a bit of pressure is applied, making it a snap to get a straight thick line.</li>
            <li> bristles on my last brush were starting to get too loose and bent in unpredictable ways.</li>
            <li> the Precision Eye Liner brush, complete 100% dupe (if not better) than the Sigma E65 eyeliner brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush did not lose one single bristle!</li>
            <li> The handle is shorter than I expected</li>
            <li> This brush has a small, tight brush head packed with soft bristles!</li>
            <li> The handle is just long enough for me to get some serious control, without being so long that it&#x27;s unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a gel eyeliner that came with a small brush.  </li>
            <li> The narrow angled bristle head is designed for applying a tight line to the upper and lower eyelash lines using liquid, gel, cream or powders.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my newly purchased Laura Mercier secret camoflage concealer (having seen this tip from Lisa Eldridge online).</li>
            <li> and I would never attempt it with anything other than THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li> Synthetic bristles use less product to achieve the desired look.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a brush that can apply eyeliner ,the pro precision gel eyeliner makeup brush with thin angled bristles for controlled lash liner application.</li>
            <li> was so difficult to use, so</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the pro Precision Gel Eye Liner Makeup Brush, and the thin angled bristle changed EVERYTHING!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been playing with gel eyeliner for a while and was unhappy with the brush in my case.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> , I have tried some very expensive brushes and they don&#x27;t compare .I</li>
            <li> brush!&lt;br /&gt;nothing bad to say about this one.</li>

            <li> Good quality brush for eyeliner &amp; brows</li>
            <li> Huge FAN of Beauty Junkees brushes.  I have been using their flat kabuki brush for several months...perfection for applying liquid foundation.  Now I have the Precision Eye Liner brush, complete 100% dupe (if not better) than the Sigma E65 eyeliner brush.  Perfectly made, feels and performs like a true quality brush.  Precision is a must for gel eyeliner application and I would never attempt it with anything other than THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li> Like most of BeautyJunkee other brushes, the bristles on this flat eyeliner brush are very soft.  I used the gel liner and the application went on smoothly with a thin line.  I am very pleased with this brush and will continue to use it to apply my gel liner because it is very easy to use and it serves its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love BeautyJunkee brushes.

One of the best eyeliner brushes I have purchased and I have purchased quite a few! I received this product at a discounted (not free) rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review, and I love it!

            <li> Good quality brush :)</li>
            <li> By far the best brush,! I received my brush the day after ordering and was so happy with the quality of it. It&#x27;s nice and thick and stiff but not overly stiff. It works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a brush that can apply eyeliner ,the pro precision gel eyeliner makeup brush with thin angled bristles for controlled lash liner application.The narrow angled bristle head is designed for applying a tight line to the upper and lower eyelash lines using liquid, gel, cream or powders. Use small strokes to create a perfect line.Start at the inner corner of the lash line with your eye open, then close your eye and continue along the rest of the lash line. For best color deposit create by using many short strokes instead of one long stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I positively love this brush it truly does the job , I have tried some very expensive brushes and they don&#x27;t compare .I use mine all the time.It does the job perfectly which most brushes have a hard time with this kind of product , I have used a really expensive brush before to achieve what I&#x27;m looking for and just end up a mess but not with using this brush .I highly recommend this product for all your makeup needs .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to great makeup brushes are the bristles. These brushes are made from high quality synthetic bristles that won&#x27;t leave fur on your face. The bristles are soft, yet just the right density to pick up and distribute product evenly, and doesn&#x27;t splay when you push down hard on it. You will love how soft the bristles are even perfect for the most sensitive skin, and cleaning is so easy . Synthetic bristles use less product to achieve the desired look. The dense bristle head works exceptionally for any kind of eyeliner product .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this fantastic brush ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Such great quality! Love.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for putting my gel eyeliner on, it glides on smoothly and without trouble.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of make-up brushes. I love make-up and want the best tools for the job. Beauty Junkies eyeliner brush is great. It is just the right amount of soft not to hurt the eye when lining it and just the right amount of hard to make a clean line. The angle is perfect for my eye-lining use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that really annoys me about other make-up brushes is when they shed hairs. I took my new brush, and I bent the hairs back and forth and even pulled on them. This brush did not lose one single bristle! Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable and they have a money-back guarantee. Next time I need a new brush, I know who I am going to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> All I can say is,this is very nice eyeliner brush I&#x27;ve ever had..It does makes my eyeliner perfect and look great!..super quick shipping and they also put card with it to let me know that I have a discount next time I order any of their products..5 stars deserve for this!</li>
            <li> Works great with my browdip. Soft.</li>
            <li> Super nice!! Love it!the bristle is just perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my newly purchased Laura Mercier secret camoflage concealer (having seen this tip from Lisa Eldridge online). This eye brush works great as a concealer brush: well made and precise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been playing with gel eyeliner for a while and was unhappy with the brush in my case. This eyeliner brush from Beauty Junkees has been a great, easy-to-work-with replacement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on my last brush were starting to get too loose and bent in unpredictable ways. This brush has a small, tight brush head packed with soft bristles! The bristles stay in line even when a bit of pressure is applied, making it a snap to get a straight thick line. The handle is just long enough for me to get some serious control, without being so long that it&#x27;s unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love getting new makeup brushes and I&#x27;m so excited to have this brush from Beauty Junkees in my case! I did receive this brush at a discount but price doesn&#x27;t change how great my eyeliner looks after using it, nor does it effect my review.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this precision gel eye liner brush from beauty junkees.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard so many raves about their brushes, that made me want to get one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a brush from ELF, makeup forever, and Sigma for my eyeliner and brows.&lt;br /&gt;Those are my trusted one, but I cant still seem to have much control when I use those brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This particular brush is as good as my sigma one, it grabs a good amount of product and it slides smoothly in my eye.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are dense and a bit sturdy, perfect to draw a line.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I use this brush, I feel like my cat eye is always on point.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is very very easy, I use some liquid soap and all the makeup goes away.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this for my brows to apply with brow gel and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!! I used a promo code to purchase this for testing.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I&#x27;ve been looking for one and I finally found the perfect one! It&#x27;s A very high quality brush! Very easy to use and gentle on the skin! I applied gel eyeliner and it glided on so beautifully and effortlessly on and I&#x27;m not a pro! I highly recommend this product! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased two brushes! I would definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Good brush. It works great with my gel liner, and washes nicely.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner brush I had. Can make a thin line easily. has a great angle Not to thin or thick. Don&#x27;t know how I used anything else!!</li>
            <li> this is the second product from beautyjunkies and i am loving it! great quality and bristle doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. love it</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a gel eyeliner that came with a small brush.  It was my first time trying gel eyeliner and the brush it came with was so difficult to use, so I decided to buy the pro Precision Gel Eye Liner Makeup Brush, and the thin angled bristle changed EVERYTHING!  It made gel eyeliner so easy to apply, and every time I apply it turns out evenly.  I would definitely recommend this product-- especially to beginners with gel liner!</li>
            <li> excellent I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, very thin and good quality. My eye makeup is perfect with it. I would buy more products of Pro Presicion.</li>
            <li> Very good quality of brush for the price. Bristles are soft, no fall-out. The angled eyeliner brush is straight and thin, very nicely constructed. The handle is shorter than I expected but I find that this gives more control when applying product. One of the best brands on Amazon for an affordable price!</li>
