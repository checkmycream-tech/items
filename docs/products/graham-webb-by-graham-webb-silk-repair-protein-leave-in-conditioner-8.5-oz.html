            <li> It soaks into the hair without leaving it flat or greasy.</li>
            <li> It is  not exactly the one I wanted and have had experience with  -  that has to do with ordering on the net.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair the silky feel, and it takes the freez out not completely, but partially.  </li>
            <li> I have used Graham Webb for years and was sad to find this particular line was discontinued at the professional stores.</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to comb out after shampooing, doesn&#x27;t lay flat on my head (as other products have done), and stays protected from absorbing that nasty salt spray from the ocean breezes.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount (depending on length), I use about the size of a nickel and my hair is shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> The cost of this product was expensive due to Graham Webb discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was told it was discontinued and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> .. hate that it is soo expensive..</li>
            <li> I am soooo disappointed that they discontinued it!  </li>

            <li> I had started using this product about 8 years ago and started noticing a real change in the look and feel of my hair.  I used it 1-2 times per week and my hair never felt or looked healthier.  A few years ago I was told it was discontinued and was very disappointed.  I made the little I had left last as long as I  possibly could and was delighted to find it on Amazon.  I had never been able to find anything remotely comparable.</li>
            <li> I was having some hair breakage issues.  This product helped moisturize and stop the breakage.  It soaks into the hair without leaving it flat or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used Graham Webb for years and was sad to find this particular line was discontinued at the professional stores. It was difficult to locate but this leave in conditioner is my absolute favorite and the treatment conditioner that is used occasionally is wonderful too. Wish they would bring this back.</li>
            <li> Love it, just to expensive</li>
            <li> really like the conditioner but it is far too expensive for me to be purchasing any more.  should lowernthe cost and you would sell more</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous leave-in conditioners over the years. This is the best one I have found and has a wonderful fragrence.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years</li>
            <li> I used this product many years ago and loved it. It was discontinued in Canada. I was thrilled to see that I could order it through amazon.  Unfortunately, this product did not meet my expectations. Either the formula changed or the texture of my hair changed. Anyway, I will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> It is  not exactly the one I wanted and have had experience with  -  that has to do with ordering on the net.  But it is  ok.  Thx.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner works so much better than a wash-out conditioner on my hair.  I was pleased to find it on the internet as my beautician can no longer get it for me.</li>
            <li> I use this product after i wash my hair.  It helps make it so manageable.  Better than any other mouse or conditioner that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used.  It controls the frizz and flyaway hair.  It makes my hair look and feel healthy.  It works best if you blow dry your hair because it is activated by heat.  My hair feels soft and silky.  I would never use any thing else since trying this product. You only need a small amount (depending on length), I use about the size of a nickel and my hair is shoulder length.  It smells nice and doesnt weigh down your hair.  My hair moves when I move my head, its very bouncy.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find this product for almost a year and kept trying to find something that didn&#x27;t weigh my fine silky hair down.  I also needed something to protect my hair from the salt, sun, and wind while walking on the Florida beaches.  A friend recommended that I look on Amazon.  Boy was I happy to find it again!  My hair is easy to comb out after shampooing, doesn&#x27;t lay flat on my head (as other products have done), and stays protected from absorbing that nasty salt spray from the ocean breezes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily to keep my hair moist; sometime I use it two or three times a day if I swim or go to the gym.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - works good.  The cost of this product was expensive due to Graham Webb discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. And the smell is amazing too :)</li>
