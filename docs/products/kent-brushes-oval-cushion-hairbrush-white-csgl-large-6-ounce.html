    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I bought this brush because of the excellent reviews and its popularity in Europe.</li>
            <li>An excellent investment piece.</li>
            <li>She loves it and said the quality of the brush is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Order arrived on time and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>Bristles are excellent all but the thickest hair would benefit.</li>
            <li>and best of all one of my coworkers noticed the shine and thought I had put a glaze in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, it comes beautifully packaged, together with a brush cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Came in a very nice box with a brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>This is a very attractive brush made with fine boar bristles.</li>
            <li>Not as good as it claimed.</li>
            <li>Good purchase</li>
            <li>Excellent brush fit for a Queen.....</li>
            <li>These brushes are reliably the absolutely best brushes and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I though maybe I should have gotten a stiffer one, but still I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Great for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Great quality, pricy, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I liked the way the handle fit in my hand when I took it out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more also get the brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>She is from England and her mother gifted her this brush in the 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I hesitated on spending the money on this brush, but glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Top-notch brush with beautiful, quality, white bristles in a white rubber cushion.</li>
            <li>It is made for people with fine hair and separates the strands much better than a coarser bristle.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t remember for many years what brush I had that made my hair so beautiful when I was younger</li>
            <li>After I bought it, I saw it in a Lucky Magazine review of the best beauty products - it DEFINITELY belongs there.</li>
            <li>This brush is specifically for thinning or fine here, but can be used for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>So comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>just as I expected, great seller</li>
            <li>They last a very long time and are wonderful on your hair.</li>
            <li>My husband needs very soft bristles; tried this one, but not as good for him as the men&#x27;s soft bristle brush.</li>
            <li>it is not thin but fine and graying.  </li>
            <li>I think if your hair is really thick it wouldn&#x27;t be the ideal brush though.</li>
            <li>worth the price.  </li>
            <li>No more fly away hairs.</li>
            <li>handle gives a comfortable grip, the bristles are just right (neither too hard nor too soft) and the oval shape is very elegant and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>Unless your hair is super straight, it will most likely remove as much hair as it removes dirt.  </li>
            <li>For the quality over all, I dont think this brush is worth nearly $75.</li>
            <li>It is very well made as with all things from England.</li>
            <li>I could not believe I was going to spend so much for a brush, but after trying others and still losing hair, I said why not.  </li>
            <li>So I will find someone who could use a soft brush &amp; order the right one.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>and it comes with a smaller brush to clean.</li>
            <li>It just glides through my long hair, leaving it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair, but this brush is more for baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>She was so pleased as the price was significantly less than in some specialty stores.</li>
            <li>The bristles barely reach my scalp, which defeats the whole purpose of why I bought the brush in the first place.  </li>
            <li>This is ideal for her short, thin, hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I can use on my 1 year old&#x27;s hair, but that is about it!</li>
            <li>If you have even a little bit of bend in your fine hair, I do not recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li>I think this brush is tooo rough for fine fragile hair.  </li>
            <li>I have bought cheaper brushes at Sally&#x27;s that are SUPPOSED to be boars hair for significantly less and significantly softer.  </li>
            <li>Not as soft as I was expecting it to be.</li>
            <li>I was surprised it was sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Ordered a SOFT Brush .....</li>
            <li>They have brushes with soft bristles for  $8.00 ...</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, leaves it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have below the bra length hair with fine to medium coarse hair with few grays.</li>
            <li>The brush is too large for my head especially since I have short hair.</li>
            <li>Removes loose hairs even with gentle strokes.</li>
            <li>but it is not soft from my experience with many boars hair brushes this one is REALLY hard.</li>
            <li>All grumbling aside, the brush is relatively well designed for someone with a lot of brushing to do as far as ergonomics.  </li>
            <li>It has static and makes my hair worse.</li>
            <li>My second Kent brush not as accurately described (not as soft as expected) as previously owned Kent brush.  </li>
            <li>I bought this specific brush for my mom who has thin, fine hair.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m losing less hair and the brush just glides through my hair without pulling!</li>
            <li> The bristles felt harder than the prongs on my Denman brush as it relates to the thin bristles.  </li>
            <li> I thought it could have at least be sealed and buffed out.  </li>
            <li> In my youth my hair was very thick not so thick now.</li>
            <li> She has very delicate hair</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> This brush is hard!!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this item and was disappointed...</li>

            <li> Love this brush. Couldn&#x27;t afford a mason Pearson. I have long, fine hair. Very gentle. I think if your hair is really thick it wouldn&#x27;t be the ideal brush though.</li>

            <li> This brush is hard!!!  I guess it&#x27;s all relative but it is not soft from my experience with many boars hair brushes this one is REALLY hard. The bristles felt harder than the prongs on my Denman brush as it relates to the thin bristles.  I was expecting something a little firmer than a baby brush and got what should be a fabric brush.

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember for many years what brush I had that made my hair so beautiful when I was younger ( I lost it in Hawaii). I&#x27;m sixty now. While browsing the web I found it again and I&#x27;m elated! Within minutes of using it my hair got slinky and shiny again (I&#x27;m a frizzy, kinky hair person). Even my husband noticed immediately. I&#x27;m losing less hair and the brush just glides through my hair without pulling! Only problem I have with this one is that it doesn&#x27;t reach my scalp enough and I though maybe I should have gotten a stiffer one, but still I&#x27;m very satisfied. Came in a very nice box with a brush cleaner. You won&#x27;t be dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> The brush is all I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I bought this specific brush for my mom who has thin, fine hair. She loves it and said the quality of the brush is wonderful. It appears the seller I purchased from is located in the U.K. where they are made and while requiring a longer ship time the brush was delivered earlier than expected. Good purchase</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. She has very delicate hair and this is just the ticket!</li>
            <li> My second Kent brush not as accurately described (not as soft as expected) as previously owned Kent brush.  My husband needs very soft bristles; tried this one, but not as good for him as the men&#x27;s soft bristle brush.</li>
            <li> The only brand I will ever use.. It is very well made as with all things from England. I will be buying more also get the brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush fit for a Queen.....</li>
            <li> My mother was looking for these brushes. She is from England and her mother gifted her this brush in the 50&#x27;s. She mentioned she lost her brush and wanted another Kent Brush. This is ideal for her short, thin, hair. She was so pleased as the price was significantly less than in some specialty stores.</li>
            <li> I could not believe I was going to spend so much for a brush, but after trying others and still losing hair, I said why not.  I should have listed to the other reviewer that stated this brush should be for babies only. Not only does It does not reach the scalp but t also pulls out my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This is the finest boar bristled, made in England brush you can find. I was surprised it was sold on Amazon. This brush is specifically for thinning or fine here, but can be used for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> 2nd of these brushes ordered in a little over a month! Great quality, pricy, but worth it. Puts me hair in place w/o gels or mousse, that is unless I come into a hurricane west wind (G. Lightfoot). Order arrived on time and in perfect condition! Hair Hair!!! I mean Hear Hear !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a medium size brush fits well in the hand.Bristles are excellent all but the thickest hair would benefit.It reaches the scalp and does not scratch.Removes loose hairs even with gentle strokes. I have below the bra length hair with fine to medium coarse hair with few grays.What one must remember is to treat hair with care.In my youth my hair was very thick not so thick now.</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive brush made with fine boar bristles. It is made for people with fine hair and separates the strands much better than a coarser bristle. The hair appears fuller when this brush is used. It comes with a comb to remove hair from the bristles.</li>
            <li> Ordered a SOFT Brush .....Damn thing is like running Bobbed Wire thru my hair what little I have... Save your money go to a local beauty supply ....They have brushes with soft bristles for  $8.00 ... Buy 8 and give seven away to your friends that groom horses... I DO  NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT ....</li>
            <li> worth the price.  doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, leaves it soft and shiny.  Beautiful brush and it comes with a smaller brush to clean.</li>
            <li> Top-notch brush with beautiful, quality, white bristles in a white rubber cushion. So comfortable to use. It just glides through my long hair, leaving it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I hesitated on spending the money on this brush, but glad I did.  I have been trying to grow my hair it is not thin but fine and graying.  after a few weeks of nightly brushing I found that I no longer needed all of the product (serum, styling cream etc.) and best of all one of my coworkers noticed the shine and thought I had put a glaze in my hair.  So I say money well spent, what I save on the cost of hair products will pay for the brush.</li>
