            <li>It is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t all stay on, but when I don&#x27;t want to suds-I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li>I have to say this product is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>I use it to cover my great roots, and my hair has thinned a bit so it serves 2 purposes !~</li>
            <li>Very good for covering the scalp so it doesn&#x27;t show through thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Great product excellent price</li>
            <li>This really is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Very nice cosmetic for disguising thinning hair on your scalp.  </li>
            <li>Love the Dermatch the best of all the choices out there.</li>
            <li>Use good lighting and a hand held mirror in addition to your bathroom mirror</li>
            <li>, Good coverage.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>need a liberal amount to do any good depending on the amount of hairloss...</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I had a hair transplant that did work beautifully, but did not have the funds to do as many graffs as I would have originally liked too.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>It covers my  thinning hair and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>very fine hair and people always say not to wash your hair every day for better hair.</li>
            <li>The Medium Brown Dermatch could be easily blended with Dark Brown for a flawless look - which is great since colored hair goes through stages of fading as time goes on.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>Note: make sure to color match to your roots...</li>
            <li>so you can see sides and top of your head...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>because if you&#x27;re looking at it you probably already know, you brush it onto your hair, comb it through, and you&#x27;ve got the appearance of a lot more hair than you did when you started.  </li>
            <li>produces a shade that almost perfectly matches my hair color, and even people looking up close and personal can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a better solution and found this product but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Better than the powders I have used.</li>
            <li>it provides better coverage than one alone.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered Dermatch and it&#x27;s the best product out there.</li>
            <li>My hair began thinning on top 2 years ago where you could see my scalp.</li>
            <li>Husband talked me in to the medium brown that I like better.</li>
            <li>This works better than the &amp;#34;salt shaker&amp;#34; powder.  </li>
            <li>More staying power and conceals better.  </li>
            <li>the extra sleep I get is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>make sure to mix and apply fast....as it tends</li>
            <li>With some practice this does a very good job of concealing bare or thinly-haired scalp areas.</li>
            <li>This stuff went on well, looks VERY NICE, and is a decent match.</li>
            <li>It does shampoo out easily.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got it because it looks so easy to use for those thinning and gray parts of your hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge area to cover</li>
            <li>This is an important distinction.</li>
            <li>This is important.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found mixing it with the light brown</li>
            <li>thought I wore a cheap wig because she could see a line.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>as others will  Clean up the sink and countertop with alcohol.</li>
            <li>Best of luck with this stuff -- it can be a pain to use, for certain, but it really added back a lot of confidence to my style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others but this by far has the best coverage and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>) Blowdry with cool setting, brushing or combing as you go to prevent sticking/</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it, but I look like I have a full head of hair when I use this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight - and for me - looks right.</li>
            <li>The dabbing (not rubbing) seems to get the most realistic looking results.</li>
            <li>If my experience continues in this manner I&#x27;ll be a loyal follower for life.</li>
            <li>I also have a thinning spot towards the front of my hairline from when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Instructions are easy to use, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It goes on fast and easy and comes off with shampoo in the shower.</li>
            <li>But, actually, it really doesn&#x27;t go on the scalp smoothly, or the hair.  </li>
            <li>For 5 years I&#x27;ve tried so many different cover ups for my gray hair and too much scalp showing in the hair part on top.</li>
            <li>Use a fine boar&#x27;s bristle brush to work the now driedconcealer into a realistic looking fade.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews (I have a 1 year old, a full time job, and a husband which means I have zero free time)</li>
            <li>right after I&#x27;ve shampooed my hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have plenty of concealer and it needs to be damp, not wet.  </li>
            <li>I have the Medium Brown, and it looks a little reddish on my scalp, but since my hair tends to be a bit on the red side, it worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li>The companys direct website offers special deals when you purchase 2 or more, so check that out as well.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend spotted it the first time I used it in no time.  </li>
            <li>You can mix colors for  more customization if necessary.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and had no smell at all.  </li>
            <li>Not enough applicators and that should be self-evident to vendors  and more included or offered as at an additional cost.</li>
            <li>I now use both the dark brown and some of this for a good natural color.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s so smart.</li>
            <li>I started with the Medium Brown...too much red/auburn color</li>
            <li>fast shipping...product as described...</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Take a comb and stick all of your hair straight up&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Dermatch!</li>
            <li>but it really bothered me.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Just add a dime size amount of water into the whole tray and&lt;br /&gt;mix</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I now cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>so am just puzzled as to why some days it is fine and other days</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural and it lasts all day, no matter what environment I&#x27;ve been in (ie: humidity, rain, sweat, etc).</li>
            <li>But with fine hair it looks greasy and gross and no amount of dry shampoo can help.</li>
            <li>Once it occurred to me to use an eyeliner pencil to color the line down the back of my head and try to cover it with hair so that when it starts to part, it still wasn&#x27;t prominent and gave the illusion of a highlight from a distance.</li>
            <li>I only tried this product once, but don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>Always feel sensitive about my hair - and ability to see my scalp.  </li>
            <li>and I no longer feel self conscious about it.</li>
            <li>It came today, I used it today, I&#x27;m surprised today.</li>
            <li>I had my hair up one day&amp;my 26yr old daughter</li>
            <li>but I really feel the need to share how this product has totally changed my life.</li>
            <li>dry out in the tray fast...</li>
            <li>It covers in such a manner that it looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have in no way regretted that purchase and will probably order this for the rest of my life even if that thinning part grows back completely.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I seem to sweat a little too much when using, and worry that will expose what I have used.</li>

            <li> I seem to sweat a little too much when using, and worry that will expose what I have used.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t as natural looking as the Dark Brown.</li>
            <li> Hair shaft has hints of grey</li>
            <li> It covers a wide part line I have in the back of my head</li>
            <li> I have an hour long drive to work and the time this saves me in the morning and</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but compared to the thousands I spent on professional help, it is just pennies a day.</li>
            <li> Have tried other similar products but none work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy but the applicators take WAY to much time.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Too dry</li>
            <li> Blow dry hair including areas with concealer.</li>
            <li> I use Dermatch dry - and it gives me the coverage I want without the dusting that occurs with some of the shake coverage products.  </li>
            <li> Its changed my life because I can hop in the shower with a shower cap, get out, dry off, and go.</li>
            <li> every single problem one can encounter with it</li>
            <li> The reason: my roots are still the dark brown my hair was when I was younger.</li>
            <li> For some reason my hair started parting down the back of my head.</li>
            <li> You can apply Dermatch either with the dry applicator or get it wet.  </li>
            <li> And because it coats your hair slightly when you comb it through I literally only have to wash my hair once every 3 days.</li>
            <li> Could not live without it!</li>
            <li> With my thinning hair, I could NOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> is mess up my sink, make my hair feel gross, and put blotches on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have seen some minor issues for other people and I just don&#x27;t seem to care.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t loose any volume to my hair!  </li>
            <li> If you put it on too wet, it runs and clumps up.</li>
            <li> Wet the concealer inside of the container well.</li>
            <li> Not just a few drops, but enough to dampen it thoroughly inside of the container.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I only tried this product once, but don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute best! For 5 years I&#x27;ve tried so many different cover ups for my gray hair and too much scalp showing in the hair part on top. It covers in such a manner that it looks natural. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> 7/31/15  Price has jumped dramatically. I paid $32 in April 2015 and today I see it listed for $81! Shop around that is an absurd increase. &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Note: make sure to color match to your roots...the hair nearest to your scalp. This is an important distinction. My roots are a different color than the hair shaft in the areas I need to apply this. I started with the Medium Brown...too much red/auburn color and it wasn&#x27;t as natural looking as the Dark Brown. The reason: my roots are still the dark brown my hair was when I was younger. Hair shaft has hints of grey so the Medium Brown didn&#x27;t blend well once I attempted to brush it into the surrounding hair (as they recommend in the instructions).  This stuff takes some practice to apply it. If you put it on too wet, it runs and clumps up. Too dry and it doesn&#x27;t cover well.  Realize that until you&#x27;ve mastered it, you are going to go out in public looking like you&#x27;ve got concealer (or shoe polish) on your head. My girlfriend spotted it the first time I used it in no time.  So, I&#x27;ve updated this after a few weeks of use to share what I&#x27;ve learned:  Dampen hair or use after showering and washing your hair.  Wet the concealer inside of the container well. This seems to get the best results. Not just a few drops, but enough to dampen it thoroughly inside of the container.  Moisten the applicator just to get it damp, and squeeze out excess water. This is important. If the applicator is too wet it will run since the applicator acts like a little sponge. Press it to your scalp when its too wet and the concealer will run.  Place both sides of applicator into container and swirl around covering applicator well.  Dab the applicator with concealer on the scalp areas you wish to conceal. The dabbing (not rubbing) seems to get the most realistic looking results. Make sure you have plenty of concealer and it needs to be damp, not wet.  Blow dry hair including areas with concealer. Use a fine boar&#x27;s bristle brush to work the now driedconcealer into a realistic looking fade.  With some practice this does a very good job of concealing bare or thinly-haired scalp areas. Use good lighting and a hand held mirror in addition to your bathroom mirror so you can see sides and top of your head...as others will  Clean up the sink and countertop with alcohol.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I can wait a couple months before dying my hair. Used to have it done every month plus this product gives my hair volume. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Works well, Good coverage. Sweat and water resistant. Have tried other similar products but none work as well as this one. You can mix colors for  more customization if necessary.</li>
            <li> works like it suppose to</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  It covers my  thinning hair and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> Great product excellent price</li>
            <li> I am female and had a problem with my hair thinning with the birth of my son 25 years ago. I had a hair transplant that did work beautifully, but did not have the funds to do as many graffs as I would have originally liked too. I found this product on line and have been using it for 20 years now. It is a little pricey but compared to the thousands I spent on professional help, it is just pennies a day. This product is applied with a sponge applicator that comes with the product and lasts approx. 6 months. It does not run whats-so-ever even when swimming. It does shampoo out easily. I would reccomend this to everyone who would like to improve their self esteem. The companys direct website offers special deals when you purchase 2 or more, so check that out as well.</li>
            <li> fast shipping...product as described...no issues</li>
            <li> Could not live without it!</li>
            <li> turns red on your scalp. I now use both the dark brown and some of this for a good natural color. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very good for covering the scalp so it doesn&#x27;t show through thinning hair. Wish the applicators were wider to allow for quicker application.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got it because it looks so easy to use for those thinning and gray parts of your hair.  But, actually, it really doesn&#x27;t go on the scalp smoothly, or the hair.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> This really is a great product.  I won&#x27;t take time explaining what it is, because if you&#x27;re looking at it you probably already know, you brush it onto your hair, comb it through, and you&#x27;ve got the appearance of a lot more hair than you did when you started.  My only complaint is that this medium brown shade they make seems to have a bit of reddish in it.  I&#x27;ve found mixing it with the light brown produces a shade that almost perfectly matches my hair color, and even people looking up close and personal can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips for application, perfected over a few months:&lt;br /&gt;1) Apply to damp hair -- a few swipes of the towel after the shower&lt;br /&gt;2) Take a comb and stick all of your hair straight up&lt;br /&gt;3) Wet the brush, shake off the water, swirl through the container&lt;br /&gt;4) Brush back through hair&lt;br /&gt;5) Repeat 5-6 times until your entire head (or thinning areas) have been coated)&lt;br /&gt;6) Blowdry with cool setting, brushing or combing as you go to prevent sticking/clumping&lt;br /&gt;7) Use a paper towel and wipe off the excess (can also do this mid-blow-dry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find a styling product (hairspray is my go to) helps add a little sheen and takes away the powdery look.  Best of luck with this stuff -- it can be a pain to use, for certain, but it really added back a lot of confidence to my style.</li>
            <li> For some reason my hair started parting down the back of my head. Even if I spray it together, it eventually parts. Once it occurred to me to use an eyeliner pencil to color the line down the back of my head and try to cover it with hair so that when it starts to part, it still wasn&#x27;t prominent and gave the illusion of a highlight from a distance. I was looking for a better solution and found this product but every single problem one can encounter with it, I encountered. It&#x27;s hard to collect and will not stick to my head no matter what I do. In fact, my scalp hurt from trying to get it to stick. I tried scraping some off the compressed powder disc so that it would be easier to collect and apply but even that was difficult. I made my scalp sore. For me it&#x27;s worse than useless. I felt that I was exacerbating whatever was causing the hair to part.</li>
            <li> Always feel sensitive about my hair - and ability to see my scalp.  I use Dermatch dry - and it gives me the coverage I want without the dusting that occurs with some of the shake coverage products.  It&#x27;s light weight - and for me - looks right.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and had no smell at all.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Instructions are easy to use, and it works very well.This also makes your hair look thicker. Better than the powders I have used.</li>
            <li> Works well. I seem to sweat a little too much when using, and worry that will expose what I have used. Perhaps I am sweating because I am nervous, so I just don&#x27;t know what is a biproduct of which.</li>
            <li> O.K. Works but coverage is not as dramatic as photos suggest, but combined with fibers it provides better coverage than one alone. Not enough applicators and that should be self-evident to vendors  and more included or offered as at an additional cost. I would like to know where to buy additional applicators.I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to figure out why some days it colors well and other days I struggle to make the color stick.  In the instructions it says that this is due to either the water or to hair products.  I use the same water every day and the same mousse so am just puzzled as to why some days it is fine and other days it is a struggle to get the color to stick to my scalp</li>
            <li> It is wonderful. It covers a wide part line I have in the back of my head and I no longer feel self conscious about it.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered Dermatch and it&#x27;s the best product out there. I&#x27;ve tried others but this by far has the best coverage and it lasts a long time.  My hair began thinning on top 2 years ago where you could see my scalp. After using other products I found Dermatch after doing an internet search.  You can apply Dermatch either with the dry applicator or get it wet.  I prefer wet  right after I&#x27;ve shampooed my hair. I highly recommend Dermatch!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Looks natural and lasts a long time. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> It came today, I used it today, I&#x27;m surprised today. I&#x27;ve got brush-on powder, sprinkle powders by Beaver, Caboki, Toppik and another one I don&#x27;t remember. I got the applicator for Toppik too. All these seem to do is mess up my sink, make my hair feel gross, and put blotches on my scalp. I had my hair up one day&amp;my 26yr old daughter thought I wore a cheap wig because she could see a line. This stuff went on well, looks VERY NICE, and is a decent match. If my experience continues in this manner I&#x27;ll be a loyal follower for life. It went on with the applicator and also a short, dense brush I had which got in a few cracks the sponge didn&#x27;t quite get.PS-it&#x27;s now about 10pm. I ended up dousing my head in the pool because of a bee. In the shower I used my WEN and this stuff STAYED!! It didn&#x27;t all stay on, but when I don&#x27;t want to suds-I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go without it. Husband talked me in to the medium brown that I like better. He&#x27;s so smart.</li>
            <li> This works better than the &amp;#34;salt shaker&amp;#34; powder.  More staying power and conceals better.  The powders would get blotchy after a few hours - especially if you have oily skin.  The Medium Brown Dermatch could be easily blended with Dark Brown for a flawless look - which is great since colored hair goes through stages of fading as time goes on.  Love the Dermatch the best of all the choices out there.</li>
            <li> The wire that goes around my head is too big so the hair does not sit well.  I am trying to cover sparse hair on my crown so this does not do the trick.</li>
            <li> Very nice cosmetic for disguising thinning hair on your scalp.  It doesn&#x27;t flake, and doesn&#x27;t come off on your pillowcase at night.  It will come off on your fingertips if you should scratch or rub your scalp, but just wash your hands after.  I have the Medium Brown, and it looks a little reddish on my scalp, but since my hair tends to be a bit on the red side, it worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you have thinning hair, then this will cover it up and make it look thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned, it will rub off on sheets and collars.  Just don&#x27;t sleep on white pillowcases or wear white collared shirts.</li>
            <li> With my thinning hair, I could NOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT!  Yes, it is tedious and takes a LOT of time to do, but I would say 80% of the people who see me or know me would never guess I have the amount of hair loss I have because of HOW WELL THIS PRODUCT COVERS the hair loss!  PLEASE NEVER STOP MAKING THIS PRODUCT DERMATCH!  It TRULY stays put until you shampoo it out.  Expensive but lasts at least a few MONTHS for me.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews (I have a 1 year old, a full time job, and a husband which means I have zero free time) but I really feel the need to share how this product has totally changed my life. That is not an exaggeration, I promise, stay with me here. I have very fine hair and people always say not to wash your hair every day for better hair. But with fine hair it looks greasy and gross and no amount of dry shampoo can help. I also have a thinning spot towards the front of my hairline from when I was pregnant. The hair has SLOWLY started to come back but it really bothered me. So I bought some stuff over the counter at Walgreens which worked but it was this very loose powder and it got everywhere and was hard to put in one specific spot. So I looked for something else and ran across this. I have in no way regretted that purchase and will probably order this for the rest of my life even if that thinning part grows back completely. Its easy to apply and it makes my hair thicker and easier to manage. And because it coats your hair slightly when you comb it through I literally only have to wash my hair once every 3 days. A little dry shampoo and I am good to go. Its holds whatever hairstyle I pick like curls, or blow outs, or waves, or straightened. I have seen some minor issues for other people and I just don&#x27;t seem to care. Yes when you itch your head you get a little under your nails. Whatever. Wash your hands. Wash your pillow case once a week and you will not notice anything on your pillow. Its changed my life because I can hop in the shower with a shower cap, get out, dry off, and go. I have an hour long drive to work and the time this saves me in the morning and the extra sleep I get is wonderful.  Cannot recommend enough.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, but I look like I have a full head of hair when I use this.  I never in a million years would have thought that something like this would work.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it! Great product.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair in the area above my forehead so it&#x27;s very noticeable. Before my wedding I was desperate for a solution to cover this area, so I decided to try Dermatch. I have to say this product is AWESOME! I now cannot live without it! I don&#x27;t have a huge area to cover so one disc has lasted me 3 years. It&#x27;s very natural and it lasts all day, no matter what environment I&#x27;ve been in (ie: humidity, rain, sweat, etc). It goes on fast and easy and comes off with shampoo in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use it to cover my great roots, and my hair has thinned a bit so it serves 2 purposes !~</li>
            <li> Chuck the stupid applicators.  Just add a dime size amount of water into the whole tray and&lt;br /&gt;mix with index finger.  Apply with index finger...make sure to mix and apply fast....as it tends&lt;br /&gt;to dry out in the tray fast...which is a good thing.  It&#x27;s a little messy but the applicators take WAY to much time.&lt;br /&gt;You need a liberal amount to do any good depending on the amount of hairloss...just experiment.  I always blow&lt;br /&gt;dry and I don&#x27;t loose any volume to my hair!  Good luck</li>
