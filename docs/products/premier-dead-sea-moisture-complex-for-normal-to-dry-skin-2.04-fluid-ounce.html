            <li>was very smooth</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Every one has different products that work best with their skin.</li>
            <li>A lovely hydrating day cream which doesn&#x27;t make your make up slide off</li>
            <li>It can change your look for the better.</li>
            <li>I know this product and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love your price too.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the product my skin</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite creams.  </li>
            <li>This also does a wonderful job of making my pores look smaller!</li>
            <li>For the price there are better products out there for me.</li>
            <li>The mineral bar is great and the cream really hydrates my skin.  </li>
            <li>I used this product and its very good quality for small price,I recommend it and any Premier product.no allergy very nice</li>
            <li>Maybe not to the extent that my skin requires, but it does a pretty good job nonetheless.</li>
            <li>After using this for about three weeks now (morning and night), I am happy, very happy to report, that this product has helped me (almost) eliminate acne, complete eradicated dry spots, and I am now going to buy one for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love how elastic, plump, smooth and soothed my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>It shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s strong too.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin so beautiful and fresh, extremely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Enjoy &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is great for all skin types and will keep your skin smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>The scent is so clean.</li>
            <li>I can easily apply makeup right after putting on te cream too.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something that will hydrate my face specially around the nose.  </li>
            <li>love this so much</li>
            <li>If your looking for a really good cream, look no further.</li>
            <li>but this moisturizer is good enough that I want to use both.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go, so no big deal.</li>
            <li>BUT IT IS NOT BAD.</li>
            <li>For super sensitive, acne-prone skin, I must say this cream is hypoallergenic and delivers the smoothest results!!!!!</li>
            <li>This product is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product last summer and loved it so much I bought it again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be going back to my favored, organic products in the future.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my skin soft, radiant and reduces the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very unsatisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I happen to get a sample of this product and it was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I love the feeling i get in my face the instant</li>
            <li>but this product combined with Gratiae toner and cleanser makes my skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I like this product but the first jar I had ordered  </li>
            <li>is the first time I have order it for Amazon</li>
            <li>I love the entire line.</li>
            <li>The product may be good, but I ordered  Normal to Dry Skin and received Normal to Oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product for a long time and still love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have large pores on my cheeks, nose and forehead.</li>
            <li>Very good product and not to expensive.  </li>
            <li>Premier Dead Sea products are amazing.</li>
            <li>The USPS lost my parcel after it had been checked in, and Amazon reimbursed the total sum and gave me free shipping after I reordered.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Having been using Premier products for about 16 months and it has really made a difference for me.  </li>
            <li>because I think that I have finally found a more natural moisturizer that works on my face (grapeseed oil).</li>
            <li>But I have found other products that are even better now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better products for much less cost even though this was cheaper than buying through the mall kiosks.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous for the dry skin around my mouth.</li>
            <li>Just wish it did more to firm the skin.</li>
            <li>Premier Dead Sea products seem to be more hype than help.</li>
            <li>(I may try the normal to oil skin to how that one works in comparison for me)</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve got normal to oily skin).  </li>
            <li>It smells like an old woman&#x27;s perfume!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I have combination skin, it&#x27;s really hard to find a product that will truly moisturize without making the rest of my face look more oily than it is.</li>
            <li>just got the premier moisture complex that I LOVE</li>
            <li>/&gt;it makes my skin soft and my glowing</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old.  </li>
            <li>us sensitive</li>
            <li>Not oily and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I was completely shock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had ever seen on my 37 year old face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This facial cream is very rich and creamy but not at all oily or thick on my face.</li>
            <li>There never seems to be any real scientific studies on whether such products actually work as claimed; only anecdotal claims by women who have used the products.  </li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day and still have some left.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t have dry skin, I find this an excellent product for protecting the skin during time spent outdoors especially in the winter cold, wind, and rain.  </li>
            <li>I live in a climate where my skin gets extremely dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy but the texture is thick enough to smooth out</li>
            <li>Actually my first purchase of this product was made in Israel and have used this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li>I live in the far Canadian north and this cream helps keep my skin healthy in a very dry cold climate.</li>
            <li>i already use it for 2 night , it was very moisture but a little bit oily .</li>
            <li>good product bad packaging and over priced.one was busted open one leaked.</li>
            <li>and I was shocked that the moisturizer was still fresh on me and my skin was so smooth.</li>

            <li> and I was shocked that the moisturizer was still fresh on me and my skin was so smooth.</li>
            <li> With all the hype of this particular brand of dead sea products and the insane prices charged through the kiosks, I thought my best bet would be to try to find it online.  </li>
            <li> I have a little dry skin and premier moisture complex works like magic.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a number of times, this facial cream immediately helped my dry face, IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is really for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I stopped buying Lancome completely and change all my skin products to Premier Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I have breakout prone skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t break me out as long as I use the oily bar</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, there are fewer wrinkles and my lifelong acne is gone.</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s a bit pricey, it lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> I have oily T-zone and dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> I am prone to dry spots and since using this - that problem has gone away.  </li>
            <li> Around my mouth is really dry and my cheeks and nose are oily.</li>
            <li> It does hydrate my dry skin while controlling excess oil, like it claims.</li>
            <li> Since using this, I have not had a problem with excessively dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many skin creams over the years - some very expensive - yet, find this product and line of products affordable and works well.</li>
            <li> I have run out of it and thought I&#x27;d try other things (trying to pay less for moisturizer), but now my 46-year-old skin looks dull and well,,,, just less pretty.</li>

            <li> and I can feel softer and less dry lines.</li>
            <li> This seller, on the other hand, I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for two weeks now use it every other day at night.</li>
            <li> my acne has cleaned up and the dark under eye circles have cleared up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer along with the night time moisturizer and other Dead Sea items since then faithfully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable to other moisturizing creams, but not better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little pricey</li>

            <li> I found Dead Sea products in spring of 2009 while in Las Vegas for a wedding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the product works yet.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past three years.</li>
            <li> AS I USUALLY BUY,</li>
            <li> I usually have to moisturize that area a couple times, sometimes even have to put lotion on after that and sometimes reapply</li>

            <li> This year we have had a very cold winter and this skin cream, along with the use of Dead Sea Vitamin Facial Serum with Vitamin E and C kept my face from chaffing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying this product from the mall kiosk....you know where they tell you, &amp;#34;If you buy this one, we will give you this one for free&amp;#34;!  I just happened to find it on Amazon, and am really happy that I did.  I am hoping that it will be availalbe when I need to replenish my supply!</li>
            <li> Leaves some glow on the skin, which I try to avoid.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent! I have used it for a number of times, this facial cream immediately helped my dry face, IMMEDIATELY. I love it. The USPS lost my parcel after it had been checked in, and Amazon reimbursed the total sum and gave me free shipping after I reordered. Thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> Every one has different products that work best with their skin. I have oily T-zone and dry cheeks. I use this as my day because it does not make me look oily under make-up. It softens and secures my make-up in place. Wait at least 5 minutes after applying before foundation application.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product; by far the best creams my wife has ever tried!</li>
            <li> It moisturized my skin and I can feel softer and less dry lines.Although I continued to have outbreaks of acne.</li>
            <li> A lovely hydrating day cream which doesn&#x27;t make your make up slide off&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favourite moisturiser&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Everyone is commenting on my &amp;#34;refreshed skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the product works yet. However,  I do know my product was already opened and either spilled out or was used when I opened it. I&#x27;m very unsatisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Premier Dead Sea products are amazing. I use premier eye cream and milk cleanser and their luxury hand and foot cream.iI just got the premier moisture complex that I LOVE so much.tTheir products are great. It keeps my skin so beautiful and fresh, extremely smooth and soft. I use to buy Lancome until I was STOPED one day at the mall by a man that asked me to come over and try the Premier moisture complex. I tried it on and walked around the mall for over an hour and I was shocked that the moisturizer was still fresh on me and my skin was so smooth. I have a little dry skin and premier moisture complex works like magic. I stopped buying Lancome completely and change all my skin products to Premier Dead Sea. I would recommend all their products. It can change your look for the better. Enjoy &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for a long time and still love it.&lt;br /&gt;it makes my skin soft and my glowing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I only give this product 4 stars instead of 5 because of the extra step involved (the oily bar needs to be applied like soap after cleansing the face). I have breakout prone skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t break me out as long as I use the oily bar (I don&#x27;t know why, but when I have tried skipping that step I would break out). I have purchased this product twice now (from different buyers) and I like it. This seller, on the other hand, I don&#x27;t like. The jar lid doesn&#x27;t screw on and it came open with the cream starting to spill out. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll purchase this stuff again because of the way the package came and because I think that I have finally found a more natural moisturizer that works on my face (grapeseed oil).</li>
            <li> This has done a good job in keeping my skin hydrated.  I am prone to dry spots and since using this - that problem has gone away.  Just wish it did more to firm the skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens and dozens of facial products. For super sensitive, acne-prone skin, I must say this cream is hypoallergenic and delivers the smoothest results!!!!! It&#x27;s not greasy but the texture is thick enough to smooth out you&#x27;re skin without breaking you out or creating excess oil. I have combination skin prone to blackheads, and this stuff does the trick!! I apply it before my makeup and also at night to hydrate my skin enough because it can get oily. The scent is so clean. I &amp;#34;found&amp;#34; this product- from one of my boyfriends. His skin was perfect and now so is mine :)</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old.  This product makes my skin soft, radiant and reduces the fine lines.  After seeing the difference in my skin,  all of my sisters have started using it.  I used it every day for two weeks now use it every other day at night.</li>
            <li> I used this product and its very good quality for small price,I recommend it and any Premier product.no allergy very nice</li>
            <li> Perfect as described.</li>
            <li> I only gave this one star because they wouldn&#x27;t let me give it zero. There is no moisture in this product. It dried out my skin and looked terrible under makeup.</li>
            <li> I used for a month and didn&#x27;t notice any changes.  It&#x27;s comparable to other moisturizing creams, but not better.  I have started to use coconut oil at night.</li>
            <li> I have run out of it and thought I&#x27;d try other things (trying to pay less for moisturizer), but now my 46-year-old skin looks dull and well,,,, just less pretty. I MUST re-order this today!!!</li>
            <li> The product may be good, but I ordered  Normal to Dry Skin and received Normal to Oily skin. I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> After using this for about three weeks now (morning and night), I am happy, very happy to report, that this product has helped me (almost) eliminate acne, complete eradicated dry spots, and I am now going to buy one for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this so much I am going to look to see if they have product with sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> The two part lid holds a cake of some mineral stuff to put on your face and take off&lt;br /&gt;before you put the cream on, it was all dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again from the same people.</li>
            <li> I know this product and love it.  I love your price too.</li>
            <li> Very good product and not to expensive.  For all kind of skin and I&#x27;am doing no allergy for once.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I found this brand lotion years  ago in a mall and have loved it and used it ever since..it really works great...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that will hydrate my face specially around the nose.  I happen to get a sample of this product and it was exactly what I was looking for.  It&#x27;s just a little pricey but it serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> great cream ever,i will recommend this to everyone....because its awesome!!! i will tell all of my friends to buy  it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Great moisturizer but not oily.</li>
            <li> I found Dead Sea products in spring of 2009 while in Las Vegas for a wedding.  I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer along with the night time moisturizer and other Dead Sea items since then faithfully. My skin looks so much better than it did in 2009!  People tell me that my face looks younger than my 57 years.  I don&#x27;t care.  I love how elastic, plump, smooth and soothed my skin feels.  My pores are smaller, there are fewer wrinkles and my lifelong acne is gone.</li>
            <li> I like this product. But I have found other products that are even better now. So, I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. Will</li>
            <li> This product is worth the price.  If your looking for a really good cream, look no further.</li>
            <li> Love the product my skin us sensitive and this is awesome for me...</li>
            <li> im wondering whether the product i received is geniuses. sealed cover has been peel ed off.</li>
            <li> Ive used it for years good to get it at a fair price</li>
            <li> Like to return , when I get my 2 bottle it wasn&#x27;t sealed and leaked almost 1/3 of the bottle .</li>
            <li> this is the best price you can find on this incredible product. I am in my 60s and use this exclusively to keep a younger looking face. but it.</li>
            <li> This facial cream is very rich and creamy but not at all oily or thick on my face. I love the feeling i get in my face the instant I put it on &amp; ow it feels throughout the day. I can easily apply makeup right after putting on te cream too.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The order was just as I expected. It shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problem skin but this product combined with Gratiae toner and cleanser makes my skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite creams.  Would recommend to anyone.  I usuallly don&#x27;t use a moisturizer since I use their serum but this moisturizer is good enough that I want to use both.</li>
            <li> Great product! Not oily and makes my skin soft. It is more expensive than I can afford. I may purchase it again, if it is a good price.</li>
            <li> My go-to beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better products for much less cost even though this was cheaper than buying through the mall kiosks.  With all the hype of this particular brand of dead sea products and the insane prices charged through the kiosks, I thought my best bet would be to try to find it online.  I did, but I have to say that I have not been impressed. There never seems to be any real scientific studies on whether such products actually work as claimed; only anecdotal claims by women who have used the products.  Frankly, I think women fool themselves into praising such products in an effort to rationalize spending big dollars on them.  I&#x27;ll be going back to my favored, organic products in the future.  Premier Dead Sea products seem to be more hype than help.</li>
            <li> paid booo coo money for it in the mall. it has helped my sun damaged skin, pre-cancer spots when used regularly to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> I like this product but the first jar I had ordered  was very smooth this last jar I ordered was not of the same consistence it was thicker like lard.</li>
            <li> i already use it for 2 night , it was very moisture but a little bit oily . It also take moment to absorb into skin . And this product smell are really good , i love it . It&#x27;s good cream and good price to get this one in the winter time .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past three years. However, the cost of the product made me stop buying it for the retailers.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have order it for Amazon and I am amazed at the difference in price.&lt;br /&gt;Retailers are selling this product for over a 100.00. I go it for 19.00! I was completely shock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic. It is great for all skin types and will keep your skin smooth all day long. For the price you can&#x27;t beat this</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT 2 JARS AND IT WAS A GOOD DEAL. IT WAS NOT AS CREAMY AS I USUALLY BUY, BUT IT IS NOT BAD.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have dry skin, I find this an excellent product for protecting the skin during time spent outdoors especially in the winter cold, wind, and rain.  And it looks great under makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. I have combination skin. Around my mouth is really dry and my cheeks and nose are oily. I also have large pores on my cheeks, nose and forehead. This stuff is fabulous for the dry skin around my mouth. I usually have to moisturize that area a couple times, sometimes even have to put lotion on after that and sometimes reapply later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have combination skin, it&#x27;s really hard to find a product that will truly moisturize without making the rest of my face look more oily than it is. It does hydrate my dry skin while controlling excess oil, like it claims. Maybe not to the extent that my skin requires, but it does a pretty good job nonetheless. Anyway, I just put a primer on my cheeks and I&#x27;m good to go, so no big deal. (I may try the normal to oil skin to how that one works in comparison for me) This also does a wonderful job of making my pores look smaller! If nothing else, I would continue to use this product for the effect it gives on my enlarged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I hate about it is the way it smells. It smells like an old woman&#x27;s perfume! And it&#x27;s strong too. If you can&#x27;t handle such aromatic products, then you might want to stay away from this. Took off a star for the smell because I truly find it horrible. If they took out the fragrance this stuff would be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It&#x27;s been over a year since I&#x27;ve bought this. I use it nearly every day and still have some left. I have also gotten used to the horrible smell. Since using this, I have not had a problem with excessively dry skin. I have also noticed that if I don&#x27;t use it for a few days, that problem area does get worse. In all, I feel the product is superior and though it&#x27;s a bit pricey, it lasts a really long time so you only have to buy it once in a while.</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling dry; the smell is awful.  For the price there are better products out there for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last summer and loved it so much I bought it again.  The mineral bar is great and the cream really hydrates my skin.  I live in the far Canadian north and this cream helps keep my skin healthy in a very dry cold climate.</li>
            <li> Having been using Premier products for about 16 months and it has really made a difference for me.  Wrinkles and discloration fading.</li>
            <li> I love what these products are doing for my skin, they are great my acne has cleaned up and the dark under eye circles have cleared up. Great product.</li>
            <li> good product bad packaging and over priced.one was busted open one leaked.</li>
            <li> This product gave me the tightest pores, plumpest skin, and healthiest glow I had ever seen on my 37 year old face.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it also aggravated my cystic acne :(&lt;br /&gt;It felt great going on (fragrance is strong, but fades rather quickly) but two days later - boils :(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it a couple of times after giving myself a month or two without it and always get boils if I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that it may be fine for those who don&#x27;t have an underlying issue since it gives me two days of great skin before I break out.</li>
            <li> love it, feels great and doesn&#x27;t cause me to be oily or have breakouts.  (I&#x27;ve got normal to oily skin).  Although it says it has an SPF in it, I will burn if I don&#x27;t throw some sunscreen over it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is really for dry skin. While the product works well with my skin. It does leave my skin feeling drier</li>
            <li> Actually my first purchase of this product was made in Israel and have used this product for a few years.  I love the entire line. I have tried many skin creams over the years - some very expensive - yet, find this product and line of products affordable and works well. I live in a climate where my skin gets extremely dry in the winter. This year we have had a very cold winter and this skin cream, along with the use of Dead Sea Vitamin Facial Serum with Vitamin E and C kept my face from chaffing.</li>
