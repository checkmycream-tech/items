            <li>I really liked this product</li>
            <li>kind of clumps</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it was a nice introduction to flock, but I think it was overpriced for the quality, shipping time, colors, and amount.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and work very well!</li>
            <li>Great fun and novelty.</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing and the power itself it\s great, but there isn&#x27;t as much as you think.</li>
            <li>But all in all it looks great on the first day.</li>
            <li>This is so cute.</li>
            <li>This product is more a of a &#x27;one night out on the town&#x27; use.</li>
            <li>better off going to Bornprettystore.com</li>
            <li>Not a problem for me since it&#x27;s one of my favorite colors and the color nail polish I wear often.</li>
            <li>This made for adorable nail art.</li>
            <li>If you feel adventurous I would suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;m able to get an idea of each color and</li>
            <li>We love to play with all these colors.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered the flocking powder</li>
            <li>Once I got a feel for how to apply it I was able to make some really cute designs.</li>
            <li>Just Love It...</li>
            <li>They are filled all the way up!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>So many colors come in the set.  </li>
            <li>daughter is very excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>It is good for me because this will be my first time using flocking powder</li>
            <li>These are wonderful, they are super fun to work with, and they make things very velvety!</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>Good for a party but normally day after most of the velvet has rubbed off but this applies to any not just these.</li>
            <li>but after my first use I fell in LOVE!</li>
            <li>Looks Cool!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply onto the nail.</li>
            <li>I found this video very helpful to learn how to apply and very cute and easy nail designs.</li>
            <li>I bought these for accent nails rather than full manicures, so I&#x27;m more than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i orded 2 of these and only got 1 that was a waist of my money and it did not make me happy</li>
            <li>Makes nail art a lot more fun.</li>
            <li>Containers were smaller than I though,but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li>And the containers were filled .</li>
            <li>The ones in the pics are nice and full and mine  were nowhere near full or halfway full!</li>
            <li>Clean and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li>It looked great when i first applied, but didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>but you WILL need to buy 2 sets to do a full set of 10 nails.</li>
            <li>fast delivery love it</li>
            <li>Considering the price (2.11 with free shipping when I bought), I believe it is still worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall, fairly good quality flocking powder...especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The velvet colors are really nice and alive.</li>
            <li>Some are full</li>
            <li>It is easy to find a nail polish with those colors.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are vibrants and pretty.</li>
            <li>Came to me fairly quickly, considering that it was coming from China.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>It works exactly how i was hoping it would!</li>
            <li>I knocked off 2/5 stars for lack of filled jars, and added one back for the simple fact that the price is great</li>
            <li>I really liked this flocking powder, Im totally recommending this to my friends.</li>
            <li>price was right....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s easy to use and it creates a soft and fuzzy nail!</li>
            <li>This flocking powder is a great addition to add into your nail polish collection, but you might have to touch up your flocking powder by adding more later on, because it might come off a little bit.</li>
            <li>I know this product did not cost that much, but I just would have liked to have seen a little more product in each container.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty much worth</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Looks better in one solid color or stripes.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the product is exactly what it states.</li>
            <li>I think the packaging cost more than the actual product!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work with all to coats, but it is pretty.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and like the fact that it looks like each pot has some glitter mixed in with the powder.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking to decorate lots of different colored small things, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li>I wish it were bigger and has more velvet flocking powder on</li>
            <li>It starts to wear away after like the first day, and 2.)</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes a long time, but it&#x27;s absolutely 100% worth every penny because you&#x27;re not spending that many pennies</li>
            <li>The other colors were the same way, varying in amount from 1/4 full to 2/3 full being the most full jar.</li>
            <li>and they loved it as well especially the younger ones.</li>
            <li>but if you want to cover a large area, i would suggest getting something else.</li>
            <li>Theyre soo vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li>For the price I do believe it was a great buy especially since I have a tendency to do my nails just about everyday.</li>
            <li>I really like this powder.</li>
            <li>jars came and none of them were filled to the same point...</li>
            <li>Will enjoy using on the nails and especially like the colors.</li>
            <li>and I did not want to pay much for a product I was going to learn on.</li>
            <li>shipped fast....</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>But you don&#x27;t really need too much</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I saw a youtube video on using flocking powder and  really wanted to buy it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the invention.</li>
            <li>Something unique and different for the winter</li>
            <li>You MIGHT be able to do one nail look with each other though.</li>
            <li>The plastic container the flocking powder containers came in was cracked in more than a few places but the actual flocking powder was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something cool and different for your nails</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this again due to the awesome price, BUT I&#x27;m opting out for a more expensive set with bigger/fuller containers.</li>
            <li>Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>It sticks to the wet polish like a charm and leaves a very fuzzy, fun effect!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a little more than 1/8\\</li>
            <li>I was glad to see such a large variety of colors for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Shipping took about 4 weeks from China to New England, US.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for new nail design ideas</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone, whether you&#x27;re a pro or just like trying new things with your nails like me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different kind</li>
            <li>Minus 1/2 star because colors did not match the picture...which saddened me because I bought this specifically wanting that gorgeously bright green (though if you look, that is stated in the description), and minus 1/2 star because not all of the jars were filled completely.</li>
            <li>Used this recently on some friends and after the first hand wash it didn&#x27;t look flocked anymore.</li>
            <li>The cases are quite small but this is also a cheap product!</li>
            <li>Your nails feel like a soft teddy bear!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy from them again, but it did get me interested enough in velvet textures on nails that I would definitely buy flock from other companies that offer better colors and shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One can was enough to do a full set of short to medium/\\&quot;semi-long\\&quot;-length nails twice for me.</li>
            <li>SO SOFT</li>
            <li>It came in today and it came in today and it came in 3 weeks early and it makes my nails so fuzzy I would recommend and order this product again</li>
            <li>how much product you actually get in each container.</li>
            <li>Like Wow...</li>
            <li>This flocking powder arrived early but wasn&#x27;t velvet like I had hoped..</li>
            <li>The excess brushed off well without too much static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve had some time to use a few colors of the flocking powder and have found that the amount given is actually more sufficient than I initially thought.</li>
            <li>The black is about 1/3 of the way full.</li>
            <li>After the first day it starts to look dingy especially the white.</li>
            <li>That ruins the fluff :3</li>
            <li>Additionally, the containers will more than likely be too small for you to simply stick your nail into in hopes of a complete and</li>
            <li>I had enough for all ten of my shorter nails, but there isn&#x27;t enough left to do another full set.</li>
            <li>clumps up, hard to apply, won&#x27;t spread like glitter, looks like cheap lint with some coloring.....</li>
            <li>Ahhhhhh, lol maybe I had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li>first off it arrived today about 2 weeks earlier than expected, I got all the colors in the picture except for orange.</li>
            <li>I like the product a lot,the only thing I can say negative about them is some of the containers are not even halfway full!</li>
            <li>The size is super small so don&#x27;t expect to have alot when you recieve it.</li>
            <li>The dark green is pretty much gone in mine...</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll get full jars.</li>
            <li>You can wash your hands as normal and when the fluff dries it goes back to the way it was.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It starts to wear away after like the first day, and 2.)</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a long time, but it&#x27;s absolutely 100% worth every penny because you&#x27;re not spending that many pennies</li>
            <li> The other colors were the same way, varying in amount from 1/4 full to 2/3 full being the most full jar.</li>
            <li> and they loved it as well especially the younger ones.</li>
            <li> but if you want to cover a large area, i would suggest getting something else.</li>
            <li> Theyre soo vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li> For the price I do believe it was a great buy especially since I have a tendency to do my nails just about everyday.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder.</li>
            <li> jars came and none of them were filled to the same point...</li>
            <li> Will enjoy using on the nails and especially like the colors.</li>
            <li> and I did not want to pay much for a product I was going to learn on.</li>
            <li> shipped fast....</li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> But you don&#x27;t really need too much</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I saw a youtube video on using flocking powder and  really wanted to buy it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the invention.</li>
            <li> Something unique and different for the winter</li>
            <li> You MIGHT be able to do one nail look with each other though.</li>
            <li> The plastic container the flocking powder containers came in was cracked in more than a few places but the actual flocking powder was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something cool and different for your nails</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this again due to the awesome price, BUT I&#x27;m opting out for a more expensive set with bigger/fuller containers.</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> It sticks to the wet polish like a charm and leaves a very fuzzy, fun effect!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little more than 1/8\\</li>
            <li> I was glad to see such a large variety of colors for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Shipping took about 4 weeks from China to New England, US.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new nail design ideas</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone, whether you&#x27;re a pro or just like trying new things with your nails like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different kind</li>
            <li> Minus 1/2 star because colors did not match the picture...which saddened me because I bought this specifically wanting that gorgeously bright green (though if you look, that is stated in the description), and minus 1/2 star because not all of the jars were filled completely.</li>
            <li> Used this recently on some friends and after the first hand wash it didn&#x27;t look flocked anymore.</li>
            <li> The cases are quite small but this is also a cheap product!</li>
            <li> Your nails feel like a soft teddy bear!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy from them again, but it did get me interested enough in velvet textures on nails that I would definitely buy flock from other companies that offer better colors and shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One can was enough to do a full set of short to medium/\\&quot;semi-long\\&quot;-length nails twice for me.</li>
            <li> SO SOFT</li>
            <li> It came in today and it came in today and it came in 3 weeks early and it makes my nails so fuzzy I would recommend and order this product again</li>
            <li> how much product you actually get in each container.</li>
            <li> Like Wow...</li>
            <li> This flocking powder arrived early but wasn&#x27;t velvet like I had hoped..</li>
            <li> The excess brushed off well without too much static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve had some time to use a few colors of the flocking powder and have found that the amount given is actually more sufficient than I initially thought.</li>
            <li> The black is about 1/3 of the way full.</li>
            <li> After the first day it starts to look dingy especially the white.</li>
            <li> That ruins the fluff :3</li>
            <li> Additionally, the containers will more than likely be too small for you to simply stick your nail into in hopes of a complete and</li>
            <li> I had enough for all ten of my shorter nails, but there isn&#x27;t enough left to do another full set.</li>
            <li> clumps up, hard to apply, won&#x27;t spread like glitter, looks like cheap lint with some coloring.....</li>
            <li> Ahhhhhh, lol maybe I had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> first off it arrived today about 2 weeks earlier than expected, I got all the colors in the picture except for orange.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot,the only thing I can say negative about them is some of the containers are not even halfway full!</li>
            <li> The size is super small so don&#x27;t expect to have alot when you recieve it.</li>
            <li> The dark green is pretty much gone in mine...</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll get full jars.</li>
            <li> You can wash your hands as normal and when the fluff dries it goes back to the way it was.</li>
            <li> The only minor problems are:</li>
            <li> Flock doesn&#x27;t last long on nail, but may be because you can&#x27;t resist feeling the texture on your nails.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it lasts only a couple of days, but that was expected</li>
            <li> &quot; deep (the container is deceptively bigger, but the bottom of each container is concave into about half the display size of the container).</li>
            <li> it comes in tiny tiny containers and some of them are half filled which was a big disappointment</li>
            <li> I always use it in just one nail with other with a similar color.</li>
            <li> the only problem you can eat hand foods with these without the powder falling off but other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking a star away because each little pot only holds enough for one hand of velvety nails.</li>
            <li> tomato red (has a strong hint of orange), yellow, very dark purple, very dark brown, dark lavender, green (like photo), fuscia (like photo), pink (not like any in the photo, but a perky pastel pink), orange (similar to photo), beige, and very dark</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only enough for a few uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like lint in little tins, It shows it as &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;velvety&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s just gross.</li>
            <li> Not much in containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minus 1/2</li>
            <li> Only major setback that has also been mentioned was that you don&#x27;t get much--about half to 3/4ths of the little inch-wide, half-inch thick cans.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of the lighter colored ones as they tend to get make-up and other products you may use embedded in it.</li>
            <li> , it comes with a little bit, but a little goes a long way with this stuff</li>
            <li> Velvet not worth it.</li>
            <li> The colors I received were black,</li>
            <li> Rubs off in a few hours</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay fluffy and some of it comes off.</li>
            <li> But The Little Containers Are Really Small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an extremely small amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the colors you receive are randomized,</li>
            <li> Has all the colors shown, but the containers are small.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> This product comes in a small box about 3.5\\&quot;X5\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> All of the excess just brushes off with out any real mess.</li>
            <li> Like the product, BUT it&#x27;s very small that you get</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yes, it takes a long time, but it&#x27;s absolutely 100% worth every penny because you&#x27;re not spending that many pennies LOL! Good quality, nice colors, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This flocking powder is a great addition to add into your nail polish collection, but you might have to touch up your flocking powder by adding more later on, because it might come off a little bit. Besides that, I love this!</li>
            <li> I always use it in just one nail with other with a similar color. It is easy to find a nail polish with those colors.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are vibrants and pretty.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for but you WILL need to buy 2 sets to do a full set of 10 nails. Beautiful colors also!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> fast delivery love it</li>
            <li> Used this recently on some friends and after the first hand wash it didn&#x27;t look flocked anymore. It looked great when i first applied, but didn&#x27;t last. Would not repurchase</li>
            <li> clumps up, hard to apply, won&#x27;t spread like glitter, looks like cheap lint with some coloring.....yup, it&#x27;s lint</li>
            <li> This is so cute. If you are looking for something cool and different for your nails this is it. Also great customer service.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be and it had no instructions either. I keep trying to figure it out.</li>
            <li> Something unique and different for the winter I like you for my pointy nails</li>
            <li> This product is more a of a &#x27;one night out on the town&#x27; use. It&#x27;s got an amazing feel. Looks better in one solid color or stripes. I tried doing a Superman design. Didn&#x27;t turn out so well. After the first day it starts to look dingy especially the white. For the price I do believe it was a great buy especially since I have a tendency to do my nails just about everyday. I did receive it in the time I was told.</li>
            <li> Like the product, BUT it&#x27;s very small that you get</li>
            <li> This is something very different. I really like this powder. This was my first time using this product. I had never seen it on anyone nailes before. I find myself uising this alot...</li>
            <li> Nice bright colors. Good for a party but normally day after most of the velvet has rubbed off but this applies to any not just these. I&#x27;ve used a few different kind and they all wash off. I guess as  you wash hands and do stuff. But all in all it looks great on the first day. I would still buy.</li>
            <li> The cases are quite small but this is also a cheap product! The colors are beautiful and work very well!</li>
            <li> The colors were cute and very bright, but it ended up making my fingers itch! Then I touched me face! Ahhhhhh, lol maybe I had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough powder in the container. There&#x27;s only enough for a few uses. better off going to Bornprettystore.com</li>
            <li> I bought these a while ago because the price was just TOO good. The flocking powder is awesome. Its...well...flocking powder. It sticks to the wet polish like a charm and leaves a very fuzzy, fun effect! HOWEVER!!&lt;br /&gt;My jars came and none of them were filled to the same point...The dark green is pretty much gone in mine...there is only about 1/4 of flocking powder in that color. The black is about 1/3 of the way full. The other colors were the same way, varying in amount from 1/4 full to 2/3 full being the most full jar. Considering the price (2.11 with free shipping when I bought), I believe it is still worth it. You MIGHT be able to do one nail look with each other though. So I would recommend purchasing two of these at a time...I knocked off 2/5 stars for lack of filled jars, and added one back for the simple fact that the price is great and I got no repeats.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors and nice powder the only problem you can eat hand foods with these without the powder falling off but other than that yay!</li>
            <li> I know this product did not cost that much, but I just would have liked to have seen a little more product in each container.  Otherwise, the product is exactly what it states. It does feel like felt in a powder form. SO SOFT</li>
            <li> It came in today and it came in today and it came in 3 weeks early and it makes my nails so fuzzy I would recommend and order this product again</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot,the only thing I can say negative about them is some of the containers are not even halfway full! The ones in the pics are nice and full and mine  were nowhere near full or halfway full!</li>
            <li> I realize you get what you pay for but maybe put in the description how much product you actually get in each container. It&#x27;s an extremely small amount. I think the packaging cost more than the actual product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work with all to coats, but it is pretty.</li>
            <li> Shipping took about 4 weeks from China to New England, US. The plastic container the flocking powder containers came in was cracked in more than a few places but the actual flocking powder was perfectly fine. Only major setback that has also been mentioned was that you don&#x27;t get much--about half to 3/4ths of the little inch-wide, half-inch thick cans. Each can should hold enough for very short nails on one hand with probably another nail or two to spare--that&#x27;s it. Additionally, the containers will more than likely be too small for you to simply stick your nail into in hopes of a complete and even coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the colors you receive are randomized, but my package came with all the colors pictured except the maroon, which seems to had been replaced with turquoise. Not a problem for me since it&#x27;s one of my favorite colors and the color nail polish I wear often. Decent product for the price. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty much worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve had some time to use a few colors of the flocking powder and have found that the amount given is actually more sufficient than I initially thought. One can was enough to do a full set of short to medium/\\&quot;semi-long\\&quot;-length nails twice for me.</li>
            <li> This made for adorable nail art. If you feel adventurous I would suggest you give this a try. You can wash your hands as normal and when the fluff dries it goes back to the way it was. I was not a fan of the lighter colored ones as they tend to get make-up and other products you may use embedded in it.</li>
            <li> I like the flocking powder.  I love the colors and like the fact that it looks like each pot has some glitter mixed in with the powder.  Will enjoy using on the nails and especially like the colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking a star away because each little pot only holds enough for one hand of velvety nails. I bought these for accent nails rather than full manicures, so I&#x27;m more than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s easy to use and it creates a soft and fuzzy nail! Very cool.</li>
            <li> i orded 2 of these and only got 1 that was a waist of my money and it did not make me happy</li>
            <li> It is a good set. Has all the colors shown, but the containers are small. It is good for me because this will be my first time using flocking powder and I did not want to pay much for a product I was going to learn on. I really liked this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not much in containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CO</li>
            <li> first off it arrived today about 2 weeks earlier than expected, I got all the colors in the picture except for orange. Theyre soo vibrant and pretty. VERY good for the price!!</li>
            <li> The Powder Is Sorta Hart To Put On But They Look Good! (If You Did It Correct) Also It Gives A Nice Texture To Your Nails. But The Little Containers Are Really Small.</li>
            <li> shipped fast.... price was right.... daughter is very excited to try it out. Since we haven&#x27;t used it yet... I can&#x27;t give my opinion on the product but I can on the seller. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> it comes in tiny tiny containers and some of them are half filled which was a big disappointment, I used them for a photoshoot on my lips and it did the job but it takes forever to get here</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, they are super fun to work with, and they make things very velvety! The only minor problems are: The colors are not the same as those in the pictures, and they are tiny. But both of those were said in the description! Also very cheap, you get what you pay for! So if you are looking to decorate lots of different colored small things, they are wonderful! but if you want to cover a large area, i would suggest getting something else.</li>
            <li> WORKED FOR WHAT I NEEDED IT FOR. THANKS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new nail design ideas &amp; I get a lot of compliments with this look. I &#x27;m able to get an idea of each color and the price was under $7! The only problem is that it lasts only a couple of days, but that was expected</li>
            <li> Overall, fairly good quality flocking powder...especially for the price. I was glad to see such a large variety of colors for such a low price. Came to me fairly quickly, considering that it was coming from China. Minus 1/2 star because colors did not match the picture...which saddened me because I bought this specifically wanting that gorgeously bright green (though if you look, that is stated in the description), and minus 1/2 star because not all of the jars were filled completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like lint in little tins, It shows it as &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;velvety&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s just gross. Very disappointed... I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everybody! The velvet colors are really nice and alive. I really liked this product</li>
            <li> Great fun and novelty. We love to play with all these colors. Flock doesn&#x27;t last long on nail, but may be because you can&#x27;t resist feeling the texture on your nails.</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing and the power itself it\s great, but there isn&#x27;t as much as you think. But you don&#x27;t really need too much</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a bigger quantity</li>
            <li> Love this product and for the price! Thanks</li>
            <li> I saw a youtube video on using flocking powder and  really wanted to buy it. The shipping was quick. DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED BY THE PICTURE!!! These containers are tiny! I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> Ever since watching a nail tutorial using this stuff i have wanted it. It works exactly how i was hoping it would! All of the excess just brushes off with out any real mess. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the flocking powder and this was just perfect. The size is super small so don&#x27;t expect to have alot when you recieve it.</li>
            <li> Items were just as pictured and the product worked excellently on my nails! Will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I wish it were bigger and has more velvet flocking powder on it cause it great when you want to do a design with it on the nail salon or a home</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered the flocking powder but after my first use I fell in LOVE! Your nails feel like a soft teddy bear! All my nieces (ages 5-25) begged me to do their nails and they loved it as well especially the younger ones. Once I got a feel for how to apply it I was able to make some really cute designs. I recommend this for anyone, whether you&#x27;re a pro or just like trying new things with your nails like me. Very happy with my flocking powder and can&#x27;t wait to get more colors!</li>
            <li> Just Love It... I just placed an order for ASAP! I can&#x27;t wait until it arrives so that I can decorate my nails. Thanks for the invention. Looks Cool! Like Wow...</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today and they look good. They are filled all the way up! i have not used it yet!</li>
            <li> I really liked this flocking powder, Im totally recommending this to my friends. This product is easy to apply. Makes nail art a lot more fun.</li>
            <li> ~Goes on easy&lt;br /&gt;~LOVE the colors&lt;br /&gt;~yes, it comes with a little bit, but a little goes a long way with this stuff&lt;br /&gt;~it kind of clumps, so I recommend sort-of kneading it before use to prevent clumps&lt;br /&gt;~time consuming, but it shows up great!&lt;br /&gt;~DO NOT SEAL IN WITH A TOPCOAT! That ruins the fluff :3</li>
            <li> Received the same amount as in the picture but the colors shown in the picture were not the same as the colors I received</li>
            <li> Velvet not worth it. Rubs off in a few hours</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. So many colors come in the set.  I did each hand in one color and still had quite a bit left in the container.  Wish I could figure out a way to make it last longer on my nails.</li>
            <li> Good but it doesn&#x27;t stay fluffy and some of it comes off.</li>
            <li> Containers were smaller than I though,but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> This flocking powder arrived early but wasn&#x27;t velvet like I had hoped.. It has like strips of glitter or something. Just not the look I was hoping for. I tried it once and have not used again.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this product 4 out of 5 was 1.) It starts to wear away after like the first day, and 2.) Because the containers were really tiny. I had enough for all ten of my shorter nails, but there isn&#x27;t enough left to do another full set. I would definitely purchase this again due to the awesome price, BUT I&#x27;m opting out for a more expensive set with bigger/fuller containers.</li>
            <li> Clean and neatly packaged. And the containers were filled . Nit to mention the beautiful colors</li>
            <li> I have gotten a lot of compliments from everyone. It is easy to apply onto the nail. I found this video very helpful to learn how to apply and very cute and easy nail designs. [...]</li>
            <li> This product comes in a small box about 3.5\\&quot;X5\\&quot;. Each container is an 1\\&quot; in diameter and it&#x27;s a little more than 1/8\\&quot; deep (the container is deceptively bigger, but the bottom of each container is concave into about half the display size of the container). That doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll get full jars. Some are full some are 3/4 full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors aren&#x27;t the same as in the photo. The colors I received were black, tomato red (has a strong hint of orange), yellow, very dark purple, very dark brown, dark lavender, green (like photo), fuscia (like photo), pink (not like any in the photo, but a perky pastel pink), orange (similar to photo), beige, and very dark maroon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flock applies well and some of the spindles are shiny giving the perception of a glittery appearance to the flock. The excess brushed off well without too much static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a nice introduction to flock, but I think it was overpriced for the quality, shipping time, colors, and amount. I wouldn&#x27;t buy from them again, but it did get me interested enough in velvet textures on nails that I would definitely buy flock from other companies that offer better colors and shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus 1 star for the colors that don&#x27;t match what&#x27;s in the photo. Minus 1/2 a star for shipping time and 1/2 a star for quality.</li>
