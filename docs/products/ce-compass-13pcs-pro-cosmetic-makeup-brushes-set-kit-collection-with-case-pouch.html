            <li> These brushes are very nice and soft. As a beginner I did which that they came stating which brush was for what. I guess I&#x27;ll have to research and figure it out myself. Other than that these brushes are very nice</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because they were cheap and I wanted an entire set, but I should&#x27;ve just spent the money on something better. The hairs on them are very rough and shed very easily on the larger brushes. I probably only use about 3 brushes from this set still, and only because I don&#x27;t have a replacement for them yet. I would not recommend these, it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my 12 year old niece.  She wanted to learn how to do makeup so her mom and I agreed she needed to learn the correct way with the correct supplies.  She loves this brush set, she has learned how to do her makeup perfectly and evenly.  Not the most expensive set out there but great starter set or a great set to use for the beginner to intermediate make-up artist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s not the best or worst set. For what you pay for it, it&#x27;s worth the price. If you expect something that will last forever, though, I wouldn&#x27;t hold your breath. It makes a good starter kit.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. It&#x27;s perfect for eyes. To make it perfect for face, (I&#x27;m not fond of the 2 large brushes) I replaced one of the large brushes with a contour/blush brush, and along with my Kabuki brush &amp; small concealer brush, I have a perfect set that I paid next to nothing for. They don&#x27;t lose hair and wash well - which you&#x27;ll need to do as they do have that manufactured odor to them. They pick up product very well, and are not too sparse nor too thick. This set is better than a set I paid $45 for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all . All the heads have fallen off , and id figured it have more better quality it feels so cheap and useless . Good for someone of the age 12 or 13 and does a slumber party or something .</li>
            <li> Very excited when I got it,brushes can be used for almost anything</li>
            <li> Great product ... keep up the good work</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> The brushes came earlier than they were supposed to which was great! The brushes felt very soft. However they did have a strong scent to them , which i took care of by just washing them with brush cleaner and allowing them to dry. The pouch that held the brushes had the same scent which i&#x27;m trying to get rid of. Overall they are great brushes for the price. Check out there website to figure out which brush is which :)</li>
