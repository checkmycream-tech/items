    <ol>
            <li>am really impressed.</li>
            <li>The hair is wonderful!</li>
            <li>it great.  </li>
            <li>It holds a curl greatly.  </li>
            <li>GREAT</li>
            <li>Great quality, 3 bundles haven&#x27;t installed yet but will dye today.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I love the way this hair looks is feel real good curl</li>
            <li>so thats a good service.</li>
            <li>It did seem like it was 16&amp;#34; or 14&amp;#34; but the hair is good</li>
            <li>She was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait love love love it, and the price was excellent as well</li>
            <li>Hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought 6 bundles 3 for my daughter hair and 3 for my own hair.</li>
            <li>The bundles were a nice size as well</li>
            <li>Nice product though.</li>
            <li>The hair was very beautiful and had a natural shine to it.</li>
            <li>this is my best hair, i would surely buy more and highly recommend this hair.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li>The volume and bounce was surprising being that the hair was fairly cheap compared to most.</li>
            <li>It does not shred, it looks really good and so full.</li>
            <li>I can say however that I am 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li>After installing the hair I died it one more time to get it darker.  </li>
            <li>It was an ok buy</li>
            <li>I love this hair.</li>
            <li>The quality is okay</li>
            <li>I must say however, I am in love.</li>
            <li>but it was better than pack hair so if your looking for something cheapish and don&#x27;t plan to use for longer than a month it could work for you.</li>
            <li>Its okay for the price.</li>
            <li>3 bundles of it is enuf for even a bid headerd person as it is very full...</li>
            <li>I love my hair and have received many compliments on how good it looks and how soft it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft doesn&#x27;t tangle and a good price will plan to purchase more maybe in a longer length :)</li>
            <li>People have commented that it is very much like her own hair and that has been gratifying for her.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the hair is great, it soft and full, its is 3pcs as described.</li>
            <li>the comb runs through smoothly.</li>
            <li>I guess when something is this cheap, it comes with the territory.</li>
            <li>the hair looks exactly like the picture, i am satisfied with my package.</li>
            <li>This hair sucks, I brought it because all the reviews were good besides one and the price was great only $111, but I should of known it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>The hair came in an adequate time frame.  </li>
            <li>I received the hair about 4 weeks earlier and the hair feels really nice.</li>
            <li>but I love the hair so far.</li>
            <li>Its just worth the price.</li>
            <li>This hair looked great upon arrival but the moment it was installed it started matting up and tangling and became incredibly stiff almost dread-like.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and cheaper than alot of other suppliers and the quality is great.</li>
            <li>and I was able to complete my whole head with the 3 bundles.</li>
            <li>Very soft, and tangle free.</li>
            <li>If you take curl rods and roll the hair for at least 30mins you will have a great hair style.  </li>
            <li>its is really soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>but, my daughter is getting her&#x27;s hair done first.</li>
            <li>Its just exactly as the pictures is.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it everyone on work and at  complimented me about it.</li>
            <li>2 of the bundles were okay, one was dry.  </li>
            <li>it gets really  tangled</li>
            <li>The hair is soft &amp;&amp; well worth it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s tangles most virgin hair you can wash &amp; it goes back to its natural state</li>
            <li>When I first opened up the package I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through the hair, it is beyond soft.  </li>
            <li>After plating a full head i still have left with a piece.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Let me tell you guys about this hair, it&#x27;s of an AMAZING quality, the hair does not  shed, it was delivered way before the expected date, I would definitely purchase again,</li>
            <li>my money also send me some new hair</li>
            <li>When fixed it clashed with my hair color that it was apparent that it was not my real hair.</li>
            <li>It was a beautiful grade of brown hair with random strands of blonde through out.  </li>
            <li>I gave it for stars because it does get tangled a lot with a little bit of shedding which all hair does but my next purchase will be longer inches because this hair is overall nice</li>
            <li>very easilyit makes my expectationsother definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll need less than the two bundles for full install.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t become as dark as I wanted it to become but that is more likely due to me rushing to do it before work.</li>
            <li>I have bought human hair and the difference was really clear.</li>
            <li>At first I was scared to buy this product due to the mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping but not exactly the color I wanted.</li>
            <li>I colored this hair a natural black color by a professional stylist and the curl patterned loosened up by maybe 25%.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I just received the hair and the bundles are a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY BIG FAT WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> During install I had my stylist flat iron it and give me a little curl in the end.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost at all.</li>
            <li> but I do know you are better off just going to the beauty supply store instead of buying this crap</li>
            <li> I had put a review up before talking about the hair but the seller had contacted me begging me to take it down</li>
            <li> so after a week and a half my hair kept matting up.</li>
            <li> I used very little product with this hair and not much heat either.</li>
            <li> but it is too little bit.</li>
            <li> the ends are nappy after a few days.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> the previous hair i had was difficult to comb in the morning or later in the day.</li>
            <li> I have very little shedding now</li>
            <li> so i m not sure about the shredding</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> This product came on time and has thick bundles.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I used the bad bundle in the middle</li>
            <li> it sheds horrible tangles allooootttt and doesn&#x27;t stay straight</li>
            <li> This is by far worst than beauty supply store hair.</li>
            <li> I took a risk and randomly brought it after just reading three reviews on it.</li>
            <li> Quite the disappointment</li>
            <li> it sheds so bad</li>
            <li> Like I can&#x27;t write another one I don&#x27;t know if I just got the bad batch or what</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fake hair doesn&#x27;t dye and gets knots horrible.</li>
            <li> the ends were split very bad</li>
            <li> This hair is the worst ever I would give it 0 stars DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just horrible!!!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> At first I was scared to buy this product due to the mixed reviews.  I can say however that I am 100% satisfied.  The hair came in an adequate time frame.  The quality of the hair it great.  It was a beautiful grade of brown hair with random strands of blonde through out.  When I first opened up the package I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers through the hair, it is beyond soft.  I died it black to match my natural hair color.  It didn&#x27;t become as dark as I wanted it to become but that is more likely due to me rushing to do it before work. After installing the hair I died it one more time to get it darker.  From the time I received the package to the 2nd die I had no shedding.  I have very little shedding now which I only feel is happening because I can&#x27;t keep my fingers out of my hair.  During install I had my stylist flat iron it and give me a little curl in the end.  It holds a curl greatly.  Once I had it flat iron I did not have to use heat for days.  If you take curl rods and roll the hair for at least 30mins you will have a great hair style.  Once I washed it (during the 2nd die) the wave pattern came back as it should have.  I love my hair and have received many compliments on how good it looks and how soft it is.</li>
            <li> This product came on time and has thick bundles.GREAT</li>
            <li> This hair is the worst ever I would give it 0 stars DO NOT BUY! it sheds so bad and it&#x27;s tangles most virgin hair you can wash &amp; it goes back to its natural state but not this hair it gets really  tangled please save your money and go else where</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair is great, it soft and full, its is 3pcs as described. Though i haven&#x27;t used it yet so i m not sure about the shredding so i will update my review after going to the hair dresser. The package came earlier than expected so thats a good service. the hair looks exactly like the picture, i am satisfied with my package. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update after weaving this hair.&lt;br /&gt;i finally found a day to have this hair weaved. its is really soft and tangle free. It does not shred, it looks really good and so full. After plating a full head i still have left with a piece.&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed. the comb runs through smoothly. the previous hair i had was difficult to comb in the morning or later in the day. it used to tangle esp under the hair on the back.&lt;br /&gt;But this is my best hair, i would surely buy more and highly recommend this hair.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> Great quality, 3 bundles haven&#x27;t installed yet but will dye today. I think I&#x27;ll need less than the two bundles for full install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I colored this hair a natural black color by a professional stylist and the curl patterned loosened up by maybe 25%. Day 2 after install with out the track being cut, there is alot of shedding no tangles.  Hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This hair sucks, I brought it because all the reviews were good besides one and the price was great only $111, but I should of known it was too good to be true. I had put a review up before talking about the hair but the seller had contacted me begging me to take it down, he or she promised they would re-fund my money also send me some new hair it was a SET UP so I&#x27;m writting another review because why lie? Like I can&#x27;t write another one I don&#x27;t know if I just got the bad batch or what but I do know you are better off just going to the beauty supply store instead of buying this crap it sheds horrible tangles allooootttt and doesn&#x27;t stay straight I had to cut all three bundles the ends were split very bad It&#x27;s just horrible!!!</li>
            <li> I just received the hair and the bundles are a bit smaller than I expected. But I will write an update once I install the hair</li>
            <li> We chose this hair because we thought it appeared to be similar to my daughter&#x27;s hair. People have commented that it is very much like her own hair and that has been gratifying for her.  Since her hair has only been in for about a month, I gave it four instead of five stars because we don&#x27;t know how well the hair will wear.&lt;br /&gt;Manassas, VA</li>
            <li> It did seem like it was 16&amp;#34; or 14&amp;#34; but the hair is good</li>
            <li> I received the hair about 4 weeks earlier and the hair feels really nice. I bought 6 bundles 3 for my daughter hair and 3 for my own hair. It looks like it&#x27;s enough for the both of use but, my daughter is getting her&#x27;s hair done first. I ordered the hair on Friday March 29th and received today April 2nd. When she gets her hair done I will post another review but I love the hair so far.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star. I tried dying the hair blonde,bleach, remove the color tried different products and colors.  NOTHING dyes the hair.This is a horrible product it&#x27;s fake hair doesn&#x27;t dye and gets knots horrible. I even have photos evidence. DO NOT BUY BIG FAT WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I love the way this hair looks is feel real good curl very easilyit makes my expectationsother definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Let me tell you guys about this hair, it&#x27;s of an AMAZING quality, the hair does not  shed, it was delivered way before the expected date, I would definitely purchase again, actually I was going to buy again but it was out of stock &amp;#34;sad face&amp;#34; so I would purchase again can&#x27;t wait love love love it, and the price was excellent as well</li>
            <li> The hair is wonderful! It&#x27;s soft doesn&#x27;t tangle and a good price will plan to purchase more maybe in a longer length :)</li>
            <li> The hair was very beautiful and had a natural shine to it. The color was spot on with no gray hairs. The volume and bounce was surprising being that the hair was fairly cheap compared to most. The bundles were a nice size as well and I was able to complete my whole head with the 3 bundles. I have had this hair installed for about 5 weeks now and it does shed quite a bit and tangles a lot as well. I used very little product with this hair and not much heat either. It was an ok buy but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but not exactly the color I wanted. When fixed it clashed with my hair color that it was apparent that it was not my real hair. It look synthetic and not real human hair. I guess when something is this cheap, it comes with the territory. I have bought human hair and the difference was really clear. Nice product though. Not sure if I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> This is by far worst than beauty supply store hair. It tangles,  sheds,  and the ends are nappy after a few days. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and I wouldn&#x27;t use this in my cheapest client&#x27;s hair. It did arrive on time, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair. Its just exactly as the pictures is. Very soft, and tangle free. 3 bundles of it is enuf for even a bid headerd person as it is very full...lol. Its just worth the price.</li>
            <li> I gave it for stars because it does get tangled a lot with a little bit of shedding which all hair does but my next purchase will be longer inches because this hair is overall nice and I would recommend it to anyone who knows about hair and can maintain it.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft &amp;&amp; well worth it. If it gets tangled or frizzy all you have to do is wash it, it&#x27;s back like &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.. (two thumbs up)</li>
            <li> The quality is okay but it is too little bit. Not worth the cost at all. Please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This weave is a must buy. I took a risk and randomly brought it after just reading three reviews on it. I must say however, I am in love. It came faster than the estimated date which was a plus for me. The first time I wore it everyone on work and at  complimented me about it. I took it out, bleached it and washed it and and put it back in and the quality did not change. I will advice others to buy it. The price is reasonable and cheaper than alot of other suppliers and the quality is great.</li>
            <li> She was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This hair looked great upon arrival but the moment it was installed it started matting up and tangling and became incredibly stiff almost dread-like. Within two weeks it was also shedding a lot. Quite the disappointment but it was better than pack hair so if your looking for something cheapish and don&#x27;t plan to use for longer than a month it could work for you. I however will not be purcashing again.</li>
            <li> 2 of the bundles were okay, one was dry.  I used 2 1/2 bundles unfortunately I used the bad bundle in the middle so after a week and a half my hair kept matting up. I cut the ends. It work, conditioned it that help. Its okay for the price. I suggest you deep condition before you put in.</li>
