            <li>It would be nice if Amazon made a link to manuals or details on all of their postings.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>product and ordered the Essence gladly.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for years and have used many types.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love them.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have dental benefits you better get one of these.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, very high speed with excellent handling characteristics.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed the quad pace feature available in most modells.  </li>
            <li>Other than the size we are very Happy with this Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works just fine.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel fantastic after brushing.</li>
            <li>This unit is so far superior to the unit I have now</li>
            <li>Despite the intense vibrations the Sonicare is very easy on the gumline.</li>
            <li>Great tooth brushes and hold a charge a long time.  </li>
            <li>On the first Sonicare I had the brush head lasted 6 months or more.  </li>
            <li>keep em clean both the product and the teeth.</li>
            <li>you do not know what clean teeth are unless you go to the dentist every day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight or the way it brushed even though it had the quad timer and was good for 120/240 current.  </li>
            <li>Now they have cheapened them so much you are lucky if you get 3 months use out of them.  </li>
            <li>I love the basic</li>
            <li>I would have paid more for that feature, and would have ordered a different model if I had known about this difference.  </li>
            <li>My dentist has commented numerous times about how much better my teeth look after using this product.  </li>
            <li>WAY better than brushing with a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare toothbrush but not my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I imagine it is because it has a battery that it is so large.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and could really use it.</li>
            <li>a phenomenal job of cleaning the teeth and gumline with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>teeth feel as clean as having just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Long lasting batteries, they clean well, easy to get used to from a normal, non-powered toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of surprised how big it was compared to the other one we had.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m in the market for a new one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that the very low pressure required to achieve a deep clean means the heads last much longer than advertised in my experience.</li>
            <li>Now they barely if ever bleed and it&#x27;s steadily improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 15 year old son even loves it.</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t realize it had a battery, or we might have ordered the other one that was a little more money.</li>
            <li>I found this one on Amazon and was going to give it to my grownup kids along with 3 extra brush heads I had bought before my old e series conked out.  </li>
            <li>It is not uncomfortable, just taking a little time to get used to the size.</li>

            <li> I bought one of the newer Sonic brushes, but did not like it&#x27;s light weight or the way it brushed even though it had the quad timer and was good for 120/240 current.  I found this one on Amazon and was going to give it to my grownup kids along with 3 extra brush heads I had bought before my old e series conked out.  I decided to keep these 2 for myself and I am really happy I did.  I love it.  It does not have the quad timer.  Wish they would make a model like this with quad timer and the ability to use in both 120/240 current.  I travel a lot and could really use it.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brushes and hold a charge a long time.  Only one base but we switch off in the morning after we brush our teeth.</li>
            <li> No bells and whistles.  Just a basic sonic toothbrush system that works.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product and I would recommend it to anyone.  On the downside I would prefer a larger brush.</li>
            <li> product and ordered the Essence gladly.  I have always enjoyed the quad pace feature available in most modells.  Unfortunately this basic model does not have the quad pace element.  Just a dissappointment.I have used Sonicare for years and have used many types.  I love the basic</li>
            <li> This unit is so far superior to the unit I have now I just ordered another set for my second home.  Very gentle, very high speed with excellent handling characteristics.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years and this is probably the last Sonicare I will buy.  It is heavy and bulky and not easy to turn off and on.  I have some arthritis in my thumb and find it very difficult to operate.  I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.  I did like the last one I had which beeped every 30 seconds and had a lighted gauge to alert you when it needed a charge.  On the first Sonicare I had the brush head lasted 6 months or more.  Now they have cheapened them so much you are lucky if you get 3 months use out of them.  I am not happy with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have worn out several Sonicare toothbrushes and I like them.  This model has a 2 minute timer, as do the others that I have purchased, however this specific model does not have the 30 second pauses that the others do.  I would have paid more for that feature, and would have ordered a different model if I had known about this difference.  There are quite a few different selections available, and it is often hard to find the specifications with the listing.  It would be nice if Amazon made a link to manuals or details on all of their postings.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Excellent price for what you get. My wife and I were both amazed by these toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does a phenomenal job of cleaning the teeth and gumline with minimal effort. Despite the intense vibrations the Sonicare is very easy on the gumline. Up until very recently when I got the deep cleaning I should have had done 15 years ago (I&#x27;m 31) my gums would bleed every time I brushed or heaven forbid flossed. Now they barely if ever bleed and it&#x27;s steadily improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel as clean as having just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is bulkier than your typical Oral B but isn&#x27;t cumbersome in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand is convenient and stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the replacement heads are expensive compared to other Sonicare models where generic heads are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that the very low pressure required to achieve a deep clean means the heads last much longer than advertised in my experience.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works just fine.  I was kind of surprised how big it was compared to the other one we had. I imagine it is because it has a battery that it is so large. It is not uncomfortable, just taking a little time to get used to the size. We didn&#x27;t realize it had a battery, or we might have ordered the other one that was a little more money. Maybe the battery will be helpful to keep it working longer don&#x27;t know yet. Could be an advantage. Other than the size we are very Happy with this Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Long lasting batteries, they clean well, easy to get used to from a normal, non-powered toothbrush.  We only need to charge them once a week or so.  My wife and I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a sonicare for about 4 years now, and only recently the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge so I&#x27;m in the market for a new one.  My dentist has commented numerous times about how much better my teeth look after using this product.  My severe tooth sensitivity has dimisished quite a bit (not totally gone though) and I&#x27;ve even dropped the $ to get brushes for my kids.  By the way, the beeping every 30 seconds is to notify you to move to a different part of your mouth.  So over the 2 minute timer you spend 30 seconds in each of the 4 parts of your teeth.  Totally recommend these.</li>
            <li> Very good and reliable product.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have dental benefits you better get one of these. WAY better than brushing with a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fantastic after brushing. this is a great product for anyone and everyone.  keep em clean both the product and the teeth.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare toothbrush but not my first electric toothbrush. If you do not own a sonicare you do not know what clean teeth are unless you go to the dentist every day. This is the less expensive sonicare the more expensive ones are supposed to be better... But I think this one is awesome what a difference. Before I tried sonicare I was convinced that it was all just a bunch of hype. Now I will never use anything but sonicare! My 15 year old son even loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Sonicare tooth brushes in the past. For the last year and a half I haven&#x27;t and my dental check up have shown it! This is a great buy for partners or kids to have 2 brushes for almost the price of one.</li>
