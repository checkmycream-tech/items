            <li>I love that you can mix your own custom masks or use straight from the jar with water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is 100% organic calcium bentonite clay,this product is finely milled into a flour texture.</li>
            <li>the skin and eliminates fine lines</li>
            <li>The product has a wonderfully fine and silky consistency.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with an organic apple cider vinegar since it seems to mix up more quickly than with water.</li>
            <li>The clay is easy to use, it works well with the seaweed powder to form a creamy and rich mixture.  </li>

            <li>Tightens sKin  leaves skin soft, good look to the skin.</li>
            <li>Since it has seaweed in the mixture, you may smell the kelp and it is kind of strong for some people though, but it is normal.  </li>

            <li>This makes a nice mask, feels good.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service by Natural Escentials!</li>
            <li>It tightens the skin and leaves it feeling so smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>I personally added some tea tree oil because it is good for acne.</li>
            <li>So, if that is true, this mask works well.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product next</li>
            <li>Product is great not just for beauty also useful for reducing pain due to inflammation from a sprang or even arthritis.</li>

            <li>Makes a noticeable difference the first time you use it!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and washes off easy leaving my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It revitalizes and promotes natural healthy skin.</li>
            <li>To remove the product, I got in the shower and simply washed it away with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would also make a nice present to add to a gift basket.</li>
            <li>This clay is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>We have also used this product as a clay facial mask to deep clean pores, and it has been great.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this about three weeks and already notice results, I am excited to see how much more my acne improves.&lt;br /&gt;-Sami</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I started using this around the first of the year and love the results so far.</li>
            <li>This Stuff is Awesome, makes my face smooth and its cold feels really tight as clay dries Love it!!</li>
            <li>Results come very fast</li>
            <li>and it left my face very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>so people like me could find it and get it at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Ok now back to the review</li>
            <li>To reduce that smell, I put in some coffee grinds and since coffee grind can be used as part of the mask mixture, it works out pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using a face mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first step to use this product is to put some of the powder into a bowl and add water and mix well.</li>
            <li>it is not gritty in tooth powder either--no more than baking soda.</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied with product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>My celly jelly definitely minimized after my first use so I am definitely pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used any other Indian Healing Clay, but I have tried those popular squeeze tube clay masks.</li>
            <li>I feel so fresh when I wash the clay away and look at my new skin!</li>
            <li>If you have trouble taking it off just treat yourself to a nice hot towel, it should wipe right off.</li>
            <li>That reaction was so unexpected and amazing that I definitely will be using this again and again.</li>
            <li>This clay is highly effective at detoxifying the skin and promoting overall natural beauty and health.</li>
            <li>First off let me tell you the seller contacted me twice with instructions on what can be added to make certain face cleaners.</li>
            <li>but I used a paper towel to get off the chunks and the rest washed down nicely.  </li>
            <li>The directions are easy to follow: Simply mix the detoxing indian healing clay with water and stir to create a mud texture.</li>
            <li>It is easy to mix and simple to use.</li>
            <li>You definitely want to be gentle and use plenty of water when rinsing off, but this clay gives a fantastic deep clean!</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality clay mask.  </li>
            <li>wow my skin feels amazing , it is soft and clearer .It is a simple to use product ,</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any difference using this product.</li>
            <li>Theyll be their the whole way through.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and have breakouts and this stuff really helped me out.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend anyone using clay products to use this Indian Healing Clay!</li>
            <li>I gotta say, this mask is the REAL THING.</li>
            <li>Seller is very informmatve.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I would definitely order this product from Natural Escentials again :).</li>
            <li>It is 100% pure High Quality Clay</li>
            <li>The next step is to apply to your face and you also have an option to add your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li>had realistic expectations for this mask, so</li>
            <li>WOW, this clay performed better on my face than I expected.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to ecpect , but I will share a little bit of what I experienced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had facial masks done in salons and this product is just a good if not better .</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts like I normally would.</li>
            <li>I use just a little clay/seaweed powder mixed with warm water once a week.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Detoxifies the skin, keeping it young and vibrant</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the fact that it only has one ingredient as opposed to other masks that include toxins.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Benefits of Bentonite mud, some of them applying to the skin, others to hair and some generally for the whole body.</li>
            <li>It keeps me looking young and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>I was overcome by such a relaxed and peaceful feeling.  </li>
            <li>The problem i have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t form a smooth paste - sort of little clumps that i have to try and smear on my face.</li>
            <li>I used it once so far</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel so soft after using this</li>
            <li>I am nervous I might get moisture in the container, but so far it hasn&#x27;t&#x27; been a problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this clay mask twice so far.</li>
            <li>Using it on my face for twenty minutes,  made it feel really soft.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice all over my body and it really stung and reddened my arms, legs and back.</li>
            <li>Now lets talk about Natural Escentials.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>After putting the mixture on the face as a mask and allows it to dry-out, it gives you a cool, refresh and tight feeling.  </li>
            <li>After using a few times I noticed my skin was softer but also more dry.</li>
            <li>Of course, the body is exposed to a lot of toxins everyday, which makes it very important to use Bentonite clay and other detoxifiers part of our weekly or fortnightly routines.</li>
            <li>I felt like I could barely move my mouth by the end of the 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far to help reduce the appearance of cellulite and it actually worked!  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s so much more expensive than the other popular brand of Indian Healing Clay -- I haven&#x27;t used it to compare.</li>
            <li>It keeps my pores tight and clean, reduces redness, and so far it&#x27;s even helped my acne settle down.</li>
            <li>I have minor adult acne</li>
            <li>I removed it from my face, I felt that my face was smoot, clean (but not sure I like it removed all of the moisture from my face) , and no signs of my extremely dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>

            <li> Tightens sKin  leaves skin soft, good look to the skin.</li>
            <li> Since it has seaweed in the mixture, you may smell the kelp and it is kind of strong for some people though, but it is normal.  </li>

            <li> It tightens the skin and leaves it feeling so smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> I personally added some tea tree oil because it is good for acne.</li>
            <li> So, if that is true, this mask works well.</li>

            <li> This would also make a nice present to add to a gift basket.</li>
            <li> This clay is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> We have also used this product as a clay facial mask to deep clean pores, and it has been great.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this about three weeks and already notice results, I am excited to see how much more my acne improves.&lt;br /&gt;-Sami</li>
            <li> right</li>

            <li> so people like me could find it and get it at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Ok now back to the review</li>
            <li> To reduce that smell, I put in some coffee grinds and since coffee grind can be used as part of the mask mixture, it works out pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using a face mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first step to use this product is to put some of the powder into a bowl and add water and mix well.</li>
            <li> it is not gritty in tooth powder either--no more than baking soda.</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied with product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> My celly jelly definitely minimized after my first use so I am definitely pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other Indian Healing Clay, but I have tried those popular squeeze tube clay masks.</li>
            <li> I feel so fresh when I wash the clay away and look at my new skin!</li>
            <li> If you have trouble taking it off just treat yourself to a nice hot towel, it should wipe right off.</li>
            <li> That reaction was so unexpected and amazing that I definitely will be using this again and again.</li>
            <li> This clay is highly effective at detoxifying the skin and promoting overall natural beauty and health.</li>
            <li> First off let me tell you the seller contacted me twice with instructions on what can be added to make certain face cleaners.</li>
            <li> but I used a paper towel to get off the chunks and the rest washed down nicely.  </li>
            <li> The directions are easy to follow: Simply mix the detoxing indian healing clay with water and stir to create a mud texture.</li>
            <li> It is easy to mix and simple to use.</li>
            <li> You definitely want to be gentle and use plenty of water when rinsing off, but this clay gives a fantastic deep clean!</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality clay mask.  </li>
            <li> wow my skin feels amazing , it is soft and clearer .It is a simple to use product ,</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any difference using this product.</li>
            <li> Theyll be their the whole way through.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have breakouts and this stuff really helped me out.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend anyone using clay products to use this Indian Healing Clay!</li>
            <li> I gotta say, this mask is the REAL THING.</li>
            <li> Seller is very informmatve.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I would definitely order this product from Natural Escentials again :).</li>
            <li> It is 100% pure High Quality Clay</li>
            <li> The next step is to apply to your face and you also have an option to add your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> had realistic expectations for this mask, so</li>
            <li> WOW, this clay performed better on my face than I expected.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to ecpect , but I will share a little bit of what I experienced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had facial masks done in salons and this product is just a good if not better .</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts like I normally would.</li>
            <li> I use just a little clay/seaweed powder mixed with warm water once a week.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Detoxifies the skin, keeping it young and vibrant</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fact that it only has one ingredient as opposed to other masks that include toxins.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Benefits of Bentonite mud, some of them applying to the skin, others to hair and some generally for the whole body.</li>
            <li> It keeps me looking young and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> I was overcome by such a relaxed and peaceful feeling.  </li>
            <li> The problem i have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t form a smooth paste - sort of little clumps that i have to try and smear on my face.</li>
            <li> I used it once so far</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel so soft after using this</li>
            <li> I am nervous I might get moisture in the container, but so far it hasn&#x27;t&#x27; been a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this clay mask twice so far.</li>
            <li> Using it on my face for twenty minutes,  made it feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice all over my body and it really stung and reddened my arms, legs and back.</li>
            <li> Now lets talk about Natural Escentials.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> After putting the mixture on the face as a mask and allows it to dry-out, it gives you a cool, refresh and tight feeling.  </li>
            <li> After using a few times I noticed my skin was softer but also more dry.</li>
            <li> Of course, the body is exposed to a lot of toxins everyday, which makes it very important to use Bentonite clay and other detoxifiers part of our weekly or fortnightly routines.</li>
            <li> I felt like I could barely move my mouth by the end of the 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far to help reduce the appearance of cellulite and it actually worked!  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s so much more expensive than the other popular brand of Indian Healing Clay -- I haven&#x27;t used it to compare.</li>
            <li> It keeps my pores tight and clean, reduces redness, and so far it&#x27;s even helped my acne settle down.</li>
            <li> I have minor adult acne</li>
            <li> I removed it from my face, I felt that my face was smoot, clean (but not sure I like it removed all of the moisture from my face) , and no signs of my extremely dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had several pimples and after each mask they seem to be getting smaller and the black heads on my nose seem to disappear.</li>
            <li> I am a life long customer now!</li>
            <li> The clay mask does exactly what it says pulling out all the nasty stuff on your face leaving your face feeling clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> I also have some dry and oily patches and my skin has seemed to even out</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount when in use, so the container will last you for a long while.</li>
            <li> Feels like it makes a difference, this is a little hard to blend at first</li>
            <li> I have had clay masks in the past that always dried out before I could use the whole container.</li>
            <li> I use a small glass jar and a wooden popsicle stick (another reviewer mentioned a chopstick, but I like the flat side of the popsicle stick).</li>
            <li> When the mask comes off my face is a little red, so don&#x27;t plan to go out</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh scent, smells simply like clay.</li>
            <li> I use it to help soothe toothaches and recently brought some to cure skin infections for a few family and friends.  </li>
            <li> She is extremely helpful and informational.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with my first order (no fault of theirs) and I didnt plan on contacting them to let them know that I was unable to use the product since the packaging was compromised.  </li>
            <li> I let the mask dry then usually wash it off in the shower or bath.</li>
            <li> It does make a bit of a mess in the bottom of the shower</li>
            <li> the end of my 20 minutes, the mask was extremely tight.</li>
            <li> I heard from a friend that you know a mask is working well when it becomes tight.</li>
            <li> a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I just scoop out a little powder and add water until I like the consistency and add it to my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Indian healing clay for a few weeks</li>
            <li> and I notice a difference within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have used green clay forever</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this initially, because of the inconsistent clumping.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;a bit messy</li>
            <li> Using the stick to scoop a small amount into the jar I eyeball it then add a little ACV and stir, then use the stick to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magical; I still have whiteheads, unevenness, redness etc</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I leave it on thickly spread for about 45 minutes until it&#x27;s stiff and cracking.</li>
            <li> I use the clay: one spoon of powder, and then add raw Apple Cider Vinegar until the texture is creamy but thick.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on to long, it can become uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Discover the secret of ancient aztec indian healing clay.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a base for toothpaste and facial products.</li>
            <li> But it just makes my hair feels weird if I accidentally get some in my hair.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but IT STINKS really bad!!</li>

I have acne and this is great for me to get all  the toxins off my face so that it can breathe freely. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh scent, smells simply like clay. You only need a small amount when in use, so the container will last you for a long while. The directions are easy to follow: Simply mix the detoxing indian healing clay with water and stir to create a mud texture. After you have created your mud texture, then apply to skin and wait for 20 minutes, then wash off. I wash mine off with warm water so it comes off easier and doesn&#x27;t pull on my skin. I haven&#x27;t experienced nothing but good results with this clay.</li>

            <li> Great product! Your skin will feel so soft after using this</li>
            <li> I saw a recipe for a facial mask with bentonite clay and organic apple cider vinegar online and decided to try it out. This one looked like a good quality organic clay. I have minor adult acne so I started out by using this mask 4 times in the last week. So far I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with the results. I had several pimples and after each mask they seem to be getting smaller and the black heads on my nose seem to disappear. I also have some dry and oily patches and my skin has seemed to even out and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts like I normally would. I&#x27;m really excited to continue using this product and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Awesome mask! It tightens the skin and leaves it feeling so smooth and fresh. Believe me when I say that I&#x27;ve tried and it all and this is my favorite mask. I absolutely love the fact that it only has one ingredient as opposed to other masks that include toxins. I have oily skin and have breakouts and this stuff really helped me out. So I sincerely recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> The clay is easy to use, it works well with the seaweed powder to form a creamy and rich mixture.  After putting the mixture on the face as a mask and allows it to dry-out, it gives you a cool, refresh and tight feeling.  Since it has seaweed in the mixture, you may smell the kelp and it is kind of strong for some people though, but it is normal.  To reduce that smell, I put in some coffee grinds and since coffee grind can be used as part of the mask mixture, it works out pretty well for me.  I love it and hope you like it too!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using a face mask. I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to ecpect , but I will share a little bit of what I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step to use this product is to put some of the powder into a bowl and add water and mix well. The next step is to apply to your face and you also have an option to add your favorite essential oil. I personally added some tea tree oil because it is good for acne. The the next step is allowed it to stay on for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of my 20 minutes, the mask was extremely tight. I heard from a friend that you know a mask is working well when it becomes tight. So, if that is true, this mask works well. I felt like I could barely move my mouth by the end of the 20 minutes. To remove the product, I got in the shower and simply washed it away with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I removed it from my face, I felt that my face was smoot, clean (but not sure I like it removed all of the moisture from my face) , and no signs of my extremely dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it says and I&#x27;m glad that I received it for testing and reviewing purposes. I&#x27;ve shared my opinions with you and I hope that you try this product!</li>
            <li> This mask clay is awesome! I&#x27;ve been using it about once a week. I mix it with an organic apple cider vinegar since it seems to mix up more quickly than with water. I use a small glass jar and a wooden popsicle stick (another reviewer mentioned a chopstick, but I like the flat side of the popsicle stick). Using the stick to scoop a small amount into the jar I eyeball it then add a little ACV and stir, then use the stick to apply. Keeps your hands clean. I let the mask dry then usually wash it off in the shower or bath. You definitely want to be gentle and use plenty of water when rinsing off, but this clay gives a fantastic deep clean!</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin and removed excess toxins in my skin. Very easy to use and you will see the difference in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits of Bentonite mud, some of them applying to the skin, others to hair and some generally for the whole body. Most of the benefits apply and relate to detox and cleansing. Of course, the body is exposed to a lot of toxins everyday, which makes it very important to use Bentonite clay and other detoxifiers part of our weekly or fortnightly routines. So, what are the Bentonite clay mask benefits that you should know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prevents abscesses and skin blemishes&lt;br /&gt;Cleans and opens clogged facial pores&lt;br /&gt;The mask is beneficial in clearing pimples&lt;br /&gt;Tightens the skin and eliminates fine lines&lt;br /&gt;Detoxifies the skin, keeping it young and vibrant&lt;br /&gt;Another of the Bentonite clay mask benefits is to help with digestive disorders, if the mask is applied on the belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I feel so fresh when I wash the clay away and look at my new skin! It keeps me looking young and rejuvenated! This is some quality product too! No impurities and I can definitely feel a difference after using it! I would recommend to anyone needing a good scrub and detox!</li>
            <li> Works well with seaweed!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is 100% pure High Quality Clay and I would highly recommend anyone using clay products to use this Indian Healing Clay! Thank you so much for having this wonderful product on the market so people like me could find it and get it at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome idea. I have had clay masks in the past that always dried out before I could use the whole container. This one starts out as a powder, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it ever drying out. I am nervous I might get moisture in the container, but so far it hasn&#x27;t&#x27; been a problem. I just scoop out a little powder and add water until I like the consistency and add it to my face. It is earthy, but I like the smell and it feels very nice to smooth on. This would also make a nice present to add to a gift basket.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay i guess. The problem i have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t form a smooth paste - sort of little clumps that i have to try and smear on my face. does anyone have a better way of mixing so there are no lumps?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this clay mask twice so far. I&#x27;ve never used any other Indian Healing Clay, but I have tried those popular squeeze tube clay masks. I gotta say, this mask is the REAL THING. It&#x27;s everything I wanted from the beauty store tube masks (that they never delivered). It keeps my pores tight and clean, reduces redness, and so far it&#x27;s even helped my acne settle down. I can&#x27;t wait to see what continued use does to improve my skin. It&#x27;s not magical; I still have whiteheads, unevenness, redness etc but I do think it&#x27;s getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use the clay: one spoon of powder, and then add raw Apple Cider Vinegar until the texture is creamy but thick. I leave it on thickly spread for about 45 minutes until it&#x27;s stiff and cracking. I don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; but there&#x27;s some pleasant tingling :) When the mask comes off my face is a little red, so don&#x27;t plan to go out right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had realistic expectations for this mask, so it&#x27;s everything I wanted it to be. The only thing is that I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s so much more expensive than the other popular brand of Indian Healing Clay -- I haven&#x27;t used it to compare. This product was received for honest review.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product</li>
            <li> Great Product. Bought it with the seaweed powder and works great together specially if you&#x27;re looking for cellulite reduction.  The seller was great and updated me about the shipment with also an ebook with recipes for face and body mask and also scrubs. Will definitely buy again from the same seller. Very nice customer service from the seller.</li>
            <li> i like it, and it easy to use. it is a really effective product.</li>
            <li> It is very excellent clay mark.  Seller is very informmatve.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have only used it on my face and neck I am very pleased with the product next I plan on doing my body</li>
            <li> This Stuff is Awesome, makes my face smooth and its cold feels really tight as clay dries Love it!!</li>
            <li> What a great find! I was able to try this sample at a reduced cost. I have never done any sort of mask before. I am in love. The mask left my face feeling just so good! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month of this!</li>
            <li> Use this with the organic Seaweed Powder by Azara Organics.My mother (86yrs) snf I love the way it makes our skin feel. I use just a little clay/seaweed powder mixed with warm water once a week. If you leave it on to long, it can become uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Very good product, very fine powder that mixes and blends well.  I blend it with oil, seaweed powder, maybe some essential oil drops, whatever, to use before showering.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my free Indian Healing Clay! I makes my skin feel better than ever. It is easy to mix and simple to use.</li>
            <li> N9 purchase has been made</li>
            <li> Very good clay, helped me remove my blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim</li>
            <li> I like it but never got a response as to what dose to take for detox. They only give you directions on how to mix for a mask. I take about a teaspoon mixed w/ fiber supplement(very important) to detox my body and I notice a difference within a few hours. I haven&#x27;t tried it for a mask yet.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and even better customer service!</li>
            <li> great product....and fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my wife and I can say with confidence it&#x27;s excellent quality and my wife is very pleased with it.  Can easily recommend it for purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a base for toothpaste and facial products.I enjoy the product immensely and love the customer service even more!</li>
            <li> I only had the clay for two days now, and I only used it on my face and brushed my teeth with it. I love how it made both feel. Using it on my face for twenty minutes,  made it feel really soft. As for my teeth and gums, it made it feel really clean, better than using toothpaste. This product is excellent.</li>
            <li> love it! using in a tooth paste powder and it helped remove coffee and tea staining that has been there for years.  Also using as a facial mask.  It is very finely ground and makes a smooth mask.  it is not gritty in tooth powder either--no more than baking soda. Uses the word organic but not on jar anywhere.  customer service is awesome!!  Overall satisfied with product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product is great not just for beauty also useful for reducing pain due to inflammation from a sprang or even arthritis. I have used green clay forever it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice all over my body and it really stung and reddened my arms, legs and back. It&#x27;s a good product, and is organic. I washed it off in the shower, it didn&#x27;t cause any problems for me. I was worried that it would clog the shower, but thankfully it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not using it as often as I&#x27;d want to though, because I&#x27;m worried about clogging the plumbing. It&#x27;s great for just the face as well.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it for mask. Very fine powder, mixes very easily. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this initially, because of the inconsistent clumping.  I figured it out!  Just mix up what you need in a glass bowl and cover it with plastic wrap, and the next morning it will be perfect for use.</li>
            <li> This clay is well worth the money.  I use it to help soothe toothaches and recently brought some to cure skin infections for a few family and friends.  This truly is a miracle clay and something everyone should have in their food or medicine cabinets.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful and it leaves my face feelin&#x27; great.  I would recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Makes my face look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Package arrived perfectly wrapped and on time.  The product has a wonderfully fine and silky consistency.  I use it as a tooth powder and it works great!</li>
            <li> Great product! I love that you can mix your own custom masks or use straight from the jar with water. If you have trouble taking it off just treat yourself to a nice hot towel, it should wipe right off.</li>
            <li> This makes a nice mask, feels good.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service by Natural Escentials!</li>
            <li> i love it natural and clean</li>
            <li> Will this take marks off my butt I have acne on my butt will is remove them</li>
            <li> WOW, this clay performed better on my face than I expected. Great product for my face masks when mixed with witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I never used masques before and was amazed at how my skin felt after just one use!  I look forward to using this product on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice, and I really like it. But it just makes my hair feels weird if I accidentally get some in my hair. (It might because I&#x27;ve been dyed my hair)</li>
            <li> So far so good. People say I look 30 and I am 63</li>
            <li> Fast friendly service, great product. Excellent follow up. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I started using this around the first of the year and love the results so far. After using a few times I noticed my skin was softer but also more dry. To contradict this I use jojoba oil to moisturize and love the two together. I have only been using this about three weeks and already notice results, I am excited to see how much more my acne improves.&lt;br /&gt;-Sami</li>
            <li> Can I just say that this product is amazing! I&#x27;ve used it twice so far to help reduce the appearance of cellulite and it actually worked!  My celly jelly definitely minimized after my first use so I am definitely pleased. Now lets talk about Natural Escentials. I had an issue with my first order (no fault of theirs) and I didnt plan on contacting them to let them know that I was unable to use the product since the packaging was compromised.  But to my surprise, they relentlessly contacted me wanting to know how the product was working and I told them of the issue that I had and they sent me another one.  They were so understanding. I truly felt like a valued customer.  I would definitely order this product from Natural Escentials again :).</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  I could feel it working in minutes.  Seller kept in contact with instructions.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The product was packaged well and delivery was prompt. I had read some reviews before I purchased and am glad I chose this product. It&#x27;s easy to use. My skin feels amazing after I use it!</li>
            <li> For me it mixes best ACV.</li>
            <li> Great product! Amazing quality! Fantastic Customer Service! Great Buy!</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft but IT STINKS really bad!!</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this product. I can&#x27;t tell much difference. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the customer service for this company is AMAZING! I use this along with the seaweed and mix it w apple cider vinegar. My son has severe acne and i did a mask on him and 2 days later t was 9% cleared. He was so impressed. I use it to tighten and detox my face and neck. I am a life long customer now!</li>
            <li> I like it. I mix or blend it with my oils. It goes on smooth and washes off easy leaving my skin soft. CAN&#x27;T WAIT  to try it on my hair. Thanks</li>
            <li> I got this Indian Healing Clay and I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly where I wanted to apply it so I put it everywhere.  My legs, arms, face, and stomach.  I let it set for about 20 minutes and took a shower to wash it off.  It does make a bit of a mess in the bottom of the shower but I used a paper towel to get off the chunks and the rest washed down nicely.  What impressed me the most about this healing clay was the feeling I had after I washed it off.  I can only attribute it to this product as I have never had this feeling before.  I was overcome by such a relaxed and peaceful feeling.  I literally could have taken a nap.  The next time I use it, I will use it around bedtime rather than morning so I can sleep afterwards.  I absolutely love this product.  That reaction was so unexpected and amazing that I definitely will be using this again and again.</li>
            <li> It does what it says&lt;br /&gt; Tightens sKin  leaves skin soft, good look to the skin. I suggest  playing  relaxing music while you have this on face and body. Itales your body feel renewed&lt;br /&gt;a bit messy but you can&#x27;t  have  everything  perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve seen a improvement in my face</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love it!</li>
