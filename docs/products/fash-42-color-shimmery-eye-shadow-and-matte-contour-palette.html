            <li>This product gave COASTAL SCENTS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY, I HAVE MANY OF COASTAL SCENTS EYESHADOW PACKS AND</li>
            <li>It is a great set up, but I could not use, it is very unnatural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m In love with this palette.</li>
            <li>LOVE Love</li>
            <li>I really love the blushes and the variety.  </li>
            <li>More than worth the price!!</li>
            <li>Grouping is better on the consumer&#x27;s eye and a better use of available elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine arrived in perfect condition - the heavy duty case is worth the price alone!!!  </li>
            <li>There is not a bad color in either of the palettes and the shimmer is perfectly elegant in the eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li>Arrange from light to dark is best!!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the colors of this palette.</li>
            <li>Overall great buy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this palette</li>
            <li>I bought this palette just for the blush and all I have to say is I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>More so, the delivery people who I figure tossed it around from place to place :P not cool.</li>
            <li>:) My sister already wants to take away my blush..</li>
            <li>Really looking forward to ordering more from FASH.</li>
            <li>Fast shipments &amp; Nice arrange of colors (eye shadow &amp; blush) but not as vibrant as the picture, still not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented and beautiful palette, a color I get broken, just as I liked very much, I recommend packing the product better.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>Colors are highly pigmented &amp; have great staying power, especially with primer.</li>
            <li>the blushes are fantastic and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>worth it</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are very pretty and pigmented except for the black and blues and this product arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>The pink and purple are super nice to apply.  </li>
            <li>i had my own single shadows to replace those.</li>
            <li>There is also a bigger palette with more shadows and fewer blushes.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>next comment is for the design team at Flash, it makes more sense to arrange the color palletes together, so all the color family is grouped together.</li>
            <li>The palette arrived with no broken pieces which is a first for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the shadows a couple of times and they are fine....</li>
            <li>i gave 2 stars because although a couple were broken the color pay off is pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my case and it&#x27;s very convenient to carry when I travel.</li>
            <li>All it needed was better packaging because things aren&#x27;t always handled carefully.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Since we are women of color they work really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast service</li>
            <li>I got it yesterday and I am very amazed with the colors.</li>
            <li>,I would purchase this brand again.nice spring colors.got hear fast .too.</li>
            <li>Colors, according to my wife, are very vivid.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, but I was slightly disappointed that some of them, the lighter eyeshadow colors are more powdery than solid.</li>
            <li>but I can live with this.</li>
            <li>Its a cool palette, I just wish it was more pigmented for the eyeshadow because it makes it difficult to blend on clients.</li>
            <li>I must say, I was quite surprised when I opened the kit.</li>
            <li>I had to pack the powder back in the pots and clean the other shadows.</li>
            <li>i love how pigmented they are which makes me that more sad that my palette is a mess!</li>
            <li>Double stack Shimmer eyeshadow/Blush palette looks like Coastal Scents because IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME except I only paid $9.99 (including shipping).</li>
            <li>i would have appreciated it a little more if they made it less of a hassle to get either your money back or another replacement of the same item!</li>
            <li>It takes a few swipes to get full effect with colors such as the yellow.</li>
            <li>As a make up artist I would not use these for my professional kit because the color does not stay on long, even with primer.</li>
            <li>This palette pretty much killed my desire to buy a bunch of blushes.</li>

            <li> Also they are very pigmented and creamy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Your consumer should not have to look for 4 different shades of purple, blue, pink eyeshadow in different areas.</li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No palette of this nature is complete without 1 black eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Had some minor creasing</li>
            <li> color is long lasting.for the money</li>
            <li> There are other blush palettes with less shadows and are more expensive</li>
            <li> when i contacted them to ask for a new one they said i had to ship the broken one back!</li>
            <li> The palette arrived within the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> but I think that was due to my moisturizer and primer.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that two of my blush were broken up...not enough for me to be pissed off, but I don&#x27;t blame the company.</li>
            <li> Needs a black eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I like the slight shimmer in the eyeshadow</li>
            <li> the eyeshadow should of had BLACK...</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that one eyeshadow was completely broken and the powder covered nearby shadows.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it quite a bit over the past week.</li>
            <li> Another shadow had a small crack and and one blush pot was also broken.</li>
            <li> like seriously why do u need to the broken one..</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because several of the colours were broken from what I assume was because of poor packaging.</li>
            <li> and when i checked the blushes on the bottom one of those were broken as hell..</li>
            <li> id just keep it with the broken ones since i had to use this palette for a makeup show i was doing and</li>
            <li> the colors that were broken</li>
            <li> This maybe a little awkward (they array of colors is RANDOM af) pallet is a must have!!</li>
            <li> it was so bad that 2 of the eye shadows were completely broken</li>
            <li> nothing bad or wowing to share.  </li>
            <li> i was so mad!</li>
            <li> and when i opened it up the packing protection was really bad!</li>
            <li> No matter your skin tone you will not be disappointed by this!</li>
            <li> the return policy they have is horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!!  Shadow colors have great pigment and stay on great.  I use primer as well  The blushes are beautiful and also has great pigment.  I definitely recommend this product!!  :)</li>
            <li> coastal scents is over priced - I got the same thing but it was way cheaper - the palette has great colours</li>
            <li> This is beautiful beyond measure.  Mine arrived in perfect condition - the heavy duty case is worth the price alone!!!  The colors are beautifully saturated - even the blushes.  It is just sooooo beautiful.  I am ecstatic that I ordered this.  There is not a bad color in either of the palettes and the shimmer is perfectly elegant in the eyeshadows.  Well done Fash!!  Do not let this one get by you.  Order, order, order!!  There is also a bigger palette with more shadows and fewer blushes.  I wanted the most blushes so I ordered this one.  No matter your skin tone you will not be disappointed by this!</li>
            <li> I find these shadows to be okay. They are some what pigmented and show up well with eye shadow primer. As a make up artist I would not use these for my professional kit because the color does not stay on long, even with primer.</li>
            <li> I love all  these beautiful colors.  I have gotten many complements and they stay on all day and don&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> Colors, according to my wife, are very vivid. She now considers to buy all her make up in amazon. Never again in a dept. store.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. The colors are highly pigmented and a little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my case and it&#x27;s very convenient to carry when I travel. The only problem I have is that one eyeshadow was completely broken and the powder covered nearby shadows. Another shadow had a small crack and and one blush pot was also broken. I had to pack the powder back in the pots and clean the other shadows. All it needed was better packaging because things aren&#x27;t always handled carefully. Other than that, I can&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s cheaper than the double stack Coastal Scents carries and you get the same blush colors and some of the same shadows and a variety of others.</li>
            <li> FASH Cosmetics 42 Double stack Shimmer eyeshadow/Blush palette looks like Coastal Scents because IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME except I only paid $9.99 (including shipping). REVIEW PROS: Colors are highly pigmented &amp; have great staying power, especially with primer. Blush variety is excellent with perfect cheek/highlight colors for every complexion (I am a mocha girl). REVIEW CONS: Needs a black eyeshadow. No palette of this nature is complete without 1 black eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I must say, I was quite surprised when I opened the kit. The eyeshadow and the blush....simply beautiful. I like the slight shimmer in the eyeshadow :) My sister already wants to take away my blush..haha. She loves them on her complexion. Since we are women of color they work really well.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that two of my blush were broken up...not enough for me to be pissed off, but I don&#x27;t blame the company. More so, the delivery people who I figure tossed it around from place to place :P not cool. Anywhoo, great product! I give it 4 stars becuz the eyeshadow should of had BLACK...I use that a lot.</li>
            <li> The palette arrived within the expected delivery date. I was disappointed because several of the colours were broken from what I assume was because of poor packaging. The colours were very gorgeous and true to colour. Also they are very pigmented and creamy, a little goes a long way. I love this palette. the blushes are fantastic and very pigmented.Overall I would recommend this product and would also purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I love the variety of colors. The pink and purple are super nice to apply.  Wonderful product for summer time!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful pigmentation and staying power.  Had some minor creasing but I think that was due to my moisturizer and primer. I going to try these with just primer tomorrow and see what happens. I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> I love love love this Fash-Duo, shipping was fast and it arrived packaged and non damaged the colors are bright and amazing and they actually showed up on my face the way they are presented in the picture. Let me tell u about these blush&#x27;s Ooooohhh they are gorgeous they are beautiful u have a choice of your shimmer ones and matte blush&#x27;s. Some people say oh this two palette is just like coastal scents but a lil more expensive I say WHO CARES! This product gave COASTAL SCENTS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY, I HAVE MANY OF COASTAL SCENTS EYESHADOW PACKS AND FASH OVEREXCEED THEM on this DUO. Point blank period.</li>
            <li> It is a great set up, but I could not use, it is very unnatural</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this palette and when i opened it up the packing protection was really bad! it was so bad that 2 of the eye shadows were completely broken and when i checked the blushes on the bottom one of those were broken as hell..i was so mad! when i contacted them to ask for a new one they said i had to ship the broken one back! like seriously why do u need to the broken one..anyways i decided because i needed this palette id just keep it with the broken ones since i had to use this palette for a makeup show i was doing and the colors that were broken i had my own single shadows to replace those. the return policy they have is horrible i would have appreciated it a little more if they made it less of a hassle to get either your money back or another replacement of the same item! i gave 2 stars because although a couple were broken the color pay off is pretty amazing! i love how pigmented they are which makes me that more sad that my palette is a mess!</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented and beautiful palette, a color I get broken, just as I liked very much, I recommend packing the product better.Thanks for the fast service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m In love with this palette. The colors are beautiful and very pigmented. It came in perfect condition and before the delivery date. I plan on using this on my vacation. Happily grateful!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and I am very amazed with the colors. They are huge.!!! They have the fastest shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to use it.. Overall I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> The palette arrived with no broken pieces which is a first for me. The colors are beautiful, but I was slightly disappointed that some of them, the lighter eyeshadow colors are more powdery than solid. It takes a few swipes to get full effect with colors such as the yellow. However, it&#x27;s still a great palette and I&#x27;ve been using it quite a bit over the past week. The blush colors are beautiful and each looks so great on my skin. Really looking forward to ordering more from FASH.</li>
            <li> I had this palette for a couple of months now and all I have to say is that I love it! I bought this palette just for the blush and all I have to say is I&#x27;m not disappointed. This palette pretty much killed my desire to buy a bunch of blushes. The eyeshadows are very pretty and pigmented except for the black and blues and this product arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m, happy to report .the color is long lasting.for the money it .was worth it ,I would purchase this brand again.nice spring colors.got hear fast .too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipments &amp; Nice arrange of colors (eye shadow &amp; blush) but not as vibrant as the picture, still not a bad thing. Packed very good, only 1 blush out 10 arrived cracked but I can live with this. All the eyeshadows arrived in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next comment is for the design team at Flash, it makes more sense to arrange the color palletes together, so all the color family is grouped together. Arrange from light to dark is best!! Your consumer should not have to look for 4 different shades of purple, blue, pink eyeshadow in different areas. Grouping is better on the consumer&#x27;s eye and a better use of available elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Its a cool palette, I just wish it was more pigmented for the eyeshadow because it makes it difficult to blend on clients.</li>
            <li> Shimmery and bright. Lots of colors. Perfect for olive-dark skin tone. LOVE Love</li>
            <li> More than worth the price!! This maybe a little awkward (they array of colors is RANDOM af) pallet is a must have!! The colors are bright and silky smooth! I&#x27;d use primer and pigment potion for an extra kick/longer lasting intensity.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the colors of this palette. The blushes work great as well. Overall great buy. I would recommend this or buy this again for a friend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the blushes and the eyeshadows are just an afterthought. I really love the blushes and the variety.  I am NC42 for references and the colors show up great on my skin and I am satisfied with the pigmentation.  I&#x27;ve only used the shadows a couple of times and they are fine....nothing bad or wowing to share.  There are other blush palettes with less shadows and are more expensive so I loved this!</li>
