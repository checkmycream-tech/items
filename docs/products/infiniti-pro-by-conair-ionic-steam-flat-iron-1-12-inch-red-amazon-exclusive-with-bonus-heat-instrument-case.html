            <li>This hair straightener is so amazing!!</li>
            <li>It does a very good job of straightening my hair, but if I get any of my hair too close to the end of the iron it pulls my hair.</li>
            <li>it is a very good product to buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a very good job straightening my hair.</li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use distilled water in mine and it still works great with tap water.</li>
            <li>The steam feature is great as well as the variable temperature settings.</li>
            <li>The reviews were great on it</li>
            <li>I figured that using steam would be a great way to do that.</li>

            <li>Though I will say that the combs are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I go over each section of hair twice, and it comes out great.  </li>
            <li>They do great on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Steam works great.  </li>
            <li>So happy for that.</li>

            <li>this was a great buy for the money and it works so well on the hair</li>
            <li>This was a great bargain</li>
            <li>The flatiron works great as mentioned in Consumer Reports.  </li>

            <li>This product works great</li>
            <li>I (still) love this straightening iron!!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li>It comes with a very nice heat resistant storage case.  </li>
            <li>Good price, good quality and does its job perfectly good!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Is the best tool I have bought, I think is even better than my T3 hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It would take me 20 to 25, on a good day.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loved the straightener.</li>
            <li>Superior service and reliability.</li>
            <li>really Good</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>my wife loved this iron....</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good hour investment of time, although I&#x27;ve gone up to 5 days without needing to wash my hair afterwards.    </li>
            <li>If I were to wash it and let it air-dry, it would look like a fascinating study in indecisiveness.  </li>
            <li>-Doesnt work good on Yaki or \\&quot;Ethnic Coarse\\</li>
            <li>The reviews were all good.  </li>
            <li>It is good in all the areas it touts....</li>
            <li>Well, I have used this item for over 2 months and decided now it is a good time to write a review.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>The steam is good to and I can tell a difference between steaming it and not.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t duplicate the sleek look you get at the salon, but this does a good job of straightening my hair and making it manageable.  </li>
            <li>She just loved how it felt when I finished, as it was shiny and silky.     </li>
            <li>Seems to me to be of good qualiy.</li>
            <li>I have always thought Conair made cheap products, and this one is a perfect example.  </li>
            <li>It goes up to 390 degrees which I guess is good for me, otherwise I may burn my hair.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Both have ions and good plates.</li>
            <li>It was a good price.</li>
            <li>and good idea for gift.</li>
            <li>Did not heat up as good as it claimed to.</li>
            <li>We loved it.</li>
            <li>I saw all the good reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>REALLY GOOD...</li>
            <li>No perm, no texturizer, nothing but a super awesome afro.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice and handy aid, really nice results.</li>
            <li>In all I&#x27;m glad I bought it...was a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li>Her hair looks very healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love it and my hair looks great after using this iron.</li>
            <li>well worth it because it was the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>There are more settings than I need, but the basics are great.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even describe how awesome it is (and im very picky)!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the steam and comb too!</li>
            <li>I had to go over each section more than once, saving NO time!  </li>
            <li>the Infinity also - now we each have one and both love it!</li>
            <li>I love the steam feature!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li>i love this straightener!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The price was outstanding!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, it works perfectly, easy to use, and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle, works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a chi, but out of all the straighteners I&#x27;ve tried in the best, this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>This has been amazing for each length.  </li>
            <li>Great product, my hair comes out, fabulous</li>
            <li>which is amazing after seeing the prices on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The one I currently own, a Virtuo, which I paid about $100.00 for 3 years ago at the mall, does not have steam.  </li>
            <li>I had a Good experience trying that I just Love it.</li>
            <li>I own this product.</li>
            <li>As I stated in the title, it&#x27;s not the magic bullet of haircare, but it IS a good tool to have your arsenal.</li>
            <li>I was delighted with the price and her satisfaction made it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I had been using a folded towel on my dressing table to protect it and was thrilled to find that this had its own silver mat.  </li>
            <li>Who keeps that around--and where would you buy it, or have time to distill your own water just to put in a hair straightener?  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice shine to hair and softness.     </li>
            <li>Honestly I couldn&#x27;t style my hair if my life depended on it.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see anything wonderful about this product, except that it looks nice.</li>
            <li>I had a Chi straightener for a while, but I really wasn&#x27;t very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it</li>
            <li>I guess over time using this is much better then without the moisture they say is good for the hair when applying heat.  </li>
            <li>Wife purchased item, worked well, she would have liked it if she had longer hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and my daughter glad with it</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT IS REALLY THAT GOOD!!</li>
            <li>This straightener is the best and most reasonably priced one I have ever used!</li>
            <li>but I need put in high level for best results.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because aesthetically its a nice straightener, I liked the 9 foot cord, and I liked the included carrying case that also functions as a counter top protecter.</li>
            <li>So coming from a teenager who just bought a straightener instead of a new iPod, I would say by this because it is THE BEST straightener ever!!</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is great, works smoothly, and I do love the steam feature that this one has.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size and it doesn&#x27;t take me more than 5-10 minutes tops to get my hair ready now.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has done it again - a great product for a super price.</li>
            <li>it is very easy on processed blond hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This straightener is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>my 13 year old daughter says that this is the best straightener we have owned.</li>
            <li>My own experience has been outstanding.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST straightener EVER!!!</li>
            <li>The Infiniti is indeed the most effective straightener I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this straightner it heats up well, the steam is an amazing addition.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to be able to use this function when you want.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that my hair feels soft and still healthy.</li>
            <li>The best part is that while it comes out straight and smooth it does not lose body (having the correct styling creme helps).  </li>
            <li>The added steam feature is nice and I will use it more when it is more humid.</li>
            <li>The steam feature is also great if you have slept on your hair -- fast touch up!</li>
            <li>I had a ceramic iron made by Revlon that wasn&#x27;t very hot and just didn&#x27;t do a good job (plus I burned myself all the time).  </li>
            <li>I love that you can adjust the temperature with ease.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser said that using steam was better for hair so, I do like having that feature.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hair straightener</li>
            <li>and I really like all the options for the steam (works great) and the heat settings.  </li>
            <li>Although I still love this straightener, it has started to have a mind of</li>
            <li>Make sure to have a bottle of room-temp filtered water nearby.</li>
            <li>all - just make sure you know how to use a straightener</li>
            <li>This straightener is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love that you can turn up the heat too because then this product will work on the curliest of hair.  </li>
            <li>I havent figured out if i like it better with or without the steam part.  </li>
            <li>After getting this this appears to have better hair days :-)</li>
            <li>From reading the reviews I thought this product would work better because of the steam.  </li>
            <li>i thought the teeth would hold the hair better and help straightedn</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work better on hair that is not as curly as mine.</li>
            <li>We simply LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love.</li>
            <li>I love the case that comes with it as well.  </li>
            <li>If I wanted pin straight hair, I&#x27;d go get a weave, lol.</li>
            <li>Nothing makes the results any better...)</li>
            <li>Ok i purchase this straightner for mi wife, since arrive</li>
            <li>Oh, and it probably would have lasted longer if I have taken better care of it.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot more from this straightener. .</li>
            <li>, I thought it would straighten better and faster.  </li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>she tried many</li>
            <li>The steam feature is interesting</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t decide if it works better with or without using the steam)</li>
            <li>I only use conair since they have the best hair products ever.</li>
            <li>I thought it was okay</li>
            <li>I am NOT that girl who can just wash and go, but I&#x27;m also not the girl who can be bothered to spend more than 10-15 minutes doing anything about it.  </li>
            <li>Is is great however the piant comes off really fast</li>
            <li>Ok value.</li>
            <li>Hopes this helps :)</li>
            <li>Its OK I will keep it.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>I got this about 3 weeks ago &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying one for my sister as well! :)</li>
            <li>this one works like magic.</li>
            <li>While she could use a separate curler, she likes to be able to have one product which can serve both functions.</li>
            <li>But she does indicate, that the Conair works better than her chi, and she uses it most of the time.</li>
            <li>I give it a 4/5 :]</li>
            <li>just what I was looking for and love the steaming function</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use that one for the most part.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the packaging by amazon and the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself at Christmas, and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but the steam container started leaking after about a month.</li>
            <li>I just love this produce.  </li>
            <li>I love the combs, and the adjustable heat settings.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41, bleach my hair, have well water, and love to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for healthy ways to style it.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>This seems to work better for my hair when the steam is turned off.  </li>
            <li>I love the steam and the heat protecting case that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I also love the retractable comb as it seems to help glide it through my hair easier without pulling.</li>
            <li>Really works great...</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I also love the heat resistant storage pouch which also doubles up as a counter protector.</li>
            <li>KIND OF CHEAP</li>
            <li>how many passes I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing, but you should save your money and invest in a Chi.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this straightener</li>
            <li>and p.s comes with cute lilttle carrying case</li>
            <li>She said this one works much better than the one she replaced.</li>
            <li>go thru the instructions to make sure.</li>
            <li>Most times not :)</li>
            <li>Just started using steam function and love it.</li>
            <li>We all love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does take a bit to get used to, but once you do-you will LOVE the results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this - but I will try to get them all on here.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this iron.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this iron.</li>
            <li>She saidit works like magic</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>But I love this</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good about this iron, I wish I had it three years ago!!!</li>
            <li>It better</li>
            <li>Looked more like a blow out.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>, I feel it straightens my hair better.</li>
            <li>, actually I love the comb feature.</li>
            <li>But as I continued to watch the ad i started to like it more and more.  </li>
            <li>and I have been in love with it ever since.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this one for my daughter in love for her birthday.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon for $53.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better &amp; more lightweight than the  Maxiglide, at a way better price.</li>
            <li>and I love how it works.</li>
            <li>and we still love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I gave it as a gift and my collegue was glad.</li>
            <li>I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li>the fact that I can use it on damp hair is a time-saver as well as sparing my hair from more heat damage.</li>
            <li>it does take some time (7 min) to heat up and create steam, but I am ok with that.</li>
            <li>Many of my on-line pals are raving about the &amp;#34;Loreal Steam Pod&amp;#34; these days, but that is too pricey for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the teeth that pop out and comb my hair while straightening</li>
            <li>OK, so I bought this because I researched on Consumer Digest for the best selling, best overall flat iron.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Truly can&#x27;t say enough how this has made my life better and easier!!!</li>
            <li>So when I received this I was very excited.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a flat iron that I&#x27;ve used that is thinner and does an excellent job of straightening without pulling my hair.</li>
            <li>As an owner of two Chi flat irons, I have to say that I am impressed with this steam iron from Conair.  </li>
            <li>So I was using a ceramic Revlon flat iron with it to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best flat irons I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>the steam element on this flat iron is wonderful.</li>
            <li>iron may work for some people, but if you want very straight hair, I don&#x27;t think it is a good value.</li>
            <li>and i thought it worked pretty good when i borrowed hers.  </li>
            <li>I think the product is pretty good for the amount I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I was not born with the natural ability to be create beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews for this product, and it sounded pretty good.</li>
            <li>The original was priced at $100 and that was ON SALE!</li>
            <li>It got here quickly and the results were just amazing.</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere on the internet, and heard that the chi&#x27;s were pretty good, but they broke easily.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that it doesnt leave hair smelling burnt and looking ironed.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap one before and this one is much better than that.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;) enjoy</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it makes my hair</li>
            <li>When you see this straightener available, grab it because there aren&#x27;t many that they sell.</li>
            <li>I loved how it kept my hair straight and sleek.</li>
            <li>One more thing would have been more detailed instructions, though I was able to figure it out quickly</li>
            <li>But I am happy to live with that, if I have to, if it means fabulous hair.</li>
            <li>After a lifetime of dealing with high maintenance hair that never really looks good, I am impressed!</li>
            <li>Other the that, this is a great product!</li>
            <li>It straightens so easily;</li>
            <li>it heats up within 0 seconds and straightens easily.</li>
            <li>- water chamber was easy to remove, fill, and replace-&lt;br /&gt;had mine for 3 yrs -never clogged.</li>
            <li>the design is sleek and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>PROS  -Easy</li>
            <li>It would probably work even faster if it put out more steam, but overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It straightened my hair easily.</li>
            <li>I used it on her hair it and easily straightened her hair also.</li>
            <li>It is actually easy to use.</li>
            <li>And is very quick to heat.  </li>
            <li>Controls on the Conair extremely easy to use and SEE.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to straighten with this one(:</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, the temp is adjustable and it&#x27;s made well...</li>
            <li>Once I read how to use this product correctly, it was easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>I love love love this hair straightner and highly recommend it to everyone!  </li>
            <li>it works fine</li>
            <li>Medium works just fine.</li>
            <li>It is light, effective,and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Tried it both ways and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>It takes half the time to straighten my hair which makes me very happy.</li>
            <li>Hello   Expressly excellent device and works very actively.   </li>
            <li>I fell in love with it the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it might outperform my trusty Chi &amp; I would have a nice, shiny new flatiron, but I should have known better.</li>
            <li>This is a decent hair straightener, but it is lacking one very important feature - an auto shut off!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny, smooth, and super straightened!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and it is well worth the money</li>
            <li>It also made my hair very shiny, whereas the one I currently own does not.  </li>
            <li>Its not always a smooth glide</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth every penny :]</li>
            <li>Really cheap.</li>
            <li>I have contrary hair, so while it can be sleek and smooth when I leave the house in the morning, it&#x27;s sometimes somewhat frizzy by the time I get to work.  </li>
            <li>It is totally worth the money and comes with a cute travel pouch.</li>
            <li>also i ordered this with Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping on a Thursday afternoon &amp;&amp; it arrived that Friday morning just in time for the weekend.  </li>
            <li>The steam makes my hair shiny and smooth every time.  </li>
            <li>it does such a great job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;One thing that I didn&#x27;t expect, nor do I like, is that it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth going across the hair.  </li>
            <li>it makes your hair like baby hair, its so smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair was great in the 80s, when perms and big hair were in.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out smooth and manageable all day.</li>
            <li>I have semi-long, very curly, frizzy hair with a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>After a few trials, the thing that I found was that this thing works best for my hair when ....</li>
            <li>Overall, a great buy.</li>
            <li>The retractable combs in the middle of the ceramic plates are great to guide my curly hair through them.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a backup flatiron when I found it dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>hair smooth and silkyy.</li>
            <li>(well enough to take on a Chi and win).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>itch her hair &amp;#34;looking a mess!&amp;#34;  Conair helps make it possible for her hair to look great.</li>
            <li>Still not as good as the old Maxiglide.  </li>
            <li>The best part: my hair stays straight for 2 or more days and it does not cause a lot of split ends like the other straighteners I&#x27;ve had.    </li>
            <li>The teeth in the flat iron part are awesome and very helpful, the part i dont like is</li>
            <li>Great flat iron with steam -</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li>Great Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>I have never paid $60 for a flat iron and now I know why I couldn&#x27;t get the great results with my hair that others were getting.  </li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>With this iron take me 15 minutes to comb it, usually took me about 45 minutes to do it as perfect and straight as I liked.</li>
            <li>I had been interested in this iron for some time because it seemed like a great combination between my old Conair steam straightener and my ceramic one.</li>
            <li>this is a great hair steam flat iron,i was so excited</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>The Infiniti Steam Straightener worked quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>And its so quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>my hair just looks amazing and it&#x27;s sooooo soft!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for more than a year, used it almost every day for 3 months straight, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>The steam makes it feel very soft and healthy, even on the more coarser looking areas underneath the outer layer of hair.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li>I followed the recommendations of consumer reports and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this straightener home...</li>
            <li>Also bought at a cheaper price than what it was originally.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I was still excited to try the product.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, I was so excited to get this straightener.  </li>
            <li>I just love this hot iron.  </li>
            <li>This iron was recommended by consumer reports and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It is also most reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Infiniti Pro!! :)</li>
            <li>This is a decent iron for a pretty good price.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY picky with hair products, and having very fine wavy hair</li>
            <li>Love it, and very glad I was able to replace the previous one.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>My hair type is medium coarse &amp; I currently own a CHI - this works better than my CHI because of the shine &amp; now my hair is silkly.  </li>
            <li>I have three different hair straighteners and this one works the best by far.</li>
            <li>I figured before that my hair needed to be cut because my ends were so dry, but with this straightener, my ends looks great.  </li>
            <li>plus its super cheap here</li>
            <li>I also love that you can set it on different tempratures to adjust to any kind of hair.</li>
            <li>that I am currently trying to grow out, but I can honestly blow-dry my hair, run this straightener through it in less than 6 minutes, and be supremely happy with how it looks!  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was anything special.  </li>
            <li>And the little water chamber for steam infusion is brilliant.  </li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron that I ever used!It works great with my hair texture (African American)</li>
            <li>So, I just use this straightener and was able to get straight hair in 1 hour WITHOUT USING THE STEAM.</li>
            <li>The color makes it so cool</li>
            <li>The steam reservoir lasted only about 20 minutes on the lowest setting, and even on the highest heat setting, I didn&#x27;t feel that it did a good job of straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>The iron does a good job for awhile, but frizz comes back before the end of the workday on me.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>He was freaking out because he said he paid $150 dollars for it (whether or not this is true</li>
            <li>Truly the only time my hair looks good is when some else does it.</li>
            <li>My hair stays moisturized, straight, and most of all with plenty of movement.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of straightening my daughters coarse hair</li>
            <li>One thing though, because I do it myself, the ends of the hair don&#x27;t look too nice, but that&#x27;s just the day that is done, by the next day the ends look fine.</li>
            <li>This is actually the second of this product I have owned it works wonderfully</li>
            <li>The steam feature makes her hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>I found that it heats up fast, and the extra amenities are great (steam capsule, heat-proof pouch, built-in combs, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>HEAT- heats super fast-no</li>
            <li>up quick  CONS  </li>
            <li>Think of a clothes iron -- when you use the steam feature, your wrinkles come out quick vs no steam.</li>
            <li>It tames the frizz quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the multiple temp, comb and steam settings, they give me much more control of my hairstyle while minimizing heat damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>One cannot add more water to keep on going with the steam because the whole iron gets too hot, so in order to get more steam it is necessary to wait until the iron is cool!!</li>
            <li>to use  -Ions and steam work great  -Adjustable temperature setting up to about 380 degrees   -comes with cool down and storage bag  -Heats</li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth shine and does so very fast.</li>
            <li>This product works better than other straighteners I have tried and own.</li>
            <li>The straightener worked great at it&#x27;s high temp setting of 395 to straighten with only one pass per two-inch section of hair.  </li>
            <li>Well, my friend told me that it could be the straightener and that I should try getting a new one, and I thought okay.</li>
            <li>I have long  hair and very  curly, I did purchase the infinity conair nano and it works great.</li>
            <li>Seems like most people with straight hair want curly and those with curly want straight!</li>
            <li>It is a nice result, and my hair feels pretty soft afterward too.</li>
            <li>I quickly got my package and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if it was worth the price.   </li>
            <li>It was extrememly fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>offs are not required on all electronics that get this hot as the chances that they will at some point accidentally be left are good.</li>
            <li>Infiniti Pro- Nano Silver Flat Iron- with steamer... is the best Flat Iron I&#x27;ve ever had, with no hair damage</li>
            <li>Fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I really like the adjustable heat settings and how easy it combs thought my hair without getting it tangle.</li>
            <li>After so many years of use, it&#x27;s been all used out with product build up causing a burning smell when heated, the water vessel falling out on it&#x27;s own and the comb stuck in the down position.</li>
            <li>Really!!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to receive this in the mail because I am ALWAYS straightening my curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your hair is completely dry before using the product, and get distilled water, works better than using tap water.</li>
            <li>After using the comb-chase method and trimming my ends a bit, it straightens natural, kinky Afro hair just fine!</li>
            <li>Right size, quick heat up</li>
            <li>My first one still works but after all of these years it doesn&#x27;t seem like its steaming, probably just needs clean.</li>
            <li>I just used my flat iron on my hair today, and its pretty good</li>
            <li>This product is a pretty good steam flat iron.</li>
            <li>If you have time, or short hair it would be amazing.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair so straight and smooth badass straightener</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The steam is a good benefit, a real help in second day styling.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Solia flat iron since then and love it!</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever owned and it comes with a case that you can put the flat iron in while its still hot.</li>
            <li>I obviously figured it out on my own and used a medicine dispenser to pour water into the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this iron and used it for the first time on a very rainy day (which would usually cause my hair to frizz) and it was wonderful.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Its worth it for the price but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li>Second, the steam feature is perfect for people with naturally wavy or curly hair because it really helps to straighten fast.</li>
            <li>This iron is FAR better than my 100+ dollar Chi iron, when I bought this one on sale for $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even After my Japanese straightener it works great smoothing your hair completely and fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition, if you have natural or chemically treated hair, please make sure you use a hair protectant to help minimize the damage from the heat.</li>
            <li>I had to be sure after that to put all of my hair in the section before the compartment started or take the cover off completely.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>You also have to be careful not to go too close to your scalp, trust me a burst of steam to the scalp does NOT feel good.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to describe my hair as soft before.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Consumer Reports indicated this iron straightens hair better than the Chi, so I decided to give it a try since there is a considerable price</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is a nice shade of red though!</li>
            <li>While I like it, it is heavier than I was used to (I left my perfect flat iron at a hotel and have no idea what brand it was to replace it), doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair out like my old one and just took a lot of getting used to.  </li>
            <li>i only passed it once and my hair ws straight over all this is the best flat iron i have ever used!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this flat iron about four years ago and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I must say after using this product I will not use another kind of straightner or flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using a small inexpensive one and decided to upgrade, and in fact really I was prepared to spend more money for a good one</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The teeth are just right.</li>
            <li>The heat control is placed right where your thumb goes when straitening your hair</li>
            <li>Compared to the Chi and Hot Tools I&#x27;ve used, this gives the most professional results, both look and feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to tell when it&#x27;s working, simply from the sights and sounds of using it</li>
            <li>I agree with the reviewer below who mentioned that the steam resevoir doesn&#x27;t last very long (it will run out of water in 10 mins) and the quality of the ceramic plates isn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
            <li>I have owned this exact flat iron for about 5 years now and loved it so much I bought this one as a gift.  </li>
            <li>This is worth it and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried one someone else purchased and spent my hard earned money on a Chi, now that is a great straightener!</li>
            <li>The water in the reservoir(which was full) ran out before I can even finish my whole hair (shoulder length).</li>
            <li>And not just my normal puffy, frizzy, why-did-I-even-bother straightening - - - smooth, shiny, like-I-had-a-blowout-at-the-salon straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It only takes me an hour to straighten my hair which is a record for me, and now it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li>So I think its a nice investment as long as you know what you&#x27;re getting when you get it!  </li>
            <li>The digital screen is awesome and sooo much easier than the other rotating ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Gave my wife one last year and my daughter liked it so much I bought her one this year.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair perfectly straight and its quick too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great products for African American hair.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and not damaging to hair like the old style straighteners.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heats quickly, straightens hair fast and the style holds.</li>
            <li>This nearly straighten my hair what most would consider to be bone straight.</li>
            <li>I got this staightner because of all the great reviews it had from african american women.</li>
            <li>I love how this straightner leaves my hair straight and soft for days.</li>
            <li>Also I like that my hair looks natural, more straight, but still has volume.</li>
            <li>First, the Nano Silver technology really provides fast, smooth, silky results.</li>
            <li>made my hair very straight and soft,but it took forever!If</li>
            <li>This product made her hair very straight</li>
            <li>The Conair Steam Straightener gets my hair very straight.</li>
            <li>This flat iron offers some good features and was well rated.  </li>
            <li>yesterday abd have used it yesterday and today - I cannot believe how straight my hair is!</li>
            <li>In fact, it was too straight!</li>
            <li>and i think the no steam actually works better.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it snags strands of my hair in the gaps around the hot plates and the steam capsule.  </li>
            <li>This was my first straightener ever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try blow drying my hair straighter next time and see if I get better results.  </li>
            <li>: Actually, I felt I should edit this review because I found out something interesting -</li>
            <li>My first one broke though.  </li>
            <li>I figured the first was a fluke, so I bought another one</li>
            <li>Even more, it won&#x27;t curl back.</li>
            <li>Love the steam, I am growing out short hair</li>
            <li>I am going back to the store today to get another one to put in the closet just in case :)</li>
            <li>This is the first straightener i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>She raves about it, she finds it exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>this was the most I have spent on any hair product, ever (I know, I know, I am cheap/poor), and I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what a steam straightener could do to my head full of unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first when I seen that it had a steam feature, I thought that would not help my curly-fro...</li>
            <li>and it still works just as well as the first time I got it.</li>
            <li>I had to further turn it up to the highest setting to get better results.  </li>
            <li>I have had no issues with filling, steam or use of this hot iron.  </li>
            <li>The Conair left my hair shinier and in better condition.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>WHEN THIS FIRST CAME OUT, IT WAS $120.</li>
            <li>It does get really HOT at 395</li>
            <li>but it is pretty.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is the auto shut-off if it&#x27;s left on.</li>
            <li>your products have never failed me,</li>
            <li>Pretty neat steam function and comb feature</li>
            <li>I first saw this product on an ad on television.</li>
            <li>And I love that it is in my fave color red.</li>
            <li>I first bought it in Target years ago and ended up giving it to my sister.  </li>
            <li>First time: stolen by my friend.</li>
            <li>Conair steaming iron works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than a regular iron, my hair is shiny after the steam iron.</li>
            <li>Not only does this flat iron work as promised, but it&#x27;s excellent for daily touch ups.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product even though I feel it does not adequately heat up.  </li>
            <li>easy burn your hand if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron so much I returned my Chi Air!</li>
            <li>I love the steam portion of the flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with my steam flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love the built in steamer and the fact that hair does not burn my fingers after I use the flat iron on it; this is a sign of not having you hair damaged with every use.</li>
            <li>I recommend this flat iron to anyone, regardless of the thickness of hair. :)</li>
            <li>The Infinity 1 1/2 Steam Flat Iron by Conair works fabulously!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my flat iron for more than a year.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>After using this, my hair is amazingly straight, shiny, smooth and SOFT.</li>
            <li>Well first off the price is very high...</li>
            <li>Finally, and most importantly, the results last!</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much silkier and softer since using this hot iron.  </li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and this is the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>The steam part doesn&#x27;t hold much water at all, and you have to turn it off and let it cool down before you add more water.  </li>
            <li>This is fine by me, &#x27;cause I did not want actually want pin straight hair (I like my afro!).</li>
            <li>At first it takes practice to get the water chamber filled up, but it comes easy after a few uses.</li>
            <li>The only reason it&#x27;s getting more than one star is because my little sister used it as well and liked it, even though her hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li>I think it also makes my hair feel more dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>Product is pretty good with thick and course hair.</li>
            <li>This Conair straightener certainly works, in fact, I can get my hair straighter if I work at it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this straightener!!</li>
            <li>I found this iron to be wider than I would like, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot and you end up with breakage because hair gets caught around the water reservoir which you also have to refill frequently.</li>
            <li>I am white with wavy fine hair that would never straighten for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and I only have to take it thru once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve a very high expectation from this Conair Infiniti</li>
            <li>That flat iron easily straighten her hair out.</li>
            <li>I would definitely compared this to be as good if not better than other steam flat irons out there; and was a very good value for this product.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>and this keeps my curls straight.</li>
            <li>so it fills MUCH easier now.  </li>
            <li>The steam really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very frizzy/curly</li>
            <li>My hair is straight with tons of body.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to keep going over the hair to make it straight.</li>
            <li>With this one, I found that the steam and ions really smooth and soften my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t actually straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>It lvs hair straight and shinny.</li>
            <li>While both the Chi and Instyler made my hair straight they didn&#x27;t get rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly so it is ready to use in a minute or so.  </li>
            <li>That is what i was really wanting, for my hair to stay straighter.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped and arrived within a reasonable time as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I have really curly and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>well, straight.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m learning to deal with it since this iron does the job (and is much cheaper than like alternatives).</li>
            <li>and it was so fast</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t steam as much as I would like it and the water goes away really fast.</li>
            <li>an will probably not burnn my hair as much.</li>
            <li>I like this straight iron</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t quite get it perfectly straight from my scalp to the end of my hair.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know)</li>
            <li>Well I remember it worked really well then.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this item.</li>
            <li>This  straightner  works  very  </li>
            <li>The Infinit by Conair works really well.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s when your hair has bubble-like lesions which are actually gas filled cavities created by the rapid vaporization of moisture within the hair-shaft.</li>
            <li>Heats fast and has a heat proof bag to put it in?</li>
            <li>I filled the reservoir and turned the heat to the second highest setting.  </li>
            <li>But, overall I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>However, the water runs out at a alarmingly fast rate and even if you have water in the reserve, there is not a steam output on every section you&#x27;re straightening.  </li>
            <li>but what if I want straight hair?  </li>
            <li>My hair looks fried whenever I use it, and it does not stay straight throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I have 3c hair if anyone wants to know.</li>
            <li>It really straightens without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Really straigtens hair without burning.  </li>
            <li>It styles my hair really well.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair</li>
            <li>I really wanted one with steam.</li>
            <li>They are very durable.</li>
            <li>The nano styles fast</li>
            <li>i swear it really does leave your hair just like it says it would</li>
            <li>The Chi was longer and harder to work with (top of my haircut is short).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>No problems, still works really well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that much time in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Seems to leave my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>However, you don&#x27;t need the steam so much.</li>
            <li>It just really locks in moisture on humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>she has very curly hair</li>
            <li>The steam feature really helps with my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this iron, even after washing it, much easier.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I did not find the built in combs to be really helpful</li>
            <li>(well depends hoe fast</li>
            <li>Myb kids like so much.</li>
            <li>The hair stays straight ALL DAY</li>
            <li>However, I had to use my CHI after using this straightener because my hair wasn&#x27;t straight.</li>
            <li>After looking around for a hair straightener that would not damage my hair yet, help it stay straight</li>
            <li>and i really didnt see a difference in with the steam or without.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any steam being used.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t steam as much as I would like it and the water goes away really fast.</li>
            <li>so it still looked frizzy and not sleek and straight.</li>
            <li>I like the steam feature, which really does impart a glossy sleekness to your hair, and</li>
            <li>hair styling tool that promised straight hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the steam function...</li>
            <li>I was expecting performance more similar to a professional model.</li>
            <li>but I told myself that if it wasn&#x27;t any better than my old one it was going back.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you keep it handy in your laboratory it wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal....</li>
            <li>Only features that would improve it would be a higher temperature setting and a cool handle piece at end when in passing hair through.</li>
            <li>ok so i bought this flat iron mainly because of the cool water thingy that actually creates steam and leaves</li>
            <li>The functions are easy to adjust and works better than average overall.  </li>
            <li>I had thought that with the steam it would be frizzy but it does such a great job that I quit using relaxers to tame my hair.</li>
            <li>The water container is easy to fill in the sink if you pull both of the rubber stoppers off the back (they are connected so not hard to do), it took me about a week to realize there were two holes with stoppers instead of just one</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice it worked any better than my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li>it does not work any better then any of the other irons I have used.  </li>
            <li>but I compared ratings on Consumer Reports and other sites and this one was rated better than other models twice the price, and I have to say after having used it for over a month now that it&#x27;s everything I&#x27;d hoped for and more.</li>
            <li>I am just very careful with making sure my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the cracks of the steam compartment.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many straightener and flat iron but the temperature never gets hot enough to get my hair shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>Con - the reservoir runs dry VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>so you can style dry hair easily.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as good as the other flat irons.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Should have spent a little more money on something better quality.</li>
            <li>The only think I would suggest it to work fast because the water runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>hair is beautifully straight and with much more volume than the typical iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is not long anymore, so it&#x27;s even better for short and poofy hair after blow drying it.</li>
            <li>The directions say not to take off the water chamber when the iron is still hot, so that is pretty much the only con I found with this.</li>
            <li>The price was excellent, I tried researching other places for this same product, it was way more expensive.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one I have purchased for myself and I like the steam action.  </li>
            <li>But like I say, that&#x27;s more down to my hair type.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair straightener hands down.</li>
            <li>It still works now, but my husband jsut got me a new one for my birthday!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy thick curly hair and with this product, for the first time in my life, I am able to have shiney straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight all day and, unlike any other product, it even stays relatively straight and smooth after sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In places where my hair is relatively straight to begin with, it will give it a more flat, polished look, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to taming my mermaid waves in the back.</li>
            <li>Really neeeded a new hair straightner</li>
            <li>I did not remember what my hair looked like prior to relaxing it since the age of 6 therefore, going natural was huge.</li>
            <li>Chemically relaxed hair requires less heat then non chemically relaxed hair in most cases.</li>
            <li>The main reason is because of the steam.  </li>
            <li>Well I got it in the mail today and tried it out straight away, in about 30-45 minutes my hair was done (so much faster than my old one)</li>
            <li>Is what I want, when I search and see the specifications, the product is excelent, This buy is in substitution of the older.</li>
            <li>But, my hair is not very cooperative with the smooth, straight hairstyles.</li>
            <li>My older model works</li>
            <li>I remember my older brother using this while we were in Florida one year for vacation...</li>
            <li>particularly for the price and the hype.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different hair straighteners, from Paul Brown, Chi, Fhi, Zoe, and recently Kiyosaki.  </li>
            <li>In 10 years I have only purchased 2 of these, and the most recent one was just 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>Skip it unless you&#x27;re in some sort of a pinch and can&#x27;t find a styling tool that&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>This one heat quickly lots of different heat settings.  </li>
            <li>I am an older lady</li>
            <li>It could have been better but let me tell you, I am African American with THAT hair.</li>
            <li>I am of Caucasian/Hispanic decent.</li>
            <li>It left my hair super silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li>We have super curly african/indian american hair.</li>
            <li>She has short hair and the iron is wider than most, 1.5\\&quot;, and she could not get the iron close enough to her head.  </li>
            <li>using the flat irons combined heat, steam and comb options and the Chi Deep Brilliance shampoo, conditioner &amp;&amp; silk reflection i have been able to wear my natural hair without a relaxer for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>That is really great for me because I have left my other one on all day!!!!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair sleek and thinner looking and very very soft!</li>
            <li>I have drawers full of curling irons and flat irons that just don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to</li>
            <li>Conair SS9 Infiniti Nano Silver High Temperature Ionic Steam Straightener]]  </li>
            <li>I purchased this iron because it was rated highly by Consumer Reports.  </li>
            <li>No need to turn up to high heat.</li>
            <li>I always use the high heat setting and always use the high steam setting.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any of my friends or strangers.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It works OK, but still leaves my hair a little frizzy.</li>
            <li>I got this as a birthday present 5 years ago and this still gets really hot!</li>
            <li>I should have done a little more research before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Use it more than once to get used to it, it IS rather heavy, but I feel it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to have the heat as high as I normally would because the steam helps straighten the hair as well.  </li>
            <li>the tips of my hair were frizzy because I was doing it wrong, lol.</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t really get my hair completely straightened though.</li>
            <li>I had an old Conair steam straightener from about 10 years ago with stainless steel plates.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair soft, polished, straight, and even movable(I can wear pony tails again and not look like a broom end!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received compliments on how straight and shiny my hair is(it looked professional).</li>
            <li>If you want straight hair, this is not the product for natural 4B/4C hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was extremely soft but not bone straight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the steam feature in the summer much as my hair is naturally curly and the steam feature doesn&#x27;t work well in the humid weather for me.</li>
            <li>The steamer works, but I&#x27;ve never used it too much (even on my old one)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>it will last you a long time and it is durable as well I also love the color as well.</li>
            <li>I kept it, but I have gone back to using my Wet 2 Straight most of the time.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, she liked it because I have not heard a complaint</li>
            <li>It use it almost everyday because I love the results.</li>
            <li>My hair is not difficult to straighten as it is only wavy to begin with; yet I have to go over each section 2 or 3 times to get it straight.</li>
            <li>There is an adjustable comb that can be completely adjusted flat (so there is no comb) or up two different lengths, and I love to use that on my hair.  </li>
            <li>You can either use a dental syringe, or you can cover one of the holes up, and under the faucet pour the water in the larger of the two holes and alternatley turn it right side up to let the air out.  </li>
            <li>so my long hair would have been super.  </li>
            <li>This conair heats up very quickly, and quickly straightens crazy bedhead to a smooth sleek look.</li>
            <li>The second one was fine although the silver silender holding the hairdryer wasn&#x27;t closing like it should the magnectic clasp wasn&#x27;t shutting properly</li>
            <li>I use distilled water, and make sure the iron is hot enough before squeezing the water button a few times.</li>
            <li>Still, I could not be happier with it and it allows me to play around with new ideas.</li>
            <li>and I decided to just get a new one.</li>
            <li>I used this for New Years</li>
            <li>It was brand new.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li>Giving it 3 stars because it is a fairly neutral rating, product worked, was just a bad fit between item and user.     </li>
            <li>Straightens my hair in half the time and looks way more healthy then it did with my wet to dry one..</li>
            <li>My old iron was a cheap, 2-inch wide one that would get my hair stick-straight.  </li>
            <li>The steam chamber is much nicer than my old Conair and works every time (which was an issue with my old conair).</li>
            <li>The comb is also very helpful as it makes it easier to keep the streaks straight to the tips without needing to use an extra comb.</li>
            <li>And the steam leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>very  soft  feeling.  </li>
            <li>The steam is not overpowering and it&#x27;s easy to fill with water without making a mess.  </li>
            <li>I find that if I move very slowly and hold the iron VERY tightly, without using the built in teeth, and with the steam reservoir on the bottom, it works the best.</li>
            <li>This completely does what it says!</li>
            <li>but im not sure i love it.  </li>
            <li>But as a warning to those who DO expect pin straight hair from this flat iron: the hair will begin to revert at the tips almost minutes after doing it, so it won&#x27;t be straight like on the picture unless you heat train your hair.</li>
            <li>And, using the Nano Silver Stream Straightner transforms it into soft, shiny hair!</li>
            <li>have had my hair at many different lengths, from chin to middle back.  </li>
            <li>First, if you saw the informercial, it IS possible to get the results they show.</li>
            <li>I have wavy blonde hair with some frizz, I remembered steam curling irons from years back and steam rollers that made my hair more shiny than just heat, so when I saw this at this low price after seeing it when it was $100.00 I thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>And did I mention soft!</li>
            <li>My hair has never been soft!</li>
            <li>I got my first one in 2004 and it finally just broke</li>
            <li>I think it may have lost a star from when I first started using to just last week.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve decided to get my hair \\&quot;trained\\&quot; first before going back to the steam iron.</li>
            <li>I PAID $60 THE FIRST TIME, AND $35 THE SECOND TIME!!!</li>
            <li>This was the second one that came to me the first the box was damaged through packaging.  </li>
            <li>My daughter used her first one for years until she finally wore it out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gets hot enough.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re barely there and do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>first then go back over my hair with the comb part out and</li>
            <li>I live in an area that has soft water and has lime deposits.</li>
            <li>I started using her old straightner myself and then borrowed her new Infiniti one.  </li>
            <li>It really works and leaves my hair shinny, silky and  straight all day long</li>
            <li>With my previous straighteners, the hair glides over the plates smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I owe the ceramic pro which works very well, however, this product works really well on my daughters long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is not a bad straightener, but if I had it to do over, I would have gotten the same brand that my daughter uses.</li>
            <li>Some days it would turn out alright, but it never stayed straight for very long and it really fried my hair.</li>
            <li>Some of it would be slightly curly, some of it would curl under, some of it would curl over, and most of it would just look like I hadn&#x27;t brushed it in years.  </li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and this was the only straightner that would actually work on my hair.</li>
            <li>I found this straightener while browsing the internet one day and was kind of skeptical, but I was ready to try something new</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it left my hair incredibly straight and soft!</li>
            <li>I have pretty straight, thick hair that needs the flat iron to give me that sleek, smooth look that I can&#x27;t get from a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didnt get 5 stars is because it should hold just a little more water for the steam.</li>
            <li>The only three set backs are that it&#x27;s a little on the bulky side, you will not be able to get close to the hair shaft, and the max temperature setting is 395 F.</li>
            <li>Not a great \\&quot;hair\\&quot; person, but this has made me look amazing time and time again.  </li>
            <li>The Infiniti Straightener worked great on my crazy hair.</li>
            <li>I am so amazed because the last time i straightened my hair with a ceramic stove and iron, I SPENT 3 HOURS TO GET MY HAIR SMOOTH AND SILKY.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft, looking shiny, not frizzy, and of course straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to consciously adjust how I hold it, but I really think it&#x27;s also a design flaw repeated by Conair in different models, as well.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the 2ish months I&#x27;ve had it so far, it has not fallen apart, so</li>
            <li>Overall, a very convenient product.</li>
            <li>Much quicker than my last one.</li>
            <li>I use it frequently.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s completely \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; to heat.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m also using as much heat protecting products as possible, so that could be it.</li>
            <li>I purchessed it for my 16 year old daughter</li>
            <li>straightens the thickest hair and leaves it soft as well.</li>
            <li>By far this one had the highest marks and satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>I will buy another brand next time and hope that it lasts much longer than the Conair model.</li>
            <li>We have natural curly hair and the straightner leave our hair...</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>But I always felt like it didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, so the difference was getting too noticeable</li>
            <li>After fixing my hair I can not tell the difference between my natural hair and chemically straightened hair.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>This item was purchased as a gift for my 15 year old granddaughter who listed it as her #1 request this year.</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t listening to her because I kept feeling my hair and thinking about how soft it felt.  </li>
            <li>I threw away the old straightner and bought myself</li>
            <li>There are no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>This is a sturdy, trusty straightener that worked seamlessly for 6 years.</li>
            <li>so much words cannot possibly describe it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>regularly professionally dyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to eliminate relaxing my hair and go all natural.</li>
            <li>For natural hair it doesnt do the job of straigten like i wanted, but i use it often when i want a wrap look or straighten hair after a wash.</li>
            <li>And even then it&#x27;s poofy and frizzy which is not the way my hair naturally falls.</li>
            <li>u are im slow) but ither than that i love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and getting my hair to look like it does when I leave the salon happens by pure luck with my old flat irons but</li>
            <li>I prefer the maxiglide over this but as a flat iron it really straigten the hair out and leave it soft and moisturized.on relax hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this flat iron on air dried braided hair.</li>
            <li>Get over yourself if you think you can whip out shiny straight flat hair in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you really need to get close to the roots you may need a hotter flat iron.</li>
            <li>I really like this affordable flat iron.  </li>
            <li>The flat iron is bulky and because of this it can&#x27;t get very close to the root of my hair</li>
            <li>The steam element on this flat iron makes for hair that&#x27;s sleek and straight.</li>
            <li>The only \\&quot;bad\\&quot; thing about this product is that from the first use, the red paint near the steam plates (corners) has been coming off.  </li>
            <li>short, much better than any other flat iron&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I noticed a distinct lack of opinion from my \\&quot;hair demographic\\&quot; and felt ladies who were like me might like a little info on how it might work for them.</li>
            <li>Instead of leaving my hair feeling silky, it felt more coarse than usual, and caused my hair to flip out at the ends no matter what I did.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as an essential beauty item.</li>
            <li>This heats high enough to straighten her hair.  </li>
            <li>The teeth in the plates have three levels, no teeth, mid-height, and tall, and the steam you can either turn off, have on low, or have on high.  </li>
            <li>I have another conair typical flat iron that I got at a chain retailer that cost only about $29.95 and works way better than this one.</li>
            <li>and it really didn&#x27;t take that long to straighten it all--nor</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of tools and products in the market to make my hair straight and to be like that all day long.</li>
            <li>Still, the unit doesn&#x27;t get as hot as expected</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I am lucky that there was nothing flammable near it or my entire house could have burned down.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel like a new and different person.</li>
            <li>Got my last one 8 months ago, and already need a new one.</li>
            <li>The water does run out fast, but I simply turn it off and fill it back up.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, my hair is really thick, frizzy, and coarse.</li>
            <li>You have to be very careful when using this because if it leaks it&#x27;s hot water and can burn you.</li>
            <li>I have bought flat irons as low as $25 and and much as $125.  </li>
            <li>Even with humid air, I found my straight streaks last much longer than with my previous straightener without even the tips curling up.</li>
            <li>for the use of distilled water -- if you do not have very hard water where you live, tap water will work fine.</li>
            <li>I am a white female, with fine hair and a little bit of wave.  </li>
            <li>so i decided to buy myself a new flat iron for myself.</li>
            <li>I am receiving a NEW flat iron for \\&quot;free\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I am african american with naturally curly hair and this flat iron gets it bone straight without damaging it.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that you have keep the steam holes clean so the steam actually comes out.</li>
            <li>After a long research for a new one I finally found the same exact one flat iron.</li>
            <li>Cons-yes the water reserve does empty fast, but if you&#x27;re a mom or multi-tasker in the mornings like me, no worries.</li>
            <li>I am left with wavy hair, and I have to get out my old straightening iron to finish the job, which defeats the purpose.  </li>
            <li>I do have to use the highest settings because my hair is so curly, so coarse, so wild.  </li>
            <li>My old steam conair straightner finally broke after almost 8 years of use, and I knew I had to find one like the one I had.</li>
            <li>I accidentally left it on one morning and it never turned off and completely melted my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely used it.</li>
            <li>You cannot do it separately by a button on the outside like the old Maxius Maxiglide.  </li>
            <li>Spend the extra money on a professional straightener; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do.  </li>
            <li>AND I BARELY go to the salon anymore.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own and will randomly turn off (3-4 times each morning)</li>
            <li>this is just ok not a great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably just something I&#x27;m doing wrong, honestly...</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty thick, curly, and unruly but with this iron it becomes completely straight.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty slow for straightning hair that is VERY curly from a perm.  </li>
            <li>Being a woman of African American descent I love the fact that it works on my frizzy, curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s wrong with a nice silver color?</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t yet speak for the durability as I&#x27;ve only used it once and a jug of distilled water costs more than a jug of milk, but for the little amount you use, it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to dry my hair all of the way before use and now remember why I love my wet to dry flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go with a better quality salon straightener, or use one of Conair&#x27;s other products that are less expensive and work a lot better.</li>
            <li>It seems to be, overall, a normal flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than my old one inch flat iron and that takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>The flat iron in my opinion doesn&#x27;t get the hair as straight as a regular flat iron does.</li>
            <li>My hair does not fall off due to heat and it really works.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the container that leaks sometimes I&#x27;d give it a higher rating because it does work faster than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve tried and the straightening lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I actually ordered from Conair direct, and the product was on back order for a month.  </li>
            <li>But they don&#x27;t get as hot as my other flat irons.</li>
            <li>It did a decent job on my hair to get the minimal waves out I have after blow drying.</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair thick, it&#x27;s curly, frizzy, and basically an Afro if I let it air dry, and better yet,</li>
            <li>I am sad Conair does not manufacturer them anymore, but the were kind enough to tell me about a comparable product in it</li>
            <li>Since I had it for so long, I wanted to get a new one because after about 4 years of using it religiously, it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I recommend the the Infiniti Hair Straightner, it heats up quickly, you have the option of using a little steam or use it dry.  </li>
            <li>With very little product and no brush or blowdryer, I was able to completely straighten dry my hair in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Infinity heats up quickly and does a fantastic job straightening my VERY thick past my shoulders, un-relaxed ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>I have hair about a good ways past my shoulders, but its very thick.</li>
            <li>Tried w/day old dry hair &amp; thought, if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d wash/condition it and start again.</li>
            <li>I just wash my hair and let it dry naturally and then use the iron.</li>
            <li>But, no matter how much time and effort I put into my hair, it typically ends up wavy and frizzy within a matter of hours.</li>
            <li>have that strange, in-between hair that isn&#x27;t really wavy, but it&#x27;s definitely not straight.  </li>
            <li>My hair is curly, coarse, long and natural.</li>
            <li>super thick curly/frizzy</li>
            <li>I have SUPER curly hair, thick that is prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>The iron itself is not heavy and isn&#x27;t too large - but the iron is also not so small that you have to spend a lot of extra time using it.  </li>
            <li>if you hold it down too far on the outside like you can with other straighteners it gets hot on your hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to the harsh reality that though I get decent results, it just doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to give me long lasting results and thus I have reverted to using my older iron.</li>
            <li>My daughter also uses it on her very thick course hair and it leave it smooth and silky...</li>
            <li>The tiny, little steam resevoir lasts about 20 minutes which means you have to refill it at least every day with distilled water (I just love having a gallon of distilled water on my counter hogging up space).  </li>
            <li>and it takes less than 10 minutes to achieve a straight, flat, shiny look for work.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks so soft, shiny and straight that my friends and family are skeptical that I myself accomplished this.</li>
            <li>On average it takes about 20 minutes to straighten my whole head with long lasting results.</li>

            <li> I am very happy with my nano conair straightner.</li>
            <li> The steam is wonderful, and has no &amp;#34;frizzing&amp;#34; effect on your hair.  </li>
            <li> if so, the iron will stay greasy and you won&#x27;t achieve best results.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS LOOKS GREAT AND SHINY!</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS AMAZING!!!</li>

            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> and it is awesome.</li>

            <li> Very happy.</li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> I am still learning the steam mode but just using it without the steam gives awesome results...</li>

            <li> Very good, I love it...!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is so amazing!!</li>
            <li> It does a very good job of straightening my hair, but if I get any of my hair too close to the end of the iron it pulls my hair.</li>
            <li> it is a very good product to buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a very good job straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer than it has ever been and its sleek and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> She loved it!</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair beautifully</li>
            <li> This straigtener, although sort of bulky, works great.</li>
            <li> I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best straightener i have ever used.</li>
            <li> and I was happy to see that Amazon carried it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great straightner.  </li>
            <li> I got this at a great price as a gift for my sister and she was extremely happy.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> but she seems happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product its Great</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I immediately went to look for another one on amazon and am SO Happy they still have them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use distilled water in mine and it still works great with tap water.</li>
            <li> The steam feature is great as well as the variable temperature settings.</li>
            <li> The reviews were great on it</li>
            <li> I figured that using steam would be a great way to do that.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Though I will say that the combs are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I go over each section of hair twice, and it comes out great.  </li>
            <li> They do great on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Steam works great.  </li>
            <li> So happy for that.</li>
            <li> i used the chi thermal protection just to protect my hair and its a great product&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
            <li> this was a great buy for the money and it works so well on the hair</li>
            <li> This was a great bargain</li>
            <li> The flatiron works great as mentioned in Consumer Reports.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t win em&#x27; all.  </li>
            <li> I did NOT have to return mine and can donate it or keep it but will get my replacement by Jan 8th GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> so i bought it again and its great</li>
            <li> It straightenes with one pass reducing the amount of damage to the hair shaft and has lots of great features.</li>
            <li> The optional steam setting works great</li>
            <li> with this Conair product makes my hair looks great every time I use it.</li>
            <li> It works great without it.  </li>
            <li> It works  great with or w/out the steam.</li>
            <li> Great delivery</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this straightner on amazon</li>
            <li> This was a great product.</li>
            <li> This product works great</li>
            <li> I (still) love this straightening iron!!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li> It comes with a very nice heat resistant storage case.  </li>
            <li> Good price, good quality and does its job perfectly good!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Is the best tool I have bought, I think is even better than my T3 hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It would take me 20 to 25, on a good day.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loved the straightener.</li>
            <li> Superior service and reliability.</li>
            <li> really Good</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> my wife loved this iron....</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good hour investment of time, although I&#x27;ve gone up to 5 days without needing to wash my hair afterwards.    </li>
            <li> If I were to wash it and let it air-dry, it would look like a fascinating study in indecisiveness.  </li>
            <li> -Doesnt work good on Yaki or \\&quot;Ethnic Coarse\\</li>
            <li> The reviews were all good.  </li>
            <li> It is good in all the areas it touts....</li>
            <li> Well, I have used this item for over 2 months and decided now it is a good time to write a review.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The steam is good to and I can tell a difference between steaming it and not.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t duplicate the sleek look you get at the salon, but this does a good job of straightening my hair and making it manageable.  </li>
            <li> She just loved how it felt when I finished, as it was shiny and silky.     </li>
            <li> Seems to me to be of good qualiy.</li>
            <li> I have always thought Conair made cheap products, and this one is a perfect example.  </li>
            <li> It goes up to 390 degrees which I guess is good for me, otherwise I may burn my hair.  </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Both have ions and good plates.</li>
            <li> It was a good price.</li>
            <li> and good idea for gift.</li>
            <li> Did not heat up as good as it claimed to.</li>
            <li> We loved it.</li>
            <li> I saw all the good reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> REALLY GOOD...</li>
            <li> No perm, no texturizer, nothing but a super awesome afro.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice and handy aid, really nice results.</li>
            <li> In all I&#x27;m glad I bought it...was a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Her hair looks very healthy.  </li>
            <li> Love it and my hair looks great after using this iron.</li>
            <li> well worth it because it was the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> There are more settings than I need, but the basics are great.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how awesome it is (and im very picky)!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the steam and comb too!</li>
            <li> I had to go over each section more than once, saving NO time!  </li>
            <li> the Infinity also - now we each have one and both love it!</li>
            <li> I love the steam feature!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li> i love this straightener!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> The price was outstanding!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, it works perfectly, easy to use, and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a chi, but out of all the straighteners I&#x27;ve tried in the best, this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> This has been amazing for each length.  </li>
            <li> Great product, my hair comes out, fabulous</li>
            <li> which is amazing after seeing the prices on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The one I currently own, a Virtuo, which I paid about $100.00 for 3 years ago at the mall, does not have steam.  </li>
            <li> I had a Good experience trying that I just Love it.</li>
            <li> I own this product.</li>
            <li> As I stated in the title, it&#x27;s not the magic bullet of haircare, but it IS a good tool to have your arsenal.</li>
            <li> I was delighted with the price and her satisfaction made it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I had been using a folded towel on my dressing table to protect it and was thrilled to find that this had its own silver mat.  </li>
            <li> Who keeps that around--and where would you buy it, or have time to distill your own water just to put in a hair straightener?  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice shine to hair and softness.     </li>
            <li> Honestly I couldn&#x27;t style my hair if my life depended on it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see anything wonderful about this product, except that it looks nice.</li>
            <li> I had a Chi straightener for a while, but I really wasn&#x27;t very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it</li>
            <li> I guess over time using this is much better then without the moisture they say is good for the hair when applying heat.  </li>
            <li> Wife purchased item, worked well, she would have liked it if she had longer hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and my daughter glad with it</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT IS REALLY THAT GOOD!!</li>
            <li> This straightener is the best and most reasonably priced one I have ever used!</li>
            <li> but I need put in high level for best results.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because aesthetically its a nice straightener, I liked the 9 foot cord, and I liked the included carrying case that also functions as a counter top protecter.</li>
            <li> So coming from a teenager who just bought a straightener instead of a new iPod, I would say by this because it is THE BEST straightener ever!!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is great, works smoothly, and I do love the steam feature that this one has.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size and it doesn&#x27;t take me more than 5-10 minutes tops to get my hair ready now.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has done it again - a great product for a super price.</li>
            <li> it is very easy on processed blond hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This straightener is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> my 13 year old daughter says that this is the best straightener we have owned.</li>
            <li> My own experience has been outstanding.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST straightener EVER!!!</li>
            <li> The Infiniti is indeed the most effective straightener I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this straightner it heats up well, the steam is an amazing addition.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to be able to use this function when you want.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that my hair feels soft and still healthy.</li>
            <li> The best part is that while it comes out straight and smooth it does not lose body (having the correct styling creme helps).  </li>
            <li> The added steam feature is nice and I will use it more when it is more humid.</li>
            <li> The steam feature is also great if you have slept on your hair -- fast touch up!</li>
            <li> I had a ceramic iron made by Revlon that wasn&#x27;t very hot and just didn&#x27;t do a good job (plus I burned myself all the time).  </li>
            <li> I love that you can adjust the temperature with ease.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser said that using steam was better for hair so, I do like having that feature.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair straightener</li>
            <li> and I really like all the options for the steam (works great) and the heat settings.  </li>
            <li> Although I still love this straightener, it has started to have a mind of</li>
            <li> Make sure to have a bottle of room-temp filtered water nearby.</li>
            <li> all - just make sure you know how to use a straightener</li>
            <li> This straightener is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love that you can turn up the heat too because then this product will work on the curliest of hair.  </li>
            <li> I havent figured out if i like it better with or without the steam part.  </li>
            <li> After getting this this appears to have better hair days :-)</li>
            <li> From reading the reviews I thought this product would work better because of the steam.  </li>
            <li> i thought the teeth would hold the hair better and help straightedn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work better on hair that is not as curly as mine.</li>
            <li> We simply LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love.</li>
            <li> I love the case that comes with it as well.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted pin straight hair, I&#x27;d go get a weave, lol.</li>
            <li> Nothing makes the results any better...)</li>
            <li> Ok i purchase this straightner for mi wife, since arrive</li>
            <li> Oh, and it probably would have lasted longer if I have taken better care of it.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot more from this straightener. .</li>
            <li> , I thought it would straighten better and faster.  </li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> she tried many</li>
            <li> The steam feature is interesting</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t decide if it works better with or without using the steam)</li>
            <li> I only use conair since they have the best hair products ever.</li>
            <li> I thought it was okay</li>
            <li> I am NOT that girl who can just wash and go, but I&#x27;m also not the girl who can be bothered to spend more than 10-15 minutes doing anything about it.  </li>
            <li> Is is great however the piant comes off really fast</li>
            <li> Ok value.</li>
            <li> Hopes this helps :)</li>
            <li> Its OK I will keep it.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> I got this about 3 weeks ago &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying one for my sister as well! :)</li>
            <li> this one works like magic.</li>
            <li> While she could use a separate curler, she likes to be able to have one product which can serve both functions.</li>
            <li> But she does indicate, that the Conair works better than her chi, and she uses it most of the time.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4/5 :]</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for and love the steaming function</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use that one for the most part.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the packaging by amazon and the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself at Christmas, and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but the steam container started leaking after about a month.</li>
            <li> I just love this produce.  </li>
            <li> I love the combs, and the adjustable heat settings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41, bleach my hair, have well water, and love to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for healthy ways to style it.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.  </li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> This seems to work better for my hair when the steam is turned off.  </li>
            <li> I love the steam and the heat protecting case that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I also love the retractable comb as it seems to help glide it through my hair easier without pulling.</li>
            <li> Really works great...</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I also love the heat resistant storage pouch which also doubles up as a counter protector.</li>
            <li> KIND OF CHEAP</li>
            <li> how many passes I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing, but you should save your money and invest in a Chi.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this straightener</li>
            <li> and p.s comes with cute lilttle carrying case</li>
            <li> She said this one works much better than the one she replaced.</li>
            <li> go thru the instructions to make sure.</li>
            <li> Most times not :)</li>
            <li> Just started using steam function and love it.</li>
            <li> We all love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a bit to get used to, but once you do-you will LOVE the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this - but I will try to get them all on here.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this iron.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron.</li>
            <li> She saidit works like magic</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> But I love this</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good about this iron, I wish I had it three years ago!!!</li>
            <li> It better</li>
            <li> Looked more like a blow out.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> , I feel it straightens my hair better.</li>
            <li> , actually I love the comb feature.</li>
            <li> But as I continued to watch the ad i started to like it more and more.  </li>
            <li> and I have been in love with it ever since.</li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this one for my daughter in love for her birthday.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it on Amazon for $53.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better &amp; more lightweight than the  Maxiglide, at a way better price.</li>
            <li> and I love how it works.</li>
            <li> and we still love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift and my collegue was glad.</li>
            <li> I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> the fact that I can use it on damp hair is a time-saver as well as sparing my hair from more heat damage.</li>
            <li> it does take some time (7 min) to heat up and create steam, but I am ok with that.</li>
            <li> Many of my on-line pals are raving about the &amp;#34;Loreal Steam Pod&amp;#34; these days, but that is too pricey for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the teeth that pop out and comb my hair while straightening</li>
            <li> OK, so I bought this because I researched on Consumer Digest for the best selling, best overall flat iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Truly can&#x27;t say enough how this has made my life better and easier!!!</li>
            <li> So when I received this I was very excited.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a flat iron that I&#x27;ve used that is thinner and does an excellent job of straightening without pulling my hair.</li>
            <li> As an owner of two Chi flat irons, I have to say that I am impressed with this steam iron from Conair.  </li>
            <li> So I was using a ceramic Revlon flat iron with it to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best flat irons I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> the steam element on this flat iron is wonderful.</li>
            <li> iron may work for some people, but if you want very straight hair, I don&#x27;t think it is a good value.</li>
            <li> and i thought it worked pretty good when i borrowed hers.  </li>
            <li> I think the product is pretty good for the amount I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I was not born with the natural ability to be create beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews for this product, and it sounded pretty good.</li>
            <li> The original was priced at $100 and that was ON SALE!</li>
            <li> It got here quickly and the results were just amazing.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere on the internet, and heard that the chi&#x27;s were pretty good, but they broke easily.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is that it doesnt leave hair smelling burnt and looking ironed.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap one before and this one is much better than that.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;) enjoy</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it makes my hair</li>
            <li> When you see this straightener available, grab it because there aren&#x27;t many that they sell.</li>
            <li> I loved how it kept my hair straight and sleek.</li>
            <li> One more thing would have been more detailed instructions, though I was able to figure it out quickly</li>
            <li> But I am happy to live with that, if I have to, if it means fabulous hair.</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of dealing with high maintenance hair that never really looks good, I am impressed!</li>
            <li> Other the that, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> It straightens so easily;</li>
            <li> it heats up within 0 seconds and straightens easily.</li>
            <li> - water chamber was easy to remove, fill, and replace-&lt;br /&gt;had mine for 3 yrs -never clogged.</li>
            <li> the design is sleek and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> PROS  -Easy</li>
            <li> It would probably work even faster if it put out more steam, but overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It straightened my hair easily.</li>
            <li> I used it on her hair it and easily straightened her hair also.</li>
            <li> It is actually easy to use.</li>
            <li> And is very quick to heat.  </li>
            <li> Controls on the Conair extremely easy to use and SEE.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to straighten with this one(:</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, the temp is adjustable and it&#x27;s made well...</li>
            <li> Once I read how to use this product correctly, it was easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> I love love love this hair straightner and highly recommend it to everyone!  </li>
            <li> it works fine</li>
            <li> Medium works just fine.</li>
            <li> It is light, effective,and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Tried it both ways and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> It takes half the time to straighten my hair which makes me very happy.</li>
            <li> Hello   Expressly excellent device and works very actively.   </li>
            <li> I fell in love with it the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it might outperform my trusty Chi &amp; I would have a nice, shiny new flatiron, but I should have known better.</li>
            <li> This is a decent hair straightener, but it is lacking one very important feature - an auto shut off!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny, smooth, and super straightened!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and it is well worth the money</li>
            <li> It also made my hair very shiny, whereas the one I currently own does not.  </li>
            <li> Its not always a smooth glide</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth every penny :]</li>
            <li> Really cheap.</li>
            <li> I have contrary hair, so while it can be sleek and smooth when I leave the house in the morning, it&#x27;s sometimes somewhat frizzy by the time I get to work.  </li>
            <li> It is totally worth the money and comes with a cute travel pouch.</li>
            <li> also i ordered this with Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping on a Thursday afternoon &amp;&amp; it arrived that Friday morning just in time for the weekend.  </li>
            <li> The steam makes my hair shiny and smooth every time.  </li>
            <li> it does such a great job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;One thing that I didn&#x27;t expect, nor do I like, is that it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth going across the hair.  </li>
            <li> it makes your hair like baby hair, its so smooth.  </li>
            <li> My hair was great in the 80s, when perms and big hair were in.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out smooth and manageable all day.</li>
            <li> I have semi-long, very curly, frizzy hair with a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> After a few trials, the thing that I found was that this thing works best for my hair when ....</li>
            <li> Overall, a great buy.</li>
            <li> The retractable combs in the middle of the ceramic plates are great to guide my curly hair through them.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a backup flatiron when I found it dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> hair smooth and silkyy.</li>
            <li> (well enough to take on a Chi and win).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> itch her hair &amp;#34;looking a mess!&amp;#34;  Conair helps make it possible for her hair to look great.</li>
            <li> Still not as good as the old Maxiglide.  </li>
            <li> The best part: my hair stays straight for 2 or more days and it does not cause a lot of split ends like the other straighteners I&#x27;ve had.    </li>
            <li> The teeth in the flat iron part are awesome and very helpful, the part i dont like is</li>
            <li> Great flat iron with steam -</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li> Great Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> I have never paid $60 for a flat iron and now I know why I couldn&#x27;t get the great results with my hair that others were getting.  </li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li> With this iron take me 15 minutes to comb it, usually took me about 45 minutes to do it as perfect and straight as I liked.</li>
            <li> I had been interested in this iron for some time because it seemed like a great combination between my old Conair steam straightener and my ceramic one.</li>
            <li> this is a great hair steam flat iron,i was so excited</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Steam Straightener worked quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> And its so quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> my hair just looks amazing and it&#x27;s sooooo soft!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for more than a year, used it almost every day for 3 months straight, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> The steam makes it feel very soft and healthy, even on the more coarser looking areas underneath the outer layer of hair.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li> I followed the recommendations of consumer reports and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this straightener home...</li>
            <li> Also bought at a cheaper price than what it was originally.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I was still excited to try the product.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I was so excited to get this straightener.  </li>
            <li> I just love this hot iron.  </li>
            <li> This iron was recommended by consumer reports and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It is also most reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Infiniti Pro!! :)</li>
            <li> This is a decent iron for a pretty good price.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY picky with hair products, and having very fine wavy hair</li>
            <li> Love it, and very glad I was able to replace the previous one.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> My hair type is medium coarse &amp; I currently own a CHI - this works better than my CHI because of the shine &amp; now my hair is silkly.  </li>
            <li> I have three different hair straighteners and this one works the best by far.</li>
            <li> I figured before that my hair needed to be cut because my ends were so dry, but with this straightener, my ends looks great.  </li>
            <li> plus its super cheap here</li>
            <li> I also love that you can set it on different tempratures to adjust to any kind of hair.</li>
            <li> that I am currently trying to grow out, but I can honestly blow-dry my hair, run this straightener through it in less than 6 minutes, and be supremely happy with how it looks!  </li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was anything special.  </li>
            <li> And the little water chamber for steam infusion is brilliant.  </li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron that I ever used!It works great with my hair texture (African American)</li>
            <li> So, I just use this straightener and was able to get straight hair in 1 hour WITHOUT USING THE STEAM.</li>
            <li> The color makes it so cool</li>
            <li> The steam reservoir lasted only about 20 minutes on the lowest setting, and even on the highest heat setting, I didn&#x27;t feel that it did a good job of straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> The iron does a good job for awhile, but frizz comes back before the end of the workday on me.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> He was freaking out because he said he paid $150 dollars for it (whether or not this is true</li>
            <li> Truly the only time my hair looks good is when some else does it.</li>
            <li> My hair stays moisturized, straight, and most of all with plenty of movement.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job of straightening my daughters coarse hair</li>
            <li> One thing though, because I do it myself, the ends of the hair don&#x27;t look too nice, but that&#x27;s just the day that is done, by the next day the ends look fine.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second of this product I have owned it works wonderfully</li>
            <li> The steam feature makes her hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> I found that it heats up fast, and the extra amenities are great (steam capsule, heat-proof pouch, built-in combs, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> HEAT- heats super fast-no</li>
            <li> up quick  CONS  </li>
            <li> Think of a clothes iron -- when you use the steam feature, your wrinkles come out quick vs no steam.</li>
            <li> It tames the frizz quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the multiple temp, comb and steam settings, they give me much more control of my hairstyle while minimizing heat damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> One cannot add more water to keep on going with the steam because the whole iron gets too hot, so in order to get more steam it is necessary to wait until the iron is cool!!</li>
            <li> to use  -Ions and steam work great  -Adjustable temperature setting up to about 380 degrees   -comes with cool down and storage bag  -Heats</li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth shine and does so very fast.</li>
            <li> This product works better than other straighteners I have tried and own.</li>
            <li> The straightener worked great at it&#x27;s high temp setting of 395 to straighten with only one pass per two-inch section of hair.  </li>
            <li> Well, my friend told me that it could be the straightener and that I should try getting a new one, and I thought okay.</li>
            <li> I have long  hair and very  curly, I did purchase the infinity conair nano and it works great.</li>
            <li> Seems like most people with straight hair want curly and those with curly want straight!</li>
            <li> It is a nice result, and my hair feels pretty soft afterward too.</li>
            <li> I quickly got my package and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if it was worth the price.   </li>
            <li> It was extrememly fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> offs are not required on all electronics that get this hot as the chances that they will at some point accidentally be left are good.</li>
            <li> Infiniti Pro- Nano Silver Flat Iron- with steamer... is the best Flat Iron I&#x27;ve ever had, with no hair damage</li>
            <li> Fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I really like the adjustable heat settings and how easy it combs thought my hair without getting it tangle.</li>
            <li> After so many years of use, it&#x27;s been all used out with product build up causing a burning smell when heated, the water vessel falling out on it&#x27;s own and the comb stuck in the down position.</li>
            <li> Really!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to receive this in the mail because I am ALWAYS straightening my curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your hair is completely dry before using the product, and get distilled water, works better than using tap water.</li>
            <li> After using the comb-chase method and trimming my ends a bit, it straightens natural, kinky Afro hair just fine!</li>
            <li> Right size, quick heat up</li>
            <li> My first one still works but after all of these years it doesn&#x27;t seem like its steaming, probably just needs clean.</li>
            <li> I just used my flat iron on my hair today, and its pretty good</li>
            <li> This product is a pretty good steam flat iron.</li>
            <li> If you have time, or short hair it would be amazing.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair so straight and smooth badass straightener</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The steam is a good benefit, a real help in second day styling.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Solia flat iron since then and love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned and it comes with a case that you can put the flat iron in while its still hot.</li>
            <li> I obviously figured it out on my own and used a medicine dispenser to pour water into the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron and used it for the first time on a very rainy day (which would usually cause my hair to frizz) and it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Its worth it for the price but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> Second, the steam feature is perfect for people with naturally wavy or curly hair because it really helps to straighten fast.</li>
            <li> This iron is FAR better than my 100+ dollar Chi iron, when I bought this one on sale for $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even After my Japanese straightener it works great smoothing your hair completely and fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, if you have natural or chemically treated hair, please make sure you use a hair protectant to help minimize the damage from the heat.</li>
            <li> I had to be sure after that to put all of my hair in the section before the compartment started or take the cover off completely.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.  </li>
            <li> You also have to be careful not to go too close to your scalp, trust me a burst of steam to the scalp does NOT feel good.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to describe my hair as soft before.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports indicated this iron straightens hair better than the Chi, so I decided to give it a try since there is a considerable price</li>
            <li> It was worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is a nice shade of red though!</li>
            <li> While I like it, it is heavier than I was used to (I left my perfect flat iron at a hotel and have no idea what brand it was to replace it), doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair out like my old one and just took a lot of getting used to.  </li>
            <li> i only passed it once and my hair ws straight over all this is the best flat iron i have ever used!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron about four years ago and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I must say after using this product I will not use another kind of straightner or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a small inexpensive one and decided to upgrade, and in fact really I was prepared to spend more money for a good one</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> The teeth are just right.</li>
            <li> The heat control is placed right where your thumb goes when straitening your hair</li>
            <li> Compared to the Chi and Hot Tools I&#x27;ve used, this gives the most professional results, both look and feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to tell when it&#x27;s working, simply from the sights and sounds of using it</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer below who mentioned that the steam resevoir doesn&#x27;t last very long (it will run out of water in 10 mins) and the quality of the ceramic plates isn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
            <li> I have owned this exact flat iron for about 5 years now and loved it so much I bought this one as a gift.  </li>
            <li> This is worth it and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried one someone else purchased and spent my hard earned money on a Chi, now that is a great straightener!</li>
            <li> The water in the reservoir(which was full) ran out before I can even finish my whole hair (shoulder length).</li>
            <li> And not just my normal puffy, frizzy, why-did-I-even-bother straightening - - - smooth, shiny, like-I-had-a-blowout-at-the-salon straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only takes me an hour to straighten my hair which is a record for me, and now it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li> So I think its a nice investment as long as you know what you&#x27;re getting when you get it!  </li>
            <li> The digital screen is awesome and sooo much easier than the other rotating ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Gave my wife one last year and my daughter liked it so much I bought her one this year.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair perfectly straight and its quick too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great products for African American hair.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and not damaging to hair like the old style straighteners.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heats quickly, straightens hair fast and the style holds.</li>
            <li> This nearly straighten my hair what most would consider to be bone straight.</li>
            <li> I got this staightner because of all the great reviews it had from african american women.</li>
            <li> I love how this straightner leaves my hair straight and soft for days.</li>
            <li> Also I like that my hair looks natural, more straight, but still has volume.</li>
            <li> First, the Nano Silver technology really provides fast, smooth, silky results.</li>
            <li> made my hair very straight and soft,but it took forever!If</li>
            <li> This product made her hair very straight</li>
            <li> The Conair Steam Straightener gets my hair very straight.</li>
            <li> This flat iron offers some good features and was well rated.  </li>
            <li> yesterday abd have used it yesterday and today - I cannot believe how straight my hair is!</li>
            <li> In fact, it was too straight!</li>
            <li> and i think the no steam actually works better.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it snags strands of my hair in the gaps around the hot plates and the steam capsule.  </li>
            <li> This was my first straightener ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try blow drying my hair straighter next time and see if I get better results.  </li>
            <li> : Actually, I felt I should edit this review because I found out something interesting -</li>
            <li> My first one broke though.  </li>
            <li> I figured the first was a fluke, so I bought another one</li>
            <li> Even more, it won&#x27;t curl back.</li>
            <li> Love the steam, I am growing out short hair</li>
            <li> I am going back to the store today to get another one to put in the closet just in case :)</li>
            <li> This is the first straightener i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> She raves about it, she finds it exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> this was the most I have spent on any hair product, ever (I know, I know, I am cheap/poor), and I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what a steam straightener could do to my head full of unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first when I seen that it had a steam feature, I thought that would not help my curly-fro...</li>
            <li> and it still works just as well as the first time I got it.</li>
            <li> I had to further turn it up to the highest setting to get better results.  </li>
            <li> I have had no issues with filling, steam or use of this hot iron.  </li>
            <li> The Conair left my hair shinier and in better condition.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> WHEN THIS FIRST CAME OUT, IT WAS $120.</li>
            <li> It does get really HOT at 395</li>
            <li> but it is pretty.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is the auto shut-off if it&#x27;s left on.</li>
            <li> your products have never failed me,</li>
            <li> Pretty neat steam function and comb feature</li>
            <li> I first saw this product on an ad on television.</li>
            <li> And I love that it is in my fave color red.</li>
            <li> I first bought it in Target years ago and ended up giving it to my sister.  </li>
            <li> First time: stolen by my friend.</li>
            <li> Conair steaming iron works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than a regular iron, my hair is shiny after the steam iron.</li>
            <li> Not only does this flat iron work as promised, but it&#x27;s excellent for daily touch ups.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product even though I feel it does not adequately heat up.  </li>
            <li> easy burn your hand if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron so much I returned my Chi Air!</li>
            <li> I love the steam portion of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my steam flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love the built in steamer and the fact that hair does not burn my fingers after I use the flat iron on it; this is a sign of not having you hair damaged with every use.</li>
            <li> I recommend this flat iron to anyone, regardless of the thickness of hair. :)</li>
            <li> The Infinity 1 1/2 Steam Flat Iron by Conair works fabulously!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my flat iron for more than a year.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair is amazingly straight, shiny, smooth and SOFT.</li>
            <li> Well first off the price is very high...</li>
            <li> Finally, and most importantly, the results last!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much silkier and softer since using this hot iron.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this is the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The steam part doesn&#x27;t hold much water at all, and you have to turn it off and let it cool down before you add more water.  </li>
            <li> This is fine by me, &#x27;cause I did not want actually want pin straight hair (I like my afro!).</li>
            <li> At first it takes practice to get the water chamber filled up, but it comes easy after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s getting more than one star is because my little sister used it as well and liked it, even though her hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li> I think it also makes my hair feel more dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Product is pretty good with thick and course hair.</li>
            <li> This Conair straightener certainly works, in fact, I can get my hair straighter if I work at it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this straightener!!</li>
            <li> I found this iron to be wider than I would like, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot and you end up with breakage because hair gets caught around the water reservoir which you also have to refill frequently.</li>
            <li> I am white with wavy fine hair that would never straighten for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and I only have to take it thru once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a very high expectation from this Conair Infiniti</li>
            <li> That flat iron easily straighten her hair out.</li>
            <li> I would definitely compared this to be as good if not better than other steam flat irons out there; and was a very good value for this product.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> and this keeps my curls straight.</li>
            <li> so it fills MUCH easier now.  </li>
            <li> The steam really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy/curly</li>
            <li> My hair is straight with tons of body.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to keep going over the hair to make it straight.</li>
            <li> With this one, I found that the steam and ions really smooth and soften my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t actually straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> It lvs hair straight and shinny.</li>
            <li> While both the Chi and Instyler made my hair straight they didn&#x27;t get rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly so it is ready to use in a minute or so.  </li>
            <li> That is what i was really wanting, for my hair to stay straighter.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped and arrived within a reasonable time as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I have really curly and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> well, straight.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m learning to deal with it since this iron does the job (and is much cheaper than like alternatives).</li>
            <li> and it was so fast</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t steam as much as I would like it and the water goes away really fast.</li>
            <li> an will probably not burnn my hair as much.</li>
            <li> I like this straight iron</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t quite get it perfectly straight from my scalp to the end of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know)</li>
            <li> Well I remember it worked really well then.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This  straightner  works  very  </li>
            <li> The Infinit by Conair works really well.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s when your hair has bubble-like lesions which are actually gas filled cavities created by the rapid vaporization of moisture within the hair-shaft.</li>
            <li> Heats fast and has a heat proof bag to put it in?</li>
            <li> I filled the reservoir and turned the heat to the second highest setting.  </li>
            <li> But, overall I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> However, the water runs out at a alarmingly fast rate and even if you have water in the reserve, there is not a steam output on every section you&#x27;re straightening.  </li>
            <li> but what if I want straight hair?  </li>
            <li> My hair looks fried whenever I use it, and it does not stay straight throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I have 3c hair if anyone wants to know.</li>
            <li> It really straightens without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Really straigtens hair without burning.  </li>
            <li> It styles my hair really well.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair</li>
            <li> I really wanted one with steam.</li>
            <li> They are very durable.</li>
            <li> The nano styles fast</li>
            <li> i swear it really does leave your hair just like it says it would</li>
            <li> The Chi was longer and harder to work with (top of my haircut is short).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> No problems, still works really well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much time in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Seems to leave my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> However, you don&#x27;t need the steam so much.</li>
            <li> It just really locks in moisture on humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she has very curly hair</li>
            <li> The steam feature really helps with my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this iron, even after washing it, much easier.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I did not find the built in combs to be really helpful</li>
            <li> (well depends hoe fast</li>
            <li> Myb kids like so much.</li>
            <li> The hair stays straight ALL DAY</li>
            <li> However, I had to use my CHI after using this straightener because my hair wasn&#x27;t straight.</li>
            <li> After looking around for a hair straightener that would not damage my hair yet, help it stay straight</li>
            <li> and i really didnt see a difference in with the steam or without.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any steam being used.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t steam as much as I would like it and the water goes away really fast.</li>
            <li> so it still looked frizzy and not sleek and straight.</li>
            <li> I like the steam feature, which really does impart a glossy sleekness to your hair, and</li>
            <li> hair styling tool that promised straight hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the steam function...</li>
            <li> I was expecting performance more similar to a professional model.</li>
            <li> but I told myself that if it wasn&#x27;t any better than my old one it was going back.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you keep it handy in your laboratory it wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal....</li>
            <li> Only features that would improve it would be a higher temperature setting and a cool handle piece at end when in passing hair through.</li>
            <li> ok so i bought this flat iron mainly because of the cool water thingy that actually creates steam and leaves</li>
            <li> The functions are easy to adjust and works better than average overall.  </li>
            <li> I had thought that with the steam it would be frizzy but it does such a great job that I quit using relaxers to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> The water container is easy to fill in the sink if you pull both of the rubber stoppers off the back (they are connected so not hard to do), it took me about a week to realize there were two holes with stoppers instead of just one</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice it worked any better than my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li> it does not work any better then any of the other irons I have used.  </li>
            <li> but I compared ratings on Consumer Reports and other sites and this one was rated better than other models twice the price, and I have to say after having used it for over a month now that it&#x27;s everything I&#x27;d hoped for and more.</li>
            <li> I am just very careful with making sure my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the cracks of the steam compartment.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many straightener and flat iron but the temperature never gets hot enough to get my hair shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> Con - the reservoir runs dry VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> so you can style dry hair easily.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as good as the other flat irons.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Should have spent a little more money on something better quality.</li>
            <li> The only think I would suggest it to work fast because the water runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> hair is beautifully straight and with much more volume than the typical iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is not long anymore, so it&#x27;s even better for short and poofy hair after blow drying it.</li>
            <li> The directions say not to take off the water chamber when the iron is still hot, so that is pretty much the only con I found with this.</li>
            <li> The price was excellent, I tried researching other places for this same product, it was way more expensive.  </li>
            <li> This is the first one I have purchased for myself and I like the steam action.  </li>
            <li> But like I say, that&#x27;s more down to my hair type.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair straightener hands down.</li>
            <li> It still works now, but my husband jsut got me a new one for my birthday!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy thick curly hair and with this product, for the first time in my life, I am able to have shiney straight hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight all day and, unlike any other product, it even stays relatively straight and smooth after sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In places where my hair is relatively straight to begin with, it will give it a more flat, polished look, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to taming my mermaid waves in the back.</li>
            <li> Really neeeded a new hair straightner</li>
            <li> I did not remember what my hair looked like prior to relaxing it since the age of 6 therefore, going natural was huge.</li>
            <li> Chemically relaxed hair requires less heat then non chemically relaxed hair in most cases.</li>
            <li> The main reason is because of the steam.  </li>
            <li> Well I got it in the mail today and tried it out straight away, in about 30-45 minutes my hair was done (so much faster than my old one)</li>
            <li> Is what I want, when I search and see the specifications, the product is excelent, This buy is in substitution of the older.</li>
            <li> But, my hair is not very cooperative with the smooth, straight hairstyles.</li>
            <li> My older model works</li>
            <li> I remember my older brother using this while we were in Florida one year for vacation...</li>
            <li> particularly for the price and the hype.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different hair straighteners, from Paul Brown, Chi, Fhi, Zoe, and recently Kiyosaki.  </li>
            <li> In 10 years I have only purchased 2 of these, and the most recent one was just 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Skip it unless you&#x27;re in some sort of a pinch and can&#x27;t find a styling tool that&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> This one heat quickly lots of different heat settings.  </li>
            <li> I am an older lady</li>
            <li> It could have been better but let me tell you, I am African American with THAT hair.</li>
            <li> I am of Caucasian/Hispanic decent.</li>
            <li> It left my hair super silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li> We have super curly african/indian american hair.</li>
            <li> She has short hair and the iron is wider than most, 1.5\\&quot;, and she could not get the iron close enough to her head.  </li>
            <li> using the flat irons combined heat, steam and comb options and the Chi Deep Brilliance shampoo, conditioner &amp;&amp; silk reflection i have been able to wear my natural hair without a relaxer for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> That is really great for me because I have left my other one on all day!!!!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair sleek and thinner looking and very very soft!</li>
            <li> I have drawers full of curling irons and flat irons that just don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to</li>
            <li> Conair SS9 Infiniti Nano Silver High Temperature Ionic Steam Straightener]]  </li>
            <li> I purchased this iron because it was rated highly by Consumer Reports.  </li>
            <li> No need to turn up to high heat.</li>
            <li> I always use the high heat setting and always use the high steam setting.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any of my friends or strangers.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works OK, but still leaves my hair a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday present 5 years ago and this still gets really hot!</li>
            <li> I should have done a little more research before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Use it more than once to get used to it, it IS rather heavy, but I feel it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to have the heat as high as I normally would because the steam helps straighten the hair as well.  </li>
            <li> the tips of my hair were frizzy because I was doing it wrong, lol.</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t really get my hair completely straightened though.</li>
            <li> I had an old Conair steam straightener from about 10 years ago with stainless steel plates.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair soft, polished, straight, and even movable(I can wear pony tails again and not look like a broom end!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received compliments on how straight and shiny my hair is(it looked professional).</li>
            <li> If you want straight hair, this is not the product for natural 4B/4C hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely soft but not bone straight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the steam feature in the summer much as my hair is naturally curly and the steam feature doesn&#x27;t work well in the humid weather for me.</li>
            <li> The steamer works, but I&#x27;ve never used it too much (even on my old one)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> it will last you a long time and it is durable as well I also love the color as well.</li>
            <li> I kept it, but I have gone back to using my Wet 2 Straight most of the time.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, she liked it because I have not heard a complaint</li>
            <li> It use it almost everyday because I love the results.</li>
            <li> My hair is not difficult to straighten as it is only wavy to begin with; yet I have to go over each section 2 or 3 times to get it straight.</li>
            <li> There is an adjustable comb that can be completely adjusted flat (so there is no comb) or up two different lengths, and I love to use that on my hair.  </li>
            <li> You can either use a dental syringe, or you can cover one of the holes up, and under the faucet pour the water in the larger of the two holes and alternatley turn it right side up to let the air out.  </li>
            <li> so my long hair would have been super.  </li>
            <li> This conair heats up very quickly, and quickly straightens crazy bedhead to a smooth sleek look.</li>
            <li> The second one was fine although the silver silender holding the hairdryer wasn&#x27;t closing like it should the magnectic clasp wasn&#x27;t shutting properly</li>
            <li> I use distilled water, and make sure the iron is hot enough before squeezing the water button a few times.</li>
            <li> Still, I could not be happier with it and it allows me to play around with new ideas.</li>
            <li> and I decided to just get a new one.</li>
            <li> I used this for New Years</li>
            <li> It was brand new.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars because it is a fairly neutral rating, product worked, was just a bad fit between item and user.     </li>
            <li> Straightens my hair in half the time and looks way more healthy then it did with my wet to dry one..</li>
            <li> My old iron was a cheap, 2-inch wide one that would get my hair stick-straight.  </li>
            <li> The steam chamber is much nicer than my old Conair and works every time (which was an issue with my old conair).</li>
            <li> The comb is also very helpful as it makes it easier to keep the streaks straight to the tips without needing to use an extra comb.</li>
            <li> And the steam leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> very  soft  feeling.  </li>
            <li> The steam is not overpowering and it&#x27;s easy to fill with water without making a mess.  </li>
            <li> I find that if I move very slowly and hold the iron VERY tightly, without using the built in teeth, and with the steam reservoir on the bottom, it works the best.</li>
            <li> This completely does what it says!</li>
            <li> but im not sure i love it.  </li>
            <li> But as a warning to those who DO expect pin straight hair from this flat iron: the hair will begin to revert at the tips almost minutes after doing it, so it won&#x27;t be straight like on the picture unless you heat train your hair.</li>
            <li> And, using the Nano Silver Stream Straightner transforms it into soft, shiny hair!</li>
            <li> have had my hair at many different lengths, from chin to middle back.  </li>
            <li> First, if you saw the informercial, it IS possible to get the results they show.</li>
            <li> I have wavy blonde hair with some frizz, I remembered steam curling irons from years back and steam rollers that made my hair more shiny than just heat, so when I saw this at this low price after seeing it when it was $100.00 I thought I would try it.</li>
            <li> And did I mention soft!</li>
            <li> My hair has never been soft!</li>
            <li> I got my first one in 2004 and it finally just broke</li>
            <li> I think it may have lost a star from when I first started using to just last week.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve decided to get my hair \\&quot;trained\\&quot; first before going back to the steam iron.</li>
            <li> I PAID $60 THE FIRST TIME, AND $35 THE SECOND TIME!!!</li>
            <li> This was the second one that came to me the first the box was damaged through packaging.  </li>
            <li> My daughter used her first one for years until she finally wore it out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gets hot enough.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re barely there and do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> first then go back over my hair with the comb part out and</li>
            <li> I live in an area that has soft water and has lime deposits.</li>
            <li> I started using her old straightner myself and then borrowed her new Infiniti one.  </li>
            <li> It really works and leaves my hair shinny, silky and  straight all day long</li>
            <li> With my previous straighteners, the hair glides over the plates smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I owe the ceramic pro which works very well, however, this product works really well on my daughters long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is not a bad straightener, but if I had it to do over, I would have gotten the same brand that my daughter uses.</li>
            <li> Some days it would turn out alright, but it never stayed straight for very long and it really fried my hair.</li>
            <li> Some of it would be slightly curly, some of it would curl under, some of it would curl over, and most of it would just look like I hadn&#x27;t brushed it in years.  </li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and this was the only straightner that would actually work on my hair.</li>
            <li> I found this straightener while browsing the internet one day and was kind of skeptical, but I was ready to try something new</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it left my hair incredibly straight and soft!</li>
            <li> I have pretty straight, thick hair that needs the flat iron to give me that sleek, smooth look that I can&#x27;t get from a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didnt get 5 stars is because it should hold just a little more water for the steam.</li>
            <li> The only three set backs are that it&#x27;s a little on the bulky side, you will not be able to get close to the hair shaft, and the max temperature setting is 395 F.</li>
            <li> Not a great \\&quot;hair\\&quot; person, but this has made me look amazing time and time again.  </li>
            <li> The Infiniti Straightener worked great on my crazy hair.</li>
            <li> I am so amazed because the last time i straightened my hair with a ceramic stove and iron, I SPENT 3 HOURS TO GET MY HAIR SMOOTH AND SILKY.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft, looking shiny, not frizzy, and of course straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to consciously adjust how I hold it, but I really think it&#x27;s also a design flaw repeated by Conair in different models, as well.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the 2ish months I&#x27;ve had it so far, it has not fallen apart, so</li>
            <li> Overall, a very convenient product.</li>
            <li> Much quicker than my last one.</li>
            <li> I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s completely \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; to heat.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m also using as much heat protecting products as possible, so that could be it.</li>
            <li> I purchessed it for my 16 year old daughter</li>
            <li> straightens the thickest hair and leaves it soft as well.</li>
            <li> By far this one had the highest marks and satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> I will buy another brand next time and hope that it lasts much longer than the Conair model.</li>
            <li> We have natural curly hair and the straightner leave our hair...</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> But I always felt like it didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, so the difference was getting too noticeable</li>
            <li> After fixing my hair I can not tell the difference between my natural hair and chemically straightened hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my 15 year old granddaughter who listed it as her #1 request this year.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair felt so soft.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t listening to her because I kept feeling my hair and thinking about how soft it felt.  </li>
            <li> I threw away the old straightner and bought myself</li>
            <li> There are no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy, trusty straightener that worked seamlessly for 6 years.</li>
            <li> so much words cannot possibly describe it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> regularly professionally dyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to eliminate relaxing my hair and go all natural.</li>
            <li> For natural hair it doesnt do the job of straigten like i wanted, but i use it often when i want a wrap look or straighten hair after a wash.</li>
            <li> And even then it&#x27;s poofy and frizzy which is not the way my hair naturally falls.</li>
            <li> u are im slow) but ither than that i love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and getting my hair to look like it does when I leave the salon happens by pure luck with my old flat irons but</li>
            <li> I prefer the maxiglide over this but as a flat iron it really straigten the hair out and leave it soft and moisturized.on relax hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this flat iron on air dried braided hair.</li>
            <li> Get over yourself if you think you can whip out shiny straight flat hair in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> If you really need to get close to the roots you may need a hotter flat iron.</li>
            <li> I really like this affordable flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron is bulky and because of this it can&#x27;t get very close to the root of my hair</li>
            <li> The steam element on this flat iron makes for hair that&#x27;s sleek and straight.</li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;bad\\&quot; thing about this product is that from the first use, the red paint near the steam plates (corners) has been coming off.  </li>
            <li> short, much better than any other flat iron&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I noticed a distinct lack of opinion from my \\&quot;hair demographic\\&quot; and felt ladies who were like me might like a little info on how it might work for them.</li>
            <li> Instead of leaving my hair feeling silky, it felt more coarse than usual, and caused my hair to flip out at the ends no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as an essential beauty item.</li>
            <li> This heats high enough to straighten her hair.  </li>
            <li> The teeth in the plates have three levels, no teeth, mid-height, and tall, and the steam you can either turn off, have on low, or have on high.  </li>
            <li> I have another conair typical flat iron that I got at a chain retailer that cost only about $29.95 and works way better than this one.</li>
            <li> and it really didn&#x27;t take that long to straighten it all--nor</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of tools and products in the market to make my hair straight and to be like that all day long.</li>
            <li> Still, the unit doesn&#x27;t get as hot as expected</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am lucky that there was nothing flammable near it or my entire house could have burned down.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel like a new and different person.</li>
            <li> Got my last one 8 months ago, and already need a new one.</li>
            <li> The water does run out fast, but I simply turn it off and fill it back up.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, my hair is really thick, frizzy, and coarse.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful when using this because if it leaks it&#x27;s hot water and can burn you.</li>
            <li> I have bought flat irons as low as $25 and and much as $125.  </li>
            <li> Even with humid air, I found my straight streaks last much longer than with my previous straightener without even the tips curling up.</li>
            <li> for the use of distilled water -- if you do not have very hard water where you live, tap water will work fine.</li>
            <li> I am a white female, with fine hair and a little bit of wave.  </li>
            <li> so i decided to buy myself a new flat iron for myself.</li>
            <li> I am receiving a NEW flat iron for \\&quot;free\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am african american with naturally curly hair and this flat iron gets it bone straight without damaging it.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that you have keep the steam holes clean so the steam actually comes out.</li>
            <li> After a long research for a new one I finally found the same exact one flat iron.</li>
            <li> Cons-yes the water reserve does empty fast, but if you&#x27;re a mom or multi-tasker in the mornings like me, no worries.</li>
            <li> I am left with wavy hair, and I have to get out my old straightening iron to finish the job, which defeats the purpose.  </li>
            <li> I do have to use the highest settings because my hair is so curly, so coarse, so wild.  </li>
            <li> My old steam conair straightner finally broke after almost 8 years of use, and I knew I had to find one like the one I had.</li>
            <li> I accidentally left it on one morning and it never turned off and completely melted my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely used it.</li>
            <li> You cannot do it separately by a button on the outside like the old Maxius Maxiglide.  </li>
            <li> Spend the extra money on a professional straightener; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do.  </li>
            <li> AND I BARELY go to the salon anymore.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own and will randomly turn off (3-4 times each morning)</li>
            <li> this is just ok not a great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably just something I&#x27;m doing wrong, honestly...</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick, curly, and unruly but with this iron it becomes completely straight.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty slow for straightning hair that is VERY curly from a perm.  </li>
            <li> Being a woman of African American descent I love the fact that it works on my frizzy, curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s wrong with a nice silver color?</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t yet speak for the durability as I&#x27;ve only used it once and a jug of distilled water costs more than a jug of milk, but for the little amount you use, it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to dry my hair all of the way before use and now remember why I love my wet to dry flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go with a better quality salon straightener, or use one of Conair&#x27;s other products that are less expensive and work a lot better.</li>
            <li> It seems to be, overall, a normal flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than my old one inch flat iron and that takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> The flat iron in my opinion doesn&#x27;t get the hair as straight as a regular flat iron does.</li>
            <li> My hair does not fall off due to heat and it really works.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the container that leaks sometimes I&#x27;d give it a higher rating because it does work faster than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve tried and the straightening lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered from Conair direct, and the product was on back order for a month.  </li>
            <li> But they don&#x27;t get as hot as my other flat irons.</li>
            <li> It did a decent job on my hair to get the minimal waves out I have after blow drying.</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair thick, it&#x27;s curly, frizzy, and basically an Afro if I let it air dry, and better yet,</li>
            <li> I am sad Conair does not manufacturer them anymore, but the were kind enough to tell me about a comparable product in it</li>
            <li> Since I had it for so long, I wanted to get a new one because after about 4 years of using it religiously, it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I recommend the the Infiniti Hair Straightner, it heats up quickly, you have the option of using a little steam or use it dry.  </li>
            <li> With very little product and no brush or blowdryer, I was able to completely straighten dry my hair in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Infinity heats up quickly and does a fantastic job straightening my VERY thick past my shoulders, un-relaxed ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> I have hair about a good ways past my shoulders, but its very thick.</li>
            <li> Tried w/day old dry hair &amp; thought, if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d wash/condition it and start again.</li>
            <li> I just wash my hair and let it dry naturally and then use the iron.</li>
            <li> But, no matter how much time and effort I put into my hair, it typically ends up wavy and frizzy within a matter of hours.</li>
            <li> have that strange, in-between hair that isn&#x27;t really wavy, but it&#x27;s definitely not straight.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly, coarse, long and natural.</li>
            <li> super thick curly/frizzy</li>
            <li> I have SUPER curly hair, thick that is prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> The iron itself is not heavy and isn&#x27;t too large - but the iron is also not so small that you have to spend a lot of extra time using it.  </li>
            <li> if you hold it down too far on the outside like you can with other straighteners it gets hot on your hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the harsh reality that though I get decent results, it just doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to give me long lasting results and thus I have reverted to using my older iron.</li>
            <li> My daughter also uses it on her very thick course hair and it leave it smooth and silky...</li>
            <li> The tiny, little steam resevoir lasts about 20 minutes which means you have to refill it at least every day with distilled water (I just love having a gallon of distilled water on my counter hogging up space).  </li>
            <li> and it takes less than 10 minutes to achieve a straight, flat, shiny look for work.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks so soft, shiny and straight that my friends and family are skeptical that I myself accomplished this.</li>
            <li> On average it takes about 20 minutes to straighten my whole head with long lasting results.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get the hang of this thing, but once I did, I have to say the investment was worth it.</li>
            <li> It is hard sometimes to find the right product for African American hair.</li>
            <li> i have extremely, ridiculously, long hair (super thick as well)</li>
            <li> I recently had to replace my first Infiniti Pro-NSS Flat Iron after I used it almost every day for the past 7 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that my very frizz prone hair stays tame even in humidity when I use the steam feature.     </li>
            <li> I have long hair (middle of my back) and I have only run out of steam once or twice in 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I was after since using a regular Flat Iron</li>
            <li> Once I receive my Organix Keretin Flat Iron Spray, I believe it will be the ultimate power team for my hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to others as my sister and I have used these flat irons over five years</li>
            <li> After just 6 months, ( I only used the flat iron about 25 times), the water reservoir would no longer stay attached to the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It is not a perfect straightener but so far not bad.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair (middle of my back)</li>
            <li> i love it alot but the only thing is that you do have to apply and apply and reapply water in the little water storage thingy on the straightener i get annoyed</li>
            <li> It usually takes forever to finish, however I was done much quicker.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because my mom has it</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron because it was rated #1 by Consumer Reports.    </li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing a Conair flat iron being that I didnt even know they made them</li>
            <li> I had the flat iron for 2 weeks and the steam feature stopped working.  </li>
            <li> not with this baby I can flat iron my shoulder length hair in 20 min.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because I wanted to maximize the health of my hair while using heat.</li>
            <li> This flat iron snags the hair and doesn&#x27;t close all the way.</li>
            <li> had sworn off flat irons after my hair broke off about 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> I had never heard of steam in a flat iron but reading the rave reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li> it is not the same.-Infinity ss9 flat iron.</li>
            <li> Well, that didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> My point is, I ordered this flat iron</li>
            <li> I have this flat iron</li>
            <li> I am a Sedu fan but this flat iron&#x27;s steam feature tops the Sedu because of the moisture it adds to my hair.  </li>
            <li> i have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> in short this flat iron measures up to any Chi or other big name irons with an even bigger price.</li>
            <li> Whenever I used the regular flat iron, my hair looked dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I broke the first one in half on my birthday just by squeezing it too tight.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair in half the time my old one took</li>
            <li> so you basically have to figure out how and where to put the water, but that&#x27;s really the only complaint I have.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, dry hair.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m outside in the wind on a humid day, my hair starts to get bigger, or if it gets wet (sweat, mist, rain)</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, wavy, thick hair and this keeps it straight all day and the only product I use is hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other flat irons and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I thought steam would be better on curly coarse hair like mine, but it left me with a fuzzy mess and the plates are very poor quality.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one ten years ago when it first hit the market and recently purchased another after the element went bad.</li>
            <li> Other straighteners have actual combs, which when straightening your hair, actually cut it!</li>
            <li> I actually bought a second one for my other daughter.  </li>
            <li> I also wish it came in different colors (other than red).</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4 star rate, is because of the steamer cap...is too hard to snap back on compared to the older one.</li>
            <li> It also lasts an additional day or two so that all I have to do is spray in some dry shampoo, touch is up with the flat iron, and out the door.</li>
            <li> I have really hard to style hair and this tool works really really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of shocked</li>
            <li> and I wish I had known about it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that is medium in thickness.  </li>
            <li> The results on her long hair are as desired.</li>
            <li> She has long hair with some curl and this does the job.  </li>
            <li> but, again, not nearly as well as this one here.</li>
            <li> heats up quickly, long cord, steam works well, built in comb feature.</li>
            <li> I debated ordering it for so long because of the cost, but decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> Bigger and heaver than I expected but not something one can&#x27;t get used to.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long at all.  </li>
            <li> The steam helps keep her long thick wavy hair straight all day.</li>
            <li> I have thick unruly hair and this really tames it.</li>
            <li> This works very well for thick, wavy hair, when I use the highest heat setting.  </li>
            <li> Yep, paid that much for something that I trashed after 3 months do to me needing stem to straighten my thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> With the Revlon model, I have to hold it on each section of the chosen strands, and hold it there for around 15 seconds before moving the wand further down to the end;I have to do the same with the Infiniti.</li>
            <li> i am a young black woman with thick hair that normally has to be relaxed every month.   </li>
            <li> It lasted for 4 years and now I have a new one to last for at least another 4.  </li>
            <li> and I mean CURLY hair, and the Infinity straigtner lvs her hair STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> the only other thing is for me to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> wide flat iron and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that compared to other straighteners, this one gets my curly, coarse hair the silkiest and straightest.</li>
            <li> Always use the steam feature, it&#x27;s no different from any other iron without it.      </li>
            <li> I will use this for a long time!</li>
            <li> - my kids joke about my 3 inch ponytail, which (straightened) is now about 10 inches long!  </li>
            <li> I emailed the seller to see if I could return it, as I am extremely unsatisfied with my purchase, and I have not heard anything back.  </li>
            <li> My wife finds it a little big, considering her last one was 1,&amp;#34; but she likes its.  </li>
            <li> I can flat iron her hair whether its wet or dry</li>
            <li> When I do use the steam, not only does it iron flat and shiny but it takes half the time to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> The steam really helped and I could straighten my hair in less than half the time it took me with other straighteners.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing, because the steam heat made my hair look very healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> The iron hardly steams at all even at the high setting.  </li>
            <li> With my hair totally dry, I have to go over one piece of hair two to three times, so</li>
            <li> They burn my hair and dry it out.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair really dry.</li>
            <li> In addition, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and damaged looking</li>
            <li> I allowed my hair to air dry in braided sections overnight, then used the iron (Infiniti SS9 1 1/2\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> almost dry afeter you wash it and then use the iron.</li>
            <li> My hair ends up looking really dry.  </li>
            <li> Even the ends of my hair didn&#x27;t look dry.  </li>
            <li> I need to blow dry my hair before using this product.</li>
            <li> Dry it and use this to straighten.</li>
            <li> So finally, one came back in stock a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I soooooooooooooooooo can not live without it</li>
            <li> It takes less than 10 minutes to do my hair, as long as its totally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I use the Conair Steam Straightner, I have no more frizz, my hair feels as soft as silk, and it doesn&#x27;t curl in the humid air.</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s average to me.</li>
            <li> Then the bristles in the middle of the flat iron that is supposed to detangle your hair while straightening it kept getting my hair stuck to it and ripping out a few strands.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of damage and agree with the other reviewers who&#x27;ve found this iron to impart a healthy gloss to hair rather than frying it.</li>
            <li> I have a combination of African American, and thick Dutch/ French hair..</li>
            <li> I am a African American with coarse thick relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> I have natural kinky curly hair (african0american) and had a hard time finding a flat iron that didn&#x27;t leave the ends of my hair fried!!!</li>
            <li> I will update again in a some months, it will be a while because I don&#x27;t want to severely heat damage my hair (some damage is expected, manageable and necessary though due to how rough my hair is)</li>
            <li> and it takes me only half the time.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and after blow drying, I can straighten in less than ten minutes</li>
            <li> but I only got half way through straightening my hair before I decided to give up.</li>
            <li> I found a way to make it last longer by turning off the steam if the flat iron is not in my hair, but the water will still go down even if the steam isn&#x27;t on (it just goes down slower).  </li>
            <li> The 4C hair (or hair with very little to no curl pattern) that never straighten no matter if it is heated or permed, both yield nearly the same results; frizzy, puffy hair after a few hours.</li>
            <li> In short, it was heavy compare to the other flat irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not only is it too heavy, it won&#x27;t even sit upright when you sit it down; it just falls over to potentially burn your counter.</li>
            <li> This flat iron cut down the time it took to get my hair done.</li>
            <li> This has cut down my morning routine and I will never buy another flat iron again.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, leave a little conditioner in, add John Frieda Serum, semi-blow dry and THEN flat iron with this product with the highest heat setting and combs all the way out.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the teeth were a little longer.</li>
            <li> The little tiny hole you have to pour the water in is a joke as well.  </li>
            <li> I always use it with steam on the highest setting, it adds a little something extra every time I style.</li>
            <li> My 12-year old thinks it&#x27;s a little heavy</li>
            <li> It does make hair shiny and volumounouos vs. crunchy and dry with other straighteners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this iron makes it perfectly straight and manageable with minimal damage.</li>
            <li> With my new steam flat iron, there is no more frizz and no more dryness.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a long power cord and automatic shut off, but ultimately neither of these features make up for the fact that this flatiron does not straighten as well as my Chi, no matter how small I make my hair sections or</li>
            <li> The steam doesn&#x27;t stay too long, leaving you to constantly refill the water for the steam at least 15 times (perhaps it&#x27;s because my hair is long?).</li>
            <li> My sister bought herself a CHI a few months back</li>
            <li> and there is not much for me to say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much to refill it, it just takes a bit of careful maneuvering.    </li>
            <li> this Infiniti Conair Nano Silver Steam Strightner does not give enough steam and when it does it lasts a few minutes, not enough to do but a few strands of hair...</li>
            <li> It felt rough when I ran it through my hair.  </li>
            <li> so had to carefully</li>
            <li> The only problem is it&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have a short hair but after ironing my whole hair with it, I become so tired because it&#x27; too heavy to keep.</li>
            <li> heavy duty and sleek at the same time.  </li>
            <li> is so rough on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Roughly, 1 1/2 hours IF I am in the mood to use the steamer, if not about an hour tops.</li>
            <li> I use a conditioning product in my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> My daughters &amp; I hv soft, curly, &amp; thick hair.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this from Amazon, but I got it as a gift from a store called Big Lots in CA for less than 20 bucks!</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers have complained about the steam reservoir not being big enough -</li>
            <li> Secondly the on/off button is not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I plan to keep using it and work on my deep conditioning technique since it seems like my hair was a little dry, the steam setting seemed to help a little</li>
            <li> I have medium hair, curly specially at the bottom, not too thin nor too thick.</li>
            <li> My sister has really thick, coarse and long hair that does have relaxer in it (although you can&#x27;t tell).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a little big</li>
            <li> Lost 2 stars due to this.</li>
            <li> did I run out of steam like some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> and my hair stays straightened, this didn&#x27;t happen with my other straighteners.</li>
            <li> The small water resevoir pops out often and also constantly snags my hair and pulls it out when I&#x27;m straigtening it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other hair straightners that did not work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I even had a friend talking to me the other night</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT SHARE THIS IRON WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND DO NOT PUT PRODUCTS ON HAIR BEFORE APPLYING STRAIGHTENING</li>
            <li> A lot of the other straighteners don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> has improved in its quality, which makes styling it other days</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve had this problem with other units I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden, the water started to leak out of the small retainer.  </li>
            <li> AmericaRx would not take the item back because it was 30 days past invoice date.  </li>
            <li> But I already see my hair in a healthier state due to the moisture from the steam.  </li>
            <li> I usually let my hair air dry or dry it with a diffuser attachment, but</li>
            <li> Other straightening irons left my hair looking very dried out and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The plates aren&#x27;t very wide</li>
            <li> the hair is completely DRY!!!</li>
            <li> It usually took me an hour to an hour and a half to straighten my (thick) hair with my old straightener, but it only took me about a half hour with the Conair.</li>
            <li> It did not get hot enough and was on the heavier side which made it difficult to hold and hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> I fell victim to an infomercial I caught one afternoon a few months ago, so I saw this on amazon and placed an order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at all the negative feedback for this iron!</li>
            <li> The only frustrating thing is to keep refilling it with water and that you have to try different angles to get down to the roots.</li>
            <li> The steam function was minimal and it&#x27;s heavy compared to other hair straighteners.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, the steam cup thingy isn&#x27;t really necessary (i.e. I don&#x27;t use it at all), but my only real complaint is that some of the paint peeled off, but that was due to misuse on my part.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very thick, naturally wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to buying it and someone said the plastic cap(to put in distilled water) was hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I thought long and hard before making this purchase and carefully reviewed all of the reviewers&#x27; comments here, as well as elsewhere on the internet.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Complained to Conair about it and heard not a peep back from them.  </li>
            <li> Some people left negative reviews because they DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE A STRAIGHTENER.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that my steam function isn&#x27;t always working, even though I leave it turned on.  </li>
            <li> I have very course hair that has some random waves.  </li>
            <li> The combs worked on my thick coarse hair and it did do the trick and got my hair pin straight,YAY!</li>
            <li> It is 1.5&amp;#34; wide and that combined with the water feature makes it heavy.</li>
            <li> Why pay the price for a Chi when you can have this for, at least, a third less at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> after gliding it down one section of my hair, I could already tell it works like it says it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt; keeps hair even as it slides down to ends.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> What a difference it makes and now I have confidence when I wear my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with a serum that helps my hair look health &amp; shiny without weighing it down.     </li>
            <li> So if you wanted stem you had to hold the attachment down while also trying to straighten you hair.</li>
            <li> It pulls your hair as you slide it down.  </li>
            <li> As a woman of color is hard to find flat irons that will not leave my ends frizzy or that I don&#x27;t have to pass over my hair 50 million times.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair that takes an hour to flat iron,</li>
            <li> I wanted to cut my time in half.  </li>
            <li> It did make it less frizzy but it doesn&#x27;t keep it any straighter.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product less than 1 star, I would.  </li>
            <li> This was about half a year ago.</li>
            <li> It cuts my straightening time in half, plus my counter is now less cluttered.</li>
            <li> It is straighter than I&#x27;ve ever seen it before with any previous $20-$40 hair straighteners, and it&#x27;s not getting fried or breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to use, I would imagine that some one that knows what they are doing could do it in less time.</li>
            <li> The price i bought this for including shipping and handling was half the amount my country was selling it retail for.</li>
            <li> so I Thought I needed less temperature.</li>
            <li> hair is slightly wavy, shoulder length, and I have it</li>
            <li> which is what we couldn&#x27;t achieve with cheaper, less quality straightners.  </li>
            <li> I came across the Infiniti SS9 during black Friday 2011.</li>
            <li> I like this model because it has slight teeth to help keep the hair separated as you pass this through your hair.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this because I read a lot of different opinions about it, and a lot of them were not good.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy/semi-curly hair that has always been unruly.</li>
            <li> I also used it on my neice who has long really thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of flat irons that will straighten, add shine and somehow heal a weird patch of my hair (underneath the bulk of my hair in the back).  </li>
            <li> I have hair that falls past my shoulders that is very thick, and naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty much the worst hair on the face of the planet.</li>
            <li> which is a little bit of an issue.</li>
            <li> ; water into the little holder.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little wavy, and it takes a llllooooonnnngggg time to straighten it with this straightner.   </li>
            <li> A little background info about me and my hair.  </li>
            <li> I just have to take little (about 1/2 inch thick)at a time.</li>
            <li> I had to push it in a little.</li>
            <li> Not a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, but it only took me about 10 minutes to straighten all of it, and it looks AND</li>
            <li> and I only have to refill the water compartment three times for my very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This gives the closest to salon results than any other iron I have used!!</li>
            <li> The worst part about this flat iron, I think, is that the steam reservoir runs out VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily the worst flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.     </li>
            <li> These combs are not pointy, they are round.  </li>
            <li> even using a diffuser, it&#x27;s still frizzy and generally messy</li>
            <li> I dried my hair with my diffuser to see what the straightener would do when my hair was at</li>
            <li> but i find that my hair gets frizzy a few minutes after.</li>
            <li> I have a few things to say about it that might be helpful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  </li>
            <li> I don[t use it everyday, but when I use it, it straightens my hair and I can curl the ends.  </li>
            <li> and I will have just wasted $40.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to go the \\&quot;Conair\\&quot;/non professional route to begin with, but when my expensive one broke</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first because I did not pay alot for this iron, nor had I heard a ton, plus, my curl pattern is 3c</li>
            <li> It straightens with steam vs. harsh heat.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The buttons are close to where you handle the straightner and sometimes are inadvertently are shut off.&lt;br /&gt;After a few months it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> and I wasted no time snatching it up.</li>
            <li> This iron worked no better than my Revlon ceramic, purchased for less at Target.</li>
            <li> and I am usually done in less than 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Straightening my hair usually takes like an hour and a half</li>
            <li> The cons are, from dry curls to sleek and dry, takes approximately one hour of slow steaming.</li>
            <li> Without the water reservoir, I was not happy with the results of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> We use plain water, and although it may reduce the life of the straightener, I&#x27;ll sacrifice that</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> I have tight kinky curls which are so hard to straighten.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that random strands of my hair KEEP getting caught between the water reservoir and flat irons.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, but manageable non-coarse hair and this bad boy just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> So, you are still not sure</li>
            <li> The keys are patience, working slowly, a lot of steam, and a firm grip.     </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a job, but I did have a savings account, and so I was anxious to get it for the price,</li>
            <li> This product may work for relaxed African American hair or for non-curly/straight textures, but I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> like I went to the hair stylist everyday!</li>
            <li> I agree that the compartment for the water is too small.  </li>
            <li> water reservoir is ridiculously small, and you literally have to use an eyedropper to fill it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think Ill ever go back to one without the steam</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but there is a trick you can do to fill it up through it&#x27;s small hole.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned quite a few straightners and none of them compare with this one!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these in the past 10 years</li>
            <li> I like the steam and the feel of my hair right after use, but hate trying to get &amp;#34;distilled&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy, curly hair that I don&#x27;t usually have the time or patience to deal with.</li>
            <li> Controls on the Chi are inside the handle and extremely hard to read.&lt;br</li>

            <li> All 4 of those things together mean one thing:  </li>
            <li> In the mean time, I do my makeup or something productive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, poofy, and just altogether ridiculous.</li>
            <li> One must fill the water reservoir with a very small water stream as it won&#x27;t fill otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just seemed ridiculous to me.</li>
            <li> Overall worst flat iron ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a CHI and had some luck, but the results were not nearly as good as the Conair straightener here.</li>
            <li> man it not a good straighter.</li>
            <li> Not good when your&lt;br /&gt;  running out the door.  </li>
            <li> Alittle heavy and handle alittle difficult to hold to - not as ergonomic as could be.  </li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed in this item especially after all those raving reviews on it that I read.  </li>
            <li> Sucks with my yaki weaves and wigs!  </li>
            <li> but i have thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have to fill the water dish twice, not a big deal just annoying.</li>
            <li> you have thin hair</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my daughter-in-law because hers was broken.  </li>
            <li> Poor design.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir has broken on me once from a fall</li>
            <li> She has thin and medium length</li>
            <li> but it had broken</li>
            <li> The water storage compartment opening is very small and difficult to fill.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed but will try again until it works,lol.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ever go wrong with Conair price and quality.</li>
            <li> It would never curl either, sigh, just wave weirdly.  </li>
            <li> and he was so angry when I used it.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> But it is not perfect.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Way to expensive for a Conair product.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical buying (yet another)</li>
            <li> Without the steam the flat iron was horrible.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no way to correct this except by cutting your hair off.</li>
            <li> have crazy hair and lots of it</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t listen to bad reviews unless they tell you hair type, and experience w/straighteners.</li>
            <li> About the smell, you have to use distilled water if you don´t want the iron to smell ugly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was very unhappy with this item and didn&#x27;t feel this product did what it advertised.</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Then the power button is in a very bad location that while I was straightening my hair I would turn it off without knowing.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I bought this product!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed in it.  </li>
            <li> I returned this item, because I was very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worst and let me tell you,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is actually the second of this product I have owned it works wonderfully I absolutely love it and it is well worth the money it will last you a long time and it is durable as well I also love the color as well. I love that you can adjust the temperature with ease.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this keeps my curls straight.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!  I am african american with naturally curly hair and this flat iron gets it bone straight without damaging it.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed in this item especially after all those raving reviews on it that I read.  The iron hardly steams at all even at the high setting.  Also, after a couple of weeks, the red paint started peeling off the side of the iron.  I am considering returning the item.</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightener because it is top-rated by Consumer Reports and was affordable. It does a very good job of straightening my hair, but if I get any of my hair too close to the end of the iron it pulls my hair. Also, it is somewhat bulky. My daughter has a flat iron that I&#x27;ve used that is thinner and does an excellent job of straightening without pulling my hair. My hairdresser said that using steam was better for hair so, I do like having that feature. But getting the water into the straightener without wasting a lot (it uses distilled water) is a bit tricky. Overall it is not a bad straightener, but if I had it to do over, I would have gotten the same brand that my daughter uses.</li>
            <li> This straigtener, although sort of bulky, works great. For the 2ish months I&#x27;ve had it so far, it has not fallen apart, so I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair straightener and I wish I had known about it a long time ago.  It straightens my hair in half the time my old one took and I really like all the options for the steam (works great) and the heat settings.  It is the perfect size and it doesn&#x27;t take me more than 5-10 minutes tops to get my hair ready now.  I have frizzy, wavy, thick hair and this keeps it straight all day and the only product I use is hairspray.  The water container is easy to fill in the sink if you pull both of the rubber stoppers off the back (they are connected so not hard to do), it took me about a week to realize there were two holes with stoppers instead of just one so it fills MUCH easier now.  Definitely worth the money.  Update on 2/16/2012:  Although I still love this straightener, it has started to have a mind of it&#x27;s own and will randomly turn off (3-4 times each morning) when I&#x27;m trying to use it.  I have to hit it against the palm of my hand sometimes before it will turn on again when I push the on/off button and the temp. setting buttons.  This started about 3-4 months ago.  Lost 2 stars due to this.</li>
            <li> The steam is a good benefit, a real help in second day styling. It&#x27;s heavier than my old one inch flat iron and that takes some getting used to. Until you learn how to use it it&#x27;s easy burn your hand if you&#x27;re not careful. In all I&#x27;m glad I bought it...was a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is so amazing!! I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out as soon as I got it. It straightens so easily; after gliding it down one section of my hair, I could already tell it works like it says it does. It usually took me an hour to an hour and a half to straighten my (thick) hair with my old straightener, but it only took me about a half hour with the Conair. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Conair Infiniti Steam Straightener a couple days ago.  The main reason is because of the steam.  The one I currently own, a Virtuo, which I paid about $100.00 for 3 years ago at the mall, does not have steam.  With my hair totally dry, I have to go over one piece of hair two to three times, so I wanted to cut my time in half.  I have long hair that is medium in thickness.  Let me tell you, this does work.  It took me about 10 minutes to totally straighten my hair.  It would take me 20 to 25, on a good day.  I only had to go over each piece ONCE.  The steam really does make a difference.  It also made my hair very shiny, whereas the one I currently own does not.  On the bottom plate, there are detangling \\&quot;combs\\&quot; that are retractable.  Other straighteners have actual combs, which when straightening your hair, actually cut it! Ouch!  These combs are not pointy, they are round.  So, it doesn&#x27;t cut your hair.  I like also because it has an automatic shut-off. That is really great for me because I have left my other one on all day!!!!  I was hesitant to purchase this because I read a lot of different opinions about it, and a lot of them were not good.  But, like anything else, you have to try things for yourself.  Everyone has different hair types, so some products might not work as well as others.  I give this straightener an A+++++.</li>
            <li> This is an update to this straightening iron I have owned since June 2008. I (still) love this straightening iron!! I&#x27;ve had it for more than a year, used it almost every day for 3 months straight, and it&#x27;s still going strong. My hair is not long anymore, so it&#x27;s even better for short and poofy hair after blow drying it. The best part: my hair stays straight for 2 or more days and it does not cause a lot of split ends like the other straighteners I&#x27;ve had.    At first it takes practice to get the water chamber filled up, but it comes easy after a few uses. Make sure to have a bottle of room-temp filtered water nearby. You can only use distilled water in it. The directions say not to take off the water chamber when the iron is still hot, so that is pretty much the only con I found with this. Otherwise, it left my hair incredibly straight and soft!</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.  It works OK, but still leaves my hair a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have short,naturally curly hair that I have struggled with for years! Seems like most people with straight hair want curly and those with curly want straight! I received this product yesterday abd have used it yesterday and today - I cannot believe how straight my hair is! Makes me feel like a new and different person. No more frizz on those hot and humid days. I love it!</li>
            <li> This completely does what it says! I read the reviews &amp; wondered but bought anyway.  My hair type is medium coarse &amp; I currently own a CHI - this works better than my CHI because of the shine &amp; now my hair is silkly.  In fact, it was too straight! I cut my hair (wish I hadn&#x27;t now) so my long hair would have been super.  Tried w/day old dry hair &amp; thought, if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d wash/condition it and start again. Didn&#x27;t have to -you&#x27;d think I had done my daily routine or come from a hairdressers!!!  Highly recommend to all - just make sure you know how to use a straightener - don&#x27;t listen to bad reviews unless they tell you hair type, and experience w/straighteners. Cons-yes the water reserve does empty fast, but if you&#x27;re a mom or multi-tasker in the mornings like me, no worries. Unplug, pop out, refill, check on the kids/feed the dog, come back, pop back in and finish up.  AND this is day one - I&#x27;ll write another in 2wks.</li>
            <li> This straightener is fantastic!  And the little water chamber for steam infusion is brilliant.  I love that you can turn up the heat too because then this product will work on the curliest of hair.  Lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> I havent figured out if i like it better with or without the steam part.  My hair is very frizzy/curly and i think the no steam actually works better.  I bought this flat iron because my mom has it and i thought it worked pretty good when i borrowed hers.  I have had 2 Chi&#x27;s before this one and they didnt last forever like ive heard so i thought i would try something different.  I would recommend but im not sure i love it.  The teeth in the flat iron part are awesome and very helpful, the part i dont like is when im using it my hair catch&#x27;s on something sometimes. Its not always a smooth glide i guess.  the only other thing is for me to straighten my hair I have to fill the water dish twice, not a big deal just annoying.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001BIZ8SY Conair SS9 Infiniti Nano Silver High Temperature Ionic Steam Straightener]]  My daughter loved the straightener. She said it does not pull her hair like some straighteners do.  The steam feature makes her hair super shiny. Her hair looks very healthy.  Amazon has done it again - a great product for a super price.</li>
            <li> Excellent item. Superior service and reliability. Have purchased a second one for another family member.</li>
            <li> Was very unhappy with this item and didn&#x27;t feel this product did what it advertised. Returned</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife since she complained a lot about how cheaper hair straighters don&#x27;t work well.  After getting this this appears to have better hair days :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron because it was rated #1 by Consumer Reports.    I was hesitant about purchasing a Conair flat iron being that I didnt even know they made them but I figured Consumer Reports was a reliable source.  I had the flat iron for 2 weeks and the steam feature stopped working.  Without the steam the flat iron was horrible.  It did not get hot enough and was on the heavier side which made it difficult to hold and hard to handle.  I purchased a Solia flat iron since then and love it!</li>
            <li> Product is pretty good with thick and course hair. it heats up within 0 seconds and straightens easily. The most important thing is that it doesnt leave hair smelling burnt and looking ironed. The only frustrating thing is to keep refilling it with water and that you have to try different angles to get down to the roots. Overall, a very convenient product.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned and it comes with a case that you can put the flat iron in while its still hot. It uses steam, which I though would make my hair poofy but it didn&#x27;t!! My hair is straight with tons of body.  I have really thick hair that takes an hour to flat iron, not with this baby I can flat iron my shoulder length hair in 20 min. you don&#x27;t have to keep going over the hair to make it straight.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair.  From reading the reviews I thought this product would work better because of the steam.  it does not work any better then any of the other irons I have used.  i thought the teeth would hold the hair better and help straightedn but that is not the case.  I go over some sections of hair about 8-10 times to straighten.  I have to fill water reserve three to four times.  this is just ok not a great.  I&#x27;m sure it would work better on hair that is not as curly as mine.</li>
            <li> This straightener is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  I have thick, wavy hair and the steam option works wonders.  Much quicker than my last one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron because it was rated highly by Consumer Reports.  I found that it heats up fast, and the extra amenities are great (steam capsule, heat-proof pouch, built-in combs, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy hair.  My old iron was a cheap, 2-inch wide one that would get my hair stick-straight.  With this one, I found that the steam and ions really smooth and soften my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t actually straighten my hair.  I am left with wavy hair, and I have to get out my old straightening iron to finish the job, which defeats the purpose.  In addition, it snags strands of my hair in the gaps around the hot plates and the steam capsule.  With each stroke, I&#x27;d rip out one or two strands of hair.  Because of that, I am returning this product.&lt;br /&gt;This iron may work for some people, but if you want very straight hair, I don&#x27;t think it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in cause we got some in, and I just couldn&#x27;t resist it with my discount at work. I have very long hair (middle of my back) and it&#x27;s very thick, naturally wavy/curly. I usually let my hair air dry or dry it with a diffuser attachment, but even using a diffuser, it&#x27;s still frizzy and generally messy looking (not all that styled). I dried my hair with my diffuser to see what the straightener would do when my hair was at it&#x27;s worst and let me tell you, it straightened it so well. The steam makes it feel very soft and healthy, even on the more coarser looking areas underneath the outer layer of hair. I had it on it&#x27;s highest setting and it really didn&#x27;t take that long to straighten it all--nor did I run out of steam like some other reviewers. I&#x27;ll have to refill it next time I use it, but that&#x27;s no hardship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t any picture instructions so you basically have to figure out how and where to put the water, but that&#x27;s really the only complaint I have. I obviously figured it out on my own and used a medicine dispenser to pour water into the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t yet speak for the durability as I&#x27;ve only used it once and a jug of distilled water costs more than a jug of milk, but for the little amount you use, it will last a very long time. I&#x27;ve never tried a chi, but out of all the straighteners I&#x27;ve tried in the best, this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best straightener i have ever used. The steam function and the built in combs are the greatest idea ever. It works so well and my hair stays straightened, this didn&#x27;t happen with my other straighteners. I have thick unruly hair and this really tames it.</li>
            <li> My sister bought herself a CHI a few months back so i decided to buy myself a new flat iron for myself. it works fine but i find that my hair gets frizzy a few minutes after. i have pretty thick hair so maybe thats the reason why butI would personally recommend the CHI.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. I use it frequently. No need to turn up to high heat. Medium works just fine. It has a steam setting and a built in comb also. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> We simply LOVE it. It lvs hair straight and shinny. My daughter has CURLY and I mean CURLY hair, and the Infinity straigtner lvs her hair STRAIGHT. Good price, good quality and does its job perfectly good!</li>
            <li> I have medium hair, curly specially at the bottom, not too thin nor too thick. I have tried a lot of tools and products in the market to make my hair straight and to be like that all day long. With this iron take me 15 minutes to comb it, usually took me about 45 minutes to do it as perfect and straight as I liked. It really works and leaves my hair shinny, silky and  straight all day long and the next day too.   About the smell, you have to use distilled water if you don´t want the iron to smell ugly. I love it!!!!!! Is the best tool I have bought, I think is even better than my T3 hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly but not just any type of curly. I have tight kinky curls which are so hard to straighten. On top of that, my hair is really thick, frizzy, and coarse. I have used everything from the Chi to the Instyler but nothing compares to this product! I am absolutely in love. While both the Chi and Instyler made my hair straight they didn&#x27;t get rid of the frizz. Also, if I went outside when it was humid my hair would get curly in a matter of an hour. Now that I use the Conair Steam Straightner, I have no more frizz, my hair feels as soft as silk, and it doesn&#x27;t curl in the humid air. It only takes me an hour to straighten my hair which is a record for me, and now it&#x27;s so easy! I will never use another straightner! It is definitely worth every penny :]</li>
            <li> Great product! Really cheap. Lots of functions. Worth the price! Really neeeded a new hair straightner and this one is one of the best!</li>
            <li> My sister has this same straightener and I was happy to see that Amazon carried it.  I have been very pleased with it so far.  It heats up very quickly so it is ready to use in a minute or so.  I love the case that comes with it as well.  Great product!</li>
            <li> The verdict is out there and there is not much for me to say. This is the best product out there.</li>
            <li> part of the problem may have been that i am used to a 1&amp;#34; wide flat iron and this is 1 1/2&amp;#34; so just getting used to the width was an issue.  Secondly the on/off button is not easy to use.  I did not try it using the addition of the water/steam because it requires distilled water and I did not have any and have not been to the store to buy any.  I have gone back to my $39 Chi knockoff for now.</li>
            <li> I have three different hair straighteners and this one works the best by far. In fact, there&#x27;s just no comparison.  The steam makes all the difference.  I have contrary hair, so while it can be sleek and smooth when I leave the house in the morning, it&#x27;s sometimes somewhat frizzy by the time I get to work.  But like I say, that&#x27;s more down to my hair type.  My only wish is that the teeth were a little longer.</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday present 5 years ago and this still gets really hot! This was my first straightener ever and I love it! I definitely suggest you buy this. Really great!</li>
            <li> I got this item because i read on consumers report that it was the best. I personally wouldn&#x27;t consider it the best straightner in my life, but it wasn&#x27;t terrible. It is a pain having to fill the water for the steam. I have hair about a good ways past my shoulders, but its very thick. It did make it less frizzy but it doesn&#x27;t keep it any straighter. That is what i was really wanting, for my hair to stay straighter.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightner.  I followed the recommendations of consumer reports and was not disappointed.  It works well and I only have to go over my hair once.  There are several settings to choose from as well. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I just used my flat iron on my hair today, and its pretty good but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was anything special.  I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I noticed a distinct lack of opinion from my \\&quot;hair demographic\\&quot; and felt ladies who were like me might like a little info on how it might work for them. What is my hair demographic? I&#x27;m an African American with 4b all-natural hair that&#x27;s completely \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; to heat. No perm, no texturizer, nothing but a super awesome afro.  That said, this will straighten your hair! But not the way it looks on the picture. It is a nice result, and my hair feels pretty soft afterward too. However, its still a bit bushy. This is fine by me, &#x27;cause I did not want actually want pin straight hair (I like my afro!). If I wanted pin straight hair, I&#x27;d go get a weave, lol. But as a warning to those who DO expect pin straight hair from this flat iron: the hair will begin to revert at the tips almost minutes after doing it, so it won&#x27;t be straight like on the picture unless you heat train your hair. I&#x27;m going to try blow drying my hair straighter next time and see if I get better results.  The worst part about this flat iron, I think, is that the steam reservoir runs out VERY quickly. I found a way to make it last longer by turning off the steam if the flat iron is not in my hair, but the water will still go down even if the steam isn&#x27;t on (it just goes down slower).  The best part is that my hair feels soft and still healthy. But I&#x27;m also using as much heat protecting products as possible, so that could be it. However, my hair does seem to like the steam (I tried it with the steam off and my hair refused to straighten...). It seems to be, overall, a normal flat iron.  So I think its a nice investment as long as you know what you&#x27;re getting when you get it!  UPDATE 01/11/12: Actually, I felt I should edit this review because I found out something interesting - the tips of my hair were frizzy because I was doing it wrong, lol. After using the comb-chase method and trimming my ends a bit, it straightens natural, kinky Afro hair just fine! And the steam leaves my hair feeling very soft. I definitely would recommend this to a friend. Updated to 4 stars!</li>
            <li> Second one purchased. Gave my wife one last year and my daughter liked it so much I bought her one this year.</li>
            <li> I got this at a great price as a gift for my sister and she was extremely happy. With me being a guy that doesn&#x27;t straighten his hair, I can&#x27;t comment from personal use lol but she seems happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, slightly wavy. I purchased this iron with the hope of running it through my hair, and getting immediate results. This iron worked no better than my Revlon ceramic, purchased for less at Target. With the Revlon model, I have to hold it on each section of the chosen strands, and hold it there for around 15 seconds before moving the wand further down to the end;I have to do the same with the Infiniti. I was expecting performance more similar to a professional model. (You can use the \\&quot;combs,\\&quot; or not; you can use the steam, or not. Nothing makes the results any better...)</li>
            <li> Esse aparelho é muito bom. Realmente deixa os cabelos mais sedosos e não resseca. Vale a pena comprar. Sem falar que a Amazon é uma loja muito boa em seu negócio!!</li>
            <li> This product its Great I had a Good experience trying that I just Love it. Its Make my have really Good</li>
            <li> This straightner is a great buy! Why pay the price for a Chi when you can have this for, at least, a third less at Amazon.com. I have coarse, dry hair. And, using the Nano Silver Stream Straightner transforms it into soft, shiny hair!</li>
            <li> Ok i purchase this straightner for mi wife, since arrive she uses like every day, when we go to a party all their friends come to my house to use it.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about a month my 13 year old daughter says that this is the best straightener we have owned. The steam helps keep her long thick wavy hair straight all day. Can&#x27;t ever go wrong with Conair price and quality.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped and arrived within a reasonable time as advertised.  The functions are easy to adjust and works better than average overall.  Still, the unit doesn&#x27;t get as hot as expected which is a little bit of an issue.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about 4 years ago when they were $150.  I loved it.  I have really curly and frizzy hair.  The steam really helped and I could straighten my hair in less than half the time it took me with other straighteners.  My first one broke though.  It still worked, but the steamer part would no longer stay on.  I still used it.  It still works now, but my husband jsut got me a new one for my birthday!  I think this is a great product.  It lasted for 4 years and now I have a new one to last for at least another 4.  Oh, and it probably would have lasted longer if I have taken better care of it.  It went through a lot in those 4 years.</li>
            <li> I purchessed it for my 16 year old daughter she did not like it at all ,said it Was cheep garbage so i sent it back</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice it worked any better than my old flat iron.  Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> straightens the thickest hair and leaves it soft as well.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot more from this straightener. . .considering the cost, I thought it would straighten better and faster.  I kept it, but I have gone back to using my Wet 2 Straight most of the time.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of Consumer Reports research on straighteners before deciding on this product.  By far this one had the highest marks and satisfaction.  My own experience has been outstanding. I do have to use the highest settings because my hair is so curly, so coarse, so wild.  The best part is that while it comes out straight and smooth it does not lose body (having the correct styling creme helps).  The only issue I have is how often I have to fill it up with water.  Still, I could not be happier with it and it allows me to play around with new ideas.</li>
            <li> Works ok.I have curly, thick hair and the steam made my hair very straight and soft,but it took forever!If you have thin hair it is a very good product to buy.For my hair it didnt work i had to put the straightener over one small pice of hair sevral times!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product less than 1 star, I would.  I&#x27;ve had two of these straighteners, both broke in just under a year. I figured the first was a fluke, so I bought another one and it did the same thing. Complained to Conair about it and heard not a peep back from them.  I will buy another brand next time and hope that it lasts much longer than the Conair model.</li>
            <li> I must say that every hair is different but for my sister and I this iron works wonderfully. We have natural curly hair and the straightner leave our hair... well, straight. Even more, it won&#x27;t curl back. I just wash my hair and let it dry naturally and then use the iron. In 30 minutes my hair is done. One thing though, because I do it myself, the ends of the hair don&#x27;t look too nice, but that&#x27;s just the day that is done, by the next day the ends look fine.</li>
            <li> My old steam conair straightner finally broke after almost 8 years of use, and I knew I had to find one like the one I had. I came across this one, and after reading the reviews decided to go with it.   I quickly got my package and couldn&#x27;t wait to see if it was worth the price.   Well it was, and then some. I am VERY picky with hair products, and having very fine wavy hair I have a need for a straightner.   This conair heats up very quickly, and quickly straightens crazy bedhead to a smooth sleek look. It leaves a smooth shine and does so very fast. It is totally worth the money and comes with a cute travel pouch. I love love love this hair straightner and highly recommend it to everyone!  The only reason I didnt get 5 stars is because it should hold just a little more water for the steam. Other the that, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> HEAT- heats super fast-no wait time- I use mine right away.&lt;br /&gt;STEAM - water chamber was easy to remove, fill, and replace-&lt;br /&gt;had mine for 3 yrs -never clogged. Reduces frizz.&lt;br /&gt;RETRACTABLE COMB- never pulled/ripped my hair out,&lt;br /&gt; keeps hair even as it slides down to ends.&lt;br /&gt;Long cord,  metallic \\&quot;candy apple\\&quot; red color is nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 45,F, with long,fine, color treated hair</li>
            <li> Great flat iron with steam - it is very easy on processed blond hair.  My daughter also uses it on her very thick course hair and it leave it smooth and silky... I would definitely compared this to be as good if not better than other steam flat irons out there; and was a very good value for this product.</li>
            <li> my wife loved this iron....she tried many but she said this is the best and fastest one to do the job</li>
            <li> i am a young black woman with thick hair that normally has to be relaxed every month.   using the flat irons combined heat, steam and comb options and the Chi Deep Brilliance shampoo, conditioner &amp;&amp; silk reflection i have been able to wear my natural hair without a relaxer for the first time ever. the design is sleek and easy to maneuver. in short this flat iron measures up to any Chi or other big name irons with an even bigger price. also i ordered this with Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping on a Thursday afternoon &amp;&amp; it arrived that Friday morning just in time for the weekend.

            <li> Not a great \\&quot;hair\\&quot; person, but this has made me look amazing time and time again.  I&#x27;ve had this straightener for almost 4 years, today i accidentally broke one the plastic on the water reservoir.  I immediately went to look for another one on amazon and am SO Happy they still have them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my hair at many different lengths, from chin to middle back.  This has been amazing for each length.  The steam makes my hair shiny and smooth every time.  I don&#x27;t even use product on my hair it does such a great job.  I always use the high heat setting and always use the high steam setting. It takes less than 10 minutes to do my hair, as long as its totally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly can&#x27;t say enough how this has made my life better and easier!!!</li>
            <li> I am white with wavy fine hair that would never straighten for me. It would never curl either, sigh, just wave weirdly.  I could never get a straightener to work for me and my last one died yesterday.  Threw it out, bought this at the store sight unseen. WOW so that&#x27;s what a straighten should do!  Love the steam, I am growing out short hair and this is wonderful.  I am going back to the store today to get another one to put in the closet just in case :)</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener as a replacement.  I had a different brand, which sells for around $100.  This Conair straightener certainly works, in fact, I can get my hair straighter if I work at it.  The steam feature is interesting (I can&#x27;t decide if it works better with or without using the steam) and I don&#x27;t like having to keep distilled water around and a syringe to fill up the reservoir. (It requires filling up with every use.)&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I didn&#x27;t expect, nor do I like, is that it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth going across the hair.  With my previous straighteners, the hair glides over the plates smoothly.  However, I&#x27;m learning to deal with it since this iron does the job (and is much cheaper than like alternatives).</li>
            <li> As an owner of two Chi flat irons, I have to say that I am impressed with this steam iron from Conair.  My hair type is thick and wavy in spots.  It was extrememly fast and easy.  The iron does not pull on my hair.  I don&#x27;t have to have the heat as high as I normally would because the steam helps straighten the hair as well.  The only think I would suggest it to work fast because the water runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> I saw the ad on tv and wanted to purchase this product. I only use conair since they have the best hair products ever. After reading reviews on this straightener, I was wondering how this product can give you salon results at home. Some people left negative reviews because they DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE A STRAIGHTENER. It is a shame that Conair needs to deal with negative reviews. So, I just use this straightener and was able to get straight hair in 1 hour WITHOUT USING THE STEAM. I am so amazed because the last time i straightened my hair with a ceramic stove and iron, I SPENT 3 HOURS TO GET MY HAIR SMOOTH AND SILKY. So, you are still not sure, i recommend this product to people who do not want to spend $65 everytime they go to the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I own this product. I have a few things to say about it that might be helpful. First, if you saw the informercial, it IS possible to get the results they show. The keys are patience, working slowly, a lot of steam, and a firm grip.     I&#x27;ve found that compared to other straighteners, this one gets my curly, coarse hair the silkiest and straightest. Plus, the iron-out lasts the longest without it turning back to frizz. That&#x27;s a pro.     The cons are, from dry curls to sleek and dry, takes approximately one hour of slow steaming. I find that if I move very slowly and hold the iron VERY tightly, without using the built in teeth, and with the steam reservoir on the bottom, it works the best. Always use the steam feature, it&#x27;s no different from any other iron without it.      Like I said though, it&#x27;s a good hour investment of time, although I&#x27;ve gone up to 5 days without needing to wash my hair afterwards.    Compared to the Chi and Hot Tools I&#x27;ve used, this gives the most professional results, both look and feel. I&#x27;ve also found that my very frizz prone hair stays tame even in humidity when I use the steam feature.     Con - the reservoir runs dry VERY quickly. It&#x27;s not much to refill it, it just takes a bit of careful maneuvering.    In short, give it a try from Conair with the 30 day trial period. Use it more than once to get used to it, it IS rather heavy, but I feel it does a decent job. As I stated in the title, it&#x27;s not the magic bullet of haircare, but it IS a good tool to have your arsenal.</li>
            <li> so im 13 and I had a revlon straightener that I got from target for about $20. This was about half a year ago. I thought it was okay, it didn&#x27;t really get my hair completely straightened though. I thought it was just my hair and that I had to accept it. Well, my friend told me that it could be the straightener and that I should try getting a new one, and I thought okay. I looked everywhere on the internet, and heard that the chi&#x27;s were pretty good, but they broke easily. My mom found Consumer Reports, and it voted the conair ss9 steam straghtener was best. remember, im 13 so I don&#x27;t have a job, but I did have a savings account, and so I was anxious to get it for the price, but I told myself that if it wasn&#x27;t any better than my old one it was going back. Well I got it in the mail today and tried it out straight away, in about 30-45 minutes my hair was done (so much faster than my old one) and It was perfect! I love it so much! The color makes it so cool and it was so fast and I look like i just went to the salon! My hair is softer than it has ever been and its sleek and gorgeous! I can&#x27;t even describe how awesome it is (and im very picky)! So coming from a teenager who just bought a straightener instead of a new iPod, I would say by this because it is THE BEST straightener ever!!</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy thick curly hair and with this product, for the first time in my life, I am able to have shiney straight hair. It is very easy to use.  What a difference it makes and now I have confidence when I wear my hair down.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first straightener i&#x27;ve ever used.I&#x27;m disappointed.I&#x27;ve a very high expectation from this Conair Infiniti but it&#x27;s not that great. It doesn&#x27;t steam as much as I would like it and the water goes away really fast.Only thing i like is the color and heat-resistant bag.</li>
            <li> I had an old Conair steam straightener from about 10 years ago with stainless steel plates. It did a decent job on my hair to get the minimal waves out I have after blow drying. But I always felt like it didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and shiny. So I was using a ceramic Revlon flat iron with it to achieve the best results. So basically I was straightening twice in the morning to get the look I wanted. I purchased this iron and used it for the first time on a very rainy day (which would usually cause my hair to frizz) and it was wonderful. I had been interested in this iron for some time because it seemed like a great combination between my old Conair steam straightener and my ceramic one. It cuts my straightening time in half, plus my counter is now less cluttered. The steam chamber is much nicer than my old Conair and works every time (which was an issue with my old conair). Definitely worth the investment. I would buy this again in a heart beat! Love it!</li>
            <li> The Infinity Nano Silver steam straightener was a requested Christmas present. I read all the reviews and went ahead with the purchase for my daughter. She raves about it, she finds it exactly as promised. It is light, effective,and easy to use. The results on her long hair are as desired. I was delighted with the price and her satisfaction made it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this straightener home...this was the most I have spent on any hair product, ever (I know, I know, I am cheap/poor), and I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what a steam straightener could do to my head full of unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have that strange, in-between hair that isn&#x27;t really wavy, but it&#x27;s definitely not straight.  If I were to wash it and let it air-dry, it would look like a fascinating study in indecisiveness.  Some of it would be slightly curly, some of it would curl under, some of it would curl over, and most of it would just look like I hadn&#x27;t brushed it in years.  I am NOT that girl who can just wash and go, but I&#x27;m also not the girl who can be bothered to spend more than 10-15 minutes doing anything about it.  (I should probably just shave my head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using either hair products (shampoo, serum) that contain keratin (Tresemme, Suave) or Moroccan oil (Suave) since I purchased it, and it is doing wonders with my almost shoulder-length hair.  I have layers cut in that I am currently trying to grow out, but I can honestly blow-dry my hair, run this straightener through it in less than 6 minutes, and be supremely happy with how it looks!  It is straighter than I&#x27;ve ever seen it before with any previous $20-$40 hair straighteners, and it&#x27;s not getting fried or breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that my steam function isn&#x27;t always working, even though I leave it turned on.  It&#x27;s very easy to tell when it&#x27;s working, simply from the sights and sounds of using it (duh), but also because the water in the removable reservoir disappears a million times faster.  It&#x27;s probably just something I&#x27;m doing wrong, honestly...but otherwise, couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is my third iron in the last 4 years. I like it and keep buying it because I use it every day, and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair at all, because of the steam. However, the water compartment breaks and Conair doesn&#x27;t sell the part separately, so I am forced to buy new ones often :-(</li>
            <li> I bought one of the for my daughter who is 13.  She has long hair with some curl and this does the job.  I like the fact that is has steam.  Keeps the shine in her hair and no split ends!! I actually bought a second one for my other daughter.  It heats up fast and is easy to use.  Only wish it had an automatic shut off.  Would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is a decent hair straightener, but it is lacking one very important feature - an auto shut off! I accidentally left it on one morning and it never turned off and completely melted my bathroom counter. I am lucky that there was nothing flammable near it or my entire house could have burned down. I can&#x27;t believe that auto shut offs are not required on all electronics that get this hot as the chances that they will at some point accidentally be left are good. Buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> this is a great hair steam flat iron,i was so excited, she cant wait to style her hair the next day...it makes your hair like baby hair, its so smooth.  I wouldnt purchase anything else even again, from another seller, the product arrived in 3 days!!!!!!!!!  no going anywhere else, ever!</li>
            <li> I fell victim to an infomercial I caught one afternoon a few months ago, so I saw this on amazon and placed an order. It really doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected. I have another conair typical flat iron that I got at a chain retailer that cost only about $29.95 and works way better than this one. The steam reservoir lasted only about 20 minutes on the lowest setting, and even on the highest heat setting, I didn&#x27;t feel that it did a good job of straightening my hair. I have very curly, but manageable non-coarse hair and this bad boy just didn&#x27;t cut it. I gave it 2 stars because aesthetically its a nice straightener, I liked the 9 foot cord, and I liked the included carrying case that also functions as a counter top protecter.</li>
            <li> Is is great however the piant comes off really fast</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron so much I returned my Chi Air!</li>
            <li> I have pretty straight, thick hair that needs the flat iron to give me that sleek, smooth look that I can&#x27;t get from a curling iron.  I had a ceramic iron made by Revlon that wasn&#x27;t very hot and just didn&#x27;t do a good job (plus I burned myself all the time).  This iron is wonderful!  The steam is not overpowering and it&#x27;s easy to fill with water without making a mess.  It has specific temperature readings to choose from instead of a 1-10 dial.  The best part - it came with a heat mat and a carrying case!  I had been using a folded towel on my dressing table to protect it and was thrilled to find that this had its own silver mat.  Easy to use, great results, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with ANY type of hair!</li>
            <li> I like it.  Right size, quick heat up and it does the job.  Ok value.</li>
            <li> PROS  -Easy to use  -Ions and steam work great  -Adjustable temperature setting up to about 380 degrees   -comes with cool down and storage bag  -Heats up quick  CONS  -Doesnt work good on Yaki or \\&quot;Ethnic Coarse\\&quot; hair  -Must re-fill water canister for steam during use  -Doesnt heat over 400 degrees  Works great with my silky weaves and wigs!  Sucks with my yaki weaves and wigs!  Hopes this helps :)</li>
            <li> Its OK I will keep it. I have wavy blonde hair with some frizz, I remembered steam curling irons from years back and steam rollers that made my hair more shiny than just heat, so when I saw this at this low price after seeing it when it was $100.00 I thought I would try it. I have a chi and I think this works just about as well an will probably not burnn my hair as much. Its worth it for the price but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> Is what I want, when I search and see the specifications, the product is excelent, This buy is in substitution of the older.</li>
            <li> I like this straight iron okay.  I was wanting a sleek look like at the salon, but it hasn&#x27;t happened, yet.  I blame myself for not wanting to spend a lot of time on my hair either.  I am a white female, with fine hair and a little bit of wave.  I feel like I have to dry my hair all of the way before use and now remember why I love my wet to dry flat iron. The iron does a good job for awhile, but frizz comes back before the end of the workday on me.&lt;br /&gt;  I like the steam and the feel of my hair right after use, but hate trying to get &amp;#34;distilled&amp;#34; water into the little holder.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron. I love the steam portion of the flat iron. I like that you can adjust the temperature so that you don&#x27;t need to have it fry your hair. My only complaint is that it is a little big so I can&#x27;t quite get it perfectly straight from my scalp to the end of my hair. This is probably the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy/semi-curly hair that has always been unruly. My hair was great in the 80s, when perms and big hair were in. But, my hair is not very cooperative with the smooth, straight hairstyles. I have tried various hair products, straightening irons, curling irons, dryers, etc. But, no matter how much time and effort I put into my hair, it typically ends up wavy and frizzy within a matter of hours. I thought long and hard before making this purchase and carefully reviewed all of the reviewers&#x27; comments here, as well as elsewhere on the internet. I&#x27;ve used a CHI and had some luck, but the results were not nearly as good as the Conair straightener here. I actually have another Infiniti by Conair straightener that I have been using for about 2 years, but it is not the Nano Silver and it does not have the steam feature. My older model works okay, but, again, not nearly as well as this one here. First, the Nano Silver technology really provides fast, smooth, silky results. My hair felt like silk after using the straightener. Second, the steam feature is perfect for people with naturally wavy or curly hair because it really helps to straighten fast. Think of a clothes iron -- when you use the steam feature, your wrinkles come out quick vs no steam. The steam feature is also great if you have slept on your hair -- fast touch up! Finally, and most importantly, the results last! My hair stays straight all day and, unlike any other product, it even stays relatively straight and smooth after sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the use of distilled water -- if you do not have very hard water where you live, tap water will work fine. All of the impurities have been removed from distilled water, so there is no mineral build-up in your iron if you use distilled water. It is a pain to fill, but I just stick it under the tap.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. I have natural kinky curly hair (african0american) and had a hard time finding a flat iron that didn&#x27;t leave the ends of my hair fried!!! I got this about 3 weeks ago &amp; love it. I use it in conjunction with a serum that helps my hair look health &amp; shiny without weighing it down.     At first when I seen that it had a steam feature, I thought that would not help my curly-fro...but it did. I love this thing!!!</li>
            <li> I remember my older brother using this while we were in Florida one year for vacation...and he was so angry when I used it. He was freaking out because he said he paid $150 dollars for it (whether or not this is true I really don&#x27;t know) Well I remember it worked really well then. 2 years later I find it and its only like $35. I was shocked! It got here quickly and the results were just amazing. It makes my hair perfectly straight and its quick too. I absolutely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This straightener is the best and most reasonably priced one I have ever used! You have to fill the water tank every time you use it but it is a small price to pay for straight hair that lasts all day! The digital screen is awesome and sooo much easier than the other rotating ones I&#x27;ve tried. My hair comes out smooth and manageable all day. I don&#x27;t use distilled water in mine and it still works great with tap water. I&#x27;m buying one for my sister as well! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at all the negative feedback for this iron! I have a combination of African American, and thick Dutch/ French hair..I didn&#x27;t have a chance. Not only is my hair thick, it&#x27;s curly, frizzy, and basically an Afro if I let it air dry, and better yet, shoulder length(when it&#x27;s not standing on end). My hair is even dyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This iron gets it done. It makes my hair softer than non-steam irons, and it is humidity resistant. Don&#x27;t be disillusioned though..if you have hair like mine, it&#x27;s ALWAYS going to take 30+ minutes to do your hair. Get over yourself if you think you can whip out shiny straight flat hair in 10 minutes. This makes my hair soft, polished, straight, and even movable(I can wear pony tails again and not look like a broom end!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve used Chi irons. They burn my hair and dry it out. This iron is FAR better than my 100+ dollar Chi iron, when I bought this one on sale for $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bottom line. Get one~</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! I bought my first one ten years ago when it first hit the market and recently purchased another after the element went bad. I have very thick hair and this iron makes it perfectly straight and manageable with minimal damage. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great products for African American hair. The only thing that bothers is it has started to lose its color and I&#x27;ve barely used it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener to give to someone as a gift. She loved it! However, the instructions indicate that to get the steam you have to fill it with water - and they recommended \\&quot;distilled\\&quot; water! Who keeps that around--and where would you buy it, or have time to distill your own water just to put in a hair straightener?  We use plain water, and although it may reduce the life of the straightener, I&#x27;ll sacrifice that so I don&#x27;t have to bother with distilled water. Really!! Just seemed ridiculous to me. Maybe if you keep it handy in your laboratory it wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal....Anyway, that&#x27;s why it only gets 4 stars vs 5.</li>
            <li> I have semi-long, very curly, frizzy hair with a mind of its own. This product works better than other straighteners I have tried and own. The steam feature is great as well as the variable temperature settings. On average it takes about 20 minutes to straighten my whole head with long lasting results. It would probably work even faster if it put out more steam, but overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the infomercial. Even on the hottest setting, this didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as well as my Remington does with 1/2 the heat (or even my $15 Conair) I had to refill the steam thing about 3 times just to last for my shoulder length hair. Instead of leaving my hair feeling silky, it felt more coarse than usual, and caused my hair to flip out at the ends no matter what I did. It&#x27;s easily the worst flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.     The only reason it&#x27;s getting more than one star is because my little sister used it as well and liked it, even though her hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li> This  straightner  works  very  well  and leaves my  hair  very  soft  feeling.  I  have  course  thick  hair .  One  thing  a person  does  need  is  a  12 CC  syringe  to  fill  up  the  water reserviour  and  it  has to  be  forced  in  to  fill  it  up  properly.</li>
            <li> The Infinit by Conair works really well. I&#x27;m African-American woman with about medium thinkness hair with no relaxer. It straightened my hair easily. I also tried it on my sister and mom. My sister has really thick, coarse and long hair that does have relaxer in it (although you can&#x27;t tell). That flat iron easily straighten her hair out. My mom&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t as thick as it use to be and she also has an relaxer. I used it on her hair it and easily straightened her hair also. Her hair is still a bit thicker then mine. So, there you have it 3 different textures of hair that the Infiniti has worked on. I would highly recommend this to any of my friends or strangers. It is easier to use then the Maxi Glide because it isn&#x27;t as bulky. Now I haven&#x27;t tried the steam fuction yet but I can only imagine it would only improve how the hair looks.[[ASIN:B00132TISE Infiniti by Conair SS9 1 1/2\\&quot; Nano Silver Steam Straightner, Red]]</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it.  It comes with a very nice heat resistant storage case.  It is easy to use and not damaging to hair like the old style straighteners.  I highly recommend this product as an essential beauty item.</li>
            <li> I had my hair straightened (Japanese Straightening) and have about 4 inches growth since. My hair is naturally wavy, so the difference was getting too noticeable so I bought this one after a lot of research.     And I would have to say ... this one works like magic. After fixing my hair I can not tell the difference between my natural hair and chemically straightened hair. It gives a nice shine to hair and softness.     After a few trials, the thing that I found was that this thing works best for my hair when .... the hair is completely DRY!!!</li>
            <li> Avoid this contraption at all costs.  Not only is it too heavy, it won&#x27;t even sit upright when you sit it down; it just falls over to potentially burn your counter. The tiny, little steam resevoir lasts about 20 minutes which means you have to refill it at least every day with distilled water (I just love having a gallon of distilled water on my counter hogging up space).  The little tiny hole you have to pour the water in is a joke as well.  The small water resevoir pops out often and also constantly snags my hair and pulls it out when I&#x27;m straigtening it.  The steam coming out of the thing has burned my hand several times too.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  I&#x27;m returning mine ASAP!</li>
            <li> OK, so I bought this because I researched on Consumer Digest for the best selling, best overall flat iron.  This was it.  The reviews were all good.  While I like it, it is heavier than I was used to (I left my perfect flat iron at a hotel and have no idea what brand it was to replace it), doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair out like my old one and just took a lot of getting used to.  But it works.  It is good in all the areas it touts....heats up quickly, long cord, steam works well, built in comb feature.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife so she could compare it with her chi. She loves the Conair for straightening, but she wished it only had 1 inch plates, because she also uses her chi for curling. While she could use a separate curler, she likes to be able to have one product which can serve both functions. But she does indicate, that the Conair works better than her chi, and she uses it most of the time.</li>
            <li> this Infiniti Conair Nano Silver Steam Strightner does not give enough steam and when it does it lasts a few minutes, not enough to do but a few strands of hair...One cannot add more water to keep on going with the steam because the whole iron gets too hot, so in order to get more steam it is necessary to wait until the iron is cool!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the infinity by conair ss9 hair straightner that used with steam.It has made my hair really dry.I have hair that&lt;br /&gt;is pass my shoulder and thick so thought this would work well in my hair.Very disappointed in the product.The reviews were great on it this is why I purchased it but man it not a good straighter.</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron about four years ago and it is amazing. My hair is pretty thick, curly, and unruly but with this iron it becomes completely straight. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and damaged looking and as I said I have had it for four years and it still works just as well as the first time I got it. In all honesty, the steam cup thingy isn&#x27;t really necessary (i.e. I don&#x27;t use it at all), but my only real complaint is that some of the paint peeled off, but that was due to misuse on my part.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because I wanted to maximize the health of my hair while using heat. I figured that using steam would be a great way to do that. I should have done a little more research before purchasing it. What I found out is there&#x27;s such a thing as bubble hair and that&#x27;s when your hair has bubble-like lesions which are actually gas filled cavities created by the rapid vaporization of moisture within the hair-shaft. there&#x27;s no way to correct this except by cutting your hair off. This can definitely be caused by steaming the hair. The flat iron in my opinion doesn&#x27;t get the hair as straight as a regular flat iron does. I don&#x27;t know if I recommend this tool to anyone at this point.</li>
            <li> I have really hard to style hair and this tool works really really well. It tames the frizz quickly. Heats fast and has a heat proof bag to put it in?</li>
            <li> I have long  hair and very  curly, I did purchase the infinity conair nano and it works great. Even After my Japanese straightener it works great smoothing your hair completely and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Infiniti by Conair SS9 1 1/2\\&quot; Nano Silver Steam Straightner, Red. This product is a pretty good steam flat iron. The only three set backs are that it&#x27;s a little on the bulky side, you will not be able to get close to the hair shaft, and the max temperature setting is 395 F. These set backs can be a problem with ethnic hair. So don&#x27;t put away your smaller flattners. In addition, if you have natural or chemically treated hair, please make sure you use a hair protectant to help minimize the damage from the heat. Chemically relaxed hair requires less heat then non chemically relaxed hair in most cases. Buying this flattner will truly save you money compared to what a trip to the salon would cost.</li>
            <li> I got this straigtner and it was the worst.  I doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  It only worked for about a month.  I paid alot of money</li>
            <li> Great product, my hair comes out, fabulous</li>
            <li> This product may work for relaxed African American hair or for non-curly/straight textures, but I was extremely disappointed. This flat iron snags the hair and doesn&#x27;t close all the way. It&#x27;s not 100% ceramic so it left my hair poofy. I am going to return it asap.</li>
            <li> Well, I have used this item for over 2 months and decided now it is a good time to write a review. I think the product is pretty good for the amount I paid for it. It comes with a heat-resistant bag and a warrenty! The only down side is that you have keep the steam holes clean so the steam actually comes out. The result lasts longer than regular straighteners. I give it a 4/5 :]</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of dealing with high maintenance hair that never really looks good, I am impressed! Truly the only time my hair looks good is when some else does it. I have thick frizzy, curly hair that I don&#x27;t usually have the time or patience to deal with. I have gone years with just air drying my hair and leaving it curly. Trying multitudes of hair products to limit the frizz. Honestly I couldn&#x27;t style my hair if my life depended on it. I was not born with the natural ability to be create beautiful hair. With that said, I&#x27;ve been walking around for a week now looking like I went to the hair stylist everyday! My hair looks so soft, shiny and straight that my friends and family are skeptical that I myself accomplished this. My hair feels and looks healthier. And did I mention soft! My hair has never been soft! I would recommend this product to any woman that has suffered as I have through the years. It is actually easy to use. If it only takes me 20-25 min. to use, I would imagine that some one that knows what they are doing could do it in less time.</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for and love the steaming function</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the one I bought 5 years ago. My mistake was not using bottled water of some sort. I live in an area that has soft water and has lime deposits. This, of course, caused the heads to clog and not work efficiently. Lesson learned. Great product. Love it, and very glad I was able to replace the previous one.</li>
            <li> It was ok. Not as good as I thought it would be. If you really need to get close to the roots you may need a hotter flat iron. Though I will say that the combs are great. The steam is good to and I can tell a difference between steaming it and not. But overall it&#x27;s average to me. I had prior to buying this one n I will continue to use that one for the most part.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my daughter-in-law because hers was broken.  Hopefully, she liked it because I have not heard a complaint plus it was just a replacement.  I&#x27;m going to assume it was a hit.</li>
            <li> The price i bought this for including shipping and handling was half the amount my country was selling it retail for. This is an excellent product, it works perfectly, easy to use, and heats up very quickly. I was pleased with the packaging by amazon and the price.</li>
            <li> This flat iron cut down the time it took to get my hair done. I read the reviews prior to buying it and someone said the plastic cap(to put in distilled water) was hard to get off. I didn&#x27;t have that problem at all.     Great price!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I use it every time I straighten! It makes my hair sleek and thinner looking and very very soft! I will use this for a long time! Love the steam and comb too! Totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> I am an AA with medium coarse hair.  I allowed my hair to air dry in braided sections overnight, then used the iron (Infiniti SS9 1 1/2\\&quot;) the next day with Silk Essentials.  The straightener worked great at it&#x27;s high temp setting of 395 to straighten with only one pass per two-inch section of hair.  At times, when I wanted a curl, I found that my hair would get caught in the compartment cover for the water.  I had to be sure after that to put all of my hair in the section before the compartment started or take the cover off completely.  Not a big issue as the iron works well with or without the chamber for my hair.  The inner comb has adjustable heights and works well to help de-tangle even further.  I would recommend this for AA women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the review on Youtube helpful in making my decision to buy this iron over the In-styler, which did not work as well on my hair.</li>
            <li> This works very well for thick, wavy hair, when I use the highest heat setting.  I can&#x27;t duplicate the sleek look you get at the salon, but this does a good job of straightening my hair and making it manageable.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Heat from iron cracks water holding compartment</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself at Christmas, and LOVE it.  I have curly/frizzy hair - my kids joke about my 3 inch ponytail, which (straightened) is now about 10 inches long!  Some other reviewers have complained about the steam reservoir not being big enough - I have long hair (middle of my back) and I have only run out of steam once or twice in 2 months.  I go over each section of hair twice, and it comes out great.  If I&#x27;m outside in the wind on a humid day, my hair starts to get bigger, or if it gets wet (sweat, mist, rain) then there is a bit of frizz or curl.  But, I can go over it (5 min.) with my Conair straightener, and it looks great again!    The only \\&quot;bad\\&quot; thing about this product is that from the first use, the red paint near the steam plates (corners) has been coming off.  This doesn&#x27;t really affect its performance, but it just looks like I&#x27;ve had it for a few years instead of months.</li>
            <li> What I was looking for and not sold in stores any longer.  Also bought at a cheaper price than what it was originally.</li>
            <li> I recommend the the Infiniti Hair Straightner, it heats up quickly, you have the option of using a little steam or use it dry.  Tried it both ways and it works just fine.  Won&#x27;t burn you hair. You have differenct temperature controls on the side.  The price was excellent, I tried researching other places for this same product, it was way more expensive.  I have tried other hair straightners that did not work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST straightener EVER!!! I got my first one in 2004 and it finally just broke so I ordered another one the next day! I can&#x27;t live without this straightener!!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron that I ever used!It works great with my hair texture (African American) I did not buy this from Amazon, but I got it as a gift from a store called Big Lots in CA for less than 20 bucks! which is amazing after seeing the prices on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hello   Expressly excellent device and works very actively.   I advise you to buy the product.  Excellent A+ .  Thank you.  ^_^</li>
            <li> An excellent hair steamer. I purchased for my girlfriend for Christmas, and she loves it. Straightens hair without frying it like a standard straightener. It does require you to buy distilled water, but that can be purchased at grocery store for $1.00 a gallon. If you have thicker hair, it will require you to go over several times. Overall, a great buy.</li>
            <li> The button to activate the steam is inside the two handles so when you squeeze it shut it is supposed to burst the steam.  You cannot do it separately by a button on the outside like the old Maxius Maxiglide.  The problem is, you can only have the tiniest piece of hair in between the plates to get the steam to work.  Otherwise the thickness of your hair prevents the button from being pushed to activate the steam.  Poor design.  It should have steam activator button on the outside!  I did like the popup comb feature that you can use or not.  Still not as good as the old Maxiglide.  Wish they would go back into business!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned.  Worth the price.  The steam helps my hair.  I don[t use it everyday, but when I use it, it straightens my hair and I can curl the ends.  I love this flat iron.  I wonder if they make this in 3/4 inch or 1 inch?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but the steam container started leaking after about a month. You have to be very careful when using this because if it leaks it&#x27;s hot water and can burn you. You also have to be careful not to go too close to your scalp, trust me a burst of steam to the scalp does NOT feel good. If it wasn&#x27;t for the container that leaks sometimes I&#x27;d give it a higher rating because it does work faster than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve tried and the straightening lasts longer. I&#x27;m kind of shocked there hasn&#x27;t been a recall yet</li>
            <li> I was enthralled by the infomercial on this product. I debated ordering it for so long because of the cost, but decided to go for it. I actually ordered from Conair direct, and the product was on back order for a month.  In fact, they lost my internet order and had me place it over the phone, and low and behold, I received two straighteners and was charged twice....  Anyways, I was still excited to try the product.  I have hair that falls past my shoulders that is very thick, and naturally wavy.  I filled the reservoir and turned the heat to the second highest setting.  I had to further turn it up to the highest setting to get better results.  I had to go over each section more than once, saving NO time!  I was still left with fly-aways.  I really don&#x27;t see anything wonderful about this product, except that it looks nice. I took advantage of their offer and returned it, so I lost like $23 with shipping and handling. I&#x27;d go with a better quality salon straightener, or use one of Conair&#x27;s other products that are less expensive and work a lot better.</li>
            <li> I just love this produce.  I am a African American with coarse thick relaxed hair.  I must say after using this product I will not use another kind of straightner or flat iron.  I love the combs, and the adjustable heat settings.  It made my hair soft and silky.  I also used it on my neice who has long really thick hair.  It usually takes forever to finish, however I was done much quicker.  She just loved how it felt when I finished, as it was shiny and silky.     Great!!!!</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I bought this product!  I agree with the reviewer below who mentioned that the steam resevoir doesn&#x27;t last very long (it will run out of water in 10 mins) and the quality of the ceramic plates isn&#x27;t very good.  It felt rough when I ran it through my hair.  I tried my friend&#x27;s CHI hair straightener I wish I bought that one instead. Boo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on this product for quite some time and finally purchased it. It straightens my hair quickly and easily. The style holds until you wash your hair. I&#x27;ve received compliments on how straight and shiny my hair is(it looked professional). The water storage compartment opening is very small and difficult to fill. But, overall I really enjoy this product. It&#x27;s heats quickly, straightens hair fast and the style holds.</li>
            <li> In short, it was heavy compare to the other flat irons I&#x27;ve used. The water in the reservoir(which was full) ran out before I can even finish my whole hair (shoulder length). The on/off button keeps turning off on me while I&#x27;m using it.  It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as good as the other flat irons. I would recommend the ghd or the Chi which what my hairstylist uses.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti is indeed the most effective straightener I&#x27;ve ever tried.  And is very quick to heat.  However, the water runs out at a alarmingly fast rate and even if you have water in the reserve, there is not a steam output on every section you&#x27;re straightening.  The directions sorely lack in this area and it leaves the user to wonder if they&#x27;re doing something incorrectly.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little wavy, and it takes a llllooooonnnngggg time to straighten it with this straightner.   I have to go over my waves, like 3 or 4 times. and it is still wavy.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my 15 year old granddaughter who listed it as her #1 request this year. It came intact but shipping took longer than promised.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Straightener worked great on my crazy hair. Other straightening irons left my hair looking very dried out and frizzy. Not to mention turning my already damaged hair into straw. The Infiniti Steam Straightener worked quickly and easily. It left my hair feeling soft, looking shiny, not frizzy, and of course straight. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I agree that the compartment for the water is too small.  It straightened my hair acceptably.      I&#x27;m still looking for the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of flat irons that will straighten, add shine and somehow heal a weird patch of my hair (underneath the bulk of my hair in the back).  This product isn&#x27;t it, and I don&#x27;t want to do Brazilian straightening because I like to wear my hair curly, too.  I will keep looking...</li>
            <li> A little background info about me and my hair.  I&#x27;m 41, bleach my hair, have well water, and love to straighten my hair.  All 4 of those things together mean one thing:  Hair Breakage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had sworn off flat irons after my hair broke off about 2 years ago.  It has grown back now, so I&#x27;m looking for healthy ways to style it.  I started out with a couple of sets of steam rollers.  They do great on my hair.  Guilt-free styling... but what if I want straight hair?  Without the damage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this was the answer.  I have very thick hair, but it only took me about 10 minutes to straighten all of it, and it looks AND FEELS wonderful!  You have to try this iron if you have lifeless, damaged hair.  If nothing else, get it for yourself for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I lost my money, it didn´t work. I bought on January 2012 but just tried to use now, there was no heat or steam at all. Now I´m orverseas, I can´t return the item.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I was so excited to get this straightener.  I am so very disappointed in it.  I do not recommend this product to anyone who has thick hair.  I can smell my hair burning as I use it, and that smell stays with my hair throughout the day.  I have to refill the steam compartment with water at least three times just to straighten all of my hair.  My hair looks fried whenever I use it, and it does not stay straight throughout the day.  The amount of time it takes to straighten my hair has doubled.  I emailed the seller to see if I could return it, as I am extremely unsatisfied with my purchase, and I have not heard anything back.  I am worried that because it has been opened, they will not take it back and I will have just wasted $40. Spend the extra money on a professional straightener; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do.  I was hesitant to go the \\&quot;Conair\\&quot;/non professional route to begin with, but when my expensive one broke and I read all the reviews, I thought, this just may work.  I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it. Waste of money. Not happy at all. Does not straighten my hair the way people said it does in their reviews. I have 3c hair if anyone wants to know. Hope this review helps</li>
            <li> The only con is that just a tiny amount of water fits in the compartment, but I don&#x27;t use it anyway. I think it&#x27;s easier if you leave your hair almost dry afeter you wash it and then use the iron. It really straightens without drying it out. Seems to me to be of good qualiy.</li>
            <li> not for short hair people, and it does get hot...it does snag my hair sometimes...but it smoothes the hairn if you have alot of heat protectant on</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Really straigtens hair without burning.  Steam works great.  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I returned this item, because I was very disappointed...particularly for the price and the hype.  The steam function was minimal and it&#x27;s heavy compared to other hair straighteners.</li>
            <li> I have always thought Conair made cheap products, and this one is a perfect example.  I thought steam would be better on curly coarse hair like mine, but it left me with a fuzzy mess and the plates are very poor quality. I&#x27;m glad I tried one someone else purchased and spent my hard earned money on a Chi, now that is a great straightener!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different hair straighteners, from Paul Brown, Chi, Fhi, Zoe, and recently Kiyosaki.  I always end up taking them back because I don&#x27;t like the results it gives me on my hair.  My hair ends up looking really dry.  And cost has never been a factor.  I have bought flat irons as low as $25 and and much as $125.  Nothing has seemed to do justice on my hair.  I did recently purchase the Infiniti Steam Straightener.  After using it, my hair felt so soft.  I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.  Even the ends of my hair didn&#x27;t look dry.  I figured before that my hair needed to be cut because my ends were so dry, but with this straightener, my ends looks great.  I even had a friend talking to me the other night and I wasn&#x27;t listening to her because I kept feeling my hair and thinking about how soft it felt.  The water does run out fast, but I simply turn it off and fill it back up.  In the mean time, I do my makeup or something productive.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  I started using her old straightner myself and then borrowed her new Infiniti one.  What a big differnce!  The Infinity by Conair Nano Silver Steam Straightner is the best ever!  I threw away the old straightner and bought myself the Infinity also - now we each have one and both love it!</li>
            <li> I owe the ceramic pro which works very well, however, this product works really well on my daughters long curly hair.  I can flat iron her hair whether its wet or dry and it takes me only half the time.  I love the product</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my steam flat iron. It styles my hair really well. My hair is chemically treated with a relaxer. Whenever I used the regular flat iron, my hair looked dry and frizzy. With my new steam flat iron, there is no more frizz and no more dryness. I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Her hair is chemically treated with a texturizer. This product made her hair very straight and there was no frizz or dryness. It use it almost everyday because I love the results.</li>
            <li> Infiniti Pro- Nano Silver Flat Iron- with steamer... is the best Flat Iron I&#x27;ve ever had, with no hair damage what so ever. I love the built in steamer and the fact that hair does not burn my fingers after I use the flat iron on it; this is a sign of not having you hair damaged with every use. I recently had to replace my first Infiniti Pro-NSS Flat Iron after I used it almost every day for the past 7 years (BTW...it still works but I accidentally broke the steam cap). After a long research for a new one I finally found the same exact one flat iron. So happy for that. The reason for the 4 star rate, is because of the steamer cap...is too hard to snap back on compared to the older one. I recommend this flat iron to anyone, regardless of the thickness of hair. :)</li>
            <li> This seems to work better for my hair when the steam is turned off.  It goes up to 390 degrees which I guess is good for me, otherwise I may burn my hair.  It gets the job done.  I like it.</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON IT THE #TRUTH.COM!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair straightener hands down. I love the steam and the heat protecting case that comes with it. I have bought four of them throughout the years (I like to drop things) and others have tried mine and bought for themselves. I am sad Conair does not manufacturer them anymore, but the were kind enough to tell me about a comparable product in it&#x27; s place (Babyliss Pro TT). I also love the retractable comb as it seems to help glide it through my hair easier without pulling. I have medium length hair and after blow drying, I can straighten in less than ten minutes and it heats up in no time. The water reservoir has broken on me once from a fall and Conair sent me one no charge no questions asked.</li>
            <li> Good but I need put in high level for best results. I have straight hair so I Thought I needed less temperature.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice flat iron.  The added steam feature is nice and I will use it more when it is more humid.</li>
            <li> So when I received this I was very excited. It worked for about 3 months using on a daily basis than the attachment that holds the water would not stay on. So if you wanted stem you had to hold the attachment down while also trying to straighten you hair. Yep, paid that much for something that I trashed after 3 months do to me needing stem to straighten my thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I just love this hot iron.  I have been wanting one for some time now! I really wanted one with steam. My hair feels so much silkier and softer since using this hot iron.  I have had no issues with filling, steam or use of this hot iron.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that asks!</li>
            <li> This flat iron offers some good features and was well rated.  My wife finds it a little big, considering her last one was 1,&amp;#34; but she likes its.  There are no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this flat iron. Really works great...</li>
            <li> I love this straightner it heats up well, the steam is an amazing addition. But I deducted 1 start because my hair gets stuck in between the plates. You have to get tiny sections of hair in order for that not to happen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other flat irons and always come back to this one. In 10 years I have only purchased 2 of these, and the most recent one was just 2 years ago. They are very durable.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener since Christmas of 2008, and am still using it today. The retractable combs in the middle of the ceramic plates are great to guide my curly hair through them. I always use it with steam on the highest setting, it adds a little something extra every time I style. After so many years of use, it&#x27;s been all used out with product build up causing a burning smell when heated, the water vessel falling out on it&#x27;s own and the comb stuck in the down position. This is a sturdy, trusty straightener that worked seamlessly for 6 years. I recommend this product to anyone who took the time to read my review.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy. I love the multiple temp, comb and steam settings, they give me much more control of my hairstyle while minimizing heat damage to my hair. The comb is also very helpful as it makes it easier to keep the streaks straight to the tips without needing to use an extra comb. The nano styles fast and I am usually done in less than 10-15 minutes. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;  A tad bulky. Bigger and heaver than I expected but not something one can&#x27;t get used to. Might be a concern if you plan to travel with it. I also wish it came in different colors (other than red). One more thing would have been more detailed instructions, though I was able to figure it out quickly so no worries there. Sometimes hairs get stuck between the straightener and the water container.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall this is a great product. Even with humid air, I found my straight streaks last much longer than with my previous straightener without even the tips curling up. I also love the heat resistant storage pouch which also doubles up as a counter protector. Thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> I DID NOT LIKE IT, THE WATER DRIPPED INTO MY FOOT AND IT HURT SOMETIMES, KIND OF CHEAP</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used it yet so i can&#x27;t rate it, i&#x27;m just wondering where can i get distilled water, and will it work without distilled water?</li>
            <li> I bought this as a backup flatiron when I found it dirt cheap. I was hoping that it might outperform my trusty Chi &amp; I would have a nice, shiny new flatiron, but I should have known better. I&#x27;ve used it several times now and with or without steam, it simply does not straighten as well as the Chi, even with the temperature controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir is ridiculously small, and you literally have to use an eyedropper to fill it. I like that it has a long power cord and automatic shut off, but ultimately neither of these features make up for the fact that this flatiron does not straighten as well as my Chi, no matter how small I make my hair sections or how many passes I make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In places where my hair is relatively straight to begin with, it will give it a more flat, polished look, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to taming my mermaid waves in the back. I think it also makes my hair feel more dry and brittle. It&#x27;s better than nothing, but you should save your money and invest in a Chi. The steam, comb and temperature controls are gimmicks that simply don&#x27;t work. Skip it unless you&#x27;re in some sort of a pinch and can&#x27;t find a styling tool that&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap one before and this one is much better than that.  But it is not perfect. I need to blow dry my hair before using this product. It does not pull your hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much the worst hair on the face of the planet. It&#x27;s thick, poofy, and just altogether ridiculous. Unstraightened, I look like a lion which is why I have affectionately dubbed my hair &#x27;the lion&#x27;s mane&#x27;. I had a Chi straightener for a while, but I really wasn&#x27;t very happy with the results. Some days it would turn out alright, but it never stayed straight for very long and it really fried my hair. I found this straightener while browsing the internet one day and was kind of skeptical, but I was ready to try something new so I bought it. It is basically the best purchase I have ever made. After using this, my hair is amazingly straight, shiny, smooth and SOFT. I have NEVER been able to describe my hair as soft before. Now my hair feels like silk. I LOVE this straightener so much words cannot possibly describe it.</li>
            <li> ok so i bought this flat iron mainly because of the cool water thingy that actually creates steam and leaves&lt;br /&gt;your hair smooth and silkyy. i swear it really does leave your hair just like it says it would and better!&lt;br /&gt;when doing my hair i used the chi thermal protection just to protect my hair and its a great product&lt;br /&gt;got it on amazon for 3 bucks i would deff recommend the chi spray. my hair is like curly/wavy but i have thick hair! and this&lt;br /&gt;iron did the job for me i only passed it once and my hair ws straight over all this is the best flat iron i have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MUST BUY! plus its super cheap here and p.s comes with cute lilttle carrying case &#x3D;) enjoy</li>
            <li> this was a great buy for the money and it works so well on the hair</li>
            <li> It was alright when it worked.  Within 2 months the straightener stopped working.  Can&#x27;t return, no warranty.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this is the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have drawers full of curling irons and flat irons that just don&#x27;t do the job. THIS one does it, and leaves my hair softer than it&#x27;s ever been. I love the steam feature! Something about that steam is softening my once-crispy bangs, and I never thought that could happen. The teeth are just right. No tangling, yet they guide and help straighten. I love, love, love this flat iron! Worth the money.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very coarse hair which becomes frizzy.  This heats high enough to straighten her hair.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  She said this one works much better than the one she replaced.</li>
            <li> Did a side by side comparison with a Chi Ionic straightener.  I don&#x27;t have time to fool around before work in the mornings, so I wanted something that heated up in a minute and did one pass straightening.  Both the Chi and the Infiniti did that.  But :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. The Conair left my hair shinier and in better condition.&lt;br /&gt;  I have shoulder length super thick curly/frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;  Both have ions and good plates. Used the same temp on both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  2. The Conair was faster. 1-2 passes compared to the Chi which took a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;  Think the 1-1/2\\&quot; Conair plate size versus Chi 1\\&quot; plate size might have made&lt;br /&gt;  the difference on thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3. Controls on the Conair extremely easy to use and SEE. Plus auto shutoff.&lt;br /&gt;  Controls on the Chi are inside the handle and extremely hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;  Had to take a close look to see if switched on or off. Not good when your&lt;br /&gt;  running out the door.  I believe this Chi had a auto shutoff but I had to&lt;br /&gt;  go thru the instructions to make sure. Not listed on box. I believe a&lt;br /&gt;  number of Chi&#x27;s don&#x27;t have the auto shutoff so had to carefully check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  4. The Chi was longer and harder to work with (top of my haircut is short).&lt;br /&gt;  The Conair is easier to handle and seems to grip the hair better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the Conair for years now.  No problems, still works really well (well enough to take on a Chi and win). I use the mid steam when I remember to put water in it. Most times not :)</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I have hard to straighten, thick, course, wavy hair. With very little product and no brush or blowdryer, I was able to completely straighten dry my hair in less than 5 minutes. And not just my normal puffy, frizzy, why-did-I-even-bother straightening - - - smooth, shiny, like-I-had-a-blowout-at-the-salon straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great Flat Iron.  Just started using steam function and love it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my nano conair straightner. I have Indian fuzzy hair and it works well. I just have to take little (about 1/2 inch thick)at a time. It takes about 10-15 min. Without a wash, it stays for atleast 5 days.</li>
            <li> This is a decent iron for a pretty good price.  There are a couple things I don&#x27;t like though.  The plates aren&#x27;t very wide so it&#x27;s pretty slow for straightning hair that is VERY curly from a perm.  The steam part doesn&#x27;t hold much water at all, and you have to turn it off and let it cool down before you add more water.  I don&#x27;t have that much time in the morning.  If you have time, or short hair it would be amazing.</li>
            <li> The Infinity 1 1/2 Steam Flat Iron by Conair works fabulously! I received one for Christmas in 2008 and broke the reservoir, I tried online to find a replacement reservoir but no luck. The original was priced at $100 and that was ON SALE! This was a great bargain and I decided to just get a new one. Turns out that if you call Conair they can ship you the reservoir for about four dollars. I ordered a couple spare as my daughter and sister also have one. We all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Infinity heats up quickly and does a fantastic job straightening my VERY thick past my shoulders, un-relaxed ethnic hair. I had thought that with the steam it would be frizzy but it does such a great job that I quit using relaxers to tame my hair. It does take a bit to get used to, but once you do-you will LOVE the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this flat iron.  I have never paid $60 for a flat iron and now I know why I couldn&#x27;t get the great results with my hair that others were getting.  It&#x27;s all in the steam feature.  I had never heard of steam in a flat iron but reading the rave reviews on Amazon convinced me to try it.  When I don&#x27;t use the steam, my hair frizzes and has flyways.  When I do use the steam, not only does it iron flat and shiny but it takes half the time to do my hair.  I have shoulder length, color treated hair and it takes less than 10 minutes to achieve a straight, flat, shiny look for work.  It also lasts an additional day or two so that all I have to do is spray in some dry shampoo, touch is up with the flat iron, and out the door. I already recommended this to another friend who purchased and loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I have owned this exact flat iron for about 5 years now and loved it so much I bought this one as a gift.  I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this - but I will try to get them all on here.  The steam is wonderful, and has no &amp;#34;frizzing&amp;#34; effect on your hair.  There is an adjustable comb that can be completely adjusted flat (so there is no comb) or up two different lengths, and I love to use that on my hair.  The iron itself is not heavy and isn&#x27;t too large - but the iron is also not so small that you have to spend a lot of extra time using it.  Love, love, love this iron.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best flat irons I have ever owned.  It has the addition of steam so you can style dry hair easily.  I actually don&#x27;t need a styling spray when I use it.  I don&#x27;t think Ill ever go back to one without the steam.. This one heat quickly lots of different heat settings.  Seems to leave my hair very shiny.,  I am an older lady so my hair is thinning.  I need all the body I can get and this does the job.</li>
            <li> After just 6 months, ( I only used the flat iron about 25 times), the water reservoir would no longer stay attached to the flat iron.  Very disappointing, because the steam heat made my hair look very healthy and shiny.  Without the water reservoir, I was not happy with the results of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It could have been better but let me tell you, I am African American with THAT hair. The 4C hair (or hair with very little to no curl pattern) that never straighten no matter if it is heated or permed, both yield nearly the same results; frizzy, puffy hair after a few hours. This nearly straighten my hair what most would consider to be bone straight. Notice I say almost. Maybe it might be my technique, after some months or a year, I plan to do an update. Note: My hair isn&#x27;t heat trained. I plan to keep using it and work on my deep conditioning technique since it seems like my hair was a little dry, the steam setting seemed to help a little but I think I will wait before making a final decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, much better than any other flat iron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update 05/06/14] I think it may have lost a star from when I first started using to just last week. I&#x27;ve come to the harsh reality that though I get decent results, it just doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to give me long lasting results and thus I have reverted to using my older iron. My hair felt hard in comparison to when I use the steam iron but I&#x27;ve decided to get my hair \\&quot;trained\\&quot; first before going back to the steam iron. I will update again in a some months, it will be a while because I don&#x27;t want to severely heat damage my hair (some damage is expected, manageable and necessary though due to how rough my hair is)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron. The first few times I&#x27;d straighten my hair, it&#x27;d turn out SUPERRRRR SHINYYYY! i have extremely, ridiculously, long hair (super thick as well) and my ends would be straight.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT SHARE THIS IRON WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND DO NOT PUT PRODUCTS ON HAIR BEFORE APPLYING STRAIGHTENING IRON.&lt;br /&gt;Bad experience. if so, the iron will stay greasy and you won&#x27;t achieve best results. BUT ISN&#x27;T THAT A GIVEN?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes my hair would get caught in the iron and it&#x27;d rip my hair. The steam doesn&#x27;t stay too long, leaving you to constantly refill the water for the steam at least 15 times (perhaps it&#x27;s because my hair is long?). That&#x27;s the only issue. However, you don&#x27;t need the steam so much. It just really locks in moisture on humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister purchased the same iron and her hair ALWAYS LOOKS GREAT AND SHINY! She doesn&#x27;t use the steam. She has thin and medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second iron. I broke the first one in half on my birthday just by squeezing it too tight. But I&#x27;ll be holding on to this one.&lt;br /&gt;AND THE PRICE IS AMAZING!!! WHEN THIS FIRST CAME OUT, IT WAS $120. I PAID $60 THE FIRST TIME, AND $35 THE SECOND TIME!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend for Christmas, And she loves it. She saidit works like magic she has very curly hair</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly.  The flatiron works great as mentioned in Consumer Reports.  I think it&#x27;s comparable to the Chi.  My 12-year old thinks it&#x27;s a little heavy but she thinks it works as well as the Chi.  It&#x27;s 1/3 of the price of a Chi.  I already bought one for my sister.</li>
            <li> This was the second one that came to me the first the box was damaged through packaging.  The second one was fine although the silver silender holding the hairdryer wasn&#x27;t closing like it should the magnectic clasp wasn&#x27;t shutting properly I had to push it in a little.</li>
            <li> I have very course hair that has some random waves.  A lot of the other straighteners don&#x27;t work as well. The steam feature really helps with my hair. I am of Caucasian/Hispanic decent.</li>
            <li> Straightens hair well.  Alittle heavy and handle alittle difficult to hold to - not as ergonomic as could be.  Like the ability to use built-in hair separator/comb feature or not (has button you can choose to use or not use).  Also like that you can use steam or not as well.</li>
            <li> LE REGALE ESTE ARTICULO A MI ESPOSA, PARA AHORRARLE TIEMPO DE IR A LA PELUQUERIA Y AUN CUANDO ELLA TIENE EL CABELLO MUY LISO, ESTA PLANCHA NO FUNCIONA BIEN, LA MAXIMA TEMPERATURA ES AUN MUY BAJA Y NO DA EL RESULTADO ESPERADO, EL PRECIO ME PARECIO BIEN PERO VIENDO LOS RESULTADOS YA ENTIENDO PORQUE SON MAS ECONOMICAS QUE LAS OTRAS MARCAS, DE VERDAD QUE NO LA RECOMENDAMOS PORQUE NO DA UN BUEN RENDIMIENTO NI SIQUIERA EN CABELLO TOTALMENTE LISO...</li>
            <li> It is not a perfect straightener but so far not bad.The only problem is it&#x27;s too heavy.I have a short hair but after ironing my whole hair with it, I become so tired because it&#x27; too heavy to keep.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.I have really thick frizzy curly hair that&#x27;s really hard to straighten sometimes but this product does the job.It makes my hair so soft and silky.I just love it I just wish I had bought this straightner sooner.I soooooooooooooooooo can not live without it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Conair</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first because I did not pay alot for this iron, nor had I heard a ton, plus, my curl pattern is 3c and I have a lot of it!  But I love this and I only have to refill the water compartment three times for my very thick hair.  It takes some getting used to, but there is a trick you can do to fill it up through it&#x27;s small hole.  You can either use a dental syringe, or you can cover one of the holes up, and under the faucet pour the water in the larger of the two holes and alternatley turn it right side up to let the air out.  Doesn&#x27;t take long at all.  I&#x27;ve noticed my hair overall has improved in its quality, which makes styling it other days I don&#x27;t use this iron, even after washing it, much easier.  My hair stays moisturized, straight, and most of all with plenty of movement.  The teeth in the plates have three levels, no teeth, mid-height, and tall, and the steam you can either turn off, have on low, or have on high.  I use both on their maximum settings.  Defintely turn the iron off when you have to refill the water compartment and remove it, or else you will burn yourself!!!  It heats up very quickly.  I cannot say enough good about this iron, I wish I had it three years ago!!!</li>
            <li> I used this for New Years and i saw no steam but will continue to use it. I have the steam waver by Conair and that Rocks and the steam works wonders.  I am a little disappointed but will try again until it works,lol. It better or i&#x27;ll return it and re-order. I hope it&#x27;s NOT defective. It does get really HOT at 395 and i normaly use 450 heat settings.  The combs worked on my thick coarse hair and it did do the trick and got my hair pin straight,YAY! But  bought this for the \\&quot;Steam\\&quot; feature.  Can&#x27;t win em&#x27; all.  This is why it got 4 stars and NOT 5! UPDATE: I am receiving a NEW flat iron for \\&quot;free\\&quot;. I did NOT have to return mine and can donate it or keep it but will get my replacement by Jan 8th GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Thanks Amazon. 5 stars it is!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift, but after reading the reviews, I decided to try it on to see how it would go.  Soooo, I ended up keeping it for myself. This hair straightener is great, works smoothly, and I do love the steam feature that this one has. It makes my hair shiny, smooth, and super straightened! I&#x27;d recommend it with no doubt!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. As a woman of color is hard to find flat irons that will not leave my ends frizzy or that I don&#x27;t have to pass over my hair 50 million times. I was able to use this flat iron on air dried braided hair. It only took me about an hour and I have bra strap length 4b/4c hair. It left my hair super silky and moisturized. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase in a timely manner. It was brand new. It was a good price. It straightens with steam vs. harsh heat. My hair is fine and I only have to take it thru once. It does make hair shiny and volumounouos vs. crunchy and dry with other straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chamber for the water is pretty small. And you must fill it up with water to make steam.</li>
            <li> If you want straight hair, this is not the product for natural 4B/4C hair. My hair was extremely soft but not bone straight. Looked more like a blow out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener before and I really liked it but mine broke a year ago &gt;.&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten it for 100 and something bucks but this one was cheaper and the same so I&#x27;m really glad I got it&lt;br /&gt;I have crazy hair and lots of it but it&#x27;s easy to straighten with this one(:</li>
            <li> Straightens my hair in half the time and looks way more healthy then it did with my wet to dry one.. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports indicated this iron straightens hair better than the Chi, so I decided to give it a try since there is a considerable price difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is slightly wavy, shoulder length, and I have it regularly professionally dyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a very good job straightening my hair. The water reservoir was halfway depleted after straightening my hair once. I did not find the built in combs to be really helpful but they were also not in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is quite a bit larger than others I&#x27;ve seen and had. It is 1.5&amp;#34; wide and that combined with the water feature makes it heavy. The heat control is placed right where your thumb goes when straitening your hair so I kept turning it off while doing my hair (and I&#x27;ve had this problem with other units I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;m trying to consciously adjust how I hold it, but I really think it&#x27;s also a design flaw repeated by Conair in different models, as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the straightener once and think I will likely keep the tool. For the price I think the pros outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing cuz i had bought one years ago but it had broken so i never bought another one so I had the money so i bought it again and its great i love it alot but the only thing is that you do have to apply and apply and reapply water in the little water storage thingy on the straightener i get annoyed cuz im not a pacient person and it takes a lil bit of time (well depends hoe fast u are im slow) but ither than that i love it. it leaves my hair so straight and smooth badass straightener</li>
            <li> the best iron i have ever used .....it leaves my hair beautifully</li>
            <li> Does a good job of straightening my daughters coarse hair</li>
            <li> this is the best i ever had. and good idea for gift. so I will buy again.Myb kids like so much.</li>
            <li> This iron was recommended by consumer reports and I was not disappointed.  I have used it for almost a year. Not only does it work well but it is pretty.  It heats up very fast and makes my hair soft and shiny.  I expected to receive the iron and the heat resistant case/mat, but was pleasantly surprised with the matching hand mirror, brush, 2 combs, hair clips and head bands that were also included.</li>
            <li> I found out about this straightner on the Consumer Reports website. It achieved their highest ranking. It is also most reasonably priced! This is the second straightner like this that I have purchased. My daughter used her first one for years until she finally wore it out. In the interim, at her request, I purchased her a CHI which did not perform as well as this Conair. It straightenes with one pass reducing the amount of damage to the hair shaft and has lots of great features. Her favorites are the 15 second heat up and variable heat setting. My favorite is the auto shut-off if it&#x27;s left on. The best straightner I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get the hang of this thing, but once I did, I have to say the investment was worth it. Just make sure your hair is completely dry before using the product, and get distilled water, works better than using tap water.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned quite a few straightners and none of them compare with this one!  It is easy to use, the temp is adjustable and it&#x27;s made well...heavy duty and sleek at the same time.  The optional steam setting works great and it&#x27;s nice to be able to use this function when you want.  The hair stays straight ALL DAY which is what we couldn&#x27;t achieve with cheaper, less quality straightners.  We highly recommend this product...it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I like it...but, I wish it would last longer.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a number of years.  Got my last one 8 months ago, and already need a new one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product over a two years ago and now purchasing it again (I was traveling aboard and the outlet converter broke it). I love how smooth it makes my hair and it last over a couple of days. This has cut down my morning routine and I will never buy another flat iron again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Left my ends frizzy. Did not work well. I would not recommend. I throw it out.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love it! Once I read how to use this product correctly, it was easy to use and store. Love it and my hair looks great after using this iron.</li>
            <li> Not got. Did not heat up as good as it claimed to. I could have paid the same price at the local store for the same item and should have!</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for over 4 years. It was worth the money. Not only does this flat iron work as promised, but it&#x27;s excellent for daily touch ups. I don&#x27;t use the steam feature in the summer much as my hair is naturally curly and the steam feature doesn&#x27;t work well in the humid weather for me. I will say that when I&#x27;m done using it, my hair feels as if I just left the hair salon and paid a bundle. TY Conair..your products have never failed me,</li>
            <li> The buttons are close to where you handle the straightner and sometimes are inadvertently are shut off.&lt;br /&gt;After a few months it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> I found this iron to be wider than I would like, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot and you end up with breakage because hair gets caught around the water reservoir which you also have to refill frequently.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Best straightener around and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li> Like because of steam &amp; comb</li>
            <li> i love this straightener! it&#x27;s the only one that works on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. My first one still works but after all of these years it doesn&#x27;t seem like its steaming, probably just needs clean. But I thought I have had it for several years so it&#x27;s time for a new one. I love it! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good, I love it...!!!!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews for this product, and it sounded pretty good. However, I had to use my CHI after using this straightener because my hair wasn&#x27;t straight. I don&#x27;t think it gets hot enough. I bought this because my CHI only works when you squeeze the blades together. Needless to say, I am not impressed. No wonder it&#x27;s so cheap. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I decided to eliminate relaxing my hair and go all natural. I did not remember what my hair looked like prior to relaxing it since the age of 6 therefore, going natural was huge. After looking around for a hair straightener that would not damage my hair yet, help it stay straight I came across the Infiniti SS9 during black Friday 2011. I did not buy it that day however, a couple months after I did purchase the product. When I straighten my hair it lasts for a month. My hair does not fall off due to heat and it really works. The only downfall is the product is not dual voltage as I just moved to a country which requires 220 volts or a transformer to use. LOVE THE PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> This straightner brings the shine out of my hair. My hair is naturally curly and getting my hair to look like it does when I leave the salon happens by pure luck with my old flat irons but with this Conair product makes my hair looks great every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I am liking my steam straightner a lot.  This is the first one I have purchased for myself and I like the steam action.  I have used my daughter&#x27;s regular straightning iron and I prefer the steam, I feel it straightens my hair better.</li>
            <li> the piece to steam water broke and wont stay in and i really didnt see a difference in with the steam or without. I prefer the maxiglide over this but as a flat iron it really straigten the hair out and leave it soft and moisturized.on relax hair. For natural hair it doesnt do the job of straigten like i wanted, but i use it often when i want a wrap look or straighten hair after a wash.</li>
            <li> Pretty neat steam function and comb feature, actually I love the comb feature. But they don&#x27;t get as hot as my other flat irons. I don&#x27;t think that these are for &amp;#34;black hair&amp;#34;. My only real complaint is that random strands of my hair KEEP getting caught between the water reservoir and flat irons. But with all that said, I still use them.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any steam being used. It works just like a regular iron that fries your hair. The &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; are a joke. They&#x27;re barely there and do absolutely nothing. My hair is not difficult to straighten as it is only wavy to begin with; yet I have to go over each section 2 or 3 times to get it straight. And even then it&#x27;s poofy and frizzy which is not the way my hair naturally falls. Should have spent a little more money on something better quality.</li>
            <li> Prefect for any type of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my flat iron for more than a year.  All of a sudden, the water started to leak out of the small retainer.  I tried using it without the steam...it is not the same.-Infinity ss9 flat iron.</li>
            <li> the steam element on this flat iron is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The product did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Well, that didn&#x27;t last long.  Three times and now it won&#x27;t heat any longer.  It&#x27;s going back.  Way to expensive for a Conair product.  They should stick to their $29 blow dryers.</li>
            <li> I first saw this product on an ad on television. I thought it would never work on my hair. But as I continued to watch the ad i started to like it more and more.  My point is, I ordered this flat iron and I have been in love with it ever since. Being a woman of African American descent I love the fact that it works on my frizzy, curly, thick hair. I also love that you can set it on different tempratures to adjust to any kind of hair. And its so quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Well first off the price is very high... it is the Steam I was after since using a regular Flat Iron is so rough on the hair.  I like it ok.  It doesn&#x27;t steam as much as I would like it and the water goes away really fast. if you hold it down too far on the outside like you can with other straighteners it gets hot on your hand.  I guess over time using this is much better then without the moisture they say is good for the hair when applying heat.  I am thinking the judges are still out on this one.  It is a nice shade of red though!</li>
            <li> Like the Infiniti Pro by Conair.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me this straightener for Christmas back in 2009 from Target. It was over $100 but well worth it because it was the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. I loved how it kept my hair straight and sleek. Since I had it for so long, I wanted to get a new one because after about 4 years of using it religiously, it needed to be replaced. When I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store, I checked here. I was planning on ordering it for Christmas 2012, but they sold out before I remembered. So finally, one came back in stock a few weeks ago and I wasted no time snatching it up. When you see this straightener available, grab it because there aren&#x27;t many that they sell. The steamer works, but I&#x27;ve never used it too much (even on my old one) It works great without it.  I highly recommend the Infiniti Pro!! :)</li>
            <li> I have this flat iron and it is awesome. I purchased this one for my daughter in love for her birthday. She uses mine when I visit!</li>
            <li> My daughters &amp; I hv soft, curly, &amp; thick hair. Four yrs ago I had to replace our Maxiglide. I bought our 1st nano silver at BigLots for $44. We loved it. It still works, needed another for  teen daughter to carry with her for games. Glad to find it on Amazon for $53. It works  great with or w/out the steam. Our hair won&#x27;t straighten w/out the comb feature. It&#x27;s better &amp; more lightweight than the  Maxiglide, at a way better price. It&#x27;s for all hair types. We have super curly african/indian american hair. 100 STARS</li>
            <li> Wife purchased item, worked well, she would have liked it if she had longer hair.  She has short hair and the iron is wider than most, 1.5\\&quot;, and she could not get the iron close enough to her head.  Giving it 3 stars because it is a fairly neutral rating, product worked, was just a bad fit between item and user.     BTW, we made the mistake of NOT buying this on Amazon. AmericaRx would not take the item back because it was 30 days past invoice date.  I bought the item November 14 for Christmas, so how were we supposed to return in 30 days?  Oh well, they got me I guess.</li>
            <li> It was only used for two months and now does not heat up.  It stopped working from one day to another.  Not a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product even though I feel it does not adequately heat up.  Perfect for not burning your hair and scalp, though.</li>
            <li> I swear buy this product. I&#x27;ve had two of these in the past 10 years and I love how it works.</li>
            <li> I got this staightner because of all the great reviews it had from african american women. I love how this straightner leaves my hair straight and soft for days. I just wish there wish a wider temp. range. And I love that it is in my fave color red. Once I receive my Organix Keretin Flat Iron Spray, I believe it will be the ultimate power team for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.  I am a Sedu fan but this flat iron&#x27;s steam feature tops the Sedu because of the moisture it adds to my hair.  I first bought it in Target years ago and ended up giving it to my sister.  I didn&#x27;t like the steam compartment getting caught on to my hair when I would wrap my hair around it to bend it.  Anyway, years later I realized that it had a lot to do with my hair growth back then... so I purchased them again here at Amazon.  I am just very careful with making sure my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the cracks of the steam compartment.  But I already see my hair in a healthier state due to the moisture from the steam.  I would definitely recommend this to others as my sister and I have used these flat irons over five years and we still love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and my daughter glad with it</li>
            <li> Just got the product in the mail. I love it. It is hard sometimes to find the right product for African American hair. My hair is curly, coarse, long and natural. I have tried many straightener and flat iron but the temperature never gets hot enough to get my hair shiny and straight. The Conair Steam Straightener gets my hair very straight. I use the highest temperature with the low steam for my hair. My hair comes out moist, silky and shiny. I really like the adjustable heat settings and how easy it combs thought my hair without getting it tangle. It takes half the time to straighten my hair which makes me very happy.</li>
            <li> I really like this affordable flat iron.  It reduces frizz without drying your hair.  Also I like that my hair looks natural, more straight, but still has volume.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and handy aid, really nice results. I gave it as a gift and my collegue was glad. She&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, works great. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Works great! Great delivery</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> It was horrible! I was pretty excited to receive this in the mail because I am ALWAYS straightening my curly/wavy hair. I saw all the good reviews and decided to give it a try. Straightening my hair usually takes like an hour and a half but I only got half way through straightening my hair before I decided to give up. The flat iron is bulky and because of this it can&#x27;t get very close to the root of my hair so it still looked frizzy and not sleek and straight. Then the power button is in a very bad location that while I was straightening my hair I would turn it off without knowing. Then the bristles in the middle of the flat iron that is supposed to detangle your hair while straightening it kept getting my hair stuck to it and ripping out a few strands. Overall worst flat iron ever! I do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> The steam element on this flat iron makes for hair that&#x27;s sleek and straight. I was afraid of damage and agree with the other reviewers who&#x27;ve found this iron to impart a healthy gloss to hair rather than frying it. I like the steam feature, which really does impart a glossy sleekness to your hair, and the fact that I can use it on damp hair is a time-saver as well as sparing my hair from more heat damage. I&#x27;d been using a small inexpensive one and decided to upgrade, and in fact really I was prepared to spend more money for a good one but I compared ratings on Consumer Reports and other sites and this one was rated better than other models twice the price, and I have to say after having used it for over a month now that it&#x27;s everything I&#x27;d hoped for and more. The color red, by the way, is hideous-- what&#x27;s wrong with a nice silver color? But I am happy to live with that, if I have to, if it means fabulous hair.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical buying (yet another) hair styling tool that promised straight hair. I have SUPER curly hair, thick that is prone to frizz. Since purchasing this iron, I&#x27;ve bought it 2 DIFFERENT TIMES. Why? First time: stolen by my friend. Second time: stolen by my sister. BECAUSE IT IS REALLY THAT GOOD!! I wash my hair, leave a little conditioner in, add John Frieda Serum, semi-blow dry and THEN flat iron with this product with the highest heat setting and combs all the way out. Roughly, 1 1/2 hours IF I am in the mood to use the steamer, if not about an hour tops. REALLY GOOD...AND I BARELY go to the salon anymore. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this straightner on amazon beacause i heard that they werent going to be making it anymore. I have super curly hair and this was the only straightner that would actually work on my hair.It comes with a silver case and it can work with steam to straigten your hair. Grea product!</li>
            <li> My teen daughter ordered this because she can&#x27;t leave the house itch her hair &amp;#34;looking a mess!&amp;#34;  Conair helps make it possible for her hair to look great.</li>
            <li> I really like the steam function... it does take some time (7 min) to heat up and create steam, but I am ok with that. One must fill the water reservoir with a very small water stream as it won&#x27;t fill otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One water reservoir fill is enough for one straightening session for medium-long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is beautifully straight and with much more volume than the typical iron. Only features that would improve it would be a higher temperature setting and a cool handle piece at end when in passing hair through.</li>
            <li> This was a great product. I fell in love with it the very first time I used it. The price was outstanding!</li>
            <li> Many of my on-line pals are raving about the &amp;#34;Loreal Steam Pod&amp;#34; these days, but that is too pricey for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Conair steaming iron works pretty well. I use distilled water, and make sure the iron is hot enough before squeezing the water button a few times. Seems to work better than a regular iron, my hair is shiny after the steam iron.</li>
            <li> I use a conditioning product in my hair when it&#x27;s wet. Dry it and use this to straighten. I use the lowest heat setting that works for my hair. I bought this for my teenage daughters and ended up using for myself.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this flat iron.  It pulls your hair as you slide it down.  Do not recommend this for anyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already ruined. Within the 1st week it chipped bc of heat tamer spray. It didn&#x27;t really work for my natural hair. But it works on my relaxed hair</li>
            <li> I like this model because it has slight teeth to help keep the hair separated as you pass this through your hair.  There are more settings than I need, but the basics are great.</li>
            <li> This product works great and i would buy again.</li>
            <li> I hope they don&#x27;t change their design because it&#x27;s the only one I will ever use. I love the teeth that pop out and comb my hair while straightening</li>
            <li> I just got my conair and I LOVE IT!!  This gives the closest to salon results than any other iron I have used!! I am still learning the steam mode but just using it without the steam gives awesome results...I use it without the comb first then go back over my hair with the comb part out and my hair just looks amazing and it&#x27;s sooooo soft!!  This is worth it and the price is very reasonable. I have caucasian hair fyi</li>
