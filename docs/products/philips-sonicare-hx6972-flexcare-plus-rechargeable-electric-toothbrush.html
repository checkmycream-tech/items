            <li>Let me talk about the reasons this brush is the best on the market for oral health:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best toothbrush I have ever used for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Removed surface stains, hygienist was impressed with my results.  </li>
            <li>One of the BEST toothbrush we&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>using it for a year i think and it still charges perfect battery lasts</li>
            <li>And it does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>In contrast, my wife has the comparable Oral B model and it has performed flawlessly for four years.  </li>
            <li>Refresh&#x27; is the 1 minute option, perfect for when I am in a rush. &#x27;</li>
            <li>This is the best thing that has happened to my teeth.  </li>
            <li>And the price is great!      </li>

            <li>The travel kit and docking station are wonderful too.</li>
            <li>The best part is that there is a compartment that sterilizes the brush.  </li>
            <li>One of the best purchases I have made!</li>
            <li>Was a great toothbrush until it died within a year!</li>

            <li>This is the best brush Ive purchased yet.  </li>

            <li>The toothbrush works great.  </li>
            <li>Basically I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>The brush is great, but I am reducing the review by 1 star because of the cost of the replacement brush heads.  </li>

            <li>Love!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!  </li>
            <li>Some added accessories come in very handy if you travel a lot.</li>
            <li>The battery stays charged for three weeks making it very handy to take on trips, plus there is a nifty carrying case.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus, rechargeable toothbrush is a very effective instrument for cleaning teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The travel case and charger are very handy, but for a one week trip I didn&#x27;t even need to charge the toothbrush; even with both my husband and myself using the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t very effective.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazing!  </li>
            <li>toothbrush is just amazing!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>So so Amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m especially excited about the case attachment that zaps bacteria.........</li>
            <li>This is a great investment for good dental health.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent toothbrush, and does a much better job of cleaning my teeth than I was doing by hand.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare is the most efficient way to taking excellent care of your teeth this toothbrush is it!  </li>
            <li>very happy I bought this :)</li>
            <li>This is the best - I put it on the Re-fresh mode and works better then any tooth brushing.</li>
            <li>Love the Sonicare toothbrushes and this one is awesome.</li>
            <li>It works great!&lt;br /&gt;The brush stays charged for just over 2 weeks brushing once a day and about a week if you brush twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with this excellent brush!</li>
            <li>It is a great unit and I loved it.</li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is a nice touch too!</li>
            <li>In my estimation, this equates to a successful product.  </li>
            <li>I love having my own!!!!</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful toothbrush, better than any of them I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with this brush it has so many features.</li>
            <li>Plus, the UV cleaning option is a nice perk!</li>
            <li>She told me that my gums are perfect, my teeth are very clean, and I have no cavities.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, it cleans, and the battery life is still excellent after more than one year of usage (about one week using it 2-3 times</li>
            <li>the unit functions perfectly and Amazon&#x27;s service was excellent, but more important is the fact that I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist EVERY morning and evening after using it</li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that though it gives you a great clean, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or scratch your gums.  </li>
            <li>The price is not an easy thing to get over, but it is truly the best tooth brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>This thing is awesome and the price/ easy returns policy with Amazon was a no brainier.  </li>
            <li>Excellent design easily held with no akward positions.</li>
            <li>We loved it, easily the best toothbrush we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, Sonicare toothbrushes guarantee me a quick cleaning &amp; a perfect report of health at the dentist office every 6 months, and the dentist/hygienist alway comments on how great my teeth look.  </li>
            <li>It is enjoyable to use a tool that produces very good results.    </li>
            <li>My Phillips sonic care plus toothbrush is a amazing product I would recommend it to any one I find amazon is a good company with great service and getting there products to my front door</li>
            <li>Compact with a good travelling case!&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Eventually, and with good fortune, you will master its operation (</li>
            <li>Holds charge for good length of time.  </li>
            <li>It is surprising how well the charge lasts and</li>
            <li>worked great then started turning on and off on its own</li>
            <li>it is still in great working condition, and my husband now has his own brush head attachment so he can steal, er...</li>
            <li>--you&#x27;d need a microbiologist on hand for that--it gives you a good feeling nevertheless to know you&#x27;re brushing with a sanitized brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I was doing a good job brushing until I purchased and used the Sonicare</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for a good sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>price is fair.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise, stay away from Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>Just stick with your already good brushing habit.  </li>
            <li>Keep up the good work Sonicare.</li>
            <li>is the 2 minute timer), and it is a good investment for oral healthcare.  </li>
            <li>This brush does a good job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good feeling to know that your toothbrush is germ-free every time you brush.</li>
            <li>My husband has found that the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; cycle is good for his bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>Before that, I had owned and loved a Sonicare that had been discontinued and I couldn&#x27;t find the replacement brushheads any longer</li>
            <li>well good looks never</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve LOVED every generation of sonicare, and i&#x27;ve had them all.  </li>
            <li>It feels sooo good.</li>
            <li>Figured it was probably going to be done for good</li>
            <li>Yeah, it works great, but is that the kind of investment you want to make, close to $100 a year on a toothbrush?    </li>
            <li>Although it is good to have, I find myself seldom use the UV function.</li>
            <li>I like the toothbrush, and the sanitizer seems like a good idea.  </li>
            <li>The travel case is convenient, battery life appears good although I&#x27;ve not stressed it yet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Looks great, nice and slim  2.</li>
            <li>You think a manual toothbrush is doing a good job of cleaning your teeth, but it takes using this Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush to see that it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and I got a good deal by buying it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>The warranty is for two years so it was still good.</li>
            <li>Phillips cust support could not verify any warranty info-which is fair.</li>
            <li>I just plop um on the peg, facing any direction and they fit perfectly!</li>
            <li>He loved it until is turned into a lemon.</li>
            <li>This model comes with a UV sanitizer, which seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li>Plus I know I can always use my good toothbrush instead of one of those $2 ones that don&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li>would say get this brush once you see how good your teeth feel,</li>
            <li>I think that is good, but I find there are some stuff I do not have when I look the instruction.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it is good</li>
            <li>alround a good product.</li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It is a good feature if u travel a lot.</li>
            <li>It fits but it doesn&#x27;t manuver as good as the compact one.</li>
            <li>It is almost as good as going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>Good for preventing plaque and conditioning gums.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this toothbrush, be prepared to give a good week or two to get used to the vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Elite was still good for about 2-3 days around the end of the 5.5 year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: As much as I loved this toothbrush, I would never buy a sonicare again.</li>
            <li>Loved it while it worked.</li>
            <li>I am wondering now if that was a good choice.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>When I purchased it and used for two weeks I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>My family and I loved this product and had looked forward to using it.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as it should be for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a good quality electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This took me a good 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>I suspect this one is superior.</li>
            <li>I suspect this one is superior.</li>
            <li>Years ago I had a Sonicare toothbrush, but they just weren&#x27;t made as good 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>I charge this brush once a week for a couple hours and it is good to go.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I had one 20 years ago....and loved it.  </li>
            <li>so that is good.  </li>
            <li>good product, does what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Looked good, seemed to work.</li>
            <li>people have had good results unplugging the chargers for a period of time to reset them.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to be good at this point.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist raves on the good job I am doing.</li>
            <li>With free shipping, it was the best price on the internet.</li>
            <li>There are two ways that this brush is superior in this regard.</li>
            <li>Good value.  </li>
            <li>I loved the job this did on my teeth</li>
            <li>It is a good toothbrush when it is working</li>
            <li>I have had good dental reviews</li>
            <li>Yes, it looks fancy, but it won&#x27;t do you any good if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It is just that good.</li>
            <li>My dentist approves (good check ups).</li>
            <li>The best part is that my gums haven&#x27;t bled since I started using this, because now I don&#x27;t have to apply lots of pressure to feel like my teeth are getting clean.</li>
            <li>and I was looking everywhere for the best price or a special</li>
            <li>UPDATE [1/27/13]: Still going strong!!</li>
            <li>Battery life is exceptional.</li>
            <li>but this one is exceptional.  </li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush, gentle on the gums &amp; the massage feels incredible!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this toothbrush for a couple of months and am super impressed with it.</li>
            <li>Like many others, we loved the toothbrush for its cleaning effectiveness - works great.  </li>
            <li>If you use an HX6972, make sure that you put the toothbrush into your mouth before turning the device on: Toothpaste will fly off the toothbrush before it reaches your mouth if you turn the brush on before it&#x27;s in the mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been more than happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>oh, and who doesn&#x27;t love going to the dentest and hearing that you&#x27;ve done a great job.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product...</li>
            <li>Works great, holds a charge for many days.</li>
            <li>We also found out that our son owns a Sonicare and is very satisfied with his brush as well.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I owned a Sonicare Elite, and it gave me many years of great service, but it was time to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B&#x27;s circular brush heads seem to work better in cleaning and I am happy with my Oral-B, even though it seems like Oral-B needs to scout some people from Sonicare&#x27;s design team.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>every 30 secs is quite useful and the UV sterilizer is awesome</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>so I bought me this model and once again I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I are very pleased with the results that this model provides</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with the way his teeth look after using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look great and my checkups are better than ever</li>
            <li>And it makes the dentist happy :)</li>
            <li>Ive had the toothbrush for about two weeks now and am very pleased with my state of the art oral hygiene product.</li>
            <li>of the box, I see that the handle is slimmer than the others, sleeker and much more attractive; and the cleaning modes are displayed on the handle.  </li>
            <li>the most attractive I&#x27;ve seen with the Sonicare</li>
            <li>Very pleased with results</li>
            <li>This product is in a beta phase at best and that is being complimentary.</li>
            <li>I love electric toothbrushes; this one is great because it comes with a travel case and UV to kill germs.</li>
            <li>have to say that being able to travel without having to bring a power cord is great.  </li>
            <li>Am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by dentist - happy with the many choices you have to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>it is great too, and I love the sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, I love it.</li>
            <li>VERY PLEASED WITH IT,</li>
            <li>We did not know what to expect when we ordered and are very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with purchase.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentist to reduce plaque and improve gum health, I have been very satisfied that this product delivers.</li>
            <li>I got this toothbrush with some skepticism, but had some good reviews from friends who own it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so nice not to have to sneak in a good brush while at the neighbor&#x27;s house.  </li>
            <li>Still I bought another one on my own because I loved it.  </li>
            <li>It has many wonderful features and  is easy to use</li>
            <li>Excellent product the single best thing I have done to improve my dental heath period</li>
            <li>I have very good check-ups and this toothbrush makes my teeth feel sooooooo clean.  </li>
            <li>I was sold on the compact size of the Flexcare Plus, and I was especially pleased with the antimicrobial light that magically dissipated germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This has to be the most perfect toothbrush available.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are very strong which allow for a superior cleaning session.</li>
            <li>If a family---you&#x27;ll need more than one power wand, since if one of you is traveling, who gets custody of the Sonicare becomes an issue!</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love it!  </li>
            <li>but frankly I don&#x27;t have much more to say about a toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love the bonus of a built-in sanitizer on my toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cleaner feeling mouth and better results from a toothbrush, this is the one you wnat to buy!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>First of all its a great brush!    </li>
            <li>SO MUCH BETTER than Oral B electric that I had!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that if I have a problem though that Philips will take care of it!</li>

            <li>I love not having to watch the clock anymore!  </li>
            <li>Who can ask for more!</li>
            <li>Running something through the dishwasher is one of the best ways to make sure that it&#x27;s clean.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve upped my rating from 1 to 3 stars, as Philips customer service quickly honored the warranty with no-fuss and very good service.</li>
            <li>Great product and easy way to shop.     </li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus has great easy to use features.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase and would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and happy with results.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush that can be easily shared between household members.</li>
            <li>The quality of this item is amazing.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use any whitening products, so it was amazing that after a week, it was so noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Amazing toothbrush, but the handle broke after 4 months.</li>
            <li>What an amazing brushing experience.</li>
            <li>Amazing toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing feeling.</li>
            <li>The feel of the toothbrush is comfortable and the brush does a great job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>its amazing</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothbrush for over 6 months and it has done an amazing job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>this toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Totally amazing battery life.</li>
            <li>Great design and features and fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the UV sanitizer, as I have yet to use it, but the brush itself is amazing.  </li>
            <li>After using this, albeit irregularly, for a month, she commented on the amazing difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I think this toothbrush is amazing and</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m depending upon the brush rather than watching my own clock or watch, but it seems to be shorter than 30 seconds per quarter section.</li>
            <li>emails from the south korean company assured me that if i bought an adaptor plug, that i could use it in the usa.&lt;br /&gt;the south korean company emails were nice, but they didn&#x27;t understand that i didn&#x27;t order what they sent me, and i didn&#x27;t want to buy an adaptor</li>
            <li>The handle of the toothbrush has a nice grip.  </li>
            <li>Once done, however, it was nice to get the excess cord out of the way</li>
            <li>The 1 minute gum cycle has it&#x27;s own quadpacer as well, which is kind of neat.    </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner and the options are amazing!!!</li>
            <li>really was wonderful otherwise.</li>
            <li>I had this toothbrush for one year, and was loving it.  </li>
            <li>and if you are healthy, there should be a good balance and</li>
            <li>you are your own hygienist.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how effective it truly is</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has impressed me so much</li>
            <li>Excellent product and speedy fast delivery</li>
            <li>Have used this toothbrush since July 2012 and really liked it, however it just died after almost 3 years of use.  </li>
            <li>The UV Sanitizer seems like a nice add-on</li>
            <li>Travel holder is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>A phillips Electric Toothbrushes in the home is like having yur own dental therapist and chair.</li>
            <li>The UV is a nice added feature and it even comes with a travel case.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works great leaves your teeth feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I did some research that suggests that UV Sanitizers are effective, but that is taking someone else&#x27;s word for it.  </li>
            <li>Plus the UV head cleaner is a nice bonus 2.)</li>
            <li>I called Philips and they said that the brush falling off its own stand onto the counter is like my dropping it.  </li>
            <li>- The mode display is invisible when it&#x27;s off, which looks nice    </li>
            <li>I really liked the sanitizer as well as I&#x27;ve also been one of those people concerned about germs on my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This one has its own sanitizer/autoclave for the brush</li>
            <li>Nice feature, if you travel even occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>but it broke after 5 years which was my own fault.</li>
            <li>Loving it every day since the day I started using it.    </li>
            <li>I just wanted to offset those reports with my own experience.  </li>
            <li>Perfect purchase for someone who wants to keep their teeth.</li>
            <li>this handy FlexCare +</li>
            <li>Includes travel case and charger which is handy.  </li>
            <li>The case protects the toothbrush nicely.</li>
            <li>The colored rings are a nice touch</li>
            <li>Nice of them.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>this is the latest and most improved model and looks great.     </li>
            <li>Nice travel container for brush and brush-heads as well.</li>
            <li>which makes a good deal even better.</li>
            <li>This product is great, it will keep your gums clean and make your trips to the dentist more pleasant.</li>
            <li>the uv rays for the tooth head is really nice</li>
            <li>he asked me what kind of toothbrush I use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I have no idea</li>
            <li>I have been a good customer of amazon but not any more.  </li>
            <li>The sonic cleaner is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but gets under the gum line nicely.</li>
            <li>-- they don&#x27;t tell us that kind of thing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice that it has the 2-minute timer so that you have a set time for brushing.  </li>
            <li>It is really nice and my teeth feels like I just had the cleaning done yesterday.  </li>
            <li>but I feel it would be nice if Phillips could correct this somehow -</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it were a bit louder</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>The travel case is perfect and very useful.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>I liked this, but it broke.  </li>
            <li>nice travel case</li>
            <li>/&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t dispense toothpaste (Intelliclean does, but I honestly didn&#x27;t care for that feature.  </li>
            <li>Another nice thing was that my gums don&#x27;t bleed when I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re into aesthetics, this one looks really nice on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re into aesthetics, this one looks really nice on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>sonicare does a better job at removing stains and giving a good \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feel.</li>
            <li>Aside from vibrating quite loudly, I really liked this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Travel charger is nice and compact.</li>
            <li>Now that I own this brand, I would never consider another brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>anywhere, not on Amazon, not even on Philips&#x27; own site</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li>also found the UV thing nice</li>
            <li>The travel case is really nice</li>
            <li>I like electric toothbrushes, and it&#x27;s nice that it has a brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>This has a nice timer that gets me to brush longer.</li>
            <li>It was nice while it lasted though, so I won&#x27;t rate it a 1.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it -</li>
            <li>travel pack is a nice addition.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning/charging station is a nice touch also.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Not what I expect after making that kind of investment in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The sterilizing option is also nice since it takes no time at all to run</li>
            <li>are so nice to have.</li>
            <li>I liked this tooth brush a lot.</li>
            <li>It comes with a handy travel case with brush head covers.  </li>
            <li>Works great, perhaps too many features that most people will not use (\\&quot;massage\\&quot; setting?</li>
            <li>Get yourself a nice Oral-B and a separate UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li>leaves your teeth feeling very clean!</li>
            <li>Also, the addition of the UV light to sterilize the heads is very nice.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush that is worth the price!</li>
            <li>The original Sonicare helped greatly with that.  </li>
            <li>.... SMILE ON!!!</li>
            <li>I know I don&#x27;t floss as often as I should, but the Sonicare does a great job keeping my teeth and gum line clean.</li>
            <li>This particular Philips Sonicare is the best one they make.</li>
            <li>We had used an older version of the Sonicare toothbrush for years, and although it did an excellent job of cleaning our teeth, it had some drawbacks.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel perfectly clean and gums feel great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I don&#x27;t feel my teeth are clean unless I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>What a great clean feeling from soniccare.</li>
            <li>It did clean my teeth great</li>
            <li>It works great to clean all areas of the teeth.  </li>
            <li>At first they worked very  good, performed as advertised.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good investment if you want clean teeth!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance and am pleased with my selection.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and satisfied.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean!!</li>
            <li>If the handle still does not stay charged, my best suggestion would be to purchase a new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is awesome because everytime you use it it feels like you&#x27;re using a brand new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Ordering new heads will be a good idea !!</li>
            <li>I bought on a trip to New York and everything has been perfect.</li>
            <li>I admittedly experienced some \\&quot;sticker shock\\&quot; when I started looking, but after two weeks of using this toothbrush I enjoy brushing, feel better and my teeth look whiter and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>It is so much more compact, light, and feels great in the hand while brushing.  </li>
            <li>Look nowhere else, Amazon offers the best price on this amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great 30 sec warning is awesome !!</li>
            <li>Being able to UV the heads and toss on a nice sterile one is a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you are a good or excellent brusher (i.e. you brush rigorously and thoroughly multiple times a day), then I do NOT recommend you buy this product.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is awesome and it has really helped me brush better</li>
            <li>my whole mouth just feels healthy dentist was very impressed and is now advertising this brush with pamplets def</li>
            <li>the stand and brush cleaner good but could be more fitting for the bathroom enviroment.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with the product and feel it is more gentle than the non-electric Oral-B toothbrushes I had been using for years.</li>

            <li>If I had rated it right after I got it, it would have received five stars as I liked all the features and, according to my hygienist, it did a great job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine and does just as good a job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>

            <li>Nice design :)</li>
            <li>The dentists tell me it&#x27;s far and away the most effective cleaning tool, so I use it diligently, and now they say my home care (which also includes twice-daily flossing) is excellent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is by far the best toothbrush I have used and</li>
            <li>By far the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I like most every Phillips/Norellco product that I own.</li>
            <li>Update: over 3 years old now still perfect!</li>
            <li>A great investment for my smile.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothbrush that I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li>So far, it is working wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>That is also a nice feature, because most don&#x27;t think of that when they start with this type of brush.  </li>
            <li>Purchased two of these thinking it was a wonderful deal from such a reputable company with a superior brand of sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>so I can find a suitable substitute?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth bright and smooth.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to be able to change while the brush was running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is the ability to change out the colored rings at the bottom of the toothbrush heads, allowing you to keep track of which head is yours, so more than one person can use the unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros - Excellent reach, cleaning action &amp; ease of</li>
            <li>This Philips Sonicare is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>old has received an EXCELLENT bill of dental health since I purchased this toothbrush January 22, 2011.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare tooth brushes for years and this is the best model so far.</li>
            <li>Has anyone found a good supplier for the bulbs that fit into the UV compartment?</li>
            <li>My gums have improved greatly and so has my smile.</li>
            <li>and then see if there is more clarity about what kind to replace it with.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very good clean feeling after every clean.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and works great even after more than six months of use.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise and the surprise of my dentist, I had a perfect checkup with an easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>so I returned it, Amazon did a great job, they sent me the replacement unit right away.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve also traveled with it a couple of times now, and it has easily held its charge for an extended weekend trip (so, i can vouch for about 3 days with no worries!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Extremely Easy to use, and charging it is a breeze!</li>
            <li>love it, love it, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>But happily they did not - they replaced the malfunctioning brush (the charger/UV light thing was fine) for</li>
            <li>Very good for teeth and gums and is highly recommended by my dentist and oral hygienist.</li>
            <li>Great product with great customer service to back it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product with great customer service to back it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still say a soft or ultrasoft bristled brush is the best for MOST people.</li>
            <li>I liked it better than the top model Oral B electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Greatly improves oral hygiene, easy to use and keeps your teeth deeply clean.</li>
            <li>As I am not a man of many words, I will say this: \\&quot;It is by far the best toothbrush I have ever owned.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>really is a good product that does what it is designed to -- i.e., thoroughly clean teeth and massage gums in the process.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m smiling a pearly and healthy smile about a great product and no questions asked warranty.  </li>
            <li>The product times out your brushes on each part of your mouth so that you get it good and clean...</li>
            <li>Love the sonicare toothbrush, this is my first electric toothbrush and it truly is a great product for getting your teeth clean!!</li>
            <li>Great product to keep your teeth healthy and help brush for the right amount of time.  </li>
            <li>That was a great addition and on a recent overseas trip with my wife came in very handy.      </li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and was extremely happy with it for the first couple of months.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, but don&#x27;t know how it measures up against this.</li>
            <li>It worked great when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It kills the germs and also just makes a great place to keep the brush heads between brushings to reduce the amount of germs that ever touch them in the first place.</li>
            <li>This flexcare plus brush is a HUGE improvement over earlir models in ease of use, feel, maneurverability, Very satisfied with product.  </li>
            <li>The gradual increase in strength when you first start using it was a welcome feature.  </li>
            <li>product works great, exactly as described, for me anyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product and it&#x27;s doing exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>The built-in timer is good to prevent cheating by brushing each portion of the mouth for the full time period.      </li>
            <li>It seems to clean fairly well, and my gums do feel healthier, if nothing more.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is great - my teeth &amp; mouth feel clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>The UV light is great,  I also like that I can put the brush heads in the case and close it to keep the brushes clean.  </li>
            <li>Works fine and is not costing me a fortune!</li>
            <li>Very easy, very clean.</li>
            <li>I am a neat freak so having that was very important.</li>
            <li>it is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothbrush, dentist feeling clean every day!</li>
            <li>Amazing results and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush ever, i highly recommend it, cleans well and is very powerful with a lot of features.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is that replacement heads are easy to find and not too pricey.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference just with the color of my teeth and my dentist is pleased with the condition of my teeth since I started using this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Divide the number of uses into what you paid and see what you get, not to mention the beautiful smile and lovely breath that everyone gets to enjoy</li>
            <li>This one does have more power, does hold a charge longer (two+ weeks), does offer more brushing options, and is sleek, modern, beautiful.  </li>
            <li>and I consider a dishwasher safe handle to be a very important feature.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean the brush head and the unit itself, run it thru warm water and UV sanitizer for additional cleaning  5.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with how clean it keeps my teeth.  </li>
            <li>In the end, I&#x27;m really glad I decided on this</li>
            <li>Gotta say how much I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Wait for respectable pricing (list price is outlandish) and rebate opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has many options on how to brush.</li>
            <li>Most notably is the \\&quot;new\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li>So if wanted to know the differences, there you go, you probably now know more than you wanted about a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have been using the predecessor Philips Sonicare FlexCare for 16 months (and this brush for a week) and love the brush and the company.  </li>
            <li>While it is inexpensive to replace a manual toothbrush every couple of weeks, we tend to keep the $13 electric heads for a couple of months, putting them at greater risk of harboring an infection.     </li>
            <li>I discovered one interesting thing upon reading the directions.  </li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t bunched up on the counter top.     </li>
            <li>and I wanted to be sure I rated this one 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>The biggest drawback was the screw-on top.  </li>
            <li>the travel pack is much more compact and accomodates two brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush sanitizer and my teeth</li>
            <li>But overall very happy</li>
            <li>She explained to me how it covers so much more of the tooth area than the Oral B. Being that she had one in the office</li>
            <li>, she turned it on to let me feel the sonic vibrations that cleaned the tooth area a thousand times better.  </li>
            <li>I love the santitizing or however you spell it, being able to swap out brush heads is convenient (sp) so that you pay one time for the brush and then just replace the top.</li>
            <li>I feel that Oral B cleans my teeth better.  </li>
            <li>I expect my gums will be in much better shape.</li>
            <li>My hygienist has me spending much more time brushing my teeth than the \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; says...</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush after a lot of research and many family members recommending Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it should be better quality.</li>
            <li>Awesome product that actually delivers.  </li>
            <li>I love the UV brush heads sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>Just the thought of not having bacteria hanging around your toothbrush heads ..is fantastic: for hygiene purposes !</li>
            <li>in life you get what you pay for and this toothbrush delivers all it promises and more.  </li>
            <li>My gums use to bleed but now after 2 weeks of using this my gums have stopped bleeding and are getting much better.</li>
            <li>this is a great toothbrush, works very well.    </li>
            <li>Love all the features.</li>
            <li>I have owned Sonicare products for many years</li>
            <li>We now use the Flexcare Plus and love it.  </li>
            <li>, I love how the toothbrush has a break-in period</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are whiter, and my dentist surely noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Despite the premature demise, I am satisfied with this machine.</li>
            <li>Love it, your teeth will love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the selections on the power toothbrush, the feeling of a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; dental cleaning each and every time I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I would expect to receive greater longevity from this product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>this is my third Sonicare toothbrush, and the best.</li>
            <li>From the more intensive and longer \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; to the \\&quot;Refresh\\&quot; mode, there&#x27;s something here for even the most rushed of users.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes brushing easier and more efficient,</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li>OMG this Sonicare is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad bought it.</li>
            <li>Could not have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li>With my sonicare, I love feeling my teeth throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Although I wish it came with more replaceable heads than one.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>the Sonicare is much better.</li>
            <li>, I go for \\&quot;Flexcare plus\\&quot; thinking it will be slightly better.      </li>
            <li>you will not regret it :)</li>
            <li>I wish it had more than a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>But I love, love this Sonicare Flexcare</li>
            <li>I prefer to pay top dollar and have NO problems.  </li>
            <li>It has a hefty handle, but performs so much better.  </li>
            <li>Ok...</li>
            <li>I prefer to pay top dollar and have NO problems.  </li>
            <li>It has a hefty handle, but performs so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.   </li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>but now I love it.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes more adjustment on the part of the operator.  </li>
            <li>They just keep getting better.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise love it.</li>
            <li>If you care to drop over $100 on a toothbrush, this appears to have the endorsement of many dentists.</li>
            <li>I was spending more than two minutes longer brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>Because we have had it more than one month CVS Pharmacy will not exchange it or let us return it for a credit.</li>
            <li>Even with these issues this is the top of the line Cadillac of cordless tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your tooth brush!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not to many quality products anymore</li>
            <li>It continues to make a sound as if it&#x27;s working, but there are no vibrations of any kind in the brush itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the ones you buy in the grocery store and this is sooooo much better.  </li>
            <li>Again, this is sooooo much better.  </li>
            <li>I brush my teeth even more now than I ever did and even floss more.    </li>
            <li>Especially liked that I could take it with me traveling for short trips without having to bring a charger.  </li>
            <li>I felt this was just more practical.</li>
            <li>I reviewed electric toothbrushes on the net, and this one came up the best.</li>
            <li>I love the timer on it and the fact that you can do 2 or 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>He did not like the feeling of the vibration, so I gladly tried it out.</li>
            <li>I love how my teeth feel every morning and evening.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is rated for 42 two minute brushings, but I don&#x27;t think most people will ever put this to the test.  </li>
            <li>and I love it -</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The Pro Results toothbrush is our 3rd Sonicare, and the best yet.</li>
            <li>They seem to do a better job cleaning my teeth, which is probably why my dentist recommends them.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m always sure to put it in my mouth before I turn it on, so that the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t go flying.</li>
            <li>I love the &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; mode on this model.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts longer and the charging station is much better.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t been able to activate my warranty.  </li>
            <li>speaking, the best feature is the timer, most people don&#x27;t spend enough time to brush their teeth...by having a timer</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s why mostly people can see the difference&lt;</li>
            <li>I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for over a decade and love the product.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush for your family works really well</li>
            <li>And if those features matter to you, I am sure you will agree.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare Flexcare+ is all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be and more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Does a GREAT job, highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>and I love having the UV Sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I never use more than one or two settings, and I can tell when I need to change my bristles, and</li>
            <li>I love it still...</li>
            <li>Overall best tooth brush on the market.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>&quot; I am much more motivated to brush my teeth twice a day now.</li>
            <li>This is our fourth Sonicare and we are very happy with the results of our oral health since we started using the Sonicare line.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, with that said, look around for a better price than Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>more time for gums if needed and the refresh mode for brushing after meals.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s much better than a $3 toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My experience, like so many others, was that one night, about two years after I purchased this item, it started turning on and off by itself.</li>
            <li>I love that the box came with an additional charger and also a travel case.</li>
            <li>Works much better than any battery powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, and much much better than any manual</li>
            <li>AND WHEN I FILLED OUT AND ASK FOR THE REBATE ,THEY DIDNT HONOR IT !</li>
            <li>i cant do that many strokes in six months</li>
            <li>The thing is all it says and more; I can&#x27;t imagine not having it now.</li>
            <li>But still, at this price I&#x27;d expect something much better.</li>
            <li>Love the tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Just called and they don&#x27;t have any record of the agent telling me that they had to accept the return before sending another, and they sure haven&#x27;t sent one.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with it</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is much better than brushing manually.  </li>
            <li>Love love</li>
            <li>, and thought this model is a step up so it has to be even better.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare beats the Oral-B in most aspects except for the function in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I should have given it more time, but I just felt it wasn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B handles and brush heads are cheaper and there are more varieties of brush heads as well</li>
            <li>and I am brushing more often.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush takes all of the guesswork out of it and does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>I do like the size of the handle, and the battery lasts many days, even if using 2-3 times per day.    </li>
            <li>It may cost a bit more</li>
            <li>Works better then a brushing and faster.</li>
            <li>But what I&#x27;m most pleased about is the bacteria</li>
            <li>-killing compartment:  after each use I put the brush part inside the door, close it, press the top button, and voila.  </li>
            <li>Got the product, took a day getting used to, but now I love the thing.</li>
            <li>-I LOVE the UV sterilization of the brushes  </li>
            <li>BUT- at my last appointment, he told me that my gums had improved dramatically and my teeth look great!</li>
            <li>Plus it looks like a space toothbrush, and who doesn&#x27;t love space?</li>
            <li>Sure, they&#x27;re coming out soon, but I&#x27;d still prefer they didn&#x27;t rot before that happens.    </li>
            <li>Plus is simply the BEST electric toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Glad to see that technology has improved.</li>
            <li>Overall, Sonicare is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time, and I am well pleased.  </li>
            <li>Wish it came with more brush heads though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>I also like the way it charges giving you many hours of use.</li>
            <li>I have been using oral b electric for many years, then switched to soniccare based on my hygenist recommendation.</li>
            <li>year on I&#x27;m more generous with my review.  </li>
            <li>Plus is even better.</li>
            <li>Thats about it for cons, when I have more problems with the unit I will edit.      </li>
            <li>I love having the UV Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I have been MORE than satisfied with this purchase....</li>
            <li>my teeth feel completely smooth and I can&#x27;t feel any residual plaque build up!  </li>
            <li>I feel like this was a worthwhile purchase</li>

            <li>Since I have braces, I need to replace brush heads sooner than most people, so saving money on these brush heads is a plus.    </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it comes with a sanitizer too.</li>
            <li>I have been a Sonicare user for more years than I can remember.  </li>

            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am enjoying my Sonicare Toothbrush and like the added feature of being able to sterilize my brush.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this electric toothbrush more than a year ago.</li>
            <li>dental checkups have gone much better since I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Had used the Sonicare ProResults for years and were pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I notice that food never gets stuck in the brush--it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these and love them.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, for $35 - $36 I used to be able to get 2 replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Sonicare slightly more</li>
            <li>He has been able to get his teeth to a respectable whitened level even though he still smokes and drinks the drinks that discolor his teeth.  </li>
            <li>so I guess this is working the magic.</li>
            <li>It arrives with more than one brush, which allows my husband and I to both use the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love the sanitizer unit.</li>
            <li>I now do not have to remove a plug to be able to plug in a hair</li>
            <li>I love the sanitizer unit.  </li>
            <li>so well it seems to do most of the work of flossing; it even cleans between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Im so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li>Thorough cleaning plus the brush heads are able to be sanitized.</li>
            <li>They should figure out their product better.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Get better dentist reports.  </li>
            <li>now they say i&#x27;m brushing much better.</li>
            <li>I am currently wearing braces and am very happy I have this toothbrush, gives me the comfort of knowing I effortlessly reach all the corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My dentists says my gums are really healthy, too.  </li>
            <li>I love the compact tooth head.  </li>
            <li>So many accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, UV sanitizer -- it is my favorite sonic toothbrush of all time.nic toothbrush of all time.</li>
            <li>The product, purchased through Amazon, provides and excellent and entertaining way to brush your teeth and stimulate your gums in an amazingly short 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to try this toothbrush through the Amazon Vine program or I probably would have gone on using my Philips Sonicare R710 HealthyWhite Power model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to try this toothbrush through the Amazon Vine program or I probably would have gone on using my Philips Sonicare R710 HealthyWhite Power model.</li>
            <li>I liked the sonic vibration and UV cleaning light.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If go for the ProResults compact version, it&#x27;s even tinier than the Elite compact version, which allows for more focused brushing.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Pros:  - Much better design for attaching the brush head.  </li>
            <li>Glad that&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li>- More compact carrying case  -</li>
            <li>I then upgraded to an arm and hammer rechargeable sonicare brush, which was better than the Oral B.    </li>
            <li>Even though my unit was out of warranty (though the closeness of the expiration date had a lot to do with it, I&#x27;m sure).</li>
            <li>Too many, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I DID AND IM COMPLETELY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>My gum has been getting better condition and no bleeding any more.  </li>
            <li>After a very short period of adjusting the results are excellent.  </li>
            <li>I was told I needed to take better care of my teeth which woke me up.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it for cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Quite an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>Why did it take me so many years to try the Sonicare????&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I ordered this from Amazon and love, love, love...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i was always using manual tooth brush, but was always told that electric cleans so much better.</li>
            <li>That said, you need more time to brush than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>My wife and I shared an Oral B electric toothbrush for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absoulutly love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I also love how you can remove the tips and have them cleaned in the machines that they send with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was so pleased.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel more polished, almost like a dental hygienist cleaned them, and coffee stains are removed much more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>sure which one) of the Sonicare</li>
            <li>While I have had a friend years ago recommend one, I have tended to prefer Oral-B manual toothbrushes for years, so they were at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>it does such a perfect job&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I probably should start using it more often, but this is a purchase that I am continually pleased I made.  </li>
            <li>, I would rate this Philips as the top of the list for premier automatic/electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush based on reviews and after a week, I&#x27;m definitely glad I followed the advice of my fellow Amazonians.</li>
            <li>&amp; I am very happy with the 2 different brush sizes.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is okay~</li>
            <li>They are SO much better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>I love this toothbrush and my gums have never been better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way it makes my teeth feel</li>
            <li>Panasonic customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li>Brushing longer with better results.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the sonicare tooth brush.</li>
            <li>so I treat my teeth a bit better, and unconsciously so.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it has a travel charger that I can use on the go.</li>
            <li>Still, I I like the Sonicare line and have been using them for about 5 or more years now.</li>
            <li>My dentist will be very happy to see me next</li>
            <li>I love that it has a built in UV brush head sanitizer</li>
            <li>most likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just &#x27;next day&#x27; bought another one from Amazon, hoping the best . . .</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the self cleaning feature</li>
            <li>The UltraViolet light stopped working again!  </li>
            <li>Amazon sent it again to me FREE OF CHARGE!</li>
            <li>My dentist also sells them at his office which tells me its a reputable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m even more pleases with</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I desided to try them again.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with this item.  </li>
            <li>Also, I love the UV cleaning chamber.</li>
            <li>(and I love the UV sanitizer, won&#x27;t buy a model that doesn&#x27;t have this feature).</li>
            <li>Much better than Oral B version that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After this I bought the Diamond Care version to for travel - love the travel case on that one....</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>Still great, very reliable.</li>
            <li>The Flexcare plus is somewhat better designed than the Flexcare</li>
            <li>I love the timer that tells you when to change positions and I like the cleaner.</li>
            <li>Its a good brush and has performed perfectly until about a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>But on a brighter note, for those months we had it, it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>However, a spinbrush for $4 plus batteries is better than a non working Sonicare that cost $129, plus tax, and</li>
            <li>It needs better care instructions if that&#x27;s the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My review has been changed for the BETTER.  : )</li>
            <li>i really do love this all around no complaints and the battery holds every well in between charges.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>i have been using it for a couple of months and feel satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the quad pacer function, 30 seconds on each part</li>
            <li>I really love the settings as they adjust either the timing or the pulsations.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the various cycles that you can choose from, and my hygienist is very impressed with how well it controls tartar.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a hack to get around using Phillips heads though.</li>
            <li>And love the massage functions for gums.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Does everything I expect from it and more.</li>
            <li>I l absolutely love the timer on this thing.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Simply the best one in the market I would</li>

            <li>Also, LOVE the fact it has the UV Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I love using this tooth brush, I look forward to brushing my teeth every morning now.</li>
            <li>The feeling in your mouth is like a tooth brush massage. :)</li>
            <li>I want to quantify my 3 star review of the Sonicare by saying I love this toothbrush and the sonicare brand of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say how glad I am that I purchased this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love that!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am extremely satisfied</li>
            <li>Nicely made, UV sterilizer light is brighter than I would like at night, but does go off by itself.</li>
            <li>It vibrates many times faster than the battery powered brushes one can buy at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>Among many desirable features, it has an automatic timer that lets you know when the recommended 2 minutes has expired.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Three settings are more than sufficient.  </li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love not having to do the brushing because this toothbrush does it for ya.</li>
            <li>After using many times, I have noticed that my gum doesn&#x27;t hurts anymore.</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of days, I am very happy with the way it cleans my teeth and the ease of use.</li>
            <li>Ive never used a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love the gum option for stimulating the gums.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am just glad that it did not burn the house</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It does an outstanding job cleaning your teeth, and is built sturdy.</li>
            <li>I like the whole sonic approach to teeth cleaning and this product does a great job.</li>
            <li>geezus, ok I digress on with the review.</li>
            <li>Worked ok for about a year.</li>
            <li>I had a simpler one before for many years and enjoyed it a lot.</li>
            <li>This brush is even better.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the power and</li>
            <li>This is just another bells and whistles product to get the consumer to part with more money.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with it</li>
            <li>but i feel that this device helps me take better care of my teeth - and probably reduces the visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li>love it and my dentist appointments improved</li>
            <li>Chatted online with Alan this evening (who&#x27;s English was not the best)</li>
            <li>just makes everything more convenient.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonic Care toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Do a much better job than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I owned an older Philips Sonicare and loved it; this one is much better!  </li>
            <li>But, if you&#x27;re going to get one, you might as well get a good one, right?  </li>
            <li>Cleans very effectively, and really like the drier</li>
            <li>bought this electric toothbrush because I had an older model Philips rechargeable toothbrush that worked great and lasted for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, it makes my mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>i really love this product, i got braces so its very easy and comfortable to brush teeth with it.</li>
            <li>After dutifully doing the 24-hour battery charge, I was very excited to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>So far we&#x27;re all good!</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer really is effective for killing microorganisms; the debate is whether this is clinically significant.  </li>
            <li>I use the UV thing after every brushing and it&#x27;s nice to know that my toothbrush is clean.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing effective - really clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is nice and gives me peace of mind knowing my brush is clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth also feel nice and clean when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great, we had the older style, and crud used to build up inside the nadle and the brush heads.</li>
            <li>It keeps my brushes clean, and it is also a handy docking station.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for more than fifteen years and have had pretty good dental checkups during that time.  </li>
            <li>Most ,if not all, reviews were pretty good</li>
            <li>The way the device charges is great and it does not have to be plugged in ALL the time, the charge lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WHO WANT GREAT DENTAL HEALTH.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Buy more brush heads to share with family members, very easy to detach and clean.    </li>
            <li>She also commented that I had a \\&quot;very clean</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth very clean.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth are getting the best care in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know hoe effective the \\&quot;sanitizer\\&quot; is but it looks cool anyway.</li>
            <li>Brush size is perfect and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Contacted customer support and the warrantee is good for exactly:: 2 years.</li>
            <li>and I loved it when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First things first this is a well crafted device and it feels good in your hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, easy and thorough!</li>
            <li>This is a great device, actually it&#x27;s a little too great.  </li>
            <li>WORTH THE INVESTMENT!!</li>
            <li>He had a GREAT checkup and raved about the Sonicare saying that he wasn&#x27;t flossing, it was the new toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>Functionally, I&#x27;m happy with the new design.</li>
            <li>That was great customer service and the new U/V sanitizer</li>
            <li>I was happy to see the new features included in this model.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer does a quick and effective job of that.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, gets my teeth cleaner than I&#x27;ve ever been able to accomplish; and the gum treatment sequence is an added plus.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about my sonicare except: I wish the Philips would find a way to make the batteries easily replaceable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it makes me feel better about the cleanliness of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>While it is inexpensive to replace a manual toothbrush every couple of weeks, we tend to keep the $13 electric heads for a couple of months, putting them at greater risk of harboring an infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the cost and convenience of a sanitizer make it a reasonable addition to good oral hygiene regime.lf of them used one anyway.      </li>
            <li>I also love being able to sterilize the bristles with the UV light.</li>
            <li>In short, this is a good product with a fair price tag.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t own a sonic care you are missing out on one of the greatest inventions of whenever it was invented.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money ,I give it good point for being versitle and easy to use for anyboby that wants a good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot but to be honest I gave it up since I travel so much.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and got an extra six months on the warranty for free by registering online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to keep clean and with the sanitizer don&#x27;t have to worry about bathroom germs.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and thought it would irritate but it feels great and gums are becoming healthy.</li>
            <li>Makes you want to smile more!</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth very smooth and clean; keeps my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after using it and my teeth looked whiter after just a couple days!  </li>
            <li>my teeth have never felt so clean!  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel and look so clean that it feels like I&#x27;ve gone to the dentist every time I brush my teeth!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+multiple settings that, while I imagine most people wont switch between, allows you to fine tune it to your mouths</li>
            <li>When it came time to use it, I felt like the Oral-B didn&#x27;t clean my teeth at all!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel straight-from-the-dentist clean!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel after using the Sonicare!</li>
            <li>Sonicare cleans my teeth SO clean!</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth and gums so clean!  </li>
            <li>My teeth feels clean than ever!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean now!</li>
            <li>Although this was a bit concerning, I was still ok with it because it worked fine.</li>
            <li>have contacted Philips and they were very nice and say they are sending me a new handle.  </li>
            <li>Its great because I really feel like my teeth are clean after.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve loved my older Sonicare and this one is even better.</li>
            <li>I also use a waterpik (can&#x27;t think of the brand at the moment) along with the Sonicare and it had really done a great job at keeping my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>these things really clean better and more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job and my teeth really feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and your teeth feel very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>The unit itself is very good and feels solid.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this model for anybody looking for a very good tootbrush.</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li>However the toothbrush is amazing, definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, with complete features, to take care of your oral care</li>
            <li>Even better, this unit has an ultraviolet light that kills germs and keeps the brush sanitary.</li>
            <li>Looks like brushing our teeth is becoming a \\&quot;shared family experience\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt cleaner and more smooth before I started using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think that is available anymore, but their system is way more efficient.</li>
            <li>Mostly, I just enjoy this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best money spent.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, but stopped working completely within one year of purchase.</li>
            <li>I switched from a 5 year old Oral B to this toothbrush at my dentist&#x27;s recommendations, and I&#x27;m happy I did.  </li>
            <li>Love it and it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>the platinum brush heads better and they fit on this toothbrush too</li>
            <li>Battery life is great so far.</li>
            <li>The options provided to me by the FlexCarePlus e.g. sensitive, gum care massage were of great help to me.</li>
            <li>I love the built-in UV light for disinfection as well.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately Amazon has a much better range.</li>
            <li>Since using the brush I have experienced no incidence of gum bleeding or soreness, and undoubtedly my teeth feel far cleaner.  </li>
            <li>My son loved my toothbrush so much that I purchased him the Kids Sonicare toothbrush which I would rate 100 stars if I could.  </li>
            <li>I loved this toothbrush so much, I bought one for my Mother for Mother&#x27;s Day and she loves it also.  </li>
            <li>It was  a good toothbrush, but I really noticed the difference when I bought this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m find that the brush head is wearing fast, also, but it still seems to be doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is good and does it job very well.</li>
            <li>I bought a Philips Sonicare FlexCare PlusToothbrush for my wife, loved it so much I had to buy me one too.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate the travel case which was included since I do a fair bit of that.</li>
            <li>This product gives your mouth a real fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have the time to write a drawn-out review but there are plenty of good reviews here already.</li>
            <li>What really upsets me is that I threw away a perfectly good electric toothbrush that worked perfectly well for more than 5 years and cost me less than $20.00 when I bought it.</li>
            <li>Very techy but easy to operate and feels good on the gums and teeth which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean too!</li>
            <li>This new model is a lot better noise wise.  </li>
            <li>the gum massage feature is also wonderful and gives your mouth a whole new feel.  </li>
            <li>Buy yours today and get ready for a new and delightful experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a 2 other brand named rechargeable toothbrushes,  this one is the best!</li>
            <li>They are slightly more course (which I like) than the original brush heads that I bought for my Elite.  </li>
            <li>Other than this, great product!</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have also mentioned that the brush heads need to be perfectly aligned in the sanitizer for the door to close, but I have never had an issue of them not being \\&quot;aligned\\&quot; correctly.</li>
            <li>I brush the full 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>I love sonicare toothbrushes, and this one has not disappointed me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i should have waited a bit longer.. other than that its a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The quality is very good and after more than half a year I&#x27;m still pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a sonicare user for many years and this new model is the best by far.</li>
            <li>you will not be able to get your teeth thus clean.  </li>
            <li>Without hyperbole, I can honestly say it gets your teeth as clean as a hygienist at the dentist, and quickly.</li>
            <li>Cleans well, has almost too many brushing options but makes my mouth feel clean and stimulates my gums.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing easy.  </li>
            <li>One thing I noticed about me cleaning my mouth with this toothbrush is that it easily made my gum lighter.</li>
            <li>I had more dental problems, and my teeth never felt clean...</li>
            <li>Thought it might have reverted to the &#x27;easy start&#x27; mode, but went through the process for &#x27;activating/deactivating&#x27; easy start and it made no difference.  </li>
            <li>Its lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the clean and gum care settings.</li>
            <li>Easy start feature for newbies to gradually introduce the Sonicare experience (can be deactivated</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s also easy for you to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You are able to clean 2 brushes at a time.</li>
            <li>Ok, this toothbrush is just amazing, works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>Additionally, having the UV sanitizer and the charger unit all on the same platform is much more convenient and a great space saver.</li>
            <li>Switching between modes is easy and intuitive.  </li>
            <li>Somehow the suite was not included in my address, and UPS wouldn&#x27;t deliver even though the name of my company is on the building and would be exceptionally easy to figure out.     </li>
            <li>Selecting between modes is quite easy.  </li>
            <li>So after years of finally debating whether or not it was worth it to make the switch from an old-fashioned toothbrush to an electric, I decided it was time to go for it-- and time to go for one of the best.  </li>
            <li>You can now easily select what mode you want and it stays highlighted on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You clean the front side of your top portion of your teeth&#x27;s, then the inside, then switch to the bottom front, then the innards of your front teeth</li>
            <li>Most times I use just the Clean Mode, and sometimes I will run it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to understand and read intructions;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Oral-B brush I used before just vibrated, this tooth brush seems to be a much more precise and advanced movement that vibrates with purpose.</li>
            <li>Clean&#x27; is the 2 minute option, that I use most often. &#x27;</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t change it as easily as I can now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love the ultraviolet light \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; for getting the brush head bacteria free.</li>
            <li>I love clean teeth...</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li>Philips says that water is pulsed during cleaning to provide better cleaning between teeth, and that may account for the clean feeling after gum massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>here is the UV Sanitizer, which is easy to use (basically put brush inside, close a door, and hit a button).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to switch modes</li>
            <li>The Elite screws on, which is easy for the kids.  </li>
            <li>four separate modes -- easy to read and set</li>
            <li>I love the UV sensor because it assures me a clean toothbrush each use.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t over or under brush, this comes with 2 chargers- one with an easy to use sanitizer and another travel charger.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to get use to.  </li>
            <li>The hx6972/10 works the best and well worth the extra money.   </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to purchase the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>it is easy.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to clean teeth more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The inside mount for the brushes pops in and out easily so it can be washed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the really clean feeling I get after brushing.  </li>
            <li>And if I can find this information easily, I would think Sonicare should know about it.</li>
            <li>AND IT FEELS CLEAN AND HAVE HEALTHY GUMS</li>
            <li>The clean feeling I get is astonishing.</li>
            <li>The traveling case is sleek and easy to pack.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>It was bought as proof of service and has been easy</li>
            <li>Refill brushes are easy to find at Costco.</li>
            <li>It is much gentler, yet more effective in cleaning between her teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>I use my Waterpik Ultra Flosser and together they are a strong team in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>The Braun however, is still going strong after 13 yrs</li>
            <li>I used to have an older model of Sonicare tooth brush and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>Still going strong</li>
            <li>This thing is still going strong after almost three years.  </li>
            <li>While searching for an electric toothbrush, I thought that, if I was going to dip myself $100 in for a good brush, might as well aim as high as I and the Philips Sonicare FlexCare</li>
            <li>Anyway, these are highly recommended for good reason.  </li>
            <li>I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy brushing my teeth because I love the feeling of them becoming clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt amazing after the first brushing.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, this is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>The quadpacer feature is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>It makes sure you brush for the full two minutes and get every part of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>It comes with two brush heads which is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it at first, but the charger quit working after about 8 months.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to use it for a full week before on a trip when I&#x27;ve forgotten to pack the travel charger.</li>
            <li>First I would like to add that the warranty and the service that comes with the warranty is spectacular.</li>
            <li>I just use the normal brush features and it gets me good reviews from my dental hygenist ..</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>and they leave my teeth feeling clean, fresh and just as nice as when I leave the dentists office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth the money to have a healthy and clean mouth!</li>
            <li>Used with new whitening toothpaste results are good.</li>
            <li>The handle, brush and charger were fine.</li>
            <li>The controls on the handle are easier than the previous versions and I am very very happy with how Sonicare has improved the design of the toothbrush head to avoid the issues that the Sonicare Elite had.       </li>
            <li>are more willing to spend more time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s still one of the best tooth brushes that I&#x27;ve ever used and it has some advantages over the previous model.</li>
            <li>This is the best looking Sonicare to date, with &#x27;improvements&#x27; over previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>has been working just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with it in the morning since nobody likes a stank-mouth</li>
            <li>The first one did excellent and the several times I went to the dentist for a checkup after buying it</li>
            <li>- they work fine</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s perfectly fine.    </li>
            <li>It is light, easy to handle, with a tip that fits in any mouth without a problem.</li>
            <li>Until the model broke, it worked fine.</li>
            <li>So keep your mouth shut while using this fine product.</li>
            <li>Additionally impressive are the choice in settings - i use \\&quot;clean\\&quot; 80% of the time - it&#x27;s your typical use setting with a 2 min</li>
            <li>The UV light cleaner thing might be more of a gimmick than anything else, but it looks cool.</li>
            <li>I thought they were fine until I picked up one of these.</li>
            <li>OTHERWISE THE PRODUCT IS FINE</li>
            <li>It lasted just fine and looked like it would have gone</li>
            <li>I checked the bulb and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is a fine instrument...when it is working.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t bother me because it still worked just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked fine for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a fine set and seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li>I discovered quite quickly that if you want your toothpaste to stay on your brush be sure to place the brush head inside your mouth before turning on the Flexcare+.</li>
            <li>My favorite aspects:  - the UV tootbrush head cleaner - kills 99% of bacteria and is really quick  - the fact that the cleaning is divided into 4 parts, 30 seconds each.</li>
            <li>so often/easily is because the vibration is too strong for whatever cheap parts they use inside the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>The brushes seem to wear out more quickly</li>
            <li>Thanks Sonicare for an outstanding product!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone who can afford to spend a bit more for better regulardental care.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t buy a better toothbrush than this one!</li>
            <li>This new version is much more effective is removing stain and plaque.</li>
            <li>Product is very useful, easy to use and helps in keeping us out of dental problems.</li>
            <li>Still, I worry about how clean the handle it self will be a year from now since I won&#x27;t be able to put it in the dishwasher to clean it.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, clean and it does a fantastic job of cleaning teeth -- it was noticable after the first use!  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has a great battery life and smooth, quiet operation.</li>
            <li>There was a huge difference between the Sonicare and my Oral B electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Because I have to work for a living, I couldn&#x27;t spend huge amounts of time chasing them around.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t manage my tooth-brushing as accurately as I should have.  </li>
            <li>What a huge improvement.    </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see what the dentist says but I&#x27;ve got faith that this toothbrush will make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>was a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>because this is cheaper, it has the UV sanitation light (which works great), and the handle itself is no different from the newer models.</li>
            <li>Therefore, this might not be great for inattentive toothbrushers or smaller</li>
            <li>2014.11.23 Update: this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Dentist told me few years ago this was the best way to protect your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>&quot; but they do recommend ways to keep your toothbrush germ free and a sanitizer will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You push a button to start the cleaning process, and the UV light will turn off automatically.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine what a hotbed of germs a toothbrush is, and the UV light kills 99% of bacteria and viruses.       </li>
            <li>Dental health is important, and we too often take it for granted.</li>
            <li>Now the brush sanitizer is a fantastic addition to this system.  </li>
            <li>The UV light works</li>
            <li>these things aren&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>The gum control function works great and provides an extra minute of brushing.  </li>
            <li>You can see the difference in the brightness of your teeth and feel how smooth your teeth are.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a fantastic investment because it WORKS</li>
            <li>This is my second sonicare toothbrush; I had it for about a month now and it works great</li>
            <li>Look out, or search on the internet for a $15 coupon that is sometime available as a rebate from Sonicare.    </li>
            <li>It was important the power toothbrush had to be rechargeable and had sonic power to tackle plaque.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the UV sanitizer, but it&#x27;s a nice option</li>
            <li>You would think if this UV thing of theirs worked as they claim they would give consumers access to the detailed results.     </li>
            <li>a sound investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She has periodontal issues and this sonic toothbrush is fantastic for her.  </li>
            <li>Here is what I experienced over the last 13 months.....</li>
            <li>The light works about 50% of the time.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush-the best that Philips makes and after a few months the handle stopped vibrating.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is a great electric toothbrush which has numerous modes.</li>
            <li>It is much slimmer and fits into my hands nicely.  </li>
            <li>The timer,ultra violet light for decontaminating the toothbrush head, the travel pack, these are just some of the features I like.</li>
            <li>To date know I just enjoy the post brushing experience.</li>
            <li>This is our 2nd Sonicare, since the purchase of the Sonicare Elite with over 6 yrs of great performance, it was time to try the newest from Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The carrying case and the UV light did not work.  </li>
            <li>The 5 different brushing modes are great.  </li>
            <li>This is a terrific product with great features</li>
            <li>It does take up a bit more counter space but all in all it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>:-)It is really worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My 2nd Sonicar and getting great checkups.  </li>
            <li>The UV light in one of the 2 units I bought was not working.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet effective in cleaning and massaging the gums.  </li>
            <li>It feels great both on my teeth and on my gums, I actually WANT to brush my teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t fit the travel charger in the travel case.  </li>
            <li>Straight out of the dentist amazing.</li>
            <li>And I actually enjoy brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The charging capability is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great toothbrush</li>
            <li>I primarily use the \\&quot;Clean\\</li>
            <li>I am one that uses these reviews in researching important purchases.  </li>
            <li>Get a cheap version</li>
            <li>No wonder it comes with an ultraviolet light to disinfect it.  </li>
            <li>There will be a light space between the brush head and unit when you fully attach it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest using the UV light every time you brush, as that may (read: WILL)</li>
            <li>(The Diamond series isn&#x27;t any more powerful).  </li>
            <li>it was like I just got my braces off because of the fact of how smooth my teeth were.  </li>
            <li>Prior to being a proud Sonicare owner, I used the Oral-B electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Not much to say except it&#x27;s brilliant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m replacing it with their Easy Clean model, but I expect that it will probably quit working in a year.  </li>
            <li>The UV light bulb burned out two days after I received it.  </li>
            <li>Got a free replacement handle by Philips.</li>
            <li>The UV light stopped working 3 weeks after I started using it.  </li>
            <li>and they are sending me a replacement light.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>the ultra-blue light lets you know that the cleaning has begun</li>
            <li>The brush head and holder are easy to clean and the item seems to hold a charge for quite some time before recharging.  </li>
            <li>but not only is it a great cleaning experience</li>
            <li>Almost every part is replaceable and it is extremely easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I am a proud owner and would definitely buy another.</li>
            <li>After 4 month, the charge with the UV light sanitizer didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is worth the money to spend on oneself to also help keep your body healthy.  </li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Also, feel free to do a web search - lots of people have this problem.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>etc) are more fun than something i see as i couldn&#x27;t do without.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy the brush without the UV light.</li>
            <li>This really helps whiten teeth and also the gum care option is really nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received this toothbrush last week from Amazon/Drugstore.com and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Sleek, easy to clean, a variety of modes</li>
            <li>There is also an UV Sanitizer to ensure your product is germ free after each application.  </li>
            <li>You know that feeling after you come out of the dentist&#x27;s office for a cleaning where your teeth have that polished, smooth feeling when you run your tongue over them?  </li>
            <li>This has been discussed by reviewers manytimes already, but to sum it up, it&#x27;s not really needed because of the germ fighting agents in your toothpaste and it may do more harm than good if bacteria mutate to become more UV resistant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to operate and keep clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, does what it says it will do and relieves the anguish of not being clean and sterilized.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean between teeth.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used a sonic type toothbrush before that wasn&#x27;t a Sonicare, you haven&#x27;t truly experienced the same as what this brush can do.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>Turned out to be a cheaply designed mechanical door switch contact  </li>
            <li>Although the warranty period has passed (2 years), they will replace the unit for free.</li>
            <li>Its more than worth the money.</li>
            <li>AND it is easy to keep clean and hygienic.  </li>
            <li>One issue I&#x27;ve had: the UV sanitizing light pooped out and the replacement bulb&#x27;s price it preposterous.</li>
            <li>Use either loctite or nailpolish and lightly coat the threads of the screw.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush &amp; it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Just great overall experience!!!</li>
            <li>So I eventually called customer service and had the fantastic experience I mentioned above.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light, oh the light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright enough to be a night light and more</li>
            <li>(I think you could probably use it for a lighthouse light to guide ships to your bathroom on a foggy night).  </li>
            <li>I understand it&#x27;s important to take care of our teeth, but this brush lasted 2 1/2 yrs.</li>
            <li>Always smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works fantastic.</li>
            <li>The ultrasound speed is amazing, yet gentle.  </li>
            <li>You will never use all the advanced features,</li>
            <li>enjoy the sanitation uv light.</li>
            <li>The timing feature where it vibrates to tell you to move to the next quadrant is a great feature.</li>
            <li>In January the UltraViolet light quit working.  </li>
            <li>The light now works.</li>
            <li>The sanitizer is great and allows me and my husband to sanitize both our toothbrushes as the same time.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the timer.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, each time the handle was replaced under warranty, but just for the inconvenience, I had to deduct a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Yes, UV light kills germs.  </li>
            <li>Then after 1 year, it quit working on the primary charger.  </li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is a nice addition, but it&#x27;s not something that is absolutely needed.</li>
            <li>I believe the UV light is bogus- that part broke after 2 months anyways.</li>
            <li>They are amazing and so gentle on your gums.  </li>
            <li>It is a great toothbrush with the UV cleaner, extra head replacements, and it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used the UV light to kill germs on the brush head</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been with Sonicare for quite some time, primarily because my dentist has recommended it.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that the Easy Clean uses the same brush heads as this model, and seems way more durable.</li>
            <li>Now, when I use the toothbrush I feel secure in the knowledge that I am not introducing germs into my mouth.  </li>
            <li>About a month after I bought this toothbrush, the &amp;#34;gum care&amp;#34; light stopped working.</li>
            <li>After another month, the &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; light stopped working.</li>
            <li>it was hassle free.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price and more.</li>
            <li>Having used the Sonicare system several years ... and happy with it ...</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic piece of technology.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good;</li>
            <li>This one has the UV sanitizer, which is a nice feature... something I occasionally commandeer for my own brush.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the oral b system for years and believe it is a far superior system.</li>
            <li>It took rather a long time to charge up before the first use, but it has had excellent battery life since then.</li>
            <li>and i am very impressed with how long you can go between charging it - even though the logical place to store the hand held unit is on the vertical charging stand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s must more gentle on my gums, feels like it cleans better, and is a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>So far we both love the Sonicare, and the addition of the UV sanitizer is nice.   </li>
            <li>The bottom line is that most of these modes are just modifications of others, much like all those \\&quot;cycles\\&quot; found on most washing machines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that most of these modes are just modifications of others, much like all those \\&quot;cycles\\&quot; found on most washing machines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one has a sensitive setting and it feels good on my teeth.</li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly and the sonicare toothbrush is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>love this toothbrush VERY much, and strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>love this toothbrush VERY much, and strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth super clean!</li>
            <li>Updated as it&#x27;s still working fine since I reviewed the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m also pretty sure that it&#x27;s even making my teeth whiter as it&#x27;s removing some of the stains and most of the plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feature that gives me a quick beep+pause</li>
            <li>I research most products and the reviews were right on target.</li>
            <li>Yeah, right, we needed more bells and whistles to brush our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so just a plain tooth brush works the best for me on the go.</li>
            <li>but, I love my teeth, and wanted my gums and whole mouth to be clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure other reviewers have covered how great this toothbrush is.  </li>
            <li>Its incredibly hygienic due to the snap on head, brush enclosure, and UV light.  </li>
            <li>This is a great unit for anyone who wants clean teeth, or anyone who wants to keep their teeth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Sonicare !!!</li>
            <li>Very nice especially the hygiene unit</li>
            <li>I find this feature very useful.</li>
            <li>I do not find very useful</li>
            <li>Very useful traveller holder which i using in my trips.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and leaves teeth</li>
            <li>the bulb - Phillips sends us emails to let us know the bulb is on back order which is very nice but not helping us with the</li>
            <li>After each brush, my teeth and gums feel more clean and fresh than ever before.  </li>
            <li>Gum care has become very importent to me and this brush has been and will be of great help to me besides my periodontist highly recommended this for me.</li>
            <li>Really makes your teeth feel clean!!</li>
            <li>ive never had a better tooth brush in my life, it makes my whole mouth feel clean like id been to the dentist without the pain!</li>
            <li>Using this toothbrush leaves you with the feeling that you just left the dentists office (in a good way, a clean teeth way, not a just had a root canal way)!</li>
            <li>The newest Sonicare is just as wonderful and effective as the others with a few new features.  </li>
            <li>All I know is that this one is great because it doesn&#x27;t vibrate so much that it hurts or makes my head feel like it&#x27;s full of bees, but it really gets my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I liked the toothbrush and my gums were kept in a healthy shape throughout all these years (helped by a general dentist cleaning</li>
            <li>Out of the dentist clean smooth.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes are kept clean and free of bacteria and viruses.  </li>
            <li>The UV light clean option also doesn&#x27;t reliably turn on.  </li>
            <li>I do like the UV, though I really don&#x27;t know how well it works, and quite honestly, your mouth is already full of bacteria</li>
            <li>Pretty much everything is all good</li>
            <li>I used to own a much older Sonicare and didn&#x27;t use it every day.  </li>
            <li>However, if all three are done correctly, your dentist visits will be quick and easy.    </li>
            <li>which I figured was pretty good catch-up after so much slacking.    </li>
            <li>- you move it evenly across your teeth and gums and the vibration \\&quot;brushes\\&quot; for you, but it quickly becomes easy.    </li>
            <li>but not if it&#x27;s going to break so quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is minimalist and attaches quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable modes are very handy but for my purposes I only use the &#x27;Clean&#x27; and &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; settings.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and made very well.</li>
            <li>இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I do love this Sonicare toothbrush very much in the 4 months that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend looks nice on counter.</li>
            <li>I like the UV light because having my toothbrush on the counter charging in the bathroom with the germs that live in bathrooms kind of creeps me out.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and leaves your teeth squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>The sonic care flex plus gives  mouth a super clean feeling, however the strong vibration of the brush does take  getting use to.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, easy to use, dependable and very sanitary.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people with arthritis or carpal tunnel in your hands, because it has a wide handle that is easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Original</li>
            <li>As a side note when using any of the modes, and you will probably learn this within five seconds of your first use, make sure the toothbrush is in your mouth before turning it on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of an investment cost-wise, but absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other electric toothbrushes before, this one is definitely the best, the quality is superb.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>As my daughter would say I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Our original version lasted over 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare should extend their warranty period and acknowledge that there is a problem with a significant percentage of their brushes.  </li>
            <li>I originally had an Sonicare Essence, but decided to try an Oral-B model.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I started using this brush, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my dental hygiene, with /far/</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and all you have to do is stand there and let the brush do all the work!</li>
            <li>Years ago, I purchased the original SoniCare.  </li>
            <li>This thing makes brushing FUN!</li>
            <li>Of course, the original will still do the trick</li>
            <li>baffles me is that the warranty is from the day of original purchase.</li>
            <li>I have had to replace the handle five times since my original purchase.  </li>
            <li>My version of this toothbrush has been a significant help on my dental cleaning that I decided my boys needed the benefit as well.  </li>
            <li>The low-end models that cost a quarter of this one have all the features my original Sonicare had.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who takes pride in their smile!</li>
            <li>It is worth the investment!</li>
            <li>I had an original model that lasted forever</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how to use it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It has a higher quality, more pleasing design than the Oral-B, which looks like a toy in comparison.</li>
            <li>I paid Amazon Prime for the overnight shipping, I was so excited.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth are getting whiter.</li>
            <li>Both me and my dentist have noticed significant improvement in my oral and dental health.</li>
            <li>how user friendly it is.  </li>
            <li>/o the original purchase info</li>
            <li>So far this has proved to be a better and more advanced product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, worth the investment (cheaper than cavities!).</li>
            <li>because the original broke somewhere between the head and the... actuator?</li>
            <li>but it made me more aware of the time I spend brushing the backs of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s pricey, it&#x27;s well worth it!  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure i was going to like it.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally as a Christmas gift, but once I saw all the features and how it worked</li>
            <li>I originally thought this was a button problem</li>
            <li>At first I said to myself \\&quot;Better call the</li>
            <li>(original unit, plus replacement heads).</li>
            <li>I called the number for customer service and got a friendly rep.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were significantly whiter in 2 minutes than they were in 10 minutes with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You can choose to use the one-minute Massage mode on its own or tack on the end of the normal brushing mode for a three-minute session (Gum Care).  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I had one of the original Sonicare toothbrushes and it served me every day for over five years.  </li>
            <li>the original design?  </li>
            <li>it is excellent alternative to ordinary brush.</li>
            <li>Far superior quality and more gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>The Refresh mode is a nice one-minute version of the normal (Clean) mode.  </li>
            <li>very good, reviewes previously helped understand how it worked and works wonders.</li>
            <li>Forget all the nit picking about models, in design alone, this is by far the best &amp;#34;SYSTEM&amp;#34; you can get simply because it&#x27;s super easy to clean, and the head protector / UV sanitizer keeps the part you stick in your mouth clean, and</li>
            <li>My mouth fells so clean and breath is so fresh!</li>
            <li>the box was in a nice package NEW and Neat ....</li>
            <li>However, some will find it nice to try out both sizes before ordering new brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light, easy to keep clean, smart shape!  </li>
            <li>It offers options that are wonderful like \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; that I use between meals that isn&#x27;t your standard 2 min of brush time as in \\&quot;clean\\&quot; that you would use morning and night.  </li>
            <li>Easier to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s not to say the Flexcare doesn&#x27;t clean well...</li>
            <li>It will need more usage to be able to form a complete opinion of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, remarkably powerful.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric toothbrush I have tried that is currently on the market.</li>
            <li>It programs you to clean your teeth longer.  </li>

            <li>I never thought I would say together, but the clean feeling you get</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s 100X better than a manual toothbrush and significantly better than the old Sonicare design with the screw on replacement heads.  </li>

            <li>Well... I end up use this toothbrush to clean my teeth up after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve said, I use the clean mode almost all the time.</li>
            <li>I never realized you could get that dentist level of clean at home until I tried the Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>But their&#x27;s did not make my teeth feel as clean as this</li>
            <li>and they were so clean they would squeak.  </li>
            <li>but that is how clean my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it has a variety of settings to allow me to clean my tongue and massage my gums.</li>

            <li>But when my hygienist saw the results she said she had almost no work to do to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how clean this makes my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>my mouth feels clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that my teeth feel as clean as leaving the dentist office after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What clean power this has.</li>
            <li>We will see what the dentist says, but my mouth feels almost fresh-from-the-dentist clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li>I tried cheaper electronic tooth brushes but my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean, and my gums were still irritated.</li>
            <li>Feel SO clean &amp; polished.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the best thing next to having your teeth cleaned professionally.  </li>

            <li>I have been using it for 2 months now since my checkup/cleaning and my teeth feel just as clean now as the day of my dentist visit.</li>
            <li>and they still don&#x27;t feel clean?</li>
            <li>The dental hygienist was amazed at how clean my teeth were after using this toothbrush for 6 months.  </li>
            <li>A must to keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean even hours after brushing.</li>
            <li>After brushing every time mouth feels really clean.</li>
            <li>how squeeky clean my teeth feel after each brushing.</li>
            <li>Clean with peroxide but STAY AWAY from this model.  </li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>I will say it is certainly the next best thing and pretty close.</li>
            <li>The brush&#x27;s \\&quot;engine\\&quot; slows after two minutes for a single minute of gum massage that feels great.</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li>Wow, they have too many models!    </li>
            <li>Plusses:  this toothbrush got my teeth very clean, and in fact seemed to work better than my old Oral-B electric toothbrush (not to mention that my dentist recommended the SoniCare over the Oral-B).  </li>
            <li>but Phillips seems to have figured out all of the flaws of their original design and made the sonic toothbrush twice as good, including a sleeker, smaller design.</li>
            <li>Fully charged it and used for full clean once a day which is two minutes a day and battery lasted until feb 7th.</li>
            <li>However the two-minute timer in the clean mode is cool</li>
            <li>You will fine it worth every penny that you spend on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and now she does the full clean almost every night before bed.</li>
            <li>Very cool product, keeps my teeth so clean, even my dental hygienist suspected I was seeing someone else, hahaha!</li>
            <li>Uses a special lamp that contains mercury and requires special disposal.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my mom for Christmas 2009 and it stopped working almost right away!  </li>
            <li>The repair was right on!</li>
            <li>then you really get a much better clean.  </li>
            <li>I can even get a really good clean back on my molars and wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li>The older screw-on brush model is still available but this one is slimmer with more bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li>The first tooth brush I have used that truly gets your teeth squeeky clean AND massages your gums and sanitizes!</li>
            <li>The best version Sonicare as put on the market with a travel hard case.  </li>
            <li>The sonicare is perfect if you have issues with brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>- Brush worked great and left the clean feeling that an electric toothbrush gives, and the vibration signaling when to switch to a different part of your teeth was a nice touch.     </li>
            <li>- The UV cleaner is a nice addition and makes you feel a little better about using the brush head more than a couple weeks.    </li>
            <li>the design itself is impeccable and makes it easy to clean/maintain (that being said it is an extremely low-maintenance product</li>
            <li>First, design is very cool.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth spending the extra money to get the best model Sonicare offers.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a much cheaper rechargable electric toothbrush first to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li>and I have generally been very satisfied</li>
            <li>if FAR better and FAR more powerful and effective.</li>
            <li>It is pretty pricey, BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;- lasts about 1.5 weeks from a full charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Notably, the Sensitive option offered a much gentler brushing, and the Massage option was a nice change of pace along the gum line.       </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m VERY happy with my purchase, especially the unbeatable price and free shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The head gets much more wear and tear with how fast the brush moves.  </li>
            <li>As for my gums, they seem to be better and not bleeding as much.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this marvel.</li>
            <li>while it is a good marketing tool, I don&#x27;t know how necessary it is.</li>
            <li>I really find that this electric toothbrush cleans my teeth much better than I can do by hand.</li>
            <li>I really like the Flexcare + toothbrush - it has so many features</li>
            <li>It cleans gently and it looks so chic on my counter :)     </li>
            <li>In the end I can&#x27;t offer any negatives on the UV Sanitizer which is good because (as of this writing) the only FlexCare Plus model you can by</li>
            <li>It feels as though we are getting good cleanings, and we are using various cleaning cycles.  </li>
            <li>Who really wants to spend more time sitting in that dental chair?    </li>
            <li>The gum care option on this toothbrush is really cool.</li>
            <li>Oral B is much cheaper and does a better job.  </li>
            <li>but I guess that is why it has the 14 uses building up to full power.  </li>
            <li>I feel I&#x27;m able to ward off tartar before it really sets in.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve already used a Sonicare, you can skip the ramp-up process and start the brush at full power.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look sweet now.     </li>
            <li>If sonic technology is good enough for Doctor</li>
            <li>Who, it&#x27;s certainly good enough for me.    </li>
            <li>I LOVE this so much that I have decided to purchase one for each of my children.</li>
            <li>They were charging full price for their&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>he didn&#x27;t had to do much cleaning compare to most of his clients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this tooth brush for about 3 years and love it as much today as I did 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush also comes with a travel case, and brush head covers, which is really cool.</li>
            <li>I really believe that I have this tooth brush to thank for that. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I really believe that I have this tooth brush to thank for that. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and it helps you with the 14 day period that it gradually gets up to full power.</li>
            <li>I drink espresso and eat tomatoes daily, and drink wine often, so I figured this would be a good investment to help keep my teeth in as good of shape as possible.</li>
            <li>and wow what a diffrence its made my teeth are more white then ever, my gums feel great</li>
            <li>but it looks cool.</li>
            <li>The representaative told me that a full set replacement unit would be delivered  to me within 7-10 day By Fedex.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool with the two brushes so my husband and I can both use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get your teeth super clean though, went to the dentist after a year instead of six months while using this guy....</li>
            <li>The gum cleaning is more gentle.  </li>
            <li>More gentle cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes aren&#x27;t cheap, but the way this toothbrush cleans my teeth makes them worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up for Sonicare!t brushes aren&#x27;t cheap, but the way this toothbrush cleans my teeth makes them worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My last toothbrush was a Sonicare Elite and that lasted me a good 5.5 years.</li>
            <li>UV sanitizer is probably more gimmick than of real use.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would spend this much on a toothbrush, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love going to the dentist and having the hygienist say \\&quot;well you didn&#x27;t leave much for me to do.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It really cleans better than anything I used before.</li>
            <li>(surprisingly that&#x27;s the second time I&#x27;ve used that sentence today.)</li>
            <li>This toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling super clean and your breath fresher.</li>
            <li>Nice replacement for my 10 year old sonic care.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer in the power of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mode is massage because it helps really get the gum line without being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Having used these for years, I can say they are the best toothbrushes going, however, my one complaint is that you cant replace the battery after it dies.  </li>
            <li>surfaces of my teeth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>Still love the toothbrush; so much so that I purchased this one for my son.</li>
            <li>like one reviewer said, our mouths are full of germs.  </li>
            <li>True story:</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>are so clean after using it the very first time.</li>
            <li>The agent said that this time, for sure, the new unit would be available and shipped by April 23.  </li>
            <li>Is the new model is built more cheaply that</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I had the right toothbrush as I didn&#x27;t see the 5 brushing mode display not knowing that the text will appear after the toothbrush is fully charge and when I hit the select button.  </li>
            <li>Whats more is that if you leave them standing near or on water, the rubber material grows mildew very quickly.</li>
            <li>The difference is that this model has a slightly more powerful motor (I think - the vibrations are more vigorous), and has the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; option which means the amplitude of the vibration is larger (moves more from side to side) and the frequency lower (vibrates slower, but still very fast).</li>
            <li>Very easy to adjust the settings for example: clean, sensitive, massage etc.</li>
            <li>To me, my experience is so important I must let others know, so you can make the right decision.  </li>
            <li>The new model does a great job cleaning your teeth and stimulating ones gums, but the push button that controls the various features is located in a position that is just too easy to bump while holding the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I love the new Refresh mode for a quick 1-minute clean to supplement my full nighttime and morning, 2-minute Clean.</li>
            <li>The UV light cleaner is nice, but we only ever use the &#x27;Clean&#x27; setting on the brush.</li>
            <li>Super cool.</li>
            <li>After the very first use, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it was really doing.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, my teeth felt just as clean and smooth as when I leave for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>Gotta say works great would recommend even to other family members.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>It was great when it worked, but I&#x27;m not willing to pay $150 for a toothbrush every nine months.</li>
            <li>BUT - despite all the negative reviews on this new model, I wanted to have the latest and the greatest, so I ignored the input and purchased this unit.  </li>
            <li>Dentist was so right that this is light years ahead of normal tooth brushing for cleaning teeth and keeping gums healthy.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel so clean after each use and it is worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li>makes mouth feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>my teeth feel so clean after each use and it is worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li>Super cleans teeth.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>Luckily it comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding the + model to be a worthy upgrade.</li>
            <li>Immediately noticeable was the more solid feel, better grip, and improved balance of the handle.</li>
            <li>All in all a worthy upgrade.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a travel case and travel charger, which I haven&#x27;t found too useful myself (thus far), but is nice to have.</li>
            <li>so I shopped Amazon to find the BEST (and most expensive)</li>
            <li>I have the older Sonicare Elite model and it is still running after 3 years, but this newer, lighter flexcare plus model seems to be more prone to failures.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really nice to have the blue light aspect, because bacteria is my No 1 enemy.</li>
            <li>If all is OK with the replacement brush after several years of use, I will update my rating to more stars.    </li>
            <li>That has not been received and it&#x27;s been many more than ten days.  </li>
            <li>plus I have noticed a tremendous amount of improvements.  </li>
            <li>I have had the older models that were more bulky.</li>
            <li>We were advised by our dentist to buy this super toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I researched the different brands to find the best one for the money and the Philips Sonicare FlexCare always came in above the rest.  </li>
            <li>Comes with two heads, charges quickly and comes with a UV cleaner.  </li>
            <li>However, it quickly became negligible, and I now never notice anything but</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Flexcare Plus is a step better than the Healthy White Sonicare I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think Philips thought of just about everything with this brush, and it definitely holds up to its guarantee of better dental checkups. :)</li>
            <li>The real test of the results will be when I go to the dentist next, but I think they will be happy.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a worthy candidate for the Oyster Award (given annually by Consumer Reports for difficult-to-open-packages).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a recommended upgrade.  </li>

            <li>don&#x27;t really use the cleaning device much, but still nice to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using various Sonicare models since 2003 and this is definitely the best designed in terms of looks, features, and slim design.  </li>
            <li>Also the UV light is a pretty cool gimmick.</li>
            <li>course, this brush as more modes than most, but are they really necessary?  </li>

            <li>(Hopefully so they can figure out why these things break so quickly.)  </li>
            <li>y o u get ued to it really quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I am now able to sanitize my brush regularly.  </li>
            <li>Gum care is easy, fun and very gentle.</li>
            <li>This is another lesson as to why when you get in touch with a company, be friendly, be patient, and 9/10 times, they&#x27;ll do right by you because they value you as a customer.</li>
            <li>Many of my family members have Sonicare brushes and highly recommended to have the cleaning system whenever I was researching for mine.      </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them as their service is top notch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great investment if you&#x27;re a &#x27;lazy&#x27; brusher and just want machine to do all the work for you (since good manual brushing can produce good results as well, at least comparable).  </li>
            <li>This model is an update to an earlier model and in most cases, changes  are minor - a good product is made somewhat better.  </li>
            <li>My gums felt amazing, my teeth were whitened immediately, and I could see newly exposed gum tissue (that had been blocked by permanent tarter) after my first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really encourages you to brush your teeth to the right amount of time and WAY better than a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>Amazon quickly refunded our first one and gave us a free shipping label for return.  </li>
            <li>Excellent Toohbrush, had a previous model for quite a few years, was happy with that one and very please with this one.</li>
            <li>I had my teeth cleaned right before using and they have stayed clean.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and have noticed that I brush my teeth more frequently and for much longer.</li>
            <li>(I have a UV light on both a hot tub and a koi pond, and you can see the difference they make in just a day).    </li>
            <li>First, I have had problems with the antibacterial &#x27;light&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>but Philips has a sleeker product with more possible options in the different packages they sell (and I was happy that my dentist gave me a $[...] mail-in rebate to sweeten the deal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>and now I brush pretty comfortably.</li>
            <li>my regular morning routine, and by the time I am ready to brush, my heads are nice and sanitized &#x3D;).</li>
            <li>very first Sonicare lasted 4 or 5 years</li>
            <li>This is our second Philips Sonicare and we are very pleased.</li>
            <li>Had a sonicare before, this one is even better, multiple speed options and the cleaning container is great not only for cleaning but keeping it contained from dust/dirt in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t pull the head off for a week or so (see the light comments below) be prepared for some pretty gnarly stuff in there.  </li>
            <li>No gingivitis yet, and the &#x27;pockets&#x27; are still within normal range but at 63, I want to keep them that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The product-of-choice if you really want to use the most current and effective technology in tooth/gum/oralcare.</li>
            <li>It also came with a UV light unit that kills bacteria for the brush heads which I find useful and a nice extra with the kit.  </li>
            <li>The refresh setting I would say is by far more superior than using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, has many choices as to how you brush, easy to travel with, long charge, and my entire  family now wants their own!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gross to think about but your mouth is a pretty gross place and the idea that you can clean your toothbrush is awesome.</li>
            <li>was always self conscious about the spot, so this certainly has made me feel more confident when I smile.  </li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer to keep bacterias and viruses down, in the tooth brush, is a great</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to be touching something every day for years and putting it in or near your mouth, you want to know that it will stay clean.</li>
            <li>Lithium-ion batteries are more powerful and don&#x27;t have a charge memory like older batteries do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I typically only use the clean cycle, and it&#x27;s nice that it beeps at you to remind you which section you&#x27;re supposed to be brushing</li>
            <li>So I just received the toothbrush and it seems like a really great product, but the price just went down 15 dollars the day after I bought it.</li>
            <li>This design is far superior to the older one where liquid could leak in to the brush assembly resulting in mold growth.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the UV that much, its nice to have and the non-UV isn&#x27;t that much cheaper right now.  </li>
            <li>I have owned a  Sonicare  toothbrush (for about two years and found very easy to use, absolutely reliable, and very thorough in its brushing (i.e., my dentist compliments me on my teeth and gums).  </li>
            <li>This one is a lot fancier and has a great \\&quot;high tech\\&quot; look with the UV Brush Head Sanitizer that lights up with a spacey blue color when it&#x27;s being used.  </li>
            <li>I love my new Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love my new Sonic.</li>
            <li>I love this new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>know that a new brush always works better in the beginning.</li>
            <li>I love the sleek new design.</li>
            <li>Now better than new.</li>
            <li>I love my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Sure, maybe I&#x27;ll get a new one instead of some refurb as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, my teeth feel like new every time I brush them.</li>
            <li>I hope this new handle lasts more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>I purchased this new top of the line model from Amazon about  a year ago.  </li>
            <li>The new technology for cleaning teeth and revitalizing gum tissue is outstanding.</li>
            <li>The product was great, until it stopped working after less than a year.  </li>
            <li>So far the unit is working fine and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product worked perfectly from the get-go, and I look forward to acing my next (long overdue) check-up.</li>
            <li>Since the unit is within 90 day full refund warranty, i can get the full refund, but will have to pay for the return shipping and the whole process will take 3 months!</li>
            <li>They are easy to tote, and don&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>That Sonicare was wonderful - long lasting, thorough.  </li>
            <li>Replaced my very old sonicare with this one and we love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush, I can not really explain how clean your teeth will feel and the gum massage setting is great for your overall gum health.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for 1 month today, but your teeth will thank you after the first brush!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!</li>
            <li>When I first got the thing, boy oh boy, it was POWERFUL!</li>
            <li>Seems like an eternity at first though!</li>
            <li>This is the best investment in personal care that I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li>The Sonicare simply does a much better job!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Tooth brush!!!</li>
            <li>Replaced it with a new one which experienced the same problem within a month.</li>
            <li>I wanted top quality, but learned that the older model, which I could have purchased much, cheaper, would have performed better and most likely still be working.  </li>
            <li>I wanted top quality, but learned that the older model, which I could have purchased much, cheaper, would have performed better and most likely still be working.  </li>
            <li>It has many different settings and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare really leaves my teeth CLEAN; like just after a dental cleaning clean</li>
            <li>From what I understand, older Sonicare devices are great, but from reading the reviews, it looks like their QA has gone into the toilet.</li>
            <li>Overall this is one of my favorite purchases and get excited to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>I believe it was due to the lateral (sideways) motion of the head being able to better clean the curved surfaces and between the teeth.    </li>
            <li>The handle, while thinner than the old model, is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Being able to clean the brush head is a major plus as well.</li>
            <li>This being my first ever electric toothbrush, I can say that my mouth/teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>the UV sanitizer compartment is easy to clean as the brush holder slides easily in and out for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 years later.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips for a Super product!</li>
            <li>So - clean teeth and clean brush, no plaque, easy to use, and various special features (like the battery indicator).</li>
            <li>I had an Oral B many years ago and hardly used it because I never felt like it did as good a job as my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I hard many good things about sonic care products.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to say besides all the added benefits stated in the other reviews - if you are new to a system like this it just makes brushing easier and more enjoyable, meaning you will do it more.</li>
            <li>It works right out of the box (you have to put the toothbrush head on it) and when you first use it your mouth will feel as clean as it does when you leave the dental office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this product, hopefully as much as I have.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few great products one manages to purchase these days.</li>
            <li>I never thought that I would say I enjoy brushing my teeth, however, this toothbrush makes it a real pleasure.</li>
            <li>This is simply short of amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few months, and it has been great.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;To begin with, there is no gross slime getting stuck in these heads, and the UV sanitizer is amazing.</li>
            <li>I had not owned a nice electronic dental care brush in the past but this is an amazing first experience.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare HX6972 has all the bells and whistles a UV light to kill bacteria between brushings,different modes (really don&#x27;t do anything), and a travel</li>
            <li>After using this tooth brash for 3+ years I can say that it does great job cleaning my teeth, but I have run into some problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sanitizer is great for when you want and bacteria free brush, which should be used at least once a week.</li>
            <li>great battery life, never an issue, even a few days on vacation.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s no worse than the newer light bulbs.</li>
            <li>I waited almost a whole year to review this product so I could give an accurate review</li>
            <li>well (far better than a</li>
            <li>It did a good job cleaning, but with the price I paid, I would expected longer life.</li>
            <li>Of the Sonicare options, the FlexCare Plus offers the most features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ultimately, the cost and convenience of a sanitizer make it a reasonable addition to good oral hygiene regime.</li>
            <li>As I found out, a brush this powerful</li>
            <li>My son loves brushing his teeth and for a 5 year old what more could a parent ask for with dental hygiene?  </li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush about 3 months ago here, I was a bit weary of the price since i had never used a sonic toothbrush before, but I figured it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>UV sanitizer Cant say what its worth.</li>
            <li>but my god it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>My husband has the flexcare model and is pleased with it so far</li>
            <li>Oral B professional (unit and brush head) are cheaper and better made.  </li>
            <li>To cut to the chase, it is not as powerful as the Elite 7500.</li>
            <li>Would I still buy this model, knowing it&#x27;s not as powerful?</li>
            <li>Money worth spending.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really fun to use.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny and change your dreaded dental visits.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is a bit steep, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go for the high-end one again with the sanitizer that I rarely use, but would buy one again.</li>
            <li>For me it has already proven to be well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>yes, but worth it.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the price for the quality of work it perfoms on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The various cleaning functions are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and does not collect junk like the old model.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>If was worth the price.   </li>
            <li>It is definately worth the price for how well it works on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Amazon had the lowest price by far (better than BB&amp;B with 20% off).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just investing in a sonic toothbrush, this is well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money I have had mine for over 6 months with no issues.</li>
            <li>They also include a travel charger, which is nice, but you would only need this for an extended trip away from home with the increased battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never used UV on my old toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve survived for 40+ years - I just make sure to rinse it well, and sometimes wash it with soap.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This brush is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is one of those purchases that you WILL NOT regret and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>additional mini-charger is nice to have, I remember having difficulties packing the big OralB charger while traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost two, one in each of those ways, but I keep replacing them, so take that for whatever its worth.</li>
            <li>it worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush so far and haven&#x27;t had any issues a month in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money...</li>
            <li>but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the product about three weeks, but so far so great.</li>
            <li>thought this comparison might be useful, since I used the Oral-B for about three years before the battery died completely, and I am using the Philips for more than a year already.</li>
            <li>Well worth every cent with the five modes.</li>
            <li>So far no issues....:)</li>
            <li>for this price its all worth it for 2.5 yrs .</li>
            <li>I love these things, but I purchased mine at the end of June 2012 and just this month it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really a big deal, as I don&#x27;t plan on using it while scuba diving, but it is a nice touch.     </li>
            <li>so the Sonicare wins in the battery department.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is one powerful</li>
            <li>That means I have to move the brush around more than I am used to with my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Dental care is definitely important and something I wish I had taken more seriously in my younger days...  </li>
            <li>My mouth and teeth feel so fresh.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>me, it&#x27;s worth the expense of replacing the brush heads, because what would be the point of using this electric toothbrush,</li>
            <li>me, this Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush has made my teeth alot whiter, given my smile confidence, which in turn has given me confidence.  </li>
            <li>think this Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>&quot; it will be worth every cent.</li>
            <li>The only thing that effectively delivers a plaque-reducing and bacteria-killing mechanism even deeper into the gumline is an oral irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also makes brushing fun for me as well.  </li>
            <li>its worth it in the end.  </li>
            <li>Cust support was nice enough-</li>
            <li>The multiple setting are nice</li>
            <li>I know it is worth</li>
            <li>Sonic Care tooth brush is worth the money I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>and my mom is too nice and did not tell me it broke until last year (2013!)</li>
            <li>They also include a travel charger, which is nice, but you would only need this for an extended trip away from home with the increased battery life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to buy replacement heads at Amazon or Walmart for this particular model.  </li>
            <li>We own several.  </li>
            <li>I thinkthis is the most worse Customer Service I ever experienced.</li>
            <li>It did its job nicely while it was working, but you&#x27;d think that a $200 unit would last a bit longer than 1.5 years.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>id say its worth it...</li>
            <li>Then, the handle started shutting off mid-brush and turning on on its own (including in the middle of the night).  </li>
            <li>Love the fact you can place brush in the blue light cleaning compartment after each brushing.</li>
            <li>and I believe it was worth it.</li>
            <li>but after you open up the box you see this nice silver finsih with no text.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice if you think it actually makes your toothbrush cleaner</li>
            <li>but it is worth ever penny.</li>
            <li>for the increased tissue health it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>then it would be worth it.      </li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but your chompers are worth it, and going through gum surgery (so I am told) is no picnic at the beach.</li>
            <li>The other great thing about this brush is that it has three different settings depending on how much time you have, and I love the massage setting for your gums!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as cheap as buying it here, but I was able to get a 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty &amp; considering how many people seem to have had trouble with motors or batteries failing</li>
            <li>worth considering over the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; Philips, and reading some of the reviews on the design of the Diamondclean</li>
            <li>worth considering over the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; Philips, and reading some of the reviews on the design of the Diamondclean</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This brush also offers a few brushing modes so that you can select what suits you best.</li>
            <li>That being said, I rarely use the UV thing and the charger can get wiped off.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>We are out $148 and have a minimally useful toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li>Rarely get cavities during Dental visit, still lovin this product.</li>
            <li>This is SO worth every penny</li>
            <li>in my opinion, has ceased to be worth the price they charge.</li>
            <li>(so that I can get another replacement under the two year warranty) or 2 years (so that I feel like I got my $$ worth).</li>
            <li>I rarely change it.</li>
            <li>I could not have made a better decision unless I&lt;br /&gt;Lived with a professional dentist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>However, she cannot use this brush every day, as it irritates one of her sensitive teeth, so if that is an issue, hand brushing might be better.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for the brush head cleaning, but different settings that showed a difference would have been nice.</li>
            <li>To ber perfectly honest, this item is a bit of a luxury: it doesn&#x27;t need multiple vibration settings.</li>
            <li>The product is well designed and feels worth the cost.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>It is really worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li>It is nice to use the sterilizer regularly.</li>
            <li>it felt kind of odd &amp; took some getting use to, but when I was done my mouth felt so clean!</li>
            <li>The ability to select different brushing programs for quick touch-ups, normal brushing, or longer brushing is something I have been using more and more.</li>
            <li>If you use this right before bed, you will probably want to close your bathroom door to avoid having the nice blue glow in your bedroom.  </li>
            <li>this is a first electric brush for me - so i don&#x27;t have a true basis for comparison - other than subsequent dentist visits whereby the hygienists were impressed with my gum improvements.</li>
            <li>UV sanitizer is a great little bonus when you really want to clean your brush.  </li>
            <li>so much I wondered if I could keep using it, but by the third brushing that all went away and I just enjoyed the clean smooth feeling it gave my teeth.</li>
            <li>just how well the sanitizer works verses normal rinsing but given how easy it is to use I use it after every brushing.</li>
            <li>You really do get the kind of clean that you only get after getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist office.</li>
            <li>the gradual increase in pressure over the first 14 uses of the brush &#x3D; brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;4) multi-level settings for full/extended brushing or quick refreshers when you are headed out somewhere&lt;</li>
            <li>The timer helps you make sure you brush the right amount of time, the different settings give you lots of options, and the technology helps keep your teeth clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Whats more is that to repair these, they were going to charge me as much as it would have been to purchase a new one!</li>
            <li>I have had a previous model of Sonicare for well over 5 years and absolutely loved it, so I was pretty excited to upgrade to the Flexcare+.</li>
            <li>I actually wish I could brush my teeth MORE often - I can&#x27;t get over how awesomely clean my teeth feel, and I want them to feel that way all the time.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended the Philips Sonicare FlexCare plus, Rechargeable toothbruth with the sanitizer to help keep my teeth, gums, filings, and crowns clean in order to make them last longer and stay healthy.  </li>
            <li>The problem was I kept pulling off the top piece and putting it away in it&#x27;s case every night and the constant wear and tear of that broke the piece that vibrates to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I personally only use the gumcare and clean settings, but after just one week my teeth and gums feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>It worked better than a manual toothbrush, but I was still getting quite a bit of staining on my front teeth from coffee (only one cup a day) and my teeth never felt completely clean after brushings.</li>
            <li>I love the UV cleaner it seems to give my brushes that extra clean that they need to help keep my breath fresher longer.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is good enough that I&#x27;ll be buying another Sonicare, just not this model since it&#x27;s older</li>
            <li>I am looking into alternate toothbrushes, and have found their main competitor to have good reviews, and will give them a try.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recall my original Sonicare toothbrush, I ended up not using it too much.   </li>
            <li>The motor on this model is also much quieter compared to the original which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I love that the head is smaller and can more easily get to the back teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean the brushes and always ready to go for the next brushing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never thought I was good at lasting the requisite / needed time period for brushing, but this is so pleasant that I find it&#x27;s not enough to go through only one timed circuit.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if the Sonicare Airfloss and a regular brush would have done the same thing, but I will say that this is a lot more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I asked my dental hygienist about the difference (she had both models right there)</li>
            <li>This version, the FlexCare plus, gets it right.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>The intensity seems spot on and the 10 minute cycle seems about right.</li>
            <li>right before you press the ON button to start brushing.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>right before I&#x27;m going to brush again.    </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it and He was right.</li>
            <li>Philips should acknowledge that these handles are defective and do the right thing by recalling.</li>
            <li>and I feel that I made the right decision.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t even the right model of toothbrush handle.  </li>
            <li>so they tried to put things right</li>
            <li>and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>The first brushing gave me amazing improvement in the overall cleanliness of my teeth and now after a month of use,I have noticed improved health in my gums as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toothbrush for the duration of the few months that it is operational, but a 4-5 month replacement cycle is pretty unacceptable.</li>
            <li>The brushes seem to last just fine, but theres something in the body of that mechanism that breaks a bit too easily.</li>
            <li>It works great for the first few months and then begins to lose its mojo.</li>
            <li>The first (Elite model) was amazing and worked for several years.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for the past 7 years and this one by far is the best one to date.  </li>
            <li>(If you give it a full charge, your toothbrush should last more than a week, so you may not need to pack the travel</li>
            <li>(If you give it a full charge, your toothbrush should last more than a week, so you may not need to pack the travel charger).    </li>
            <li>based on what I&#x27;ve experienced so far though, I wish I would have invested in one of these long ago.</li>
            <li>The metal prong is just press fit into plastic, yet it is the main vibrating part.</li>
            <li>Who wants to put slime in their mouth when they are trying to CLEAN their teeth?</li>
            <li>the toothbrush is made real well and is easy to figure ,it does a good job cleaning your teeth and has multiple switches to clean you teeth in different way,</li>
            <li>My teeth whitened up fast and areas where i&#x27;m used to staining are all clean now (from what i can see in my mirror).</li>
            <li>I thought it worked fine for about 2 years with normal use.  </li>
            <li>If you want a toothbrush that really gets your teeth squeaky clean a Philips Sonicare is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li>I tend to swap heads keeping 2 in there clean and ready to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does clean very well</li>
            <li>I also used an Oral-B model and it didn&#x27;t clean my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is simple to use, works great has easy useful functions and operates effortlessly.</li>
            <li>It took a while to get used to the VERY strong sonic power of this brush (even though I came from a basic electronic brush)</li>
            <li>I wish they could tone it down a bit more, say 50% more.</li>
            <li>Keep it simple, save money and purchase the Original SoniCare or Original Oral-B systems!  </li>
            <li>I am glad I spent the money for a great clean and hopefully less time at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I need an old toothbrush to clean the Sonicare handle!  </li>
            <li>GumCare&#x27; takes 3 minutes, the first 2 minutes of this mode are just like clean, and the last minute is more of the &#x27;massage&#x27; feature, which is a bit softer and is meant to use for brushing your gums.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is even more slender than the previous, more lightweight &amp; easier to use.</li>
            <li>The brush has some nice touches such as the electronic head sanitizer, as well as multiple functions (Clean Teeth, Clean Gums, Massage, Quick Brush, etc.).</li>
            <li>She really like it and says it work very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I now have a new toothbrush and it appears to be working just fine.  </li>
            <li>If you have excellent brushing habits as is, then this product is going to make things better and potentially could make things worse.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt so clean after brushing them and the next morning they still felt clean!</li>
            <li>The small travel charger is great.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush but It barely lasted me over a year.</li>
            <li>However, with this brush, it&#x27;s amazing how much cleaner and fresh my mouth feels only after two minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner, the width of the toothbrush head is much smaller and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>The rubber ring that seals the top has apparently deteriorated over time and allowed water to enter the inside of the unit.</li>
            <li>But this line satisfies my neat-freakness and does a great job cleaning, as usual.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard this from other reviewers, and I can tell you from my own experience that after a week of use, I still have full bars (3 of 3) showing on the display.  </li>
            <li>While the price here was good for the HX6972/10, it is about $40 higher than for the HX6992/10 at other places.  </li>
            <li>And the lady on the line was so nice that it did not take long for me to receive a replacement handle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I want to keep my own teeth as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very powerful, yet quiet model and it&#x27;s easy for me to use.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous that I&#x27;d have a long wait for delivery, but was very happy when it arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li>Particularly if you are the nerd variety and enjoy fun new gadgets, and being able to tell people that your new space toothbrush has a UV sanitation chamber.</li>
            <li>And after about 3 days the power kind of died down significantly.</li>
            <li>I put my brush in there after every use and after going on long trips to make sure my brush is always clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I believe it&#x27;s a great improvement on personal hygiene, I&#x27;d recommend to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;Especially young people in their 20&#x27;s; as they still have a chance to save their teeth, and this tool is so much better than a regular brush!their 20&#x27;s; as they still have a chance to save their teeth, and this tool is so much better than a regular brush!</li>
            <li>you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly seems like it is a doing a far better job on my teeth than any toothbrush did before, none of that midday \\&quot;film\\&quot; that I used to get.</li>
            <li>I realized that even though it looks like a kid&#x27;s brush it really is far better for my mouth than the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; large brushhead.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use - open the box, read the instructions, plug it in and after charging, it is ready to use!  </li>
            <li>5 years and 2 month later toothbrush is still going strong!</li>
            <li>So glad we did, as the four of us love it, even the little kids.</li>
            <li>Last, but not least; speaking to the real reason for using an electric toothbrush....my teeth and gums are clean and healthy!  </li>
            <li>The site had a \\&quot;live chat\\&quot; option, but no agents were available according to the chat application.      </li>
            <li>and they are sending me a new toothbrush free of charge.  </li>
            <li>The new brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and they are sending out a new bulb to me for free.</li>
            <li>I told her my issue, gave her my serial number, and an order for a new unit was place free of charge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary -  If you buy an electric toothbrush, I highly suggest the original SoniCare product.  </li>
            <li>If you buy an electric toothbrush, I highly suggest the original SoniCare product.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that this new flexcare plus model has a closed handle and the toothbrush goes onto a metal rod so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and finally you clean the enamels of your teeth&#x27;s for the top side and bottom side for a complete clean.     </li>
            <li>I wanted something that would be as gentle as the elite and would have bought a second one, but liked the additional features of the flexcare plus.</li>
            <li>That is, the vibrating action is not as strong...</li>
            <li>Its a great product, my teeth are much white then when i used a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that (basically) gingivitis is initially caused by plaque accumulation and soft plaque can be removed by good hygiene (e.g. brushing AND flossing).</li>
            <li>The brushing does great work and your teeth and gums and made a noticeable difference, especially to my dentist who made mention of it on my next visit.  </li>
            <li>(I know, gross but even if you replace your brush head every 3 months like recommended it&#x27;s easy to forget to clean out the moisture inside which can build up into mold).</li>
            <li>I researched for several months as I still wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth over $100.  </li>
            <li>This is a good upgrade over the previous model.</li>
            <li>I knew I wanted to go back to Sonicare and am so happy I finally did!</li>
            <li>It costs quite a bit more than a regular toothbrush (but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be to make the pause between cycles more distinct; if you are not paying attention you can miss the change.  </li>
            <li>I had a previous sonicare which was good</li>
            <li>, this is the most powerful brush Sonicare currently makes</li>
            <li>In summary, a good toothbrush, but plan on replacing it after less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does take a full 10 minutes to complete a full sanitization session, but I just turn on the sanitation while I am showering and/or flossing-</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT investment in your dental hygiene; dentist bills are a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li>The smaller profile is much easier to handle and the improvements in the brush head design are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my good old manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, and is obviously the result of several years of updates and refinement.</li>
            <li>brush head isn&#x27;t easy for young children or those with disabilities to attach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have a great checkup every 6 months even though I only actually brush once a day.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good because I don&#x27;t think the soft case can properly protect the metal stem sticking out of the handle.</li>
            <li>After five days i noticed less bleeding from my gums, this has to be a good thing.</li>
            <li>Easy Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush, White]].</li>
            <li>And if its fun your more likely to do it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for getting it shipped so quickly.</li>
            <li>I previously had another (older) Sonicare and liked that cheaper more basic design much better.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, the toothbrush is incredibly easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush until it has an internal short and melts apart.</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend the purchase for anyone who wants to take really good care of your teeth.</li>
            <li>It has proved to be a very effective response to my lazy dental habits.</li>
            <li>I have been using sonicare flexcare toothbrush for almost 4 years , I fall in love with this toothbrush right away, I tired all kind of electric toothbrushes (more than 10), flexcare by far is the best,the feeling of refreshness is no comparison.    </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to go on about what I like about this toothbrush since many other reviewers go into fine details about what there is to like about it.</li>
            <li>Even after the very first use, your teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I have had many Sonicare brushes, but I think Philips finally got it right with this one.</li>
            <li>I even turned off the easy start mode and tried it at full power, and it still wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth well enough.</li>
            <li>The design is sleek, easy to select different functions (massage, clean, etc.)and is powerful yet gentle.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Philips doesn&#x27;t appear to care very much about customer service.</li>
            <li>He likes this toothbrush very much.</li>
            <li>but i like it very much.</li>
            <li>but now i like it very much</li>
            <li>This new FlexCare is more complex to operate but does a superior job.  </li>
            <li>I just recently upgraded my original Sonicare Advanced toothbrush to</li>
            <li>So far the replacement handle is working just fine</li>
            <li>It worked fine until early November 2013.</li>
            <li>just use the normal &#x27;clean&#x27; function -</li>
            <li>This thing removes coffee/tea stains and removes residue from the gumline better than any other toothbrush/electric I&#x27;ve owned, and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is a beautiful piece of machinery.</li>
            <li>Sure, I called them and they said they would ship me a new handle for free but if this unit had lasted me just 2 months more, the warranty would have expired and there would have been no free replacement!</li>
            <li>it works great; the various timer modes really are useful, particularly the \\&quot;Refresh\\&quot; mode for a quick brush, and they stay set after you use them, so you don&#x27;t need to continually select your preferred mode when starting.  </li>
            <li>My new toothbrush seems very futuristic and easy to use.</li>
            <li>they just don&#x27;t make the new Sonicare as well as the original.</li>
            <li>The CSR said that even if I have a brand new handle from them, the original warranty date stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the brush sanitizer regularly and it gives me a feeling of confidence that my brush is clean to the point of germ free when I use it.</li>
            <li>I only use the UV light once a week to clean the brush head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery life is also a lot better than older models (mine was really old</li>
            <li>I really like the clean feeling that the Sonicare leaves and my gums feel much healthier.</li>
            <li>We upgraded from some older electric toothbrushes and we were quite surprised with how much better they have gotten.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and will suggest my whole family to use it !</li>
            <li>They rush to add and over hype so-called &amp;#34;big improvements&amp;#34; to their products to keep prices high while sacrificing true quality.  </li>
            <li>The price is a little high, but is well worth it as I find its use to be more entertaining than a chore and look forward both morning and night to using it.  </li>
            <li>The replacement unit worked fine for about 6 more months and developed the same problem again.</li>
            <li>Comes with a travel charger and a great travel hard case which protects your brush and keeps it all organized.  </li>
            <li>The gum care mode seemed great for me because I tended to bleed in my gums from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>Also comes with a great travel case for brush unit, hard plastic with brush covers.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist told me she hardly had to do any cleaning because my teeth were in great shape.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the warranty is 24 months, so I called Philips and they quickly sent me a new handle of the same model for free.</li>
            <li>Purchased to place a very old original version of the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>My teeth never felt or looked clean afer using a 2 minute cycle, and the brush head after time kept moving around -- I knew it was time for a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge problem for me too, it&#x27;s incredibly sensitive and turns off or changes modes when i&#x27;m holding it like i would a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Basically, this feature starts you off with a gentler brushing experience for your first use, and the power gradually builds throughout the first week (i.e., 14 brushings).  </li>
            <li>This is my first review on any product</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t aware that the device comes with two sizes of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Of course if your looking at this brush the head replacement is probably pretty trivial seeing as how, well, if your willing to spend this money on a brush, purchasing replacement heads should not be an issue.    </li>
            <li>The most recent version of the toothbrush they show is the HX6950.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I like the extra accessory :)      </li>
            <li>This was a first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with both the toothbrush and the company.</li>
            <li>The larger heads also fit in the travel case, so you don&#x27;t have to use the compact travel head if you don&#x27;t want to!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>What is the exact issue you are facing with the unit?  </li>
            <li>: Could you confirm the exact issue you&#x27;re facing with it?  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel so much \\&quot;slicker\\&quot; and fresher than ever before!</li>
            <li>This model has a different type of connection that is much more sanitary.</li>
            <li>This latest upgrade feels like a big step up.</li>
            <li>this latest version is head and shoulders above the rest.   </li>
            <li>I now have next to no tarter, my teeth are cleaner and whiter than ever, my gums are healthy and going to the dentist is now a snap.  </li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted over 13 years and both my husband and me used it.  </li>
            <li>Just got a lot of toothpaste on my shirt and on the floor the first couple of times.</li>
            <li>It actually makes brushing a more pleasurable experience.</li>
            <li>but it is exponentially better at removing plaque than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>is in the process of going to put my toothpaste on and then pressing the bright green circular ON button to start brushing</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>and I am an avid coffee drinker.</li>
            <li>just got a toothbrush like this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush really does give you that \\&quot;fresh from the dentist\\</li>
            <li>The first two times I used this it tickled my mouth</li>
            <li>Love the different selections for program length and intensity of the oscillations.</li>
            <li>I love the different programs it has to choose from</li>
            <li>Still, its a fantastic brush and one that I can directly attribute to healthier teeth.</li>
            <li>In addition, more gadgets equate to potential repair problems.  </li>
            <li>Keep it simple, save money and purchase the Original SoniCare or Original Oral-B</li>
            <li>In addition, more gadgets equate to potential repair problems.  </li>
            <li>So much better than my standard tooth brush!</li>
            <li>Electric tooth brushes never seem to last more than 2 to 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I had a first generation sonicare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure their actual cost is pennies.</li>
            <li>Got the toothbrush on a very timely manner--two days!  </li>
            <li>At first I was leery of the built in timer</li>
            <li>Love all the different modeson it.</li>
            <li>It tickles at first</li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love the different levels you can use when brushing.  </li>
            <li>I love mine and will NEVER go back to a manual toothbrush!</li>
            <li>We had to buy another one since the first product came damaged.  </li>
            <li>The first is the Procare brush heads that come with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It takes more effort to switch between modes than to simply take the darn thing out of your mouth halfway through the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no joke when people tell you that you notice the difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>but then you wouldn&#x27;t get to see the cool blue light when the sanitizer is working).  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s ticklish at first</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This is the first Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased one for my wife, which is her first, and she loves it.</li>
            <li>Although I have only been using the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Plus for about a week I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This is our first electric toothbrush and I wish I bought one years ago.  </li>
            <li>I guess I used that OralB brush for about 6 years (therefore I&#x27;m quite pleased with its reliability) following my dentist recommendation.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>They have been telling me to buy a higher quality brush for years,</li>
            <li>But at the same time I wish they found a way to make the design more</li>
            <li>i received this fourth replacement one month ago, so presumably it&#x27;s from the latest run manufactured.  </li>
            <li>Quadpacer timer to alert you when it&#x27;s time to change from top teeth to bottom teeth, and from inside to outside areas.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>At first i have to admit, it was intimidating because of how my teeth and gums reacted to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But when you first get the toothbrush, the toothbrush automatically knows that your teeth can&#x27;t quite handle it</li>
            <li>After about the first week, I think I got used to it</li>
            <li>The first time it broke, it slipped and fell into the sink.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that the brush gives you a signal when it&#x27;s time to switch to the next section.  </li>
            <li>Love the extra features..</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips!</li>
            <li>If you pay $140 for something, it has to last more than 4 months.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it tickled a lot</li>
            <li>the brush goes so fast, that any toothpaste just flies off the brush!</li>
            <li>but the short modes make me brush more often between meals.</li>
            <li>Just today (almost exactly a year since I got it)</li>
            <li>And because I am better at brushing my teeth, it has been a lot easier to get disciplined about flossing and mouthwashing properly.</li>
            <li>They do a noticeably better job of cleaning, and are easier than regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I bought this Sonicare over the Oral-B at first based on the number of reviews on the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C</li>
            <li>First one broke within 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush and the various settings, as well as the built in timers.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it for the recommended 2 minutes - don&#x27;t cut that time short.  </li>
            <li>First one broke within 1-2 years.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my teeth feel like I just left the dentist, but without the dentist price!</li>
            <li>I love the different cleaning settings and the sanitizing cycle.  </li>
            <li>so I was hesitant at first</li>
            <li>I had to spend several hours before I was able to do so.  </li>
            <li>We used a Sonicare for 8 years and if the on/off rubber switch hadn&#x27;t finally disintegrated, might have used it for 8 more.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience using an electric toothbrush, so I did not know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the idea of having different options.  </li>
            <li>I think your smile is one of the first things, if not the first thing people will notice when they look at you, so to have that added confidence is very important.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hope this helped;-)</li>
            <li>you see a big differences it helps your teeth to be healthy gums buy it</li>
            <li>I really like the way my teeth have that fresh feeling after using this toothbrush that is like just leaving the dentist office.  </li>
            <li>The brush has a timer for each quadrant (outside diameter of top teeth, inside diameter of top teeth, outside diameter for bottom teeth, and inside diameter for bottom teeth).  </li>
            <li>, most seemed the same, like</li>
            <li>I have not tried the ones that come with the flexCare plus yet, I went with the &#x27;upgrade&#x27; ones for my first try.</li>
            <li>Until it died exactly one year after I bought it.</li>
            <li>After the first use (and all others)</li>
            <li>I love the way it times your brushing and lets you know when to move on to the next quadrant</li>
            <li>I have not used the sanitizer yet although I think that is a pretty neat feature.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon</li>
            <li>however i doubt the reliability of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using electric toothbrush about 4 years ago, first started with Sonicare Crest Intelliclean.</li>
            <li>However, the first one broke the day after we got it.</li>
            <li>REALLY!  </li>
            <li>exactly when</li>
            <li>and this is actually my first Amazon review, ever, despite being a customer for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>First world problems.  </li>
            <li>It is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Only time will tell :)</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It definitely cleans my teeth better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>love the options on the toothbrush and for different types of cleanings.</li>
            <li>On the first use, I was horrified I hadn&#x27;t updated sooner.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>It felt as if my brain would be scrambled at first.</li>
            <li>All their products are stellar but the flexcare plus outdoes anything they have produced before or since.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would have lasted me longer if I just kept the same toothbrush head on until I had to replace it.</li>
            <li>but i use &#x27;gum care&#x27; most of the times which is 3 mins in total.</li>
            <li>Ultimately what matters though is the job the brush does, and let me say it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>so i read as many reviews as possible before spending any money.</li>
            <li>These are all just slightly different speeds and durations but everyone can choose their favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is my first battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sonicare cleans teeth so much better than regular brushing alone.  </li>
            <li>My first Sonicare toothbrush was a more basic model, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Even after the first time using this one my teeth felt that way.  </li>
            <li>and I love having all the different settings and choices of speeds.  </li>
            <li>and I love having all the different settings and choices of speeds.  </li>
            <li>I have used electric toothbrushes before, but this was my first model that utilized \\&quot;sonic</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter, cleaner and feel so much better than with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>It actually tickled my top inside gums to the point i had to move from that area</li>
            <li>Just what they had said in the product description, works exactly what they said.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll bug Philips first, but</li>
            <li>but if you want to take care of your teeth, it is NOT expensive.</li>
            <li>Love the UV feature and the selection of all the different cleaning modes on this model.</li>
            <li>This is my first mechanical toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have owned these sonicare brushes since they first came out</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>and I love the various settings.</li>
            <li>This lasted exactly 2.5 years and the battery died.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better performance and longevity from the generic heads at a 1/3 the price.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until yesterday (Oct 20, 2012), the unit made a loud noise and the brush stopped moving.</li>
            <li>have owned this product for a week so far, and it has been light on my gums and feels even cleaner and smoother than the Oral B did.  </li>
            <li>This is my first sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This is the first electric tooth brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>this is the first sonic toothbrush I ever had</li>
            <li>this toothbrush can only make things better</li>
            <li>and it still works like the day I first tried it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I have used an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Even the green bars that show the charge level are pretty bright.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electronic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>What really irks me is that this outfit puts two plug adapters into the box to make it compatible with US outlets!  </li>
            <li>a real winner!</li>
            <li>my first flex care, I would remove the head and sanitize it every night.</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t LOVE it is because of the cost of those replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>For the first time, my dentist didn&#x27;t find any cavities.  </li>
            <li>It did seem to work well at first, but can no longer use.</li>
            <li>Sure enough</li>
            <li>This item was sent to me via Amazon AFTER the first one was stolen on delivery.</li>
            <li>What really surprised me at how hassle free the process was.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this toothbrush, which I use daily.</li>
            <li>It was almost one of the first things we bought together after we got married.</li>
            <li>For $129 dollars plus tax?Even at the $100 plus tax my dentist charged with discount, TOO MUCH!</li>
            <li>the first customer service rep had me do.</li>
            <li>The first two each lasted about 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I found that MANY people have had the same issue.  </li>
            <li>Hope it means a better checkup next time.  </li>
            <li>When I received it, it was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t vibrate the brush head consistently.</li>
            <li>different types of brush styles makes it even better</li>
            <li>Rinsing the brush in hot water still works.</li>
            <li>This is my third replacement--over many years--of my Phillips Sonicare, a product I have been using since it was first introduced.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this last year and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this for my hubby as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li>I love the sanitizing unit and the overall look of the unit.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks and beyond, I&#x27;m glad to say it worked, and my mouth feels terrific.</li>
            <li>really like these toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li>The sanitizer really makes the brushes seem fresh after every use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I just rinse the toothpaste off first.</li>
            <li>but I can say first hand that after owning this for almost a year now I am blown away by the quality, and the technology.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I have bought.</li>
            <li>Besides that, the sonicare is exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I have a similar version, which I love.</li>
            <li>I always put the toothbrush back on the charger and it sits on top of my decorative tissue box.</li>
            <li>I want to have it stand pretty in my bathroom</li>
            <li>only true criticism I have is that the price is definitely steeper than what most people are going to be comfortable paying, and from what I am told these things do NOT have an indefinite shelf life.</li>
            <li>I am sure they will do all they can to help you find a solution if one is possible.</li>
            <li>The different modes are pretty cool, especially the one for people with sensitive teeth like me, and it&#x27;s nice that it comes programmed to start off easy.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it - but could have gotten a double one for less at Costco, but am happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>There are very few products that I can say I actually love, but this is a product I truly love.</li>
            <li>We loved these while they worked, but both my husband&#x27;s and mine died after a year and half!</li>
            <li>There appears to be no distinction between Clean and Refresh, and the directions only indicate that the Clean mode is designed for a two minute brush, while the Refresh is designed for a one minute brush.  </li>
            <li>The gumcare mode is really the main one I use, it combines the 2 minute clean with a 1 minute cycle for your gums.  </li>
            <li>The brush is easier to keep clean and to clean when necessary.  </li>
            <li>Although the cost of replacement heads makes a cheapskate like me less eager to switch out, the heads are very long-lasting nevertheless making it a good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much easier to keep clean than the older sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I got used to it quickly though and the results are so much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>-  two suffered from a defective battery where the unit would never achieve full charge and would need to be recharged after just a day of use, even from new.    </li>
            <li>You will notice how much cleaner your teeth feel right away.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews here and finally decided to buy it after the overwhelming amount of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Plus the sanitizer insures clean brush heads everytime which honestly is the only reason why I initially bought this.</li>
            <li>So simple and nice to know that your brush is clean for the next day.  </li>
            <li>The literature is really sparse on whether a sterile toothbrush has significant health effects, but there is a growing body of research that implicates dental bacteria in a variety of systemic diseases and disorders, so a sterile toothbrush is certainly not a negative.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine though, as it was more a gimmicky feature for me anyway.</li>
            <li>Works very well to clean my teeth that the normal toothbrush won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have peridontal issues when using a manual brush and my first sonicare turned my dental visits around to a completely positive experience.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is an amazing toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is amazing too; you wouldn&#x27;t believe how many germs sit on the average toothbrush left in a bathroom.</li>
            <li>Though my gums got a good report at my last dentist visit they did discover the first cavity I&#x27;ve had in years between two back molars which my dentist asserts could have been prevented by thorough flossing.  </li>
            <li>They fixed all the issues that existed with the original.  </li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll have to buy your own adapter to charge in other countries.    </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice that it has the other options too.</li>
            <li>- They swapped the flat part that prevents the brush from rolling from the top to the bottom with this model.  </li>
            <li>It has a lot of power behind each brush, but that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li>I usually use the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting, but having the timed &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; quick-brush has come in handy several times and the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; setting is nice too.</li>
            <li>It is so intense that it is very very ticklish at first.</li>
            <li>The hard case and additional small-size charger are nice additions for the traveller, though I wish the charger could somehow fit inside the case with my brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but you will never find a toothbrush that leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than this one, and personally I find it hard to put a price tag on excellent hygiene.</li>
            <li>This is much more user friendly than the previous model&#x27;s Clean, Sensitive, and Massage modes paired with the separate routines of Go Care and Max Care.  </li>
            <li>After a quick troubleshooting they took my address and mailed me out a new handle.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my new one and really feel like I had a clean mouth and teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Successfully meeting my 2 requirements for being happy with my new tooth brush, the Sonicare went above and beyond when it comes to the actual brushing.</li>
            <li>I really like this new toothbrush and its different options, plus the sanitizer is a nice add on.  </li>
            <li>So far they have been very helpful and even sent free brush heads to make up for some mis-information they gave me about the rebate forms.  </li>
            <li>All of these options have an amazing slight pause every 30 seconds, that you use to make sure you are spending equal time in each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare has five modes: Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive and Massage.   </li>
            <li>and wow does it clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go as far as saying I feel \\&quot;dentist\\&quot; clean after using this thing</li>
            <li>So far I have used the Clean and Gum Modes and the quadpacer has does its job well.</li>
            <li>There are five modes to choose from:  Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage.  </li>
            <li>old Sonicare was a pain to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>brushing modes - clean, gum care, refresh, sensitive and massage.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Plus are Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage.  </li>
            <li>So now, the UV sanitizer is history and I clean it the old school way.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel extremely clean after each session as if I just had them professionally done.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean after using both the sensitive and massage options-</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but would be nice to not have to consciously avoid parts of my toothbrush every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips, work on that for the next model please. :)</li>
            <li>I also really like the sanitizer as it provides an extra level of protection against most germs on my brush head.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of cavities as a kid (as I&#x27;m sure you can imagine), and now that I&#x27;m an adult, those old fillings have started to go.</li>
            <li>And she is definitely not enamored with my gripping the whole brush to pull it off.  </li>
            <li>So I upgraded to the elite which I loved but after several years the battery finally gave out.</li>
            <li>FAR better than my old Oral B.</li>
            <li>I really feel something of this price should last more than 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>Possibly it was superior to the current models.</li>
            <li>This is a well-made brush - my mom got a more basic model to replace hers and it seems much cheaper and plasticy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple other Sonicare toothbrushes in the past (the kind that unscrew into 2 pieces &amp; expose the vibrating magnets) &amp; have always loved Sonicare.</li>
            <li>worth their high price.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money, and it came highly recommended from my dentist.</li>
            <li>So that you can choose from five different settings from massage to clean!</li>
            <li>By the way, even with less powerful stokes, felxcare plus is still a very good toothbrush compare to others, It just not up to the standard set by my 4-years old flexcare, That&#x27;s why I gave it a 3-stars.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and has several other (four more, I think) settings for additional mouth care...especially like the refresher one which gives you a quick one-minute go-over.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for a little more than a week, and so far love it.  </li>
            <li>Also, it has several settings and it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>We bought this toothbrush looking at all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews made me choose this brand and model over competitors.</li>
            <li>I pretty much use Clean,GumCare,and Massage.  </li>
            <li>Yes, you can actually feel your teeth becoming cleaner while it works.</li>
            <li>Although the brush itself continues to function, the built-in UV sanitizing port (which sanitizes the brush head in a ten minute light cycle), started acting erratically after three weeks, requiring you to push the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button repeatedly - sometimes more than seven or eight times - and now, this morning, has quit altogether.  </li>
            <li>First let me begin by telling you that I did not care much about brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>It is much lighter weight and easier to handle than the old one I had and seems to have somewhat better brushing action.</li>
            <li>I have had it about 3 weeks and also needed to take it on a trip and was pleased at how long the charge lasts.  </li>
            <li>There was no way I could brush as fast and consistently as that lil guy did.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product so far, I especially like the timer, for changing to the different areas in your mouth</li>
            <li>the other hand, it does as good a job cleaning the teeth as the old model we wore out.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums so every time I brush, the sink is full of blood.  </li>
            <li>I have loved the experience since I bought the brush a few months ago!</li>
            <li>you can afford it by all means go for this one as it is far and away superior to any other electric toothbrush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Since the first time using this Sonicare brush, my teeth finally feel clean -- and definitely look and feel better.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this and have already recommended to a friend who compared it to his older Sonicare which was hard to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>There are many settings to use, typically I&#x27;ll use the normal or normal with gum massage cycles, but sometimes I&#x27;ll do a quick clean cycle just to freshen up.</li>
            <li>I was WRONG great \\&quot;tool\\&quot; to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I had to get rid of my first sonicare, which was fine for a couple of years, then the motor would simply stop.</li>
            <li>This thing took a little while to get used to, but with all the settings on it, I was able to gradually work up to the full \\&quot;clean\\&quot;</li>
            <li>these new toothbrushes do not hold up as well as the older ones which last forever, although they do vibrate faster and more powerful at the beginning.</li>
            <li>one problem I had with the older model was that when you selected what function you wanted - sensitive, regular or quick brush - you couldn&#x27;t tell for sure that you had selected correctly.  </li>
            <li>I am one hundred and ten percent satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I loved the &#x27;sonic&#x27; vibration, and I had very few dental problems.  </li>
            <li>, travel case is pretty hard so thats good.     </li>
            <li>Just one month after using this, the person I gave this gift to went to the dentist and the hygienist commented about the amazing condition of his gums based on previous visits - he \\&quot;must be flossing\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This one has multiple settings and a sanitizing feature which works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>First, it is one of the newest models (they have the UV light for cleaning) and second</li>
            <li>so I bought one for my wife, who is very particular, and she loves it as well.  </li>
            <li>arrived so quickly also, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips did a nice job of simplifying the mode selection over the previous FlexCare model.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush is easy to use and multiple settings allow u to customize brush mode to needed cleaning level.  </li>
            <li>We love the brush cover with the UV light - no more fecal matter from flushed toilets onto my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is easy enough to do.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine spending this kind of money on an appliance and have it work for less than 60 days.  </li>
            <li>it is way too easy to accidentally touch the on-off switch or the settings and either turn off the brush or move into a different level of cleaning.</li>
            <li>just dry off the bristles on a towel, nothing more is needed.</li>
            <li>as i read in customer reviews by previous sonicare owners the toothbrush lasts about 5 years and its nice</li>
            <li>In all cases, the motor is very quiet and the slim handle is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is easy to use and keeps your brush heads lasting longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never be able to go back to a normal toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is worth it in the long run, however, since your dental health is important.</li>
            <li>28 April 2013 - i am about to order this same product for my mother, and thought i would update again to say this toothbrush is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Brush gives great action to clean teeth including behind teeth.</li>
            <li>If anyone reads both parts of my review, my father still has the same tooth brush and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>5 years later, and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Certainly you get more brushes from a single charge, so you can take the brush traveling without worrying about having to recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From a pure cleaning functionality perspective....</li>
            <li>Perhaps offering a unit without the UV Sanitizer could lower the pricesome, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect a large difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t keep the dock in my bathroom, as it&#x27;s quite large.  </li>
            <li>Large range of levels of intensity.</li>
            <li>This kit is certainly designed to be shared between cohabitants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the unit is slightly loud, but not to the point where you&#x27;ll wake up your whole family, just a normal whirling sound.    </li>
            <li>My wife and I had many problems with a prior model with bleeding gums, etc. - even with new bristles.</li>
            <li>Customer service has been great, but this will be my third handle in less than 2 years.</li>
            <li>The good changes are noticeable: teeth are less sensitive, stronger, cleaner.</li>
            <li>Also, something to note is that the amount of time you brush is very important and you cannot compensate with a harder bristled brush.</li>
            <li>New one is really nice, works well and especially like the built in head clear.</li>
            <li>My new one is even better than the first one and it pays off in the long run.</li>
            <li>There are 5 different settings which work just fine.  </li>
            <li>Purchased originally in August 2012, had the first problem in April 2013 (got a replacement handle from Sonicare), and now having the same problem again.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be just fine, so that is not too big of a deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am interested to know if anyone has found other better electronic tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>It would be great if the door could pop open after the sanitizing was done to allow the brushes to dry naturally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always been the pricier way to dental hygiene, but now the consumer is getting  inferior manufacturing and half the size of the original product,and still paying the original higher cost.</li>
            <li>I did just fine without one for the last 4 decades.</li>
            <li>I love having multiple settings for different functions- including the quick setting if I&#x27;m in a hurry or on the go.</li>
            <li>The first was an older type I used for about 2 years, but they discontinued it and no longer made the replacement heads</li>
            <li>and my gums were very high,</li>
            <li>The look and feel of this tooth brush is very high tech and sleek.</li>
            <li>It has very high cleansing power.</li>
            <li>In any case, Philips has taken a very high quality product and, frankly, ruined it.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality.  </li>
            <li>feel the price is too high and probably limiting access to more people; it was one of the main objections to me purchasing it earlier.</li>
            <li>The travel case is nice, although it&#x27;s a little bulkier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Not too convinced with the UV de-sanitizer but the handle and brush quality is pretty high.</li>
            <li>This toothcare was considered a higher end electric toothbrush, and came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Expensive but very good</li>
            <li>The new version is no where near the quality of the original Sonicare and that is a shame.  </li>
            <li>How many times have you brushed your teeth during an illness &amp; wondered if you were simply re-infecting yourself with whatever bug laid you up in the first place?!  </li>
            <li>and I can already tell a HUGE difference in my gum health, and several people have remarked that my teeth seem whiter.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in how I brush my teeth different and it takes no time at all.  </li>
            <li>Also really like the convenience of removing the head section and cleaning with the ultraviolet compartment.</li>
            <li>And although it&#x27;s not THAT intense of a feeling, it&#x27;s as close as you&#x27;re going to get at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush heads can be bought for a reasonable price in packs on</li>
            <li>sanitizer works very well</li>
            <li>On the whole, however, this toothbrush delivers as advertised.     </li>
            <li>Also, if you open the door at any time during the cleaning, the UV light will immediately shut off (tried it).  </li>
            <li>I have no way of really knowing if it is working or not, but it appears to be doing its job.  </li>
            <li>When turned on you see a light illuminate from inside and omit this blue glow.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle but thorough cleaning each time I use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what I was in for.</li>
            <li>been usin nw for about a month, i thought it was reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>(last time it was a cheap knock off).    </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have read too much advertisement.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>I am really offended  </li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>no matter how much I cleaned it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li>You really do need 3 minutes to brush every area well....</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t brush your teeth and you need to spend this much money in order to motivate yourself, then I guess it&#x27;s a start.</li>
            <li>so that your gums and teeth get used to it, I like the different options available and the fact that it has a built in sterilizer and travel charger.  </li>
            <li>the bottom of the toothbrush will give your toothbrush a really funky odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the bottom of the toothbrush will give your toothbrush a really funky odor.    </li>
            <li>I use it along with my wife, with separate brush heads, and the process is very manageable.    </li>
            <li>Both seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for their business.   </li>
            <li>After two weeks of use, my teeth were whiter and my mouth felt much cleaner.</li>
            <li>and this happens very often to</li>
            <li>Gets teeth much cleaner than manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It really changed me</li>
            <li>and I never use a manual toothbrush anymore unless I absolutely have to and without my sonicare.</li>
            <li>With all the modes possible, you are free to choose one variation to suit your mood at use time.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t anything I would disparage about the Flexcare Plus.</li>
            <li>all without too much thought.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I spent the money to get it.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me, and I highly recommend it to anyone out there who&#x27;s considering it!</li>
            <li>Amazon wants me to write twenty words to qualify for a review</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price for the money, much cheaper than those at retail stores that I looked at.  </li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but I felt it was important enough....</li>
            <li>I can tell a difference in my gums already and it REALLY cleans my teeth.    </li>
            <li>My teeth were whiter and my mouth felt much cleaner.</li>
            <li>Something internally broke, makes buzzing/rattling sound and does not vibrate anymore as it should.</li>
            <li>Well, we have no way to tell, really.</li>
            <li>It really seems to get my teeth the very cleanest.</li>
            <li>It leaves you with a \\&quot;straight from the dentist\\&quot; feeling each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>I never though I would spend this much money on a toothbrush, but I splurged on it and now I&#x27;m recommending this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t sell just the handle, so I&#x27;d have to go buy the whole kit again.</li>
            <li>I really like the features.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the light bulb didn&#x27;t work and a replacement was to be sent within ten days.  </li>
            <li>There really aren&#x27;t any.  </li>
            <li>But since using this toothbrush, my teeth feel so much cleaner, even at the end of the day</li>
            <li>You can really feel the difference after brushing.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had accicently bumped the stand (gently).  </li>
            <li>Thanks Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to pay over $100 for a TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li>She showed me the power the Sonicare has and stated it would really help me with the inflammation of my gums.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an electric toothbrush I would highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>Only con is the toothbrush came with a warranty card that lists a website where u can register your product and get an extended warranty for free</li>
            <li>Dentists recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>I just want to mention that, straight out of the box, the UV bulb didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Our dentist recommended it, and I was reluctant to spend so much money on a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The ultrasonic vibration really massages the gums really well.</li>
            <li>Both of these products are available on-line with a 20% discount (shipping included), a total savings of around $46!!   </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans very well&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The carrying case and portable charger are very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This one has to be pulled straight off, and I feel like I am going to break it.    </li>
            <li>I can really feel as my teeth are cleaner.</li>
            <li>I decided to go for this model because it wasn&#x27;t the highest model, yet it still had all the features I really needed.</li>
            <li>This thing really humms.</li>
            <li>This takes some getting used to, and a light touch is key.    </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it, especially considering how important it is to take care of your teeth.</li>
            <li>My hygentist really wanted me to get this model.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it really does.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Who wants a germy brush head</li>
            <li>This really works</li>
            <li>With the enclosure for the brush heads, they are not only protected from this, but they may also be sanitized by the UV light that comes with the unit.  </li>
            <li>and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li>But the whole thing was a comedy of errors.</li>
            <li>The whole rigmarole took 4 months.</li>
            <li>Very ergometric;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I solved both of these issues with this Sonicare, and much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gum issues and this is so gentle but thorough.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but we decided to get this model and then the whole family would use it.</li>
            <li>But now after a couple weeks of twice a day use, I can really see and feel the difference it has been making.</li>
            <li>You want to buy this brush, for real.  </li>
            <li>do you know how much you pay for filling, caps, dentures, etc.</li>
            <li>Have had this toothbrush for a month and really like it.  </li>
            <li>He really didn&#x27;t even want to try it, but I insisted that he give it a week.  </li>
            <li>, it went very well.  </li>
            <li>per my dentist my gums,plaque and everything are so much improved  </li>
            <li>But the quality of the battery is really bad.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The quadrant timer is also very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very</li>
            <li>I really like that it hesitates</li>
            <li>Really?)</li>
            <li>The price has really gone</li>
            <li>Very well calculated.</li>
            <li>It has a very tolerant rechargeable battery that will forgive you for neglecting or compulsively overcharging it.</li>
            <li>the UV light keeps you from re giving it back to yourself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also includes a sanitizer feature, which I really like.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used the sanitizer thing so much.  </li>
            <li>I had this product for two years and it worked reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>Yellow charge light flashes and the brush is now a deadweight.  </li>
            <li>Ultra violet light is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>the enamel on my teeth is harder and my gums are much better.  </li>
            <li>everything is solid, parts fit together well, and the materials are sturdy.    </li>
            <li>I went in to get a dentist checkup, and my teeth were reasonably O.K.</li>
            <li>The reason I&#x27;m really writing this review is because my toothbrush started turning on and off sporadically this week.  </li>
            <li>The Plus model has a sleeker appearance with the various speeds not showing until you press the \\&quot;mode\\&quot; button to light up the choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the toothbrush, because when we don&#x27;t use Sonicare, the dentists notice.  </li>
            <li>I thought with the way this brush moves so fast that it would cause bleeding too</li>
            <li>I can say now that I have healthy pink gums that no longer bleed when I floss or brush.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant about spending so much for a toothbrush</li>
            <li>Aside: I do the same with my Brita faucet filter because the LED light is flaky.    </li>
            <li>Really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is much like the one we owned before.</li>
            <li>This really works well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this month ago and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Teeth and gums feel much healthier and need for flossing is reduced.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to leave my teeth much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel that much cleaner</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling this</li>
            <li>do i really need this ultraviolet device that disinfecting brush?</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the timed alerts that tell you after 30 seconds have passed when you are brushing your teeth so that you can move to a different section of your mouth to brush.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my teeth are much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li>This unit has spent most of its life in the box.</li>
            <li>I really have a use for them now with my $150 toothbrush paperweight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried regular toothbrushes of course &amp; those cheap electric rotary toothbrushes that pretend to be sonic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After much research I decided to get this one.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy brush heads almost every 6 month because they get worn out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>After using &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode for more than a year I get a gum recession and had to switch to a &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; mode and be careful around those areas.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>The timer is very helpful, and I really do find myself with a cleaner mouth (or so I feel it).  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>thanks mom &amp; dad) but</li>
            <li>I automatically bought the whole family sonicare toothbrushes</li>
            <li>The unit worked as advertized and was,in fact, better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The customer service was really polite on the phone, I got an email response confirming they had received my receipt within 5 minutes of me emailing it to them</li>
            <li>This unit has a pulsing blue light when the sanitizer is on which can light up an entire room at night.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well until now.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is absolutely fantastic and definitely goes along with the mission of encouraging people to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely spend the extra $10 to get a US model and hassle free packaging.  </li>
            <li>I could never bring myself to spend so much on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel much cleaner than manual</li>
            <li>Real customer service glitch.</li>
            <li>But once you get used to it, there really isn&#x27;t anything better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I got used to the brush, the cleaning mode was absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care about any of the &#x27;modes&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this toothbrush takes care of all areas in my mouth without much effort.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll probably get a much cheaper, disposable model.</li>
            <li>We contacted the Phillips customer service and they walked us through the tier one fixes; check the bulb, check the switch - the whole deal, and nothing helped.  </li>
            <li>weeks later, we called again - no product available, but it would be in and shipped ...</li>
            <li>I really like how it cleans itself.</li>
            <li>Really like this tooth brush and the sanitizer feature is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>It has really improved my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much, much cleaner than they were when I used a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Philips needs to work on the internal quality of their brushes and stop being so cheap about it.</li>
            <li>But when the time comes I do replace it, because when it woks it works really well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I also really like the sanitizer function for the heads.</li>
            <li>Our teeth really did feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The brushes were reasonable then as well.</li>
            <li>The different options might light up or not, the unit may or may not come on.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really need.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Sonic toothbrush is all it is advertised to be and confirmed by numerous professionals reviews who advised that \\&quot;if</li>
            <li>and she is very picky about her teeth</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone for all the info.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on a quality product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much cleaner my mouth is since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>I use it over my whole mouth and tongue after I brush my teeth with it-</li>
            <li>I paid a packet for this on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and I really regret it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really neat.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s supposed to be fully charged at the third light.  </li>
            <li>It really reduces gum problems as claimed and tooth decay.</li>
            <li>I like the portability as I travel and the case is very well designed.</li>
            <li>This is a much advanced product with several additional settings.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have not felt so smooth since my last dentist appt.</li>
            <li>Very cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can reach the rear molars really well</li>
            <li>The in-built timer is a real help to allow you to focus upon each quadrant in turn.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>The whole \\&quot;germs\\&quot; thing...</li>
            <li>it is very efficient for tooth brushing.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it has been a good decision as this brush shouldn&#x27;t need the constant cleaning of the old one</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is easy to use, though I am mainly interested in the cleaning and massage effects, and not particularly in the &#x27; refresh &#x27; aspect ?</li>
            <li>For $30, the replacement brushes are the big catch here, kind of the same rip off as overpriced ink for computer printers.</li>
            <li>I liked it when it worked, but for the initial purchase price, plus the cost of brush replacements I&#x27;m going to look elsewhere for my next brush.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a big deal unless you&#x27;ll be traveling for more than two weeks, but I do frequently go on extended trips, and I&#x27;d rather have a case that holds everything I need.</li>
            <li>The textured bristles along with the 31,000 vibrations per minute not only remove plaque on the surface of the teeth, but effectively penetrate several millimeters below the gumline to break up plaque and kill bacteria.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I have have shared this brush but using our own brush heads for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t use the various functions even though I got this because my dentist said my gums were beginning to recede, and I also had a cavity at the same appointment.  </li>
            <li>That feature may be disabled, but I find it most useful.  </li>
            <li>I slowly went up to a cheap Oral B electric toothbrush, and it seemed to do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Bought this unit thinking it would be good as I have used sonic tooth brush for over 10 years now.&lt;br /&gt;This was the most disappointing product I purchase from Philips.</li>
            <li>It is fairly quiet and my husband seems to love it so far.</li>
            <li>I like the new Phillips Sonicare FlexCare Plus very much.  </li>
            <li>only problem I encounter is the brush head must fit on the handle in a certain direction -- you have to fit it on a rod, which is flat on one side.  </li>
            <li>I share this with my girlfriend, so we each have our own brush heads, and having the closed stand right next to it</li>
            <li>This one works great, plain and simple.</li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is nice too, just a little extra security for a clean mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleaning features are ok and pretty typical but the bells and whistles are bogus.  </li>
            <li>It tickled at first on my upper inside gums, but you quickly get used to it</li>
            <li>They are alittle pricey, but I do notice the difference when Iam using a new brush head, or closer to when I first have changed it, to when it&#x27;s closer to the 3 month</li>
            <li>First, they sent me a new toothbrush replacement.</li>
            <li>With the way the unit holds a charge, it can be easily taken on a long weekend trip without having to recharge.  </li>
            <li>I used an older sonicare model for a few years prior to purchasing this one, and it was great too.  </li>
            <li>This one works good like the others but will last longer cause spit/water won&#x27;t get inside it like the other models.    </li>
            <li>for the past three years, and even though that product is still available, for a slight price increase, the FlexCare Plus adds incremental improvements to what was already a very nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Wish they can very more and better color selections, for example, red, yellow, and green.</li>
            <li>After being told I was out of warranty and the unit was junk, I took it apart to confirm that yes, the main piece inside had separated and is made of cheap Chinese components.</li>
            <li>Significant advancement over prior products in this line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen this for $190 on many other sites</li>
            <li>The Sonicare flexcare cleans better than any other model that I have used before.</li>
            <li>I have used the original Sonicare toothbrush for about 6 years until I noticed my dentist had this model sitting in his office at my last check up</li>
            <li>and they sent me out a replacement charger/sanitizer with prepaid shipping to send the original charger/sanitizer back to them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with this model with the UV sanitizer and all of the other accessories.</li>
            <li>However, I had to purchase this newer one because my other battery eventually died, so hopefully this one will have a longer shelf-life, even if that means more charges in-between.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I had to purchase this newer one because my other battery eventually died, so hopefully this one will have a longer shelf-life, even if that means more charges in-between.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush is so much better than the Sonicare Elite (and all other E Series) model.</li>
            <li>Apparently, many other people have found this problem too.</li>
            <li>My original Sonicare unit, not made by Philips, finally died.  </li>
            <li>and I think I replaced it only because I was excited about the newer models, not because it died...</li>
            <li>There may be other products that are better</li>
            <li>WHITENS AND CLEANS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER WE HAVE PURCHASED.</li>
            <li>We have tried many other styles and brands.  </li>
            <li>did the same experiment on the original toothbrush....</li>
            <li>I believe you might get better battery life using some of the other modes the brush possesses, so Phillipsis not misleading anyone with battery life claims.</li>
            <li>battery lasts longer than the other model I had, love the added travel case and charger.</li>
            <li>have since switched to the Philips Easy Clean (the last one lasted almost twice as long as this one).</li>
            <li>The old OralB did a good job, no doubt, but my recent FlexCare+ experience makes me wonder why did I wait for so long before switching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li>when I got the flexcare plus, right at first try, I felt the difference, the plus is less powerful and  didn&#x27;t clean my teeth properly, I though my feeling is fooling me (the plus is much quieter than my 4 years old flexcare) , I did a water test, I put both toothbrushes into  a pot of water, both full charged, turn them on, see how water splashes.    </li>
            <li>I am sure that the money that I spend purchasing these for my children will be well spent as I am sure that when I take them to the dentist, the savings will really show by way of less cavities.</li>
            <li>The booklet gives you an example of how to clean your teeth using different quadrants, but however you decide to do it, the whole idea is to use 4 30-second quadrants to clean your entire mouth in a 2 minute period.  </li>
            <li>A couple months in I could feel the tip where the brush attaches becoming loose.</li>
            <li>Confirmed with current owners and found that this product really does live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>They are sending me a new handle and a prepaid box to sent my old one back, for free!</li>
            <li>When I tried to brush with a regular toothbrush, I didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>It actually does give you that after the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel clean the entire day.  </li>
            <li>Most people write reviews after the first few months of having a product.</li>
            <li>toothbrush actually shoots water/(spit, too?)/toothpaste in between your teeth instead of just spinning to clean the surface.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is accidentally changing the setting from clean to another of the settings-</li>
            <li>In fact, one time the dentist asked if I had just had my teeth clean recently, but I had not since my checkup about a year before.  </li>
            <li>Clean\\&quot; cycle is a much cleaner feel than the older sonic technology.</li>
            <li>which is why i ultimately settled on this model, newest and no nooks &amp; crannies to clean).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having just used a regular brush all my life, I was amazed at the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;options&amp;#34;  like clean, gum care, etc.</li>
            <li>different heads (diamond clean)</li>
            <li>We upgraded from an older Sonicare system and really like the increased power and longer battery life of this model.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My teeth feel extra clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush stays clean enough, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The different modes on the toothbrush (clean, gum care, refresh, massage...</li>
            <li>It works very well, is comfortable to use, and has a timer to help me keep track of how long to brush.</li>
            <li>Only the &#x27;Clean&#x27; setting.  </li>
            <li>I have never felt such a clean after using this product.</li>
            <li>For the actual toothbrush I would give it 5 stars for ease of use, features, and ability to clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels extra clean after using this</li>
            <li>I have personally noticed how clean my teeth get.  </li>
            <li>Gum Care is actually an extended Clean.  </li>
            <li>Gum Care is actually an extended Clean.  </li>
            <li>But getting older I decided to really kick it up a notch and went for the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned multiple electric toothbrushes over the years, and I&#x27;ve had problems keeping them clean.</li>
            <li>if this brush worked only as well as a competitor, I would pick it for its ease of keeping clean.</li>
            <li>I still use a regular toothbrush to clean my tongue, but the sonicare can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I do like the capability of sanitizing the brushes and I definitely see a difference with the color of my teeth and the clean feeling after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wear good (or dark colored) clothes while using this thing:  Since the mouth has to be open while using the device (to keep it properely positioned and to avoid having teeth shattered -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted that I haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist yet since getting it, I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I will try to remember to come back and report if there is any positive changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy for water to be trapped under the UV sanitizer door which leads to mold growing in there.</li>
            <li>While I was spitting and rinsing after brushing the 2nd time with the Sonicare, I was surprised at how many food particles that my old brush missed!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to share a single handset and</li>
            <li>brush itself works great of course, and my mouth has never felt as clean as it has these past few days since I got it.  </li>
            <li>Usually I would have stains again 5 months later but my teeth are still nice and clean.</li>
            <li>rarely leave product reviews, but had to for this particular one so others are aware of the lack of quality within this Philips product - and potentially all Sonicare products .</li>
            <li>: If you decide to purchase a new Sonicare toothbrush, to help offset some of the cost, I can offer you 15% off your total Sonicare purchase along with free shipping at our Philps online store.   </li>
            <li>stopped working after 6 months, but it honestly makes very little sense anyway.</li>
            <li>A new habit seems to be developing between us: when either finishes brushing in the morning or before bed, we have been returning our brush to the sanitizer and installing the appropriate brush head for the other so that it is ready for immediate use.</li>
            <li>The blue light is fairly bright and much larger than the green battery indicator on the main brushing unit.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money, my dentist visits are always quick and never much plaque.    </li>
            <li>This brush is gentle enough to where my gums don&#x27;t bleed but are adequately cleaned.</li>
            <li>As a quick replacement I got a battery operated Sonicare which also worked well, but I saw this one on line and thought I would really like it because of the choice of settings, especially the gum care.</li>
            <li>Insructions easy; the pause system that tells u when u have spent enough time on a section of your teeth makes this so user friendly.</li>
            <li>The battery life before recharging is long and it is comfortable   to use it.</li>
            <li>It is a UV light, that I just read not too long ago, contains mercury.</li>
            <li>I was completely sold on this brush within the first couple days.  </li>
            <li>The infrared brush cleaner is also cool especially if you are a germ-a-fobic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another really cool thing about this brush is that it comes with 2 different chargers!</li>
            <li>After one full week, no one call me back</li>
            <li>I was told to contact the manufacturer when I first purchased it because it immediately developed problems.</li>
            <li>Although I liked it initially, after an unacceptablly short amount of time, it started making an unusually loud noise and</li>
            <li>but I usually end up ignoring that and doing my own thing.  </li>
            <li>It has a 30 second timer for each section of your teeth for a full two minutes of cleaning.</li>
            <li>The push button \\&quot;switch\\&quot; only worked intermittently and would not stay on for a full sanitizing cycle, let alone a recharge.  </li>
            <li>[For full disclosure, I am actually evaluating the \\&quot;PROFESSIONAL\\&quot; HX6992/10, obtained from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>This has been true of the last 3 Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>The second model did stop working (gradually got weaker and weaker until it wasn&#x27;t really doing much more than a regular toothbrush)</li>
            <li>Have really liked using sonicare toothbrush in the past.  </li>
            <li>There are improvements in all areas compared to the previous FlexCare model, from the better cleaning modes, to the nice plastic travel case, the improved battery life that lasts twice as long as the old model, and the slightly quieter sound during its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Sonicare can hold a charge for much longer than the Oral-B.     The UV lamp was a big selling point for me at first, but after I bought it, I thought it was overkill, and probably not necessary as I have been doing fine for over a quarter of a century without a germicidal lamp for my toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li>but I like the Sonicare better overall for the sound and the clean feeling it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>The sensitive mode is okay, even though I consider myself to have sensitive teeth, I didn&#x27;t find it necessary to use that particular mode.</li>
            <li>I sent it off to get it fixed, and it came back just fine.</li>
            <li>I had to press it down it in its support for a better contact</li>
            <li>But the Philips customer service is outstanding, so should anything happen down the road</li>
            <li>They were very kind and helpful and allowed that they would ship a new unit along with a return shipping label (for the broken unit) immediately.  </li>
            <li>It tickles the inside of my mouth a little, but not so much that I fall on the ground laughing and can&#x27;t finish brushing :)</li>
            <li>In addition, you will save mega-bucks on the original system purchase, and the replacement brushes are cheaper than the new &#x27;tiny&#x27; heads.  </li>
            <li>In addition, you will save mega-bucks on the original system purchase, and the replacement brushes are cheaper than the new &#x27;tiny&#x27; heads.  </li>
            <li>Decided it was time to treat the teeth to a new experience!  </li>
            <li>In 11/2013, I purchased a new handle (here on Amazon- yay!)</li>
            <li>This new brush is thinner, lighter and has nowhere for the wetness from brushing to accumulate!</li>
            <li>TO BRUSH MY TEETH WITH MY NEW PHILLIPS SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH!</li>
            <li>I sometime feel like brushing a little longer just to make sure each tooth got clean enough.</li>
            <li>The brush heads come in 2 sizes, small and large, and one of each is included in the package, and I use the large ones and have still never had any issue with them fitting in the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I opted this time to just buy a whole new one.</li>
            <li>Oh, and thanks for recommending that I spend another 20 bucks on new brush heads to try to correct the issue.</li>
            <li>It brings in a whole new dimension to brushing your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She has told me how much she likes her new Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I live alone and gently use this product without any form of abuse</li>
            <li>than as noted above; probably a useful device to keep teeth extra clean, and a neat toy.</li>
            <li>My previous Oral B lasted more than 8 years.</li>
            <li>I could have two of them with more attachments for less money at Costco, than I what I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The magnet keeping the door close is better than the latch of the previous model also.</li>
            <li>how much better it is than my previous</li>
            <li>I previously used the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush, and like many reviewers, I had a problem with buildup at the bottom of the brush head.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads for this latest model are also a lot cheaper than with their previous models.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a top of the line Sonicare toothbrush at $50 less than retail.</li>
            <li>Be sure to purchase extra brushes if you want same size for two people.</li>
            <li>As for differences between this and the elite, the main difference I&#x27;ve noticed is the difference in use options,</li>
            <li>You should buy Sonicare only if you are satisfied with it lasting 2 years.</li>
            <li>Not all Sonicare toothbrushes have a UV sanitizer, so this would be the main reason for me to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;DIFFERENCES with older HX6930 MODEL&lt;</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer comes with this Kit, and while I can not vouch for the scientific benefits of such a devices, the blue light comes on every night, and it at least makes me feel more comfortable</li>
            <li>This Sonicare FlexCare Plus is replacing an older model from 14 years ago.</li>
            <li>The main thing that scares me is removing and replacing the brush heads after each use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be lucky if the replacement handle will last me a year.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and all the different settings especially the timer</li>
            <li>Yes, you may get the same, or even more vibrations per second...</li>
            <li>so I quickly turned the timer back on.  </li>
            <li>this is the 3rd Phillips I have owned and all have been key to keepin my gums and teeth healthy.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and buy the more basic model - unless you simply have to have the UV disinfection.</li>
            <li>The current modes only run for a top time of 3 minutes which doubles for anybody with braces.</li>
            <li>I can already notice an improvement in my teeth compared to my older oral-b.</li>
            <li>So many people have had the same problem as me: their toothbrush dying after 2 years, just outside the warranty.</li>
            <li>Then I looked up the reviews, and saw many people talking about the same or similar problems.    </li>
            <li>I particularly like the sanitizing bay.</li>
            <li>May. So, my main issue is not with Amazon; they did their  job in getting me the Sonicare FlexCare Pus in two days.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from an older sonicare model.  </li>
            <li>The main takeaway:</li>
            <li>I wish I had stayed with the older screw on brush model</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll get use to it (mainly because of how it vibrates</li>
            <li>The battery life of this toothbrush is a lot longer than the older toothbrush models, which is a plus if you are traveling or don&#x27;t want the hassle of always having to charge your toothbrush.     </li>
            <li>I do like the gum care setting as well as the \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; setting for a quick brush in between regular brushings.</li>
            <li>I had an Braun that was older than I want to admit.  </li>
            <li>Simple to use, more options than probably necessary, it is a toothbrush not a car.</li>
            <li>and I did a lot of research before purchasing this particular model.  </li>
            <li>For a couple of years before purchasing this toothbrush, I had an older generation Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush</li>
            <li>The Flexcare+, however, suffers from manufacturing defects that seems to give each toothbrush an effective shelf life of at most 4-5 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the same thing happen with so many manual toothbrushes that I don&#x27;t even look at the blue colored section of my ProResults brush and rely on a calendar.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that a tooth brush could make such a difference, but thing thing is in a word AWESOME.</li>
            <li>I had been using an older model for three years and it was time to upgrade.</li>
            <li>It vibrates the brush head quickly and pressing gently against the teeth at the gumline makes for a slightly sensitive strange experience at first.  </li>
            <li>We really enjoyed it but after only two weeks it simply stopped.  </li>
            <li>love the different settings, especially the gum cleaning setting.  </li>
            <li>Once I had a sonicare toothbrush I cannot go back to a regular toohbrush also since my dentist has seen better results since using.  </li>
            <li>There is a newer Sonicare Toothbrush available (The DiamondClean) and it is possible they fixed the issue in that model.</li>
            <li>It appears that the main difference between the units is about $57.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It cleans much better than a standard toothbrush, my mouth actually feels refreshed.</li>
            <li>Still holds a decent charge and the sterilizer still works.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product to replace an older Sonicare toothbrush...</li>
            <li>I purchased the Sonicare HX9672 to replace an older model Sonicare toothbrush that seemed to be a favorable home for mold where the brush head connected to the handle.  </li>
            <li>Never realized my older toothbrush wasso  inferior until using the Sonicare Flex Care Plus.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the older models it just doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am horrible when it comes to brushing my teeth for more than 20 seconds, this toothbrush vibrates through each phase of brushing, which is awesome and makes me brush longer.  </li>
            <li>The brush is noticeably gentler on my teeth and gums and my gums in particular look a lot healthier now.</li>
            <li>I replaced my older model with the flexcare because Costco was not always carrying the older brush heads.  </li>
            <li>It lost power after a year, but customer service is so good that after a few minutes of resetting the device, they simply replaced the defective brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What upsets me is that the newer models are of a lower quality compared to the older Philips models.</li>
            <li>main reason we purchased this unit was because of the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>(i was searching for it online and called amazon to no avail, but luckily found it in my browser history) for those buyers who purchased one before August 12th and September 2nd, 2012, with the rebate deadline being September 17th, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I went with this particular model because of the attached stand that held brushes.</li>
            <li>I always considered myself someone with pretty good oral hygiene - brushed (with a regular toothbrush) twice a day, floss every other day.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering how it cleans, it&#x27;s pretty much a vibrating toothbrush that you go back and forth at a angle towards your teeth (with some pressure applied for maximum clean) at a forward and back motion.</li>
            <li>The technology has come a long way since i purchased my original brush 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>it was nice to have the low power mode where it slowly ramps up to full power over time, to get you used to the feel of an ultra-sonic toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>The 30-second reminders are also a good addition, makes it much easier to time your brushing, although I&#x27;m not sure why they only work with the outside/inside of the teeth, and consider the \\&quot;bite edge\\&quot; of the molars as something to be done afterwards?  </li>
            <li>I previously used the cheap Crest Spin brush consistently.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is far more powerful than my preceding one and the narrow head lets me clean harder to get at areas.  </li>
            <li>I love that there is a sensitive stage for my teeth, and it&#x27;s no big deal for my husband or me to change it back to regular clean or vice-versa.</li>
            <li>If you have the older FlexCare model, I would wait until it is time to replace your old one before upgrading as the differences, while improvements, are not substantial.some, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect a large difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;SO, I go to my dentist, they give me a free Oral-B Professional Care 5000 toothbrush, I give away my Sonicare because I need the money, and here I am 3 months later, waiting for my new Sonicare to come in the mail</li>
            <li>But still, I was more surprised with this brush than any other I had before!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently, it also has a setting that for the first few uses, it slowly increases its pressure so you can get accustomed to it-- a feature which was ingeniously awesome for people like me, switching from a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>While I may not have LIKED brushing my teeth before, I would always be extremely thorough when I brushed.</li>
            <li>This is a VAST improvement over the old non-hygienic original model.</li>
            <li>Just recieved my sonicare toothbrush the other day, and so far I love it</li>
            <li>Purchased this product along with the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush for myself and my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>sonicare flexcare plus on gum setting, with Colgate sensitive smart foam and listerine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge improvement over the soft cases of previous models, and should go a long way to keeping my brush safe when I travel (which I do a lot).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed I use little pressure and can feel better results, thus eliminating the possibility of eroding my enamel.</li>
            <li>The ultrasonic activity of this tooth brush takes a little time to get accustomed to its vibrations, but it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning more thoroughly than its predecessor.  </li>
            <li>At Amazon the price varies, I once saw it for 125$, I paid a little more though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: my unit stopped working after little more than 1 year, while still under warranty.</li>
            <li>This unit was a little more</li>
            <li>This one was a little more finicky -</li>
            <li>Much better than those little ones you can purchase at Wal Mart, etc.  </li>
            <li>I chose this one because I thought it would work a little better than my Oral-B with the rotating head.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but your teeth will be glad you bought one.</li>
            <li>However, after just 1 year of use, the unit has completely stopped working!!</li>
            <li>You simply place the brush head into the cleaning unit, hit the clean button and it will automatically shutoff when complete.</li>
            <li>After a few months of use, I started experiencing problems with charging the unit through the main charger, so I switched to the travel charger, which worked better.</li>
            <li>In addition to the regular clean, sensitive, and massage modes, there are now \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Refresh\\&quot;  modes.  </li>
            <li>Third, 5 functions: clean, sensitive, massage (gum care), go care (2 min),</li>
            <li>My teeth feel straight from the dentist clean minus the bleeding gums.</li>
            <li>As a son of a dentist I figured myself for a pretty good caretaker of my teeth but after having neglected my dental checkups for about 3 years, I finally went in and found out I needed some fairly serious work done.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, due to it&#x27;s ergonomic design, that thoroughly cleaning your teeth and mouth is effortless.</li>
            <li>NICE, HARD PLASTIC TRAVEL CASE which holds the handle and two brush heads --</li>
            <li>Since there are no exposed internal parts to rust from water damage, I expect this one to last much longer than my original Sonicare (which unfortunately only lasted a year &amp; actually cost more than the one I have now).</li>
            <li>I decided to pay a little extra thinking $12.50 a month for better oral health would be worth it.</li>
            <li>It really leaves your teeth feeling like something effective has been done, and with such little effort.</li>
            <li>They are really expensive, and I never, ever see any special deals on them, which would be nice.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what the other one did except for one important change on the &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; mode which replaced &#x27;Max Care (which is why I picked the new one over the old) &#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This particular mode, with the UV Disinfectant Station is new to us, but it appears to work as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is important since the sanitizer becomes a closed container, and excess water could cause mold/mildew.  </li>
            <li>Yep- I was skeptical, and not too happy about the price...</li>
            <li>We have used it for nearly one month, and really like it.</li>
            <li>We replaced an old Sonicare model, and this one is easier to use, easier to store, probably much easier to take traveling.  </li>
            <li>The advance features are not that effective to spend about 2 times more of price of a ordinary electric brush...for mine the 30 sec timer did not worked properly.</li>
            <li>So far, I think this is a very beneficial product.</li>
            <li>the tone that is used for reminding that the 30 seconds are up is quite soft and gentle...</li>
            <li>He travels frequently for work and the sanitizer and travel accessories are very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Amazing design, waterproof, great contact-free charging base, simple to use included UV head cleaner, etc.</li>
            <li>Naturally, he broke it, probably from too much pressure.</li>
            <li>The brush head is small, but I find this a good thing, because anything bigger would be a nuisance once it started buzzing in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>It takes 24 hours to give this product a full charge, but once it&#x27;s charged, you won&#x27;t need to do it again for a long while.  </li>
            <li>When you first start using this, I would suggest that you be as gentle as possible with the speed (based on my experience).</li>
            <li>love the comfort of knowing that the germs on my toothbrush have been killed off.</li>
            <li>Last year, I had $20,000 worth of dental work done.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews of products I purchase (probably out of indifference)</li>
            <li>me, that made it worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more of a maintenance issue than I prefer, but hopefully it&#x27;ll pay off in the long run, especially in the dentist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li>Although I give this product 5 stars because of its outstanding performance, but there are few things need improvement.      </li>
            <li>Even though we use pretty basic features, this product seems very well made</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush - you must get a version with a timer, don&#x27;t even have to think about if you&#x27;re brushing long enough.</li>
            <li>I would pretty much bleed every time I brushed my teeth--</li>
            <li>but unlike a normal tooth brush, you don&#x27;t have to move your arm around.</li>
            <li>I had practically no plaque on my teeth (and no cavities, but that was normal anyway).</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel noticeably cleaner and healthier than they did with normal brushing.</li>
            <li>I actually find it fun to brush my teeth using this.</li>
            <li>so I used that for a few more month.</li>
            <li>But it would be nice if the company saw this complaint--</li>
            <li>definitely overpriced, your teeth are worth every penny invested in their maintenance and care.</li>
            <li>It is well worth having, though I wouldn&#x27;t mind having the option of buying the unit without the sanitizer so as to make the unit smaller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CLEANING mode: 2 minutes of normal cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CARE mode: 2 minutes of normal cleaning plus 1 additional minute to concentrate on the gums (Quadpacer beeps every 15 seconds for the gum care minute).  </li>
            <li>They said all I need know is a normal cleaning.</li>
            <li>(keep in mind, my wife and I use it, twice daily each at a minimum), it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I somehow often accidentally change out of the normal mode.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush comes with a couple of different modes and settings such as gum brushing but to be honest I only use one of them for brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>For Sonicare, I liked how the brush head was more closely related to a traditional toothbrush, rather than a circular shape of Oral-B. Some of the reviews for Oral-B indicated a minor irritation when the toothbrush would stop in the middle of brushing, telling you to move to the next &amp;#34;section.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For this kind of money, I wish could get at least five years of service of it.  </li>
            <li>This item broke under normal use.</li>
            <li>Aside from the technical jargon and scientific proof i can say that this makes brushing fun.</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;ve never been concerned about germ &#x27;buildup&#x27; on a normal toothbrush, so this feature is something I&#x27;ll use, but</li>
            <li>The DiamondClean seems like more money simply for a cool design but no more function over the FlexCare+.  </li>
            <li>The DiamondClean seems like more money simply for a cool design but no more function over the FlexCare+.  </li>
            <li>They normally cover the battery and will replace it for you.</li>
            <li>This item might seem pricey, but it has definitely been worth it.</li>
            <li>I chipped a substantial part of one of my front teeth biting my fork at breakfast and had to have an emergency resin filling, I used this on the normal setting that night without thinking and finished without even realizing</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action of this brush is superior (in my opinion) for cleaning over the reciprocal action of the Oral-B, and less likely to damage gums and cause</li>
            <li>The build quality is very nice, I like the different options for tooth brushing (although there seem to be a few options that aren&#x27;t really necessary).</li>
            <li>It stays charged for a very long time and  cleans my teeth better than I ever could with a regular brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush head will come out slightly warm, but only slightly.  </li>
            <li>(so it occupies less bathroom counter space and is far more compact to pack into luggage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(so it occupies less bathroom counter space and is far more compact to pack into luggage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Oral-B 5000 also lacks any display that shows which mode you have selected, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal since you can easily tell by the different types of vibrations.     </li>
            <li>This has far more options than the previous model I owned.</li>
            <li>Long charge, very slim and especially easy for travel with its smaller secondary charger plug.</li>
            <li>The model I bought from my dentist almost a decade ago worked for seven years before the metal rod that vibrates the head finally vibrated the rubber seals right off.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I gave this four stars is because of the cost, and difficulty finding, the right replacement heads.</li>
            <li>At the very least, it&#x27;s a placebo that makes me feel like it&#x27;s becoming clean</li>
            <li>No way did I get the same clean feeling as I did with my old Oral B with floss action electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Something internally broke on top where you connect the brush, it is totally loose now.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that it was a really nice product when it worked, it failed early and the manufacturer does not seem to interested in supporting it.  </li>
            <li>It has many different modes such as a gum care mode which is the standard brushing with a one minute period of gentle gum care massage.</li>
            <li>It offers several different settings, and it is much easier to keep clean than older models.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an older model of the Sonicare toothbrush for the past two years and I love it.</li>
            <li>I was not convinced the other reviews were really accurate when they said it felt like they had just been to the dentist.</li>
            <li>When my toothbrush broke randomly, I spent 5 minutes on the phone with Sonicare&#x27;s friendly and apologetic customer service.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works extremely well, but after nine months the shaft broke free of the motor.</li>
            <li>Good for me to have since I take frequent short business trips and rather avoid taking along the travel charger even if it&#x27;s quite small.    </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in buying the ultimate toothbrush at any price.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll get a new one.</li>
            <li>It was time to get a new brush head</li>
            <li>so I decided to go ahead and get a new brush while I was looking around.  </li>
            <li>and I like the new &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; routine.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s time to move to a new part of your mouth</li>
            <li>The new model fixes that.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this if you want an electric toothbrush that makes you feel like your teeth are brand new.</li>
            <li>&amp; I needed a new brush...</li>
            <li>After using the toothbrush for 4+ months I went to a new dentist</li>
            <li>So the question is, if you already have a Philips Sonicare Flexcare, do you need this new model?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using the new Flexcare design, I have also needed two new crowns...</li>
            <li>We have used this new brush for about a week now</li>
            <li>After my son saying get a new toothbrusher cleaner.  </li>
            <li>New Flexcares are the way to go in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the new Sonicare FlexCare</li>
            <li>because it was out of warranty, I would have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to get a new toothbrush, but after that experience, I&#x27;ll have to go elsewhere.</li>
            <li>you can call philips and they will send you a new one after you give them your product number on the bottom of the unit.</li>
            <li>when the new flexcare came in, i was ecstatic.  </li>
            <li>it was new.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sonicare Flexcare+, along with a new Sonicare Airfloss for about two weeks now.</li>
            <li>The modes on the new FlexCare</li>
            <li>New one sent Feb. 15, and now it is March 2</li>
            <li>Amazon sent a new one next-day.  </li>
            <li>I eagerly waited for my new gadget.</li>
            <li>I figured maybe it&#x27;s time for something new in my routine.    </li>
            <li>prefer this new one.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to purchase a new Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li>So, they sent me a new charger.</li>
            <li>The new toothbrush still wouldn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li>Then they decided to try another new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is made to break after the warranty so you can buy their new model.</li>
            <li>The new handle also die on Sep 2013.</li>
            <li>i called philips service and got a new</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s out of warranty, i have to think about to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>#34;USA is USA, UK is UK, buy a new brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>one completely new feature  </li>
            <li>I had a plan to buy a new ipod this summer</li>
            <li>Some reviews were by new comers to the electric toothbrush world and others who weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>When the battery stopped holding a charge on the Elite, I looked around for the new model and settled on the FlexCare+.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even want a new one, maybe a coupon or something.</li>
            <li>I bought the new one on July 13, 2012.</li>
            <li>Sourced the new multi-voltage Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I did some research online for one of the new electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Sonicare and because the brush was within the 2 year warranty they immediately shipped me out a new toothbrush that I received in a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will be getting the new unit in about a week.</li>
            <li>and she could give me 15% off of a new 150 dollar toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have both and this new one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to bother and just go looking for a new brand.</li>
            <li>I reicntly bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I checked the internet for ratings of another product and found a posting on how to repair this issue after I ordered a new replacement.</li>
            <li>(see the cons) and they sent me a new one, no questions asked that arrived within a week of me sending them my receipt.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Today, we received a new (or refurbished) \\&quot;sanitizing unit\\&quot; and recharger for our defective Sonicare Flexcare+  </li>
            <li>I have been using this new FlexCare</li>
            <li>Then, DON&#x27;T REMOVE THE BRUSH until you plan to replace it with a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Costco replaced the package with a new batch, I think there&#x27;s 5 to a package.</li>
            <li>but That just means these new heads will get twice the workout.</li>
            <li>I have two new heads that will not get used, at $18 for the pair.</li>
            <li>That is when I new</li>
            <li>bothered though that I still have two brand new brush heads for the e series.  </li>
            <li>I anticipate I will not need a new one for years to come.  </li>
            <li>Each new one costs about $10 each - and you buy them in packs of multiples, like 6 or 7.  </li>
            <li>I could live without the sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Phillips and was told that we need a new bulb and they will send us one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(the warranty does not reset after they send you a new unit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She also hinted that the replacements where not brand new, but refurbished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It even helps rebuild receding gums, if you spend more time consistently on the troubled areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: they have these new sensitive tips which consist of soft bristles that work perfectly for vulnerable gums that bleed easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>In two minutes of use, it feels like your teeth and mouth are as clean as if you spent four minutes with a manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Basically bluer color than the old one which was more of a green color.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>When I had trouble with my older brush this summer, I easily reached a company rep on the phone</li>
            <li>well, it also adds an added benefit of helping the brush dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>Well, the SoniCare Flexcare Plus system was the most EXPENSIVE system available (around $170.00 dollars)....  </li>
            <li>Well, the SoniCare Flexcare Plus system was the most EXPENSIVE system available (around $170.00 dollars)....  </li>
            <li>One of the things I criticized on my older FlexCare brush was the soft travel case.  </li>
            <li>If you have the older FlexCare model, I would wait until it is time to replace your old one before upgrading as the differences, while improvements, are not substantial.</li>
            <li>but it sounds like it would be a good idea to disinfect at least weekly, if not several times a week.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare also has a nicer display on the handle which actually shows the setting you select and the battery indicator is more modern, compared to the old-fashioned calculator type black LCD on the Oral-B.</li>
            <li>For the price of this unit, we fully expected it to last more than 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised this tooth brush did a decent job on removing all the plaque or color or dye...</li>
            <li>You would think that these bulbs would be available at a local store such as Target or Walmart, but no.</li>
            <li>but many are too harsh for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The battery does not fully charge the toothbrush; it only charges to the second light after 24hrs</li>
            <li>I cannot use a regular one now because it simply does not work half as good.</li>
            <li>but sometimes it seems that I should let the brush head dry a little more because if I put it in right after brushing when I get home form work/school the head is damp.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer was a major selling feature because my wife and I can each store our separate brush heads in the sealed unit away from the circulating air (remember that this sits on the counter top in the same bathroom where the toilet flushes!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girl who grew up using technology from a very young age.</li>
            <li>This model is MUCH easier to keep clean and also has a much smaller diameter handle (probably half the size of the first Sonicare I had).  </li>
            <li>i have very sensitive teeth and gums and it took some getting used to</li>
            <li>Only the first charging bar would blink, normally the first two are lit up while the third one flashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised they have not remedied this defect yet.  </li>
            <li>and it is hard to get them real clean with a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I figured I would upgrade to a new brush that my significant other and I could share.     </li>
            <li>Brush heads seem to last a long time and are easy to swap out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moved from sensitive to normal seeting within a week.</li>
            <li>I was somewhat skeptical about what to expect from a teeth cleaning system promising such great things, and the price also caused me some hesitation.  </li>
            <li>Further, I could not detect any difference in intensity during my first 14 brushings, but this may be the point of the feature.       </li>
            <li>I ordered more of the regular size heads, as it only comes with one regular and one travel head, and both my husband and I share it!</li>
            <li>I like proResults small brushes more as their are easier to operate with.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare on the other hand, gets your teeth whiter &amp; cleaner, significantly reduces tarter and improves the health of your gums.  </li>
            <li>I was only aware of it when i changed the brush (every 3 months, as recommended by my dentist), but i didn&#x27;t like the idea.</li>
            <li>: 29 November 2011 - It has now been well over a year since i first posted the above review about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>charge lasts for an inordinately long time--for me, about a week&#x27;s worth of morning-only brushings without recharging.</li>
            <li>SoniCare Flexcare Plus system is smaller than the first SoniCare I purchase years ago.  </li>
            <li>It was under warranty the first two times only.   </li>
            <li>I started with the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; level for the first two weeks and then switched to regular cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The instructions recommend charging 24 hours prior to the first use, but I doubt this is necessary given that the brush will only be used minutes a day and likely be able to charge 23 hours minimum every day that you use</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this toothbrush, you and your dentist will be much happier!</li>
            <li>pretty basic.  </li>
            <li>Solid product, but not substantially better than other models or makes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several Sonicare products over the years and this is the first one that died (after 9 months).  </li>
            <li>and i am so amazed to see that in first use it removes the yellow ting from my teeth ,</li>
            <li>i will write more in few weeks after my teeth will show some change!</li>
            <li>The many other reviews that say the same thing were what finallyconvinced me to take the leap, and so now let me add this review to theirs to help convince</li>
            <li>I originally turned off the setting that allowed thebrush to beep every 30 seconds, indicating you should move onto another quarter of your mouth, I actually turned it back on, because I found if it wasn&#x27;t on</li>
            <li>/&gt;After hearing about his ordeal, and seeing his difficulty in eating with dentures, I know I want to keep my teeth as healthy as possible, to possibly avert having to go through the same thing.  </li>
            <li>I know some people might want to set it for the one they like and have it always use that option, but me personally, I like to use different modes at different times, so it would annoy me more if it was set to one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told the Oral-B is not much better in quality, so I&#x27;m stuck with Sonicare until I can find a better product.  </li>
            <li>there are others, and fixed it!</li>
            <li>Wow, once you get used to this thing it keeps your teeth polished-clean!  ...</li>
            <li>I actually still have my original Sonicare and that toothbrush dates back to 1999</li>
            <li>So you have to be prepared for a pretty big investment in brush heads after purchasing this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unsurprisingly, they weren&#x27;t interested in replacing the device outside of warrantee.</li>
            <li>When I brushed my teeth for the first time with this</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>After having a lower level Sonicare Electric toohbrush for several years and pleased with its performance, I purchased a much more expensive FlexCare model as it was recommended for people with gum issues.</li>
            <li>I brushed 2X a day and felt I was being pretty thorough.  </li>
            <li>The first one broke after about a year, similar to another person&#x27;s review.  </li>
            <li>I had used an earlier version of the Sonicare years ago, and was pleased with it, but stopped using it due to sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>First, the head began wobbling shortly after purchase (from my dentist).</li>
            <li>First I got 2 cavities in my back molars</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Last week I was woken up in the middle of the night by a loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the brush is actually more powerful than previous ones, or if the battery on my old one had slowly faded, but I thought the FlexCare Plus was more powerful off the bat.  </li>
            <li>It has 5 different settings which is particularly nice if you&#x27;ve just had a cleaning or feel a little sensitive (sensitive setting).</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is a nice feature since we can clean our brush heads thoroughly if we get a cold virus</li>
            <li>You only thought you had brushed your teeth clean until you use a Phillips Sonicare</li>
            <li>However, I had the older model first and noticed that the newer one doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long.</li>
            <li>However, I had the older model first and noticed that the newer one doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviews say our teeth feel really clean after this.</li>
            <li>We have had other electric tooth brushes and nothing compares to the clean feeling this one gives you.</li>
            <li>If you have the money then buy this because its really like no other as far as taking care of your teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 10/2011 - After using my brush multiple times daily for more than 1.75 years, the head of the brush handle was starting to make loud noises and had become \\&quot;loosened\\&quot; from the pressure of brushing</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 10/2011 - After using my brush multiple times daily for more than 1.75 years, the head of the brush handle was starting to make loud noises and had become \\&quot;loosened\\&quot; from the pressure of brushing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a dentist&#x27;s clean feeling every day, but your teeth and mouth definitely feel far cleaner and more refreshed after a Sonicare brushing than using any regular brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though the toothbrush gently increases intensity through the first 10 or so times you use it, my gums bled slightly the first few times I used it - my hygenist said that was actually a good sign at first as long as it didn&#x27;t continue (it didn&#x27;t) - it means pockets in your gums that were previously undisturbed are being cleaned.</li>
            <li>When I did connect, the company said it was a clearly covered case, and would send a new unit.  </li>
            <li>The Powerfloss has already been replaced, and the new unit works, but makes loud crunching sounds.  </li>
            <li>They fixed that in this new one.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my old toothbrush and new</li>
            <li>We were somewhat surprised to find this new FlexCare</li>
            <li>but ANYWAY - I called and within 5 minutes, Mike was sending me a new handle via fed ex with pre-paid labels to send the old one.  </li>
            <li>New head design considerable improvement.  </li>
            <li>liked this model, however I found that I didn&#x27;t really use the extra modes all that much, and seeing as I have all the accessories still from this set (hard case, sanitizer, multiple chargers)</li>
            <li>On both the old and new FlexCare model, I actually rarely ever use the UV Sanitizer as I find that just thoroughly rinsinig the brush head after each use and letting the brush head thoroughly dry before I use it again is sufficient.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly refreshing, and you just don&#x27;t realize how many unpleasant things are on your teeth until you use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have used the UV sanitizer several times, but, as a microbiologist, I&#x27;m not sure it is doing anything amazing.  </li>
            <li>It starts off real gentle the first few days and increases in intensity..  </li>
            <li>Amazon.com is always easy to order from, and I received the product in just a few days.  </li>
            <li>The brush handle itself also lights up showing the different settings such as Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive and Massage.  </li>
            <li>The other Sensitive and Massage modes, however, demonstrated their unique value.  </li>
            <li>good base products but the bells and whistles bring no value; the &#x27;clean&#x27; function works very well, but the UV chamber, &#x27;massage&#x27; option,</li>
            <li>There is also a quick 30 sec mode and 1 minute mode.</li>
            <li>I like the 30 second timer, so I can get full and equal coverage.  </li>
            <li>Charge it the second you get it for 24 hours for a full charge (last three weeks, maybe longer)  </li>
            <li>Works well on its own, but I received my set with foreign wall plugs, and one foreign to US travel plug (or whatever it is called).</li>
            <li>On the few trips we have had to take away from home, it holds a charge for a nice long time.  </li>
            <li>It will feel offensive at first, especially if you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I mention this because the sonic vibration created by the new style so much less than the sonic vibration produced by my original SoniCare.  </li>
            <li>I was using an Oral B one, but it was only okay when it came down to it.</li>
            <li>My dental health is too important to mess around with any longer</li>
            <li>I went looking for a new brush for two reasons: one, the Oral-B brush heads always accumulated a gross slime inside of them, that really grossed me out.</li>
            <li>The second reason I went looking for a new toothbrush, is that I really wanted a UV sanitizer for the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>This latest model isn&#x27;t too much different than last year&#x27;s though there are a few minor upgrades and all of the Sonicare brand toothbrushes are fine dental hygiene products  </li>
            <li>This is a definite upgrade from previous models; lighter, longer battery life, and more controlled cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I like the many different modes on this toothbrush, and the toothbrush itself is lighter and sleeker than the previous models.</li>
            <li>Less brushing, more timing, hitting specific dental \\&quot;regions\\&quot; and the built in timer reminds you when it&#x27;s time to switch.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t know for sure how this toothbrush is working until my next dental appointment, but after a month my teeth are feeling cleaner and look slightly whiter.</li>
            <li>hard case is easily the only useful improvement (for me).</li>
            <li>It worked great until I had to change a brush head which is the only way that could have broke, despite the fact that I only applied the level of force necessary to remove it and no more.</li>
            <li>What I really appreciate is that they are sending me new unit before I send back the old one (they will include a label).</li>
            <li>But the strange thing is, the other 3 units I gifted are still working without any problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken it on a few weekend trips without my charger and battery has held fine.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have had better check ups at the dentist over the past few years because of the Sonicare toothbrush and while my dentist will agree that you don&#x27;t need the fancy UV light to have healthier gums, this is a definite upgrade that was well worth the investment on my part.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because after a certain time, the battery seems to die...</li>
            <li>Back in the \\&quot;old days\\&quot; when I was still using manual (non-electric) toothbrushes, I have always alternated between two manual toothbrushes, thoroughly rinsing each brush after use and letting each totally dry in between use, and I never had any issues with hygiene from contaminated brush bristles (heck, doorknobs, public drinking fountains, kitchen sink sponges, and shaking peoples&#x27; hands can carry more</li>
            <li>This UV light sanitizes the brush in as little as 10 minutes</li>
            <li>While the toothbrush vibrates it&#x27;s just a little sound it makes that tells you 30 seconds have passed and</li>
            <li>It comes with a sanitizer with a UV light bulb that you can sanitize the brush heads inside this little door.  </li>
            <li>The unit is light and the brush is like a little cleaning vibrating beast.  </li>
            <li>bit pricey, but if you are the lazy person that does not like to brush their teeth this will make you change your mind, once you learn what clean really</li>
            <li>I figured I can make do with a traditional toothbrush just fine, and not spend a lot of money on something that would provide minimal benefit.</li>
            <li>I feel as though a battery powered option would have been nice seeing as electrical outlets are typically not very abundant in bathrooms.</li>
            <li>I like having a little extra time at the end if I feel like some of my teeth need a bit more attention.</li>
            <li>the individual brush heads come with caps as well, which could help you feel a little better about cleanliness if the unit stays out on the counter as opposed to in a drawer or medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I love all the little features like the different modes to use</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a little silly, but now I am confident in knowing my toothbrush is clean!</li>
            <li>I called Phillips after the one they sent me to replace my original one lasted less then a year.  </li>
            <li>so I love the travel charger and hard case.</li>
            <li>I am hard on it and have to replace brushes much more often that my husband.</li>
            <li>For those suffering from brushing too hard, this toothbrush is sincerely a must-have.</li>
            <li>Since using this, I hardly notice any food coming out when I floss because it removes most of it for you already.</li>
            <li>Construction is of very high quality and cleaning is simple.</li>
            <li>Because I like the brush so much I was prepared to buy a new one, but first I called customer service to check if there was something I could do to fix it, and they offered to send me a new handle free, and a pre-paid shipping label to send back the broken one.  </li>
            <li>Also, the heads have a little plastic circle on it that comes in a few different colors, which is great for couples who share the toothbrush-</li>
            <li>They can be found at CVS and various other retail stores and online.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived as stated and very quickly.</li>
            <li>Even though I liked the product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another, and I would likely think hard before I bought another product by this manufacturer.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, it did kind of tickle, but it takes very little time to adjust to using this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy a brand new Oral B ever 3 months, have a nice clean handle, rather than buy a head for Sonicare only to put it on top of my nasty ole Sonicare handle.  </li>
            <li>Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>but I purchased it because it&#x27;s great for cold and flu</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different motion and very pressure sensitive too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The old Sonicare toothbrushes used to last much longer.</li>
            <li>one has a Gum Care mode, which previously with the electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had is Max Care, which is 2 minutes of Clean, and 1 minute of Massage, so the options are changed alittle by name.  </li>
            <li>Great to know if I want to go on a vacation and not want ot take a charger (although it does come with a small travel case and small portable charger)</li>
            <li>In fact, I can see a clear difference in the tarter buildup (or lack of) while using this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>still use this, my teeth are clean and you *can* feel a difference if all you&#x27;re used previously is a manual brush.</li>
            <li>The included instructions are clear.</li>
            <li>So this is clearly a product quality issue with the handle.</li>
            <li>Incidentally, when I use it on the roof of my mouth, it helps clear my sinuses during allergy season.</li>
            <li>If you consider how much whitening products and cavity fillings cost, you can save yourself a lot of money by purchasing equipment (such as this electric toothbrush).</li>
            <li>Perhaps the settings change too easily as i frequently find the setting changed after my wife uses it.</li>
            <li>Fact that it has a method for completely sterilizing brushes made me take the jump to buy.</li>
            <li>vs. 20 2-minute brushings of the old one&lt;</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not going to go into it that far with this review.  </li>
            <li>02/2014 - I have had the replacement brush for nearly 2.5 years now with no problems whatsoever.t some of this</li>
            <li>02/2014 - I have had the replacement brush for nearly 2.5 years now with no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>toothbrush can harbor a variety of germs capable of causing illness and even reinfection with the same disease (see dentalresource dot org slash topics25 dot htm).  </li>
            <li>Now you may not use all of them, but Philips offers them to us for the folks that will.  </li>
            <li>I will Only write reviews on items that really make a difference.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>I had Oral B Professional for 5-6 years</li>
            <li>Same goes for brushes - their functionality degrades much faster than advertisted.</li>
            <li>I am also using the UV sanitizer frequently.</li>
            <li>As far as my wife and I can tell, it looks like it reduces stains somewhat.</li>
            <li>Why would you make an electric toothbrush that isn&#x27;t completely waterproof???</li>
            <li>and you should be brushing softly.</li>
            <li>If you have arthritis, etc., this is probably the only reasonable alternative.</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself to help with a sensitive tooth/gum issue that I had.  </li>
            <li>I brush my teeth frequently</li>
            <li>Sensitive</li>
            <li>(The adjustment for sensitive teeth)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Three weeks ago my Dental Hygienist told me that I have gingivitis and the early stages of periodontal disease.</li>
            <li>Beats manual brushing by far.</li>
            <li>3) Sensitive, massaging, etc.      </li>
            <li>not because the crowns were old or failing, but because bacteria had entered underneath and into the nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I see no problems with it as far as cleaning it or it opening during travel.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have sensitive teeth or just want to massage your gums, there&#x27;s a setting for those.  </li>
            <li>After brushing with the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush, I feel like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>No issues so far</li>
            <li>have a different brand of electric toothbrush that is much cheaper</li>
            <li>9 months, it stopped working, at first it gave a strange noise...</li>
            <li>&quot; setting that gives you some extra time with gentle brushing to work on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sonicare stops suddenly making you wonder if the brush is really over</li>
            <li>and I have to do it rather frequently to keep it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I cannot say much about the system reliability, obviously.</li>
            <li>Most commonly we use the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; cycle.  </li>
            <li>was so old it cracked.    </li>
            <li>Also to note is battery was not dead at this date, it was on</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for my old Sonicare that the battery was dying on.  </li>
            <li>+ every time you do to get it fixed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect that it will last much longer.  </li>
            <li>a day)&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that compared with the Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and the tooth brush I was using ULTREO went out of biz.  </li>
            <li>The old versions used magnets to vibrate the head.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll really see at the next visit to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I figured Amazon would ask me to send the whole unit back</li>
            <li>so I contacted Philips directly.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]].     </li>
            <li>like I just had them professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of days now and what a difference between my old Oral-B and this one.</li>
            <li>I get that professional cleaning feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product so far.</li>
            <li>I now have to go directly to the manufacturer, box the damn thing up, and wait weeks for a replacement unit (assuming they honor the warranty).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the most reliable flosser, to say the least.</li>
            <li>negative thing I can say about is that, when you put in the toothpaste, MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing the job of my now defunct, 10 year old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush about a month ago to replace a 6 year old rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I occasionally use the UV sanitizing feature but really have no way of telling if it is of any benefit and will probably discontinue it&#x27;s use.   </li>
            <li>If you want an additional adult brush for the spouse, you have to buy it separately.  </li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality and performance.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this and as far as the $ goes if it saves me time in \\&quot;THE</li>
            <li>I purchased this to update my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I put it in my old charger and it wouldn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li>After using the this Sonicare for awhile, I went on vacation and grabbed my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li>really like the different brushing mode options. &#x27;</li>
            <li>I had an old sonicare</li>
            <li>After going with the $20 cheap-o \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrushes, I finally upgraded to the real thing.  </li>
            <li>The cost to make a replacement is most likely less than $.25 in material and $1-1.50 total cost and the cheapest I have found my particular replacement is $9.00 if i purchase three at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to going back to the dentist in November and hearing what the hygienest has to say about the state of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I also like the quad pacer feature-my old one had this and the battery operated</li>
            <li>The basic unit works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li>I really like it, and 14 months later, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I had an old Sonicare Elite that died, and I decided to go up a couple models for this one.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare sending a replacement handle and a return label for the old handle.</li>
            <li>I bought a smaller charger without the brush cleaning thing, it&#x27;s much simpler and easier.</li>
            <li>Something like this should have a far longer warranty.  </li>
            <li>But now... this brush blows the old one away.</li>
            <li>The uv sanitizer is also neat, obviously didn&#x27;t take that much care in sanitizing my toothbrush head before but now that i have something to do that...</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old Sonic care toothbrush (it lasted 6 years)</li>
            <li>I attribute it to the controls being at a natural holding place.</li>
            <li>i use the sensitive heads with it.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommend this toothbrush after my old one which was an Oral B went</li>
            <li>young kids</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t understand the concept of the Quadpacer technology (at least my kids didn&#x27;t); and rather than using the appropriate mode, they just play with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as cleaning your teeth, you just can&#x27;t beat a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>There is a \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; setting on the brush for people with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>Brushing is like getting a professional cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Flexcare handle is much longer than the Elite handle, which results in a larger case.</li>
            <li>I never had a cavity my whole life until the last two trips to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this junk just to be told that there is nothing they can do after it breaks 3 months into usage.</li>
            <li>I never liked electric toothbrushes, but I sure do like the ultrasonic one.  </li>
            <li>Every time I brush, I feel like I just had a professional cleaning...no joke.</li>
            <li>These things are gret they really hold pu even over several years.  </li>
            <li>When done just pull the brush from the handle,rinse it off, and pop it into the hygenic cleaner and your ready for the next cleaning.</li>
            <li>Rechargable Sonic Toothbrush - DENTAL PROFESSIONAL MODEL HX 6992/03]]</li>
            <li>(mine had a UV sanitizer as well), and the Oral-B Triumph [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li>The version here in town doesn&#x27;t have the sensitive gum feature.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>In that case we just revert to the old brushes we have.  </li>
            <li>No bleeding to sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>This replaced our old Sonicare and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>

            <li>IT&#x27;s now nearly a year post purchase and the tooth brush</li>
            <li>but somehow I could never avoid needing something fixed until I got this brush.</li>
            <li>We are stuck with junk and cannot get it fixed.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel FAR</li>
            <li>He is going to be surprised.</li>
            <li>I bought some generic ones cheaper, but plan to pick up some of the name brand to really see if there is a difference.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>have used my unit for a couple of years and from the very beginning, my checkups have shown definite improvements.  </li>
            <li>We read some reviews and forums regarding this problem and tried almost everything; letting it completely drain, not use it for a wile, keep it unplugged, etc., but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li>I have used the travel case frequently.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use Sensitive mode yet, as I just haven&#x27;t needed it.  </li>
            <li>and perhaps it was because it was 4 years old</li>
            <li>It is of course completely out of warranty.</li>
            <li>(my old one stopped holding a charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The 4 stars is for my old Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>Maybe all the different cleaning cycles isn&#x27;t really needed.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I never have an tartar on my teeth when they are professionally cleaned</li>
            <li>Although my toothbrush was a week out of warranty customer service sent me a replacement toothbrush handle and sent a postage paid label to return my old one.  </li>
            <li>The product is NOT made in the USA as advertised; the box reads \\&quot;Developed in U.S.A./Made by Phillips in China.  </li>
            <li>It makes me wonder how regular tooth brushes are even legal.</li>
            <li>Those inconveniences would cause me to give the product a 4-star rating, but the fact that my instrument simply died after 14 months of ownership really bothers me.  </li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush, and I really like the disinfecting feature of this model.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d think they should be bright blue, red, yellow, green, orange.</li>
            <li>The oscillating action leaves your mouth feeling as though you have just had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>(he uses a different brush head) and he does not have the gum issues that I have, but he really likes this toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li>Recommend using sensitive head to prevent overbrussing.</li>
            <li>I know this product is expensive, and I know there may be more bells and whistles than you&#x27;re looking for on a toothbrush, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>It comes with two heads of different sizes, for different jaw sizes, which is useful if there are two that would use the brush.</li>
            <li>You then have to press the green button OFF, press the silver button however many times to get back to the one you want</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a brush worth of $135 to work for only so short of time; so I&#x27;ve stocked up my brush heads.</li>
            <li>For this price and short lifetime, it only worth 1 star.</li>
            <li>My teeth as sparkling white and started looking better after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>Have used various electric teeth cleaning systems for over a decade with mixed success.  </li>
            <li>Different head size brushes are a useful personal option    </li>
            <li>writing your review, please consider the following guidelines:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focus on the product and your individual experience using it&lt;br /&gt;Provide details about why you liked or disliked a product</li>
            <li>Actually, I used the 30 second smile tooth brush system before using this one......</li>
            <li>When traveling, it stays charged for at least 1 week, but has a nice carry case and smaller charger that fits in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>The Philips models are good, but if something is wrong the customer service response is variable depending on who picks up the telephone.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use it, we each have our own head (he uses the grey band, I always get dark blue).  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s unfortunate, but with that being said, I think whether or not this is a good product depends solely on that.</li>
            <li>The cheaper model makes awfully loud sound and it can&#x27;t clean -- turns out that the motor is very weak, they used cheap plastic instead of rubber around the shaft, which made the little vibration sounds horribly loud.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any data on the effectiveness of the ultraviolet light on germs on the brushes, especially at the base of the bristles where they would likely to grow, but I am pretty sure that any intensity strong enough to kill germs aren&#x27;t doing anything to help to the longevity of the nylon brushes.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, Phillips wants us to buy new ones every three months, but I suspect that could be stretched to six months.</li>
            <li>Much like other products in the same family, the Sonicare \\&quot;brushing style\\&quot; can be unusual at first, but after a day or two you&#x27;ll barely notice a thing.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is working fantastic, and there have definitely been positive changes - no more cavities, and the gum damage that was going on has been completely resolved.</li>
            <li>As emphasized by one reviewer, the hard plastic end piece to which the actual toothbrush is attached vibrates furiously and has the potential to be genuinely hazardous when it contacts teeth at certain angles (i.e.: if the brush end is not carefully positioned while the toothbrush is in one&#x27;s mouth).  </li>
            <li>This will improve you&#x27;re oral health no matter how good or bad it is right now.</li>
            <li>The next time it broke, I just missed the stand and it fell onto the shelf right next to the charger.</li>
            <li>I foolishly bought another right away, and it last only 5 months.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Sonicare and they FINALLY got the head design right.  </li>
            <li>Second, sanitizer has space to store 2 brush heads, and while sanitezer does its job, there is a space right next to it to charge toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It definitely improves overall dental hygiene more than any other product.</li>
            <li>that the toothbrush can last up to 2 weeks on a single, full charge.  </li>
            <li>I like that it comes with a travel kit (hardcase and small adapter) which makes traveling with this tooth brush easy.</li>
            <li>I expect these other good habits to taper off as time goes on, but at least I&#x27;ll still have my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>clean and ready for the next round.</li>
            <li>The price is a little high, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>but the charging cables are a little too thick and wild, but I can live with that, so all is good.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean that I now use the refresh mode after every meal as I can&#x27;t stand the sensation of having little particles in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are so clean it feels almost like I just walked out of the dentist after I finish brushing (except a little slimier).</li>
            <li>The price was $10 less than the Amazon easy open package.  </li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised that it works so well particularly in comparison to what I have been using for several years.</li>
            <li>The UV light didn&#x27;t last that long though, only about 4 months.</li>
            <li>No mess.     </li>
            <li>Oral B and other brands are not as powerful.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that the other toothbrush wasn&#x27;t as powerful as the Sonicare model the hygienist showed me.</li>
            <li>Still better than the old design which had a giant well under the brush head and two small holes leading into that well so that the well collected all sorts of grossness in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>different modes are nice, but I usually just stay on the same setting.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>After about 8 months of use the internal timers for the regular brush cycle were starting to get shorter and shorter, sometimes they would be longer than normal, sometimes they would be about the right time length.  </li>
            <li>Of course if you think about the extra 1 minute gum cycle adding an extra 1/3 time to the brush cycle, it kind of makes sense that the brush would wear out an extra 1/3 faster, i.e. 2 months instead of the typical 3.    </li>
            <li>There are of course other specialized cleaning including with the brush such as gum care, message, and sensitive clean.  </li>
            <li>Now in the last 4 years I have had to buy a new flexcare toothbrush 3 times!  </li>
            <li>When I then asked what I should do if the new bulb does not work either at first they said that the warranty did not cover \\&quot;parts and accessories\\&quot;, but when I pushed the issue a little the rep then told me that if the bulb does not work to contact them again and they would send a new sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I can hardly wait to go to the dentist and see what he thinks of my clean teeth!</li>
            <li>It was bought to replace an older Sonic that finally quit.</li>
            <li>And the reason for this is that while handling the brush prior to brushing you don&#x27;t realize your are indirectly pressing that silver button once or twice or more, so when you finally come to press the ON button it&#x27;s been set to a different mode than when you last brushed.</li>
            <li>Personally i did not notice or feel any difference in dental care between the older elite and newer flexcare+ models.</li>
            <li>I say, go for the older ones since they last longer and perform just as well!</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to brushing my teeth first thing in the morning and last thing at night.</li>
            <li>The charge on the battery last for almost two months as this is well built as compare to the older models.</li>
            <li>actually brushed my teeth with my old toothbrush as I normally would</li>
            <li>At my second visit they both suggested I should look into getting a Sonicare, any model but in particular one that had the gum care settings.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this particular model and I can&#x27;t thank her enough.</li>
            <li>I had an older Sonicare for 12 years-it finally died.</li>
            <li>Today, the second one broke as well, same problem as the first one: doesn&#x27;t vibrate thus now</li>
            <li>I upgraded to this from an Essence after it finally stopped holding a decent charge.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare Toothbrushes for years and this one is pretty similar to the last one that I had with the exception of the extra gum care setting and the fact that the indicators are not visible unless you are using it which gives a sleeker look as compared to the older versions.  </li>
            <li>Slimmer design  - 2nd charger (w/o UV sanitizer) is small and convenient  - Cleans better than the Elite.  </li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an older model of the same brand.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting to get 5 years out of it, otherwise it&#x27;s pretty expensive to be replacing more often.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush will give you a decent check mark when you see your dentist next time.</li>
            <li>Either the design of the newer handles is faulty, or the product is no longer made with the same care as the older models were.</li>
            <li>Sonicare, when your newer units work as well as your older units, I may be back.</li>
            <li>decided on this particular model because it has the extra Gum Care mode that the lower models do not.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hygienist says that my home dental care is excellent and e cleanings are much quicker and less painful.</li>
            <li>Not only does the new handle design eliminate that truly icky build-up under the replaceable brushes (gross!), but the brush sanitizing light (gimmick or not) at least makes you feel like you&#x27;re being a little more safe, germ-wise.</li>
            <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t dock any stars for my own clumsiness, but this is a piece of equipment that is used multiple times daily, and is subject to wet and slippery conditions.</li>
            <li>Older models were notoriously hard to clean and would collect water and get mildew.  </li>
            <li>We use the diamond clean heads on the advice of other reviewers and i would recommend the same.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this terrific product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them, you simply may not need all the bells and whistles</li>
            <li>I have no idea how well this actually works to sanitize a brush and whether it really is necessary to protect yourself from putting germs back into your mouth that you may have put onto your own brush a few hours before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Forced to revert back to the rotating head style item which produced much poorer results and required more extensive flossing and a combination of nonelectric hand brushing.    </li>
            <li>had a defective UV light unfortunately, but a quick call to Philips, and a replacement is on the way.  </li>
            <li>I can actually clean my back teeth without activating my gag reflex, because the head is smaller (than my old regular brush) and I don&#x27;t have to saw back and forth, as the electric brush does the scrubbing for me.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, it brushes so fast that you don&#x27;t need to be spending long time brushing the teeth at all!&lt;br /&gt;Second, it reaches between the teeth, something my circular (rotating brush) toothbrush had difficulty</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer these modes to the previous model&#x27;s Clean, Sensitive, Massage, Go Care, and Max Care.  </li>
            <li>So I gave Philips another chance because as long as it was working, I really like how well it cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably because I was apparently brutalizing my teeth and gums with my old manual.    </li>
            <li>but I only use the normal cleaning setting.  </li>
            <li>The smaller normal stand is also included, which is what I now use.</li>
            <li>The first sonicare I purchased, I used a couple of years but there were rough edges around the toothbrush(bad design).</li>
            <li>, I use only a normal one for two minutes.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to touch the ring where the device attaches to the head while you brush or you will get burned, it gets hot.</li>
            <li>The higher vibration takes some adjustment but it will tickle you pink, at the results.</li>
            <li>The malfunctions started out as the unit turning off prior to the full 2 minute brush cycle, and beeping at intervals other than 30s.  </li>
            <li>I have traditionally been a firm brusher, putting a bit more pressure on the brush than necessary, but I don&#x27;t find myself being that way with this brush.  </li>
            <li>We normally put it back after every use</li>
            <li>What was once worth $100 plus dollars to me is now not worth replacing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can go back to the normal toothbrush now</li>
            <li>Will have to see how things go over time, as I have a lot of trouble with plaque build-up and staining as I&#x27;m a &#x27;full pot&#x27; coffee sipper.</li>
            <li>But then, a few weeks ago, I accidentally dropped it in a sink full of water and it immediately shorted out.  </li>
            <li>The total operating costs ( replacement brush heads seem pretty pricey, also )of these products and what would appear to be deteriorating quality are hard to stomach, even if they do keep my teeth super shiny.</li>
            <li>The vibration takes a little getting used to, but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>You can easily brush for half as long, or 50% longer . . .</li>
            <li>The bristles seem fine and still firm enough to continue but I feel its a bit misleading.  </li>
            <li>I first found this annoying because it&#x27;s not that easy to fit the cord into the grooves in the bottom of the charger.  </li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s out of warranty there is no possibility of repair and all they give you is a coupon worth 15% off of their online store (which sells products at approximately 15% higher price than Amazon!).  </li>
            <li>This model cleans more signifcantly than any other model that I have previously used.</li>
            <li>Also seems to keep gums less irritated, I noticed a significant increase in irritation when going back to the manual toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they would make the selection button a little more difficult to depress</li>
            <li>What got me excited about this toothbrush was the UV light which plugs right in like normal and next to it, you can charge the toothbrush base.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a new toothbrush when my current one (Oral B) is still working.  </li>
            <li>Contacted Philips online help and received a new one for replacement, except they shipped a standard size brush head instead of a compact one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using my new tooth brush for only 2 weeks now</li>
            <li>When Iam on my last brush head, I order or buy new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And they could only offer discount on new item.</li>
            <li>Between all these sonicare toothbrushes and replacement heads (I even bought my mom a new model this last Christmas)</li>
            <li>noticed a brand new Oral B only costs $35</li>
            <li>3) Battery for the Flexcare+ seems to last about a week longer (3.5 weeks) than my Elite when it was new.</li>
            <li>Now I have to buy a new one or something similar.</li>
            <li>Hoping this new one not only helps keep teeth cleaner, but helps us stay healthier by keeping the brush heads cleaner.</li>
            <li>I missed using the toothbrush for the short time it took to receive the new one.</li>
            <li>new extra one.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to get a new electric toothbrush and did some research and Sonicare seemed to be the way to go.</li>
            <li>However the Sonicare HX6970 has lasted for 20 months (having just recently died).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Philips to process a warranty replacement, and they are sending me a new unit under the two year warranty.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;minuses\\&quot; to the new model are that the sterilizer no longer indicates if the brushes have been sterilized at the end of the cycle (previously there was a steady green light):  </li>
            <li>But by doing this sometimes you have to scroll through the modes (pressing it several times) to get to the mode you previously had it on -- in my case, the &#x27;Clean&#x27; mode.</li>
            <li>&quot; that really seem like a waste of money - - they just make the brush run for more or less amount of time, rather than the standard 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, keep in mind that you still have to floss (at least twice a day). :-)</li>
            <li>love this toothbrush, but my complaint about the mold build-up in the earlier model persists to this model.</li>
            <li>Although they tend to be the most expensive brushes, they have longevity which stands out, much like the Kitchenaid of stand mixers.  </li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve just manually brushed my teeth and my dental hygenist said I really needed to get back to electric.  </li>
            <li>Much simpler than brushing back and forth at different angles.      </li>
            <li>I am a bit more careful when pulling it off, as you do have to tug it firmly, and it seems to be doing quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually called up Sonicare to find out what some of the differences were between the different models and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li>I finally confessed I had gotten a different brush but was trying to make it work because of how much I paid for it.</li>
            <li>sonic brush has 5 modes which accommodate different durations and vibration speeds, so if you are worried whether or not this will offend your sensitive teeth try the sensitive setting and work your way up.</li>
            <li>It is used at least once a day and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>It was a good brush while it worked, but entirely too expensive.</li>
            <li>The small head makes it so easy to clean hard to reach places</li>
            <li>New design of brush head stays clean and no more gunk build up!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The downside, of course, is the Sonicare price tag (and ongoing replacement brush head costs), but, in the end, I feel it&#x27;s worth it and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever go back to using just a regular toothbrush again after so long with a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>There is no other toothbrush that gives you the results of the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I have been using oral-b toothbrushes for over 10 years, and finally decided to give sonicare a try and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>But this is nothing major, I can</li>
            <li>I had gotten a bit lazy with brushing and flossing, and I started to notice some significant gum problems.</li>
            <li>I am a person that buys from Amazon without checking other sources because I feel that Amazon&#x27;s price is generally pretty competitive.</li>
            <li>This product is defective and should not be bought without a major redesign.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised as I have had sonicare toothbrushes for as long as I can remember with years and years of trouble free operation.</li>
            <li>The major selling point for me was the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I use the smaller head on my daughter and I&#x27;ve been using it on her on the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; setting for over a year and it makes her teeth sparkle!</li>
            <li>build of this device is very solid, which makes sense because it is meant to vibrate at incredible speeds, the Sanitizing charging base on the other hand is not as substantial so be careful to keep this away from your counter top ledge.  </li>
            <li>My dentist asked me what I was using because when I went in for my cleaning, there was very little for them to clean.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth a little better than mu old brush and is less bulky to hold.</li>
            <li>It is definitely less than 2 years old, not this model exactly, but I was checking my order history to see if I bought it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>teeth also feel much cleaner even using less toothpaste than I normally would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It quickly boiled down to a choice between this one and the comparable Oral-B model and my choice was made due to aesthetics and features; the two products seem to function pretty much same</li>
            <li>I like this model even better, hopefully this one will last as long as the previous one!</li>
            <li>When the 2nd unit started to experience the same issue a few month later is investigated more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>The last batch of heads I purchased from Costco, I returned immediately,due to loose bristles that actually came off with the FIRST use!</li>
            <li>No more having to clean out the gunk on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Braun and Oral-B toothbrushes in the past and they just don&#x27;t come close to the Sonicare in the way they clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Much cleaner than previous Soniccare models and entire motor and unit feels much stronger and robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So you could see that after a time, the amount spent on replacement heads would exceed the price spent on the original toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very intense cleaning action (vibrates gums) and takes a little time to adjust to.  </li>
            <li>I spent a large amount of time trying to contact customer service on the phone.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth every cent.</li>
            <li>The little cleaner booth may or may not be useful</li>
            <li>/&gt;Options: There are a couple different brush head types that you can use with this particular model, I tend to use the standard longer brushes.</li>
            <li>The first week or two my gums were a little sensitive</li>
            <li>Also I cant figure out how to fit the charger into the hard case but there must be a way.</li>
            <li>so I picked up a basic mode 2 Series Plaque Control last week from SAM&#x27;s club since I thought I don&#x27;t need all the bell and whistles on the high end model</li>
            <li>The quality is definitely an upgrade from cheaper electric toothbrushes, and I highly recommend this product after having now used it personally for a month.  </li>
            <li>Overall a solidly build, high quality product.</li>
            <li>Too bad, because while it works, it is great.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t charge once a week I can go at least 2 weeks with just one light on the battery going</li>
            <li>/&gt;But more importantly, it cleans like crazy!</li>
            <li>after I have cleaned my teeth, I take the brushhead off, rinse it, then I put it into the small area where the UV Sanitizer is, press that button, which turns on the blue light to sanitize the brush head.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recomend the toothbrush, but not sure if there is a problem with the UV light</li>
            <li>This is clearly the final step.  </li>
            <li>This is apparently a newer model.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never in my life spent this much money on a toothbrush</li>
            <li>the stronger brushing action and the fact that the battery on the flex care+ last a lot longer between charging.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old Elite 7500 (NiCd batteries) finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
            <li>I used to have sensitive gums despite flossing once a day and brushing twice a day with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Is it possible that people who use the Sonicare may not have to go to the dentist as frequently as regualr toothbrush users??</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used all of the functions yet as it is only 3 weeks old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about 6 months now and so far it is living up to its potential and delivering on all the points referenced in the product description</li>
            <li>The 5 different options for brushing make it completely personalized based on the type of brush you want to accomplish.  </li>
            <li>It has different speeds for softer brushing, massage and sensitive modes.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve barely used it since I&#x27;ve gotten this product.  </li>
            <li>then the motion of the brush head reduced to the point the &#x27;vibration&#x27; was barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the case may be I will be sticking to changing the heads every 3 months even if the blue markers fade early.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are sensitive, and I can already feel an improvement, especially in my gums.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to call Sonicare directly since it&#x27;s still within the warranty.</li>
            <li>I tried buying this product from the Philips company direct, but they were actually out of stock.  </li>
            <li>I recently switched to this Philips version and I&#x27;m surprised to see, after each brush, my teeth felling smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li>- Compared to the Oral B Professional series brush I had, this was definitely an upgrade...</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is different from the old style sonicares.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i am myself medical professional</li>
            <li>This is my third Sonicare toothbrush, and so far, it&#x27;s the highest quality Sonicare I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the FlexCare Plus two to three times daily for about a month now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any buildup so far.    </li>
            <li>this product was a gift for my girlfriend; her old sonicare which was proabaly the basic one broke</li>
            <li>After only a few uses my whole mouth felt much cleaner.</li>
            <li>There are several brushing settings so, if you have sensitive teeth, there is a setting for that.  </li>
            <li>you find one regular adult brush.  </li>
            <li>On a recent visit to the dentist with my 8 year old son, the hygienist recommended he use a Sonicare as he wasn&#x27;t getting the job done.</li>
            <li>You simply pop them onto the pegs, making sure that the brush head is facing the center, close the door and push the green button...</li>
            <li>Finally, died completely.</li>
            <li>so well that I never want to go back to my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I recommend using the smaller brush on the sensitive setting to get used to it.</li>
            <li>This Sonicare Flexcare Plus is a big improvement over my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li>You can barely feel that button even when you are paying attention.  </li>
            <li>I finally got this in January and haven&#x27;t missed my old toothbrush at all.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it after reading several scholarly research articles on the benefits of \\&quot;true\\&quot; sonic action in toothbrushes over manual brushing.</li>
            <li>My dentist kept suggesting a sonic toothbrush because of my sensitive gums which I finally decided to fork out the money for one.</li>
            <li>After about 9 months, the unit developed problem, turning on by itself and would not charge properly.</li>
            <li>The improvement was quite apparent.</li>
            <li>I did not order a replacement because my old one died, I just thought it didn&#x27;t have the ooomph of its former self.</li>
            <li>So as far as I can determine not only has Phillips quality control deteriorated but they are not environmentally  friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even when I switched back to the old brush head.  </li>
            <li>I have an old Sonicare that is still working 7 years later.</li>
            <li>I formerly used the old bulky Sonicare and cleaning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using SonoCare for years and my old one finally wore out.  </li>
            <li>the hum was higher pitched and the actual metal stick that the toothbrush goes on was not really moving anymore.  </li>
            <li>Checked the old handle on both chargers (wall and travel) and got the same results: Two beeps, pause, third beep, with charging light on handle going from green to orange and toothbrush starting and stopping erratically, so problem seems to be the handle.</li>
            <li>Ok, it&#x27;s broken, we&#x27;ll send you</li>
            <li>I bought an Oral B a few months ago, strictly for my travel and rarely use it, but it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;TWO CHARGERS: a small travel charger and a full size charger that is attached to a UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>Tip - let the brush do the work with light pressure and slow movement around the mouth.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much more effortless than a traditional manual toothbrush since you simply put the Sonicare brush against the teeth at the gumline and slowly move it across the fronts and backs of the teeth.  </li>
            <li>With this brush, you get that fresh from the dentist feeling everyday, and how can you beat that?</li>
            <li>That is the most frustrating part of this device.</li>
            <li>This newer one has more features that are poorly implemented.</li>
            <li>it would be even better if price could be a little lower and the body of brush can be made less bulky.</li>
            <li>First run the battery down by continuously restarting when it times out.</li>
            <li>I had this dark spot on one of my upper teeth,in the upper right hand corner, near the gum line.</li>
            <li>brush gives off a tone of 500Hz, meaning it moves at about 500 brushes per second, and feels like a massage device, only vibrating much faster!&lt;br /&gt;Using it tickles the gum a bit (comparable to when your arm or leg is asleep (due to lack of blood flow) comparable to the &#x27;pins and needles&#x27; feeling, only much softer, with the difference that the feeling goes away as soon as one stops brushing the gum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I see that is happening over time is the full charge is lasting less than a week.  </li>
            <li>I had to go several days with a regular toothbrush before my new toothbrush arrived.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this new one was much more short-lived.  </li>
            <li>The new brush heads snap on, have no place for debris to be trapped, and are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the new model for a short time now, about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I hope this new unit will last for about the same time or longer.</li>
            <li>However, during that same time, I have had to obtain three new handles, all for the same reason:  </li>
            <li>No one can convince me otherwise that they don&#x27;t know what they are doing...making a defective product in China that will not last and then turning their backs on you when the product dies - even if you register it - the only &amp;#34;goodwill&amp;#34; they give is &amp;#34;allowing &amp;#34; you to purchase a new product from them again.  </li>
            <li>I did find that after the 10 minute cycle was complete, the brush head was dry as far as I could tell.  </li>
            <li>The handle suddenly felt less powerful after 8 months of use.</li>
            <li>They worked better than a manual toothbrush, which is what I expected from this, but other than that I had no real expectations.    </li>
            <li>For several months there were no problems, but then the toothbrush suddenly became very loud.</li>
            <li>After having used a Sonicare FlexCare brush for over a year and a half, I highly recommend this model to anyone looking for a new power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>After having used a Sonicare FlexCare brush for over a year and a half, I highly recommend this model to anyone looking for a new power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and germs are killed with the UV light after a single push of a button.  </li>
            <li>The first stopped vibrating properly within 2 years and the other 2 brushes stopped just after the 2 year warranty ended.   </li>
            <li>Other than that this is only product I will ever use because of this consistent results.</li>
            <li>Keeps teeth significantly cleaner than manual brushing (I&#x27;ve been brushing with a manual brush - see cons - for a couple months and had a 6th month cleaning in which the hygienist commented on some extra scale build up, usually they&#x27;re in and out of there in no time with no complaints when I&#x27;ve been brushing with the Sonicare and flossing</li>
            <li>The brush heads are typically the same price as an online purchase so replacements can quickly be picked up when necessary.</li>
            <li>My teeth are super slick when I rub my tongue over them and shiny.  </li>
            <li>work-around solution is simple: put the brush on carefully, lubricating with water if it seems a little too tight, and making sure not to try to push it all the way to the top of the handle (there is supposed to be a small gap).  </li>
            <li>I used to view brushing as more of a chore and typically brushed too hard and too long.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only negative thing I have to say about this fine, well-made toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You can store and clean the brush head in a small compartment next to the recharging handle.  </li>
            <li>Only drawback is the recommended weekly cleaning of the device, but small price to pay for a clean brushhead.</li>
            <li>This one does not clean teeth or gums as well as the 30 second smile.  </li>
            <li>I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  </li>
            <li>That means this last time when it died, with a nearly $200 toothbrush breaking after barely 6 months of use since last replacement, the conversation concluded with a \\&quot;sorry.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I purchased this product about six months ago and as other reviews note, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product.</li>
            <li>The brush completely stops after 2 minutes and you need to restart the cycle again to brush the flat surface areas.</li>
            <li>There was hardly anything at all for her to clean.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m a little worried that this is going to break on me after a few months after some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
            <li>This feeling will last for a few months about 4 to 6 before you have to change the head, (they recommend ever 3 but with the included sanitizer and the easy  way they recommend brushing these heads last a long time.)</li>
            <li>They also included a shipping label to send back the defective unit on their dime for proper recycling (gold star for being green friendly assuming they actually recycle it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It started to decrease in its brushing power, and after trying a new brush head and determining that it wasn&#x27;t the problem, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that its the actual brush that is having these problems and that its simply on its last legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most dramatic thing happened tho.  </li>
            <li>I never liked electric toothbrushes because my teeth never felt clean afterward.</li>
            <li>Your risk is increased if your brush is kept near your toilet or if your home has roaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It lasted me several years before the internal battery died completely</li>
            <li>I am waiting to see whether my dental hygienist thinks that there is an obvious &#x27; difference &#x27; at my next professional &#x27; cleaning &#x27; appointment.  </li>
            <li>I believe they only have 3 colors (grey, dark blue, light blue).</li>
            <li>The old screw-on type traps water and toothpaste residue and requires me to regular take off the collar to rinse it out properly.</li>
            <li>This version comes with the hard case instead of the strange soft case Flexcare originally shipped with.</li>
            <li>This shuts it off after approximately 2 minutes, which almost always isn&#x27;t enough time for me to cover all the surfaces/areas (but that&#x27;s probably just the meticulousness/OCD in me, more than anything</li>
            <li>I was skeptical because I have never owned a electric brush I liked and always went back to the manual type.</li>
            <li>To top it off the UV light in the base stopped working within a couple of months of use.</li>
            <li>Looks like the company is pumping up its profits by making them in a way that consistently breaks down shortly after the warranty expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit to get used to at first, however, once you get used to the vibrations</li>
            <li>While I have purchased and used several electric tooth brushes in the past, none of them has left my teeth feeling as clean as the Phillips FlexCare Plus HX6972.</li>
            <li>but with a new \\&quot;toy\\&quot; like this the two minutes don&#x27;t seem long enough.</li>
            <li>I had a problem of placing to much pressure while brushing using a conventional toothbrush, but using the FlexCare</li>
            <li>The different cycles on the handle are easier to understand and set, it comes with a hard, more protective case (previous was soft), and I think the battery lasts longer (time will tell).  </li>
            <li>After my wife and I each had a recent trip to the dentist, where the previous version to this model of electric toothbrush was demonstrated and recommended by the hygienist, I started shopping around to find exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The price may seem high for some, but this will last for a long time and is essential if you want to protect your teeth.</li>
            <li>I put very little weight on the UV Sanitize feature, however I came down with flu virus shortly after I began using this brush and what a relief to have that available!    </li>
            <li>, Philips SoniCare told me the SoniCares last generally 2-5 years but sent a $15 off coupon as a consolation prize.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely not anti-big business, but I have to echo the general complaints of companies taking advantage of their customers.  </li>
            <li>The biggest complaint I had of the original was the mold that would build up on the inside of the handle unless you cleaned it meticulously on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>One day, the vibration was suddenly weaker to the point of being barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li>The massage setting soothes my gums, which don&#x27;t like being brushed, and that two minute timer is a Godsend (I am five, apparently, and</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with this toothbrush and can only hope it lasts as long as the old one did!</li>
            <li>first of all, the electric plug did not fit usa electric outlets.&lt;br /&gt;second</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a regular viewer of the Mythbusters show, you&#x27;ll no doubt have seen the episode dealing with toothbrush hygiene and how ridiculously difficult it is to keep germs, especially of the fecal kind, off the brush head.</li>
            <li>The sensation was off-putting at first, but I got used to it after a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent this much money on much more useless things.</li>
            <li>The first few times using it takes some getting use to it.  </li>
            <li>Regarding the different modes, and whether or not this is better than the base model, I honestly only ever used the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting, and I don&#x27;t think many other users would stray too far from that setting either.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth it to buy another one.</li>
            <li>I have had this brush exactly 2 years - it is a few days out of warranty.  </li>
            <li>(My gums were pretty bad too start anyway) but its very comfortable now.</li>
            <li>(see my previous review for a detailed write up) for about a year and a half before getting</li>
            <li>I hope the competition gets the message that Sonicare is going down hill fast.</li>
            <li>after buying my first electric toothbrush, I regret all the years passed without having it, I don&#x27;t think with a regular tooth brush I was doing any good for my teeth except gum recession which is horrible, high quality if you can afford get it it will save you even cleaning your teeth at the dentist</li>
            <li>And my teeth are much whiter while not changing any other dental habits!</li>
            <li>I thought I had found a winner with my previous Oral-B brush; I got lazy and mostly stopped brushing for 5 months, and started again in the last month with that brush.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my lips felt a little tingly with the vibration but even the second time of use I was used to it and now is a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try to keep my mouth closed as much as possible,  but you really have to keep your mouth open to brush your teeth properly.  </li>
            <li>The reason is when I called Philips, a nice CS rep named Sarah hooked me up with a new base and three brand new brush heads.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it for very long but so far I would reccomend it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brand and model primarily due to the high revues of others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend one model or the other.</li>
            <li>My gums are not sore (in the front of my mouth- where I am less than gentle) and my teeth feel like I have been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>:  Much like previous units, this is a breeze.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;Different&#x27; color, looks very similar - its &#x27;Soft Sky Blue&#x27; instead of &#x27;Medical Blue&#x27;.</li>
            <li>least in my case, I could quickly notice the difference in the quality of my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>Also comes with a smaller travel charger (though you can make it at least 2 weeks on a full charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hated it the first day but loved it by the fifth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little weird at first to get used to, but you will in time and fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;standard&#x27; design of the brush head combined with the up and down motion of the toothbrush worked really well for the front side of the teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having owned the previous model of this toothbrush, heres the dirt: It has one additional setting, slightly better looks, a hard case, and bristles that fade with use.</li>
            <li>This is our third Sonicare--our 2nd one was still alive when we sent it to the farm because it wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge on long trips.</li>
            <li>My old brush didn&#x27;t have a timer and based on what my dentist used to tell me, I obviously was not brushing long enough.</li>
            <li>Especially when it&#x27;s too late to get a full refund and my money back.</li>
            <li>The tip (where the brush heads connect to the toothbrush) came loose and started to make a loud noise and rattling around.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although one is capable of cleaning their teeth just as well with a manual toothbrush, people are less likely to brush for the recommended two minutes when using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit I had previously lasted over a decade was repaired only once a a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I suggest you get a cheaper model, unless you really need all these settings for your teeth, and don&#x27;t mind if it does you wrong quickly.</li>
            <li>And you cannot buy replacement wands only so you will be forced to buy a whole new set.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to brush my teeth twice because it did not clean very well.</li>
            <li>I had the same problem with the loose shaft that others are reporting,and fixed it.</li>
            <li>She said I didn&#x27;t have any new cavities (I usually  get new cavities every time I see her)</li>
            <li>This helps me not spend to little or too much time on any one area and keeps me focused when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li>and it can irritate your gum, again, it all about getting use to it, and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure towards your teeth or it will hurt, a little bit will do).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also had other problems with the new Flexcare system.  </li>
            <li>I realize the product is out of warranty, but they made not attempt to try to help me other than to tell me to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>but again, when the motor stops working 1 month after purchase, it&#x27;s hard to say a fancy toothbrush with lights is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I felt a little guilty about spending $$$ on a toothbrush, but I figured it would be a good investment.  </li>
            <li>It charges fairly quick and usually lasts me about 1-2 weeks on a single charge.</li>
            <li>was preparing to order a new unit today when I thought to check the Sonicare website to see it the warranty was still active.  </li>
            <li>Not going to throw good money after bad on this.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in the color of my teeth (whiter) and the elimination of plaque build up behind my front teeth.</li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>

            <li> Let me talk about the reasons this brush is the best on the market for oral health:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Removed surface stains, hygienist was impressed with my results.  </li>
            <li> One of the BEST toothbrush we&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> using it for a year i think and it still charges perfect battery lasts</li>
            <li> And it does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> In contrast, my wife has the comparable Oral B model and it has performed flawlessly for four years.  </li>
            <li> Refresh&#x27; is the 1 minute option, perfect for when I am in a rush. &#x27;</li>
            <li> This is the best thing that has happened to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> And the price is great!      </li>

            <li> I especially am pleased with teh UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> The travel kit and docking station are wonderful too.</li>
            <li> The best part is that there is a compartment that sterilizes the brush.  </li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I have made!</li>
            <li> Was a great toothbrush until it died within a year!</li>

            <li> The toothbrush works great.  </li>
            <li> Basically I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> The brush is great, but I am reducing the review by 1 star because of the cost of the replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Great product for maintaining dental health if used as directed.  </li>

            <li> Love!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!  </li>
            <li> Some added accessories come in very handy if you travel a lot.</li>
            <li> The battery stays charged for three weeks making it very handy to take on trips, plus there is a nifty carrying case.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus, rechargeable toothbrush is a very effective instrument for cleaning teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The travel case and charger are very handy, but for a one week trip I didn&#x27;t even need to charge the toothbrush; even with both my husband and myself using the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t very effective.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazing!  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is just amazing!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> So so Amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m especially excited about the case attachment that zaps bacteria.........</li>
            <li> This is a great investment for good dental health.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent toothbrush, and does a much better job of cleaning my teeth than I was doing by hand.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare is the most efficient way to taking excellent care of your teeth this toothbrush is it!  </li>
            <li> very happy I bought this :)</li>
            <li> This is the best - I put it on the Re-fresh mode and works better then any tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> Love the Sonicare toothbrushes and this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> It works great!&lt;br /&gt;The brush stays charged for just over 2 weeks brushing once a day and about a week if you brush twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with this excellent brush!</li>
            <li> It is a great unit and I loved it.</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is a nice touch too!</li>
            <li> In my estimation, this equates to a successful product.  </li>
            <li> I love having my own!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful toothbrush, better than any of them I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this brush it has so many features.</li>
            <li> Plus, the UV cleaning option is a nice perk!</li>
            <li> She told me that my gums are perfect, my teeth are very clean, and I have no cavities.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, it cleans, and the battery life is still excellent after more than one year of usage (about one week using it 2-3 times</li>
            <li> the unit functions perfectly and Amazon&#x27;s service was excellent, but more important is the fact that I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist EVERY morning and evening after using it</li>
            <li> The best thing about it is that though it gives you a great clean, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or scratch your gums.  </li>
            <li> The price is not an easy thing to get over, but it is truly the best tooth brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome and the price/ easy returns policy with Amazon was a no brainier.  </li>
            <li> Excellent design easily held with no akward positions.</li>
            <li> We loved it, easily the best toothbrush we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, Sonicare toothbrushes guarantee me a quick cleaning &amp; a perfect report of health at the dentist office every 6 months, and the dentist/hygienist alway comments on how great my teeth look.  </li>
            <li> It is enjoyable to use a tool that produces very good results.    </li>
            <li> My Phillips sonic care plus toothbrush is a amazing product I would recommend it to any one I find amazon is a good company with great service and getting there products to my front door</li>
            <li> Compact with a good travelling case!&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Eventually, and with good fortune, you will master its operation (</li>
            <li> Holds charge for good length of time.  </li>
            <li> It is surprising how well the charge lasts and</li>
            <li> worked great then started turning on and off on its own</li>
            <li> it is still in great working condition, and my husband now has his own brush head attachment so he can steal, er...</li>
            <li> --you&#x27;d need a microbiologist on hand for that--it gives you a good feeling nevertheless to know you&#x27;re brushing with a sanitized brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I was doing a good job brushing until I purchased and used the Sonicare</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone looking for a good sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> price is fair.</li>
            <li> Word to the wise, stay away from Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> Just stick with your already good brushing habit.  </li>
            <li> Keep up the good work Sonicare.</li>
            <li> is the 2 minute timer), and it is a good investment for oral healthcare.  </li>
            <li> This brush does a good job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good feeling to know that your toothbrush is germ-free every time you brush.</li>
            <li> My husband has found that the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; cycle is good for his bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> Before that, I had owned and loved a Sonicare that had been discontinued and I couldn&#x27;t find the replacement brushheads any longer</li>
            <li> well good looks never</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve LOVED every generation of sonicare, and i&#x27;ve had them all.  </li>
            <li> It feels sooo good.</li>
            <li> Figured it was probably going to be done for good</li>
            <li> Yeah, it works great, but is that the kind of investment you want to make, close to $100 a year on a toothbrush?    </li>
            <li> Although it is good to have, I find myself seldom use the UV function.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush, and the sanitizer seems like a good idea.  </li>
            <li> The travel case is convenient, battery life appears good although I&#x27;ve not stressed it yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Looks great, nice and slim  2.</li>
            <li> You think a manual toothbrush is doing a good job of cleaning your teeth, but it takes using this Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush to see that it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I got a good deal by buying it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> The warranty is for two years so it was still good.</li>
            <li> Phillips cust support could not verify any warranty info-which is fair.</li>
            <li> I just plop um on the peg, facing any direction and they fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> He loved it until is turned into a lemon.</li>
            <li> This model comes with a UV sanitizer, which seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> Plus I know I can always use my good toothbrush instead of one of those $2 ones that don&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> would say get this brush once you see how good your teeth feel,</li>
            <li> I think that is good, but I find there are some stuff I do not have when I look the instruction.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it is good</li>
            <li> alround a good product.</li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> It is a good feature if u travel a lot.</li>
            <li> It fits but it doesn&#x27;t manuver as good as the compact one.</li>
            <li> It is almost as good as going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Good for preventing plaque and conditioning gums.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this toothbrush, be prepared to give a good week or two to get used to the vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Elite was still good for about 2-3 days around the end of the 5.5 year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: As much as I loved this toothbrush, I would never buy a sonicare again.</li>
            <li> Loved it while it worked.</li>
            <li> I am wondering now if that was a good choice.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> When I purchased it and used for two weeks I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> My family and I loved this product and had looked forward to using it.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as it should be for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a good quality electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This took me a good 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> I suspect this one is superior.</li>
            <li> I suspect this one is superior.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a Sonicare toothbrush, but they just weren&#x27;t made as good 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I charge this brush once a week for a couple hours and it is good to go.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I had one 20 years ago....and loved it.  </li>
            <li> so that is good.  </li>
            <li> good product, does what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Looked good, seemed to work.</li>
            <li> people have had good results unplugging the chargers for a period of time to reset them.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to be good at this point.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist raves on the good job I am doing.</li>
            <li> With free shipping, it was the best price on the internet.</li>
            <li> There are two ways that this brush is superior in this regard.</li>
            <li> Good value.  </li>
            <li> I loved the job this did on my teeth</li>
            <li> It is a good toothbrush when it is working</li>
            <li> I have had good dental reviews</li>
            <li> Yes, it looks fancy, but it won&#x27;t do you any good if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It is just that good.</li>
            <li> My dentist approves (good check ups).</li>
            <li> The best part is that my gums haven&#x27;t bled since I started using this, because now I don&#x27;t have to apply lots of pressure to feel like my teeth are getting clean.</li>
            <li> and I was looking everywhere for the best price or a special</li>
            <li> UPDATE [1/27/13]: Still going strong!!</li>
            <li> Battery life is exceptional.</li>
            <li> but this one is exceptional.  </li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, gentle on the gums &amp; the massage feels incredible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this toothbrush for a couple of months and am super impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Like many others, we loved the toothbrush for its cleaning effectiveness - works great.  </li>
            <li> If you use an HX6972, make sure that you put the toothbrush into your mouth before turning the device on: Toothpaste will fly off the toothbrush before it reaches your mouth if you turn the brush on before it&#x27;s in the mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been more than happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> oh, and who doesn&#x27;t love going to the dentest and hearing that you&#x27;ve done a great job.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product...</li>
            <li> Works great, holds a charge for many days.</li>
            <li> We also found out that our son owns a Sonicare and is very satisfied with his brush as well.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I owned a Sonicare Elite, and it gave me many years of great service, but it was time to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B&#x27;s circular brush heads seem to work better in cleaning and I am happy with my Oral-B, even though it seems like Oral-B needs to scout some people from Sonicare&#x27;s design team.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> every 30 secs is quite useful and the UV sterilizer is awesome</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> so I bought me this model and once again I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I are very pleased with the results that this model provides</li>
            <li> He is very pleased with the way his teeth look after using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My teeth look great and my checkups are better than ever</li>
            <li> And it makes the dentist happy :)</li>
            <li> Ive had the toothbrush for about two weeks now and am very pleased with my state of the art oral hygiene product.</li>
            <li> of the box, I see that the handle is slimmer than the others, sleeker and much more attractive; and the cleaning modes are displayed on the handle.  </li>
            <li> the most attractive I&#x27;ve seen with the Sonicare</li>
            <li> Very pleased with results</li>
            <li> This product is in a beta phase at best and that is being complimentary.</li>
            <li> I love electric toothbrushes; this one is great because it comes with a travel case and UV to kill germs.</li>
            <li> have to say that being able to travel without having to bring a power cord is great.  </li>
            <li> Am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by dentist - happy with the many choices you have to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> it is great too, and I love the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, I love it.</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED WITH IT,</li>
            <li> We did not know what to expect when we ordered and are very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist to reduce plaque and improve gum health, I have been very satisfied that this product delivers.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush with some skepticism, but had some good reviews from friends who own it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so nice not to have to sneak in a good brush while at the neighbor&#x27;s house.  </li>
            <li> Still I bought another one on my own because I loved it.  </li>
            <li> It has many wonderful features and  is easy to use</li>
            <li> Excellent product the single best thing I have done to improve my dental heath period</li>
            <li> I have very good check-ups and this toothbrush makes my teeth feel sooooooo clean.  </li>
            <li> I was sold on the compact size of the Flexcare Plus, and I was especially pleased with the antimicrobial light that magically dissipated germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This has to be the most perfect toothbrush available.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are very strong which allow for a superior cleaning session.</li>
            <li> If a family---you&#x27;ll need more than one power wand, since if one of you is traveling, who gets custody of the Sonicare becomes an issue!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love it!  </li>
            <li> but frankly I don&#x27;t have much more to say about a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love the bonus of a built-in sanitizer on my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cleaner feeling mouth and better results from a toothbrush, this is the one you wnat to buy!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> First of all its a great brush!    </li>
            <li> SO MUCH BETTER than Oral B electric that I had!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that if I have a problem though that Philips will take care of it!</li>
            <li> If your brush breaks be sure to contact customer service!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this model which is supposed to be the latest and greatest.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare!</li>

            <li> This is a sophisticated mouth care system!</li>
            <li> I love brushing my teeth now!  </li>
            <li> and we love it!</li>
            <li> this one is even better!  </li>
            <li> Better save your receipt and pray they break within the warranty period or you will be out of luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two years now and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!</li>
            <li> I love my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush!</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;d say top notch - at cleaning your teeth!  </li>
            <li> Now that I have this, I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I also like the idea of being able to sanitize your brush!</li>
            <li> Better than anticipated!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is outstanding!  </li>
            <li> I love not having to watch the clock anymore!  </li>
            <li> Who can ask for more!</li>
            <li> Running something through the dishwasher is one of the best ways to make sure that it&#x27;s clean.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve upped my rating from 1 to 3 stars, as Philips customer service quickly honored the warranty with no-fuss and very good service.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy way to shop.     </li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus has great easy to use features.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase and would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and happy with results.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush that can be easily shared between household members.</li>
            <li> The quality of this item is amazing.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use any whitening products, so it was amazing that after a week, it was so noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Amazing toothbrush, but the handle broke after 4 months.</li>
            <li> What an amazing brushing experience.</li>
            <li> Amazing toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is an amazing feeling.</li>
            <li> The feel of the toothbrush is comfortable and the brush does a great job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> its amazing</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for over 6 months and it has done an amazing job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> this toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Totally amazing battery life.</li>
            <li> Great design and features and fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the UV sanitizer, as I have yet to use it, but the brush itself is amazing.  </li>
            <li> After using this, albeit irregularly, for a month, she commented on the amazing difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I think this toothbrush is amazing and</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m depending upon the brush rather than watching my own clock or watch, but it seems to be shorter than 30 seconds per quarter section.</li>
            <li> emails from the south korean company assured me that if i bought an adaptor plug, that i could use it in the usa.&lt;br /&gt;the south korean company emails were nice, but they didn&#x27;t understand that i didn&#x27;t order what they sent me, and i didn&#x27;t want to buy an adaptor</li>
            <li> The handle of the toothbrush has a nice grip.  </li>
            <li> Once done, however, it was nice to get the excess cord out of the way</li>
            <li> The 1 minute gum cycle has it&#x27;s own quadpacer as well, which is kind of neat.    </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner and the options are amazing!!!</li>
            <li> really was wonderful otherwise.</li>
            <li> I had this toothbrush for one year, and was loving it.  </li>
            <li> and if you are healthy, there should be a good balance and</li>
            <li> you are your own hygienist.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how effective it truly is</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has impressed me so much</li>
            <li> Excellent product and speedy fast delivery</li>
            <li> Have used this toothbrush since July 2012 and really liked it, however it just died after almost 3 years of use.  </li>
            <li> The UV Sanitizer seems like a nice add-on</li>
            <li> Travel holder is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> A phillips Electric Toothbrushes in the home is like having yur own dental therapist and chair.</li>
            <li> The UV is a nice added feature and it even comes with a travel case.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great leaves your teeth feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I did some research that suggests that UV Sanitizers are effective, but that is taking someone else&#x27;s word for it.  </li>
            <li> Plus the UV head cleaner is a nice bonus 2.)</li>
            <li> I called Philips and they said that the brush falling off its own stand onto the counter is like my dropping it.  </li>
            <li> - The mode display is invisible when it&#x27;s off, which looks nice    </li>
            <li> I really liked the sanitizer as well as I&#x27;ve also been one of those people concerned about germs on my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This one has its own sanitizer/autoclave for the brush</li>
            <li> Nice feature, if you travel even occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> but it broke after 5 years which was my own fault.</li>
            <li> Loving it every day since the day I started using it.    </li>
            <li> I just wanted to offset those reports with my own experience.  </li>
            <li> Perfect purchase for someone who wants to keep their teeth.</li>
            <li> this handy FlexCare +</li>
            <li> Includes travel case and charger which is handy.  </li>
            <li> The case protects the toothbrush nicely.</li>
            <li> The colored rings are a nice touch</li>
            <li> Nice of them.  </li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> this is the latest and most improved model and looks great.     </li>
            <li> Nice travel container for brush and brush-heads as well.</li>
            <li> which makes a good deal even better.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it will keep your gums clean and make your trips to the dentist more pleasant.</li>
            <li> the uv rays for the tooth head is really nice</li>
            <li> he asked me what kind of toothbrush I use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I have no idea</li>
            <li> I have been a good customer of amazon but not any more.  </li>
            <li> The sonic cleaner is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but gets under the gum line nicely.</li>
            <li> -- they don&#x27;t tell us that kind of thing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice that it has the 2-minute timer so that you have a set time for brushing.  </li>
            <li> It is really nice and my teeth feels like I just had the cleaning done yesterday.  </li>
            <li> but I feel it would be nice if Phillips could correct this somehow -</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it were a bit louder</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> The travel case is perfect and very useful.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> I liked this, but it broke.  </li>
            <li> nice travel case</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t dispense toothpaste (Intelliclean does, but I honestly didn&#x27;t care for that feature.  </li>
            <li> Another nice thing was that my gums don&#x27;t bleed when I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re into aesthetics, this one looks really nice on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re into aesthetics, this one looks really nice on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> sonicare does a better job at removing stains and giving a good \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feel.</li>
            <li> Aside from vibrating quite loudly, I really liked this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Travel charger is nice and compact.</li>
            <li> Now that I own this brand, I would never consider another brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> anywhere, not on Amazon, not even on Philips&#x27; own site</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> also found the UV thing nice</li>
            <li> The travel case is really nice</li>
            <li> I like electric toothbrushes, and it&#x27;s nice that it has a brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> This has a nice timer that gets me to brush longer.</li>
            <li> It was nice while it lasted though, so I won&#x27;t rate it a 1.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it -</li>
            <li> travel pack is a nice addition.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning/charging station is a nice touch also.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Not what I expect after making that kind of investment in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The sterilizing option is also nice since it takes no time at all to run</li>
            <li> are so nice to have.</li>
            <li> I liked this tooth brush a lot.</li>
            <li> It comes with a handy travel case with brush head covers.  </li>
            <li> Works great, perhaps too many features that most people will not use (\\&quot;massage\\&quot; setting?</li>
            <li> Get yourself a nice Oral-B and a separate UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> leaves your teeth feeling very clean!</li>
            <li> Also, the addition of the UV light to sterilize the heads is very nice.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush that is worth the price!</li>
            <li> The original Sonicare helped greatly with that.  </li>
            <li> .... SMILE ON!!!</li>
            <li> I know I don&#x27;t floss as often as I should, but the Sonicare does a great job keeping my teeth and gum line clean.</li>
            <li> This particular Philips Sonicare is the best one they make.</li>
            <li> We had used an older version of the Sonicare toothbrush for years, and although it did an excellent job of cleaning our teeth, it had some drawbacks.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel perfectly clean and gums feel great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I don&#x27;t feel my teeth are clean unless I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> What a great clean feeling from soniccare.</li>
            <li> It did clean my teeth great</li>
            <li> It works great to clean all areas of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> At first they worked very  good, performed as advertised.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good investment if you want clean teeth!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance and am pleased with my selection.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and satisfied.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean!!</li>
            <li> If the handle still does not stay charged, my best suggestion would be to purchase a new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is awesome because everytime you use it it feels like you&#x27;re using a brand new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Ordering new heads will be a good idea !!</li>
            <li> I bought on a trip to New York and everything has been perfect.</li>
            <li> I admittedly experienced some \\&quot;sticker shock\\&quot; when I started looking, but after two weeks of using this toothbrush I enjoy brushing, feel better and my teeth look whiter and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> It is so much more compact, light, and feels great in the hand while brushing.  </li>
            <li> Look nowhere else, Amazon offers the best price on this amazing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great 30 sec warning is awesome !!</li>
            <li> Being able to UV the heads and toss on a nice sterile one is a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you are a good or excellent brusher (i.e. you brush rigorously and thoroughly multiple times a day), then I do NOT recommend you buy this product.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is awesome and it has really helped me brush better</li>
            <li> my whole mouth just feels healthy dentist was very impressed and is now advertising this brush with pamplets def</li>
            <li> the stand and brush cleaner good but could be more fitting for the bathroom enviroment.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the product and feel it is more gentle than the non-electric Oral-B toothbrushes I had been using for years.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t believe it for my self until i tried it, this sonicare flexcare plus is amazing, this brush have your teeth feeling squeaky clean and have your mouth fresh and wonderful.</li>
            <li> The front of the handle will highlight which mode you are in, and it is very easy to tell which mode is highlighted.  </li>

            <li> love love looooooooooooooooove!</li>
            <li> I checked all over the web and found the best price (by far) on Amazon!</li>
            <li> It has been the perfect replacement for our old Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with this purchase and purchase experience!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product, it works well and gives me the great smile and healthy mouth I want.</li>
            <li> If I had rated it right after I got it, it would have received five stars as I liked all the features and, according to my hygienist, it did a great job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine and does just as good a job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine and does just as good a job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> say.&lt;br /&gt;working fine, the way i wanted, and good design!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This one is the best of the ones I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Your teeth and gums feel real clean when finished.  </li>
            <li> Great buy, it was really worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> Nice design :)</li>
            <li> The dentists tell me it&#x27;s far and away the most effective cleaning tool, so I use it diligently, and now they say my home care (which also includes twice-daily flossing) is excellent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is by far the best toothbrush I have used and</li>
            <li> By far the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I like most every Phillips/Norellco product that I own.</li>
            <li> Update: over 3 years old now still perfect!</li>
            <li> A great investment for my smile.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush that I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> So far, it is working wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> That is also a nice feature, because most don&#x27;t think of that when they start with this type of brush.  </li>
            <li> Purchased two of these thinking it was a wonderful deal from such a reputable company with a superior brand of sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> so I can find a suitable substitute?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth bright and smooth.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to be able to change while the brush was running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is the ability to change out the colored rings at the bottom of the toothbrush heads, allowing you to keep track of which head is yours, so more than one person can use the unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros - Excellent reach, cleaning action &amp; ease of</li>
            <li> This Philips Sonicare is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> old has received an EXCELLENT bill of dental health since I purchased this toothbrush January 22, 2011.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare tooth brushes for years and this is the best model so far.</li>
            <li> Has anyone found a good supplier for the bulbs that fit into the UV compartment?</li>
            <li> My gums have improved greatly and so has my smile.</li>
            <li> and then see if there is more clarity about what kind to replace it with.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very good clean feeling after every clean.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and works great even after more than six months of use.  </li>
            <li> Much to my surprise and the surprise of my dentist, I had a perfect checkup with an easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li> so I returned it, Amazon did a great job, they sent me the replacement unit right away.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve also traveled with it a couple of times now, and it has easily held its charge for an extended weekend trip (so, i can vouch for about 3 days with no worries!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely Easy to use, and charging it is a breeze!</li>
            <li> love it, love it, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> But happily they did not - they replaced the malfunctioning brush (the charger/UV light thing was fine) for</li>
            <li> Very good for teeth and gums and is highly recommended by my dentist and oral hygienist.</li>
            <li> Great product with great customer service to back it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product with great customer service to back it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still say a soft or ultrasoft bristled brush is the best for MOST people.</li>
            <li> I liked it better than the top model Oral B electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Greatly improves oral hygiene, easy to use and keeps your teeth deeply clean.</li>
            <li> As I am not a man of many words, I will say this: \\&quot;It is by far the best toothbrush I have ever owned.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> really is a good product that does what it is designed to -- i.e., thoroughly clean teeth and massage gums in the process.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m smiling a pearly and healthy smile about a great product and no questions asked warranty.  </li>
            <li> The product times out your brushes on each part of your mouth so that you get it good and clean...</li>
            <li> Love the sonicare toothbrush, this is my first electric toothbrush and it truly is a great product for getting your teeth clean!!</li>
            <li> Great product to keep your teeth healthy and help brush for the right amount of time.  </li>
            <li> That was a great addition and on a recent overseas trip with my wife came in very handy.      </li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and was extremely happy with it for the first couple of months.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, but don&#x27;t know how it measures up against this.</li>
            <li> It worked great when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It kills the germs and also just makes a great place to keep the brush heads between brushings to reduce the amount of germs that ever touch them in the first place.</li>
            <li> This flexcare plus brush is a HUGE improvement over earlir models in ease of use, feel, maneurverability, Very satisfied with product.  </li>
            <li> The gradual increase in strength when you first start using it was a welcome feature.  </li>
            <li> product works great, exactly as described, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product and it&#x27;s doing exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> The built-in timer is good to prevent cheating by brushing each portion of the mouth for the full time period.      </li>
            <li> It seems to clean fairly well, and my gums do feel healthier, if nothing more.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is great - my teeth &amp; mouth feel clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> The UV light is great,  I also like that I can put the brush heads in the case and close it to keep the brushes clean.  </li>
            <li> Works fine and is not costing me a fortune!</li>
            <li> Very easy, very clean.</li>
            <li> I am a neat freak so having that was very important.</li>
            <li> it is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush, dentist feeling clean every day!</li>
            <li> Amazing results and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever, i highly recommend it, cleans well and is very powerful with a lot of features.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is that replacement heads are easy to find and not too pricey.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference just with the color of my teeth and my dentist is pleased with the condition of my teeth since I started using this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Divide the number of uses into what you paid and see what you get, not to mention the beautiful smile and lovely breath that everyone gets to enjoy</li>
            <li> This one does have more power, does hold a charge longer (two+ weeks), does offer more brushing options, and is sleek, modern, beautiful.  </li>
            <li> and I consider a dishwasher safe handle to be a very important feature.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean the brush head and the unit itself, run it thru warm water and UV sanitizer for additional cleaning  5.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with how clean it keeps my teeth.  </li>
            <li> In the end, I&#x27;m really glad I decided on this</li>
            <li> Gotta say how much I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Wait for respectable pricing (list price is outlandish) and rebate opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has many options on how to brush.</li>
            <li> Most notably is the \\&quot;new\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li> So if wanted to know the differences, there you go, you probably now know more than you wanted about a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have been using the predecessor Philips Sonicare FlexCare for 16 months (and this brush for a week) and love the brush and the company.  </li>
            <li> While it is inexpensive to replace a manual toothbrush every couple of weeks, we tend to keep the $13 electric heads for a couple of months, putting them at greater risk of harboring an infection.     </li>
            <li> I discovered one interesting thing upon reading the directions.  </li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t bunched up on the counter top.     </li>
            <li> and I wanted to be sure I rated this one 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> The biggest drawback was the screw-on top.  </li>
            <li> the travel pack is much more compact and accomodates two brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I love the brush sanitizer and my teeth</li>
            <li> But overall very happy</li>
            <li> She explained to me how it covers so much more of the tooth area than the Oral B. Being that she had one in the office</li>
            <li> , she turned it on to let me feel the sonic vibrations that cleaned the tooth area a thousand times better.  </li>
            <li> I love the santitizing or however you spell it, being able to swap out brush heads is convenient (sp) so that you pay one time for the brush and then just replace the top.</li>
            <li> I feel that Oral B cleans my teeth better.  </li>
            <li> I expect my gums will be in much better shape.</li>
            <li> My hygienist has me spending much more time brushing my teeth than the \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; says...</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush after a lot of research and many family members recommending Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Okay.  </li>
            <li> Okay.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it should be better quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that actually delivers.  </li>
            <li> I love the UV brush heads sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> Just the thought of not having bacteria hanging around your toothbrush heads ..is fantastic: for hygiene purposes !</li>
            <li> in life you get what you pay for and this toothbrush delivers all it promises and more.  </li>
            <li> My gums use to bleed but now after 2 weeks of using this my gums have stopped bleeding and are getting much better.</li>
            <li> this is a great toothbrush, works very well.    </li>
            <li> Love all the features.</li>
            <li> I have owned Sonicare products for many years</li>
            <li> We now use the Flexcare Plus and love it.  </li>
            <li> , I love how the toothbrush has a break-in period</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are whiter, and my dentist surely noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Despite the premature demise, I am satisfied with this machine.</li>
            <li> Love it, your teeth will love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the selections on the power toothbrush, the feeling of a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; dental cleaning each and every time I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I would expect to receive greater longevity from this product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> this is my third Sonicare toothbrush, and the best.</li>
            <li> From the more intensive and longer \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; to the \\&quot;Refresh\\&quot; mode, there&#x27;s something here for even the most rushed of users.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes brushing easier and more efficient,</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li> OMG this Sonicare is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad bought it.</li>
            <li> Could not have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li> With my sonicare, I love feeling my teeth throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Although I wish it came with more replaceable heads than one.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> the Sonicare is much better.</li>
            <li> , I go for \\&quot;Flexcare plus\\&quot; thinking it will be slightly better.      </li>
            <li> you will not regret it :)</li>
            <li> I wish it had more than a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> But I love, love this Sonicare Flexcare</li>
            <li> I prefer to pay top dollar and have NO problems.  </li>
            <li> It has a hefty handle, but performs so much better.  </li>
            <li> Ok...</li>
            <li> I prefer to pay top dollar and have NO problems.  </li>
            <li> It has a hefty handle, but performs so much better.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.   </li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> but now I love it.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes more adjustment on the part of the operator.  </li>
            <li> They just keep getting better.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise love it.</li>
            <li> If you care to drop over $100 on a toothbrush, this appears to have the endorsement of many dentists.</li>
            <li> I was spending more than two minutes longer brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> Because we have had it more than one month CVS Pharmacy will not exchange it or let us return it for a credit.</li>
            <li> Even with these issues this is the top of the line Cadillac of cordless tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your tooth brush!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not to many quality products anymore</li>
            <li> It continues to make a sound as if it&#x27;s working, but there are no vibrations of any kind in the brush itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the ones you buy in the grocery store and this is sooooo much better.  </li>
            <li> Again, this is sooooo much better.  </li>
            <li> I brush my teeth even more now than I ever did and even floss more.    </li>
            <li> Especially liked that I could take it with me traveling for short trips without having to bring a charger.  </li>
            <li> I felt this was just more practical.</li>
            <li> I reviewed electric toothbrushes on the net, and this one came up the best.</li>
            <li> I love the timer on it and the fact that you can do 2 or 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> He did not like the feeling of the vibration, so I gladly tried it out.</li>
            <li> I love how my teeth feel every morning and evening.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is rated for 42 two minute brushings, but I don&#x27;t think most people will ever put this to the test.  </li>
            <li> and I love it -</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The Pro Results toothbrush is our 3rd Sonicare, and the best yet.</li>
            <li> They seem to do a better job cleaning my teeth, which is probably why my dentist recommends them.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m always sure to put it in my mouth before I turn it on, so that the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t go flying.</li>
            <li> I love the &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; mode on this model.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts longer and the charging station is much better.  </li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t been able to activate my warranty.  </li>
            <li> speaking, the best feature is the timer, most people don&#x27;t spend enough time to brush their teeth...by having a timer</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s why mostly people can see the difference&lt;</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for over a decade and love the product.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for your family works really well</li>
            <li> And if those features matter to you, I am sure you will agree.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare Flexcare+ is all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be and more.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Does a GREAT job, highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> and I love having the UV Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I never use more than one or two settings, and I can tell when I need to change my bristles, and</li>
            <li> I love it still...</li>
            <li> Overall best tooth brush on the market.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> &quot; I am much more motivated to brush my teeth twice a day now.</li>
            <li> This is our fourth Sonicare and we are very happy with the results of our oral health since we started using the Sonicare line.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, with that said, look around for a better price than Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> more time for gums if needed and the refresh mode for brushing after meals.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s much better than a $3 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My experience, like so many others, was that one night, about two years after I purchased this item, it started turning on and off by itself.</li>
            <li> I love that the box came with an additional charger and also a travel case.</li>
            <li> Works much better than any battery powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, and much much better than any manual</li>
            <li> AND WHEN I FILLED OUT AND ASK FOR THE REBATE ,THEY DIDNT HONOR IT !</li>
            <li> i cant do that many strokes in six months</li>
            <li> The thing is all it says and more; I can&#x27;t imagine not having it now.</li>
            <li> But still, at this price I&#x27;d expect something much better.</li>
            <li> Love the tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Just called and they don&#x27;t have any record of the agent telling me that they had to accept the return before sending another, and they sure haven&#x27;t sent one.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with it</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much better than brushing manually.  </li>
            <li> Love love</li>
            <li> , and thought this model is a step up so it has to be even better.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare beats the Oral-B in most aspects except for the function in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I should have given it more time, but I just felt it wasn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B handles and brush heads are cheaper and there are more varieties of brush heads as well</li>
            <li> and I am brushing more often.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush takes all of the guesswork out of it and does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> I do like the size of the handle, and the battery lasts many days, even if using 2-3 times per day.    </li>
            <li> It may cost a bit more</li>
            <li> Works better then a brushing and faster.</li>
            <li> But what I&#x27;m most pleased about is the bacteria</li>
            <li> -killing compartment:  after each use I put the brush part inside the door, close it, press the top button, and voila.  </li>
            <li> Got the product, took a day getting used to, but now I love the thing.</li>
            <li> -I LOVE the UV sterilization of the brushes  </li>
            <li> BUT- at my last appointment, he told me that my gums had improved dramatically and my teeth look great!</li>
            <li> Plus it looks like a space toothbrush, and who doesn&#x27;t love space?</li>
            <li> Sure, they&#x27;re coming out soon, but I&#x27;d still prefer they didn&#x27;t rot before that happens.    </li>
            <li> Plus is simply the BEST electric toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Glad to see that technology has improved.</li>
            <li> Overall, Sonicare is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time, and I am well pleased.  </li>
            <li> Wish it came with more brush heads though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> I also like the way it charges giving you many hours of use.</li>
            <li> I have been using oral b electric for many years, then switched to soniccare based on my hygenist recommendation.</li>
            <li> year on I&#x27;m more generous with my review.  </li>
            <li> Plus is even better.</li>
            <li> Thats about it for cons, when I have more problems with the unit I will edit.      </li>
            <li> I love having the UV Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I have been MORE than satisfied with this purchase....</li>
            <li> my teeth feel completely smooth and I can&#x27;t feel any residual plaque build up!  </li>
            <li> I feel like this was a worthwhile purchase</li>
            <li> Once every 3 days is a better</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Purchased August 24th, 2011 &amp; I enjoyed it while it lasted, but it broke on Feb 17th, 2012.  </li>
            <li> This is the most effective prevention of gum disease available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> A web search provides a more problematic assessment of the long-term value this purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> One more thing I have to mention, ever since I began using this brush, my dentist tells me at every cleaning that I am plaque and tarter free!</li>
            <li> One more thing I have to mention, ever since I began using this brush, my dentist tells me at every cleaning that I am plaque and tarter free!</li>
            <li> Since I have braces, I need to replace brush heads sooner than most people, so saving money on these brush heads is a plus.    </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it comes with a sanitizer too.</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for more years than I can remember.  </li>

            <li> This item was shared by my husband and I, used at most 4 times a day.  </li>

            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> Many differemnt cleaning power/levels.</li>
            <li> I read and googled as many reviews as I could find and this was the toothbrush that was getting all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure</li>
            <li> He said it cleans better (I agree, but I never though he would give in).    </li>
            <li> I love the timing devise on this.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I purchase this toothbrush in order to take better care of my all around dental health.</li>

            <li> Completely satisfied with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t make a better recommendation.</li>
            <li> definately better than brushing with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The travel case is so cute.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> Such a good feeling!!  </li>
            <li> I love the sanitizer that cleans your brush heads when you are done using them for the day.  </li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my Sonicare Toothbrush and like the added feature of being able to sterilize my brush.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this electric toothbrush more than a year ago.</li>
            <li> dental checkups have gone much better since I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Had used the Sonicare ProResults for years and were pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I notice that food never gets stuck in the brush--it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these and love them.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, for $35 - $36 I used to be able to get 2 replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Sonicare slightly more</li>
            <li> He has been able to get his teeth to a respectable whitened level even though he still smokes and drinks the drinks that discolor his teeth.  </li>
            <li> so I guess this is working the magic.</li>
            <li> It arrives with more than one brush, which allows my husband and I to both use the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love the sanitizer unit.</li>
            <li> I now do not have to remove a plug to be able to plug in a hair</li>
            <li> I love the sanitizer unit.  </li>
            <li> so well it seems to do most of the work of flossing; it even cleans between teeth.  </li>
            <li> Im so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> Thorough cleaning plus the brush heads are able to be sanitized.</li>
            <li> They should figure out their product better.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Get better dentist reports.  </li>
            <li> now they say i&#x27;m brushing much better.</li>
            <li> I am currently wearing braces and am very happy I have this toothbrush, gives me the comfort of knowing I effortlessly reach all the corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;I was able to try this toothbrush through the Amazon Vine program or I probably would have gone on using my Philips Sonicare R710 HealthyWhite Power model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to try this toothbrush through the Amazon Vine program or I probably would have gone on using my Philips Sonicare R710 HealthyWhite Power model.</li>

            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If go for the ProResults compact version, it&#x27;s even tinier than the Elite compact version, which allows for more focused brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Pros:  - Much better design for attaching the brush head.  </li>
            <li> Glad that&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> - More compact carrying case  -</li>
            <li> I then upgraded to an arm and hammer rechargeable sonicare brush, which was better than the Oral B.    </li>
            <li> Even though my unit was out of warranty (though the closeness of the expiration date had a lot to do with it, I&#x27;m sure).</li>
            <li> Too many, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I DID AND IM COMPLETELY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> My gum has been getting better condition and no bleeding any more.  </li>
            <li> After a very short period of adjusting the results are excellent.  </li>
            <li> I was told I needed to take better care of my teeth which woke me up.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it for cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Quite an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> Why did it take me so many years to try the Sonicare????&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon and love, love, love...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> i was always using manual tooth brush, but was always told that electric cleans so much better.</li>
            <li> That said, you need more time to brush than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> My wife and I shared an Oral B electric toothbrush for many years now.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I absoulutly love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I also love how you can remove the tips and have them cleaned in the machines that they send with it.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was so pleased.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel more polished, almost like a dental hygienist cleaned them, and coffee stains are removed much more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> sure which one) of the Sonicare</li>
            <li> While I have had a friend years ago recommend one, I have tended to prefer Oral-B manual toothbrushes for years, so they were at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> it does such a perfect job&lt;</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I probably should start using it more often, but this is a purchase that I am continually pleased I made.  </li>
            <li> , I would rate this Philips as the top of the list for premier automatic/electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush based on reviews and after a week, I&#x27;m definitely glad I followed the advice of my fellow Amazonians.</li>
            <li> &amp; I am very happy with the 2 different brush sizes.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is okay~</li>
            <li> They are SO much better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, love the timer.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;going to purchase one for my husband and kids too</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and my gums have never been better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way it makes my teeth feel</li>
            <li> Panasonic customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li> Brushing longer with better results.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the sonicare tooth brush.</li>
            <li> so I treat my teeth a bit better, and unconsciously so.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has a travel charger that I can use on the go.</li>
            <li> Still, I I like the Sonicare line and have been using them for about 5 or more years now.</li>
            <li> My dentist will be very happy to see me next</li>
            <li> I love that it has a built in UV brush head sanitizer</li>
            <li> most likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just &#x27;next day&#x27; bought another one from Amazon, hoping the best . . .</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the self cleaning feature</li>
            <li> The UltraViolet light stopped working again!  </li>
            <li> Amazon sent it again to me FREE OF CHARGE!</li>
            <li> My dentist also sells them at his office which tells me its a reputable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m even more pleases with</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I desided to try them again.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with this item.  </li>
            <li> Also, I love the UV cleaning chamber.</li>
            <li> (and I love the UV sanitizer, won&#x27;t buy a model that doesn&#x27;t have this feature).</li>
            <li> Much better than Oral B version that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After this I bought the Diamond Care version to for travel - love the travel case on that one....</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> Still great, very reliable.</li>
            <li> The Flexcare plus is somewhat better designed than the Flexcare</li>
            <li> I love the timer that tells you when to change positions and I like the cleaner.</li>
            <li> Its a good brush and has performed perfectly until about a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> But on a brighter note, for those months we had it, it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> However, a spinbrush for $4 plus batteries is better than a non working Sonicare that cost $129, plus tax, and</li>
            <li> It needs better care instructions if that&#x27;s the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My review has been changed for the BETTER.  : )</li>
            <li> i really do love this all around no complaints and the battery holds every well in between charges.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> i have been using it for a couple of months and feel satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the quad pacer function, 30 seconds on each part</li>
            <li> I really love the settings as they adjust either the timing or the pulsations.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE</li>
            <li> I love the various cycles that you can choose from, and my hygienist is very impressed with how well it controls tartar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a hack to get around using Phillips heads though.</li>
            <li> And love the massage functions for gums.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Does everything I expect from it and more.</li>
            <li> I l absolutely love the timer on this thing.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Simply the best one in the market I would</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Also, LOVE the fact it has the UV Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I love using this tooth brush, I look forward to brushing my teeth every morning now.</li>
            <li> The feeling in your mouth is like a tooth brush massage. :)</li>
            <li> I want to quantify my 3 star review of the Sonicare by saying I love this toothbrush and the sonicare brand of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say how glad I am that I purchased this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love that!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I am extremely satisfied</li>
            <li> Nicely made, UV sterilizer light is brighter than I would like at night, but does go off by itself.</li>
            <li> It vibrates many times faster than the battery powered brushes one can buy at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Among many desirable features, it has an automatic timer that lets you know when the recommended 2 minutes has expired.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Three settings are more than sufficient.  </li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love not having to do the brushing because this toothbrush does it for ya.</li>
            <li> After using many times, I have noticed that my gum doesn&#x27;t hurts anymore.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of days, I am very happy with the way it cleans my teeth and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> Ive never used a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love the gum option for stimulating the gums.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am just glad that it did not burn the house</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It does an outstanding job cleaning your teeth, and is built sturdy.</li>
            <li> I like the whole sonic approach to teeth cleaning and this product does a great job.</li>
            <li> geezus, ok I digress on with the review.</li>
            <li> Worked ok for about a year.</li>
            <li> I had a simpler one before for many years and enjoyed it a lot.</li>
            <li> This brush is even better.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the power and</li>
            <li> This is just another bells and whistles product to get the consumer to part with more money.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with it</li>
            <li> but i feel that this device helps me take better care of my teeth - and probably reduces the visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> love it and my dentist appointments improved</li>
            <li> Chatted online with Alan this evening (who&#x27;s English was not the best)</li>
            <li> just makes everything more convenient.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonic Care toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Do a much better job than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I owned an older Philips Sonicare and loved it; this one is much better!  </li>
            <li> But, if you&#x27;re going to get one, you might as well get a good one, right?  </li>
            <li> Cleans very effectively, and really like the drier</li>
            <li> bought this electric toothbrush because I had an older model Philips rechargeable toothbrush that worked great and lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, it makes my mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> i really love this product, i got braces so its very easy and comfortable to brush teeth with it.</li>
            <li> After dutifully doing the 24-hour battery charge, I was very excited to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> So far we&#x27;re all good!</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer really is effective for killing microorganisms; the debate is whether this is clinically significant.  </li>
            <li> I use the UV thing after every brushing and it&#x27;s nice to know that my toothbrush is clean.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing effective - really clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is nice and gives me peace of mind knowing my brush is clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth also feel nice and clean when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great, we had the older style, and crud used to build up inside the nadle and the brush heads.</li>
            <li> It keeps my brushes clean, and it is also a handy docking station.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for more than fifteen years and have had pretty good dental checkups during that time.  </li>
            <li> Most ,if not all, reviews were pretty good</li>
            <li> The way the device charges is great and it does not have to be plugged in ALL the time, the charge lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WHO WANT GREAT DENTAL HEALTH.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Buy more brush heads to share with family members, very easy to detach and clean.    </li>
            <li> She also commented that I had a \\&quot;very clean</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth very clean.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are getting the best care in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know hoe effective the \\&quot;sanitizer\\&quot; is but it looks cool anyway.</li>
            <li> Brush size is perfect and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Contacted customer support and the warrantee is good for exactly:: 2 years.</li>
            <li> and I loved it when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First things first this is a well crafted device and it feels good in your hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, easy and thorough!</li>
            <li> This is a great device, actually it&#x27;s a little too great.  </li>
            <li> WORTH THE INVESTMENT!!</li>
            <li> He had a GREAT checkup and raved about the Sonicare saying that he wasn&#x27;t flossing, it was the new toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> Functionally, I&#x27;m happy with the new design.</li>
            <li> That was great customer service and the new U/V sanitizer</li>
            <li> I was happy to see the new features included in this model.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer does a quick and effective job of that.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, gets my teeth cleaner than I&#x27;ve ever been able to accomplish; and the gum treatment sequence is an added plus.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about my sonicare except: I wish the Philips would find a way to make the batteries easily replaceable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it makes me feel better about the cleanliness of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> While it is inexpensive to replace a manual toothbrush every couple of weeks, we tend to keep the $13 electric heads for a couple of months, putting them at greater risk of harboring an infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the cost and convenience of a sanitizer make it a reasonable addition to good oral hygiene regime.lf of them used one anyway.      </li>
            <li> I also love being able to sterilize the bristles with the UV light.</li>
            <li> In short, this is a good product with a fair price tag.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own a sonic care you are missing out on one of the greatest inventions of whenever it was invented.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money ,I give it good point for being versitle and easy to use for anyboby that wants a good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot but to be honest I gave it up since I travel so much.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and got an extra six months on the warranty for free by registering online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to keep clean and with the sanitizer don&#x27;t have to worry about bathroom germs.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and thought it would irritate but it feels great and gums are becoming healthy.</li>
            <li> Makes you want to smile more!</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth very smooth and clean; keeps my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after using it and my teeth looked whiter after just a couple days!  </li>
            <li> my teeth have never felt so clean!  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel and look so clean that it feels like I&#x27;ve gone to the dentist every time I brush my teeth!  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;+multiple settings that, while I imagine most people wont switch between, allows you to fine tune it to your mouths</li>
            <li> When it came time to use it, I felt like the Oral-B didn&#x27;t clean my teeth at all!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel straight-from-the-dentist clean!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel after using the Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Sonicare cleans my teeth SO clean!</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth and gums so clean!  </li>
            <li> My teeth feels clean than ever!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean now!</li>
            <li> Although this was a bit concerning, I was still ok with it because it worked fine.</li>
            <li> have contacted Philips and they were very nice and say they are sending me a new handle.  </li>
            <li> Its great because I really feel like my teeth are clean after.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve loved my older Sonicare and this one is even better.</li>
            <li> I also use a waterpik (can&#x27;t think of the brand at the moment) along with the Sonicare and it had really done a great job at keeping my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> these things really clean better and more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job and my teeth really feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and your teeth feel very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> The unit itself is very good and feels solid.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this model for anybody looking for a very good tootbrush.</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li> However the toothbrush is amazing, definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, with complete features, to take care of your oral care</li>
            <li> Even better, this unit has an ultraviolet light that kills germs and keeps the brush sanitary.</li>
            <li> Looks like brushing our teeth is becoming a \\&quot;shared family experience\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner and more smooth before I started using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think that is available anymore, but their system is way more efficient.</li>
            <li> Mostly, I just enjoy this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best money spent.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, but stopped working completely within one year of purchase.</li>
            <li> I switched from a 5 year old Oral B to this toothbrush at my dentist&#x27;s recommendations, and I&#x27;m happy I did.  </li>
            <li> Love it and it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> the platinum brush heads better and they fit on this toothbrush too</li>
            <li> Battery life is great so far.</li>
            <li> The options provided to me by the FlexCarePlus e.g. sensitive, gum care massage were of great help to me.</li>
            <li> I love the built-in UV light for disinfection as well.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately Amazon has a much better range.</li>
            <li> Since using the brush I have experienced no incidence of gum bleeding or soreness, and undoubtedly my teeth feel far cleaner.  </li>
            <li> My son loved my toothbrush so much that I purchased him the Kids Sonicare toothbrush which I would rate 100 stars if I could.  </li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush so much, I bought one for my Mother for Mother&#x27;s Day and she loves it also.  </li>
            <li> It was  a good toothbrush, but I really noticed the difference when I bought this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m find that the brush head is wearing fast, also, but it still seems to be doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is good and does it job very well.</li>
            <li> I bought a Philips Sonicare FlexCare PlusToothbrush for my wife, loved it so much I had to buy me one too.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate the travel case which was included since I do a fair bit of that.</li>
            <li> This product gives your mouth a real fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have the time to write a drawn-out review but there are plenty of good reviews here already.</li>
            <li> What really upsets me is that I threw away a perfectly good electric toothbrush that worked perfectly well for more than 5 years and cost me less than $20.00 when I bought it.</li>
            <li> Very techy but easy to operate and feels good on the gums and teeth which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> This new model is a lot better noise wise.  </li>
            <li> the gum massage feature is also wonderful and gives your mouth a whole new feel.  </li>
            <li> Buy yours today and get ready for a new and delightful experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a 2 other brand named rechargeable toothbrushes,  this one is the best!</li>
            <li> They are slightly more course (which I like) than the original brush heads that I bought for my Elite.  </li>
            <li> Other than this, great product!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have also mentioned that the brush heads need to be perfectly aligned in the sanitizer for the door to close, but I have never had an issue of them not being \\&quot;aligned\\&quot; correctly.</li>
            <li> I brush the full 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> I love sonicare toothbrushes, and this one has not disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i should have waited a bit longer.. other than that its a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The quality is very good and after more than half a year I&#x27;m still pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sonicare user for many years and this new model is the best by far.</li>
            <li> you will not be able to get your teeth thus clean.  </li>
            <li> Without hyperbole, I can honestly say it gets your teeth as clean as a hygienist at the dentist, and quickly.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, has almost too many brushing options but makes my mouth feel clean and stimulates my gums.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing easy.  </li>
            <li> One thing I noticed about me cleaning my mouth with this toothbrush is that it easily made my gum lighter.</li>
            <li> I had more dental problems, and my teeth never felt clean...</li>
            <li> Thought it might have reverted to the &#x27;easy start&#x27; mode, but went through the process for &#x27;activating/deactivating&#x27; easy start and it made no difference.  </li>
            <li> Its lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the clean and gum care settings.</li>
            <li> Easy start feature for newbies to gradually introduce the Sonicare experience (can be deactivated</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s also easy for you to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You are able to clean 2 brushes at a time.</li>
            <li> Ok, this toothbrush is just amazing, works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> Additionally, having the UV sanitizer and the charger unit all on the same platform is much more convenient and a great space saver.</li>
            <li> Switching between modes is easy and intuitive.  </li>
            <li> Somehow the suite was not included in my address, and UPS wouldn&#x27;t deliver even though the name of my company is on the building and would be exceptionally easy to figure out.     </li>
            <li> Selecting between modes is quite easy.  </li>
            <li> So after years of finally debating whether or not it was worth it to make the switch from an old-fashioned toothbrush to an electric, I decided it was time to go for it-- and time to go for one of the best.  </li>
            <li> You can now easily select what mode you want and it stays highlighted on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You clean the front side of your top portion of your teeth&#x27;s, then the inside, then switch to the bottom front, then the innards of your front teeth</li>
            <li> Most times I use just the Clean Mode, and sometimes I will run it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to use;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to understand and read intructions;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral-B brush I used before just vibrated, this tooth brush seems to be a much more precise and advanced movement that vibrates with purpose.</li>
            <li> Clean&#x27; is the 2 minute option, that I use most often. &#x27;</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t change it as easily as I can now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love the ultraviolet light \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; for getting the brush head bacteria free.</li>
            <li> I love clean teeth...</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li> Philips says that water is pulsed during cleaning to provide better cleaning between teeth, and that may account for the clean feeling after gum massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> here is the UV Sanitizer, which is easy to use (basically put brush inside, close a door, and hit a button).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to switch modes</li>
            <li> The Elite screws on, which is easy for the kids.  </li>
            <li> four separate modes -- easy to read and set</li>
            <li> I love the UV sensor because it assures me a clean toothbrush each use.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t over or under brush, this comes with 2 chargers- one with an easy to use sanitizer and another travel charger.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to get use to.  </li>
            <li> The hx6972/10 works the best and well worth the extra money.   </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to purchase the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> it is easy.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to clean teeth more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The inside mount for the brushes pops in and out easily so it can be washed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the really clean feeling I get after brushing.  </li>
            <li> And if I can find this information easily, I would think Sonicare should know about it.</li>
            <li> AND IT FEELS CLEAN AND HAVE HEALTHY GUMS</li>
            <li> The clean feeling I get is astonishing.</li>
            <li> The traveling case is sleek and easy to pack.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It was bought as proof of service and has been easy</li>
            <li> Refill brushes are easy to find at Costco.</li>
            <li> It is much gentler, yet more effective in cleaning between her teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I use my Waterpik Ultra Flosser and together they are a strong team in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> The Braun however, is still going strong after 13 yrs</li>
            <li> I used to have an older model of Sonicare tooth brush and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> Still going strong</li>
            <li> This thing is still going strong after almost three years.  </li>
            <li> While searching for an electric toothbrush, I thought that, if I was going to dip myself $100 in for a good brush, might as well aim as high as I and the Philips Sonicare FlexCare</li>
            <li> Anyway, these are highly recommended for good reason.  </li>
            <li> I liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy brushing my teeth because I love the feeling of them becoming clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt amazing after the first brushing.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, this is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> The quadpacer feature is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> It makes sure you brush for the full two minutes and get every part of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> It comes with two brush heads which is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first, but the charger quit working after about 8 months.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been able to use it for a full week before on a trip when I&#x27;ve forgotten to pack the travel charger.</li>
            <li> First I would like to add that the warranty and the service that comes with the warranty is spectacular.</li>
            <li> I just use the normal brush features and it gets me good reviews from my dental hygenist ..</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> and they leave my teeth feeling clean, fresh and just as nice as when I leave the dentists office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth the money to have a healthy and clean mouth!</li>
            <li> Used with new whitening toothpaste results are good.</li>
            <li> The handle, brush and charger were fine.</li>
            <li> The controls on the handle are easier than the previous versions and I am very very happy with how Sonicare has improved the design of the toothbrush head to avoid the issues that the Sonicare Elite had.       </li>
            <li> are more willing to spend more time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s still one of the best tooth brushes that I&#x27;ve ever used and it has some advantages over the previous model.</li>
            <li> This is the best looking Sonicare to date, with &#x27;improvements&#x27; over previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> has been working just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with it in the morning since nobody likes a stank-mouth</li>
            <li> The first one did excellent and the several times I went to the dentist for a checkup after buying it</li>
            <li> - they work fine</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s perfectly fine.    </li>
            <li> It is light, easy to handle, with a tip that fits in any mouth without a problem.</li>
            <li> Until the model broke, it worked fine.</li>
            <li> So keep your mouth shut while using this fine product.</li>
            <li> Additionally impressive are the choice in settings - i use \\&quot;clean\\&quot; 80% of the time - it&#x27;s your typical use setting with a 2 min</li>
            <li> The UV light cleaner thing might be more of a gimmick than anything else, but it looks cool.</li>
            <li> I thought they were fine until I picked up one of these.</li>
            <li> OTHERWISE THE PRODUCT IS FINE</li>
            <li> It lasted just fine and looked like it would have gone</li>
            <li> I checked the bulb and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a fine instrument...when it is working.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t bother me because it still worked just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked fine for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a fine set and seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> I discovered quite quickly that if you want your toothpaste to stay on your brush be sure to place the brush head inside your mouth before turning on the Flexcare+.</li>
            <li> My favorite aspects:  - the UV tootbrush head cleaner - kills 99% of bacteria and is really quick  - the fact that the cleaning is divided into 4 parts, 30 seconds each.</li>
            <li> so often/easily is because the vibration is too strong for whatever cheap parts they use inside the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> The brushes seem to wear out more quickly</li>
            <li> Thanks Sonicare for an outstanding product!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone who can afford to spend a bit more for better regulardental care.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t buy a better toothbrush than this one!</li>
            <li> This new version is much more effective is removing stain and plaque.</li>
            <li> Product is very useful, easy to use and helps in keeping us out of dental problems.</li>
            <li> Still, I worry about how clean the handle it self will be a year from now since I won&#x27;t be able to put it in the dishwasher to clean it.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, clean and it does a fantastic job of cleaning teeth -- it was noticable after the first use!  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It has a great battery life and smooth, quiet operation.</li>
            <li> There was a huge difference between the Sonicare and my Oral B electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Because I have to work for a living, I couldn&#x27;t spend huge amounts of time chasing them around.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t manage my tooth-brushing as accurately as I should have.  </li>
            <li> What a huge improvement.    </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see what the dentist says but I&#x27;ve got faith that this toothbrush will make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> was a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> because this is cheaper, it has the UV sanitation light (which works great), and the handle itself is no different from the newer models.</li>
            <li> Therefore, this might not be great for inattentive toothbrushers or smaller</li>
            <li> 2014.11.23 Update: this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Dentist told me few years ago this was the best way to protect your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> &quot; but they do recommend ways to keep your toothbrush germ free and a sanitizer will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You push a button to start the cleaning process, and the UV light will turn off automatically.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what a hotbed of germs a toothbrush is, and the UV light kills 99% of bacteria and viruses.       </li>
            <li> Dental health is important, and we too often take it for granted.</li>
            <li> Now the brush sanitizer is a fantastic addition to this system.  </li>
            <li> The UV light works</li>
            <li> these things aren&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li> The gum control function works great and provides an extra minute of brushing.  </li>
            <li> You can see the difference in the brightness of your teeth and feel how smooth your teeth are.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a fantastic investment because it WORKS</li>
            <li> This is my second sonicare toothbrush; I had it for about a month now and it works great</li>
            <li> Look out, or search on the internet for a $15 coupon that is sometime available as a rebate from Sonicare.    </li>
            <li> It was important the power toothbrush had to be rechargeable and had sonic power to tackle plaque.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the UV sanitizer, but it&#x27;s a nice option</li>
            <li> You would think if this UV thing of theirs worked as they claim they would give consumers access to the detailed results.     </li>
            <li> a sound investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has periodontal issues and this sonic toothbrush is fantastic for her.  </li>
            <li> Here is what I experienced over the last 13 months.....</li>
            <li> The light works about 50% of the time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush-the best that Philips makes and after a few months the handle stopped vibrating.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush which has numerous modes.</li>
            <li> It is much slimmer and fits into my hands nicely.  </li>
            <li> The timer,ultra violet light for decontaminating the toothbrush head, the travel pack, these are just some of the features I like.</li>
            <li> To date know I just enjoy the post brushing experience.</li>
            <li> This is our 2nd Sonicare, since the purchase of the Sonicare Elite with over 6 yrs of great performance, it was time to try the newest from Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The carrying case and the UV light did not work.  </li>
            <li> The 5 different brushing modes are great.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrific product with great features</li>
            <li> It does take up a bit more counter space but all in all it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> :-)It is really worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My 2nd Sonicar and getting great checkups.  </li>
            <li> The UV light in one of the 2 units I bought was not working.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet effective in cleaning and massaging the gums.  </li>
            <li> It feels great both on my teeth and on my gums, I actually WANT to brush my teeth twice a day.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t fit the travel charger in the travel case.  </li>
            <li> Straight out of the dentist amazing.</li>
            <li> And I actually enjoy brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The charging capability is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a great toothbrush</li>
            <li> I primarily use the \\&quot;Clean\\</li>
            <li> I am one that uses these reviews in researching important purchases.  </li>
            <li> Get a cheap version</li>
            <li> No wonder it comes with an ultraviolet light to disinfect it.  </li>
            <li> There will be a light space between the brush head and unit when you fully attach it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest using the UV light every time you brush, as that may (read: WILL)</li>
            <li> (The Diamond series isn&#x27;t any more powerful).  </li>
            <li> it was like I just got my braces off because of the fact of how smooth my teeth were.  </li>
            <li> Prior to being a proud Sonicare owner, I used the Oral-B electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Not much to say except it&#x27;s brilliant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing it with their Easy Clean model, but I expect that it will probably quit working in a year.  </li>
            <li> The UV light bulb burned out two days after I received it.  </li>
            <li> Got a free replacement handle by Philips.</li>
            <li> The UV light stopped working 3 weeks after I started using it.  </li>
            <li> and they are sending me a replacement light.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> the ultra-blue light lets you know that the cleaning has begun</li>
            <li> The brush head and holder are easy to clean and the item seems to hold a charge for quite some time before recharging.  </li>
            <li> but not only is it a great cleaning experience</li>
            <li> Almost every part is replaceable and it is extremely easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I am a proud owner and would definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> After 4 month, the charge with the UV light sanitizer didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is worth the money to spend on oneself to also help keep your body healthy.  </li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Also, feel free to do a web search - lots of people have this problem.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> etc) are more fun than something i see as i couldn&#x27;t do without.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy the brush without the UV light.</li>
            <li> This really helps whiten teeth and also the gum care option is really nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this toothbrush last week from Amazon/Drugstore.com and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Sleek, easy to clean, a variety of modes</li>
            <li> There is also an UV Sanitizer to ensure your product is germ free after each application.  </li>
            <li> You know that feeling after you come out of the dentist&#x27;s office for a cleaning where your teeth have that polished, smooth feeling when you run your tongue over them?  </li>
            <li> This has been discussed by reviewers manytimes already, but to sum it up, it&#x27;s not really needed because of the germ fighting agents in your toothpaste and it may do more harm than good if bacteria mutate to become more UV resistant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to operate and keep clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, does what it says it will do and relieves the anguish of not being clean and sterilized.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean between teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used a sonic type toothbrush before that wasn&#x27;t a Sonicare, you haven&#x27;t truly experienced the same as what this brush can do.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> Turned out to be a cheaply designed mechanical door switch contact  </li>
            <li> Although the warranty period has passed (2 years), they will replace the unit for free.</li>
            <li> Its more than worth the money.</li>
            <li> AND it is easy to keep clean and hygienic.  </li>
            <li> One issue I&#x27;ve had: the UV sanitizing light pooped out and the replacement bulb&#x27;s price it preposterous.</li>
            <li> Use either loctite or nailpolish and lightly coat the threads of the screw.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush &amp; it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Just great overall experience!!!</li>
            <li> So I eventually called customer service and had the fantastic experience I mentioned above.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light, oh the light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright enough to be a night light and more</li>
            <li> (I think you could probably use it for a lighthouse light to guide ships to your bathroom on a foggy night).  </li>
            <li> I understand it&#x27;s important to take care of our teeth, but this brush lasted 2 1/2 yrs.</li>
            <li> Always smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works fantastic.</li>
            <li> The ultrasound speed is amazing, yet gentle.  </li>
            <li> You will never use all the advanced features,</li>
            <li> enjoy the sanitation uv light.</li>
            <li> The timing feature where it vibrates to tell you to move to the next quadrant is a great feature.</li>
            <li> In January the UltraViolet light quit working.  </li>
            <li> The light now works.</li>
            <li> The sanitizer is great and allows me and my husband to sanitize both our toothbrushes as the same time.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the timer.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, each time the handle was replaced under warranty, but just for the inconvenience, I had to deduct a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Yes, UV light kills germs.  </li>
            <li> Then after 1 year, it quit working on the primary charger.  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is a nice addition, but it&#x27;s not something that is absolutely needed.</li>
            <li> I believe the UV light is bogus- that part broke after 2 months anyways.</li>
            <li> They are amazing and so gentle on your gums.  </li>
            <li> It is a great toothbrush with the UV cleaner, extra head replacements, and it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the UV light to kill germs on the brush head</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been with Sonicare for quite some time, primarily because my dentist has recommended it.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is that the Easy Clean uses the same brush heads as this model, and seems way more durable.</li>
            <li> Now, when I use the toothbrush I feel secure in the knowledge that I am not introducing germs into my mouth.  </li>
            <li> About a month after I bought this toothbrush, the &amp;#34;gum care&amp;#34; light stopped working.</li>
            <li> After another month, the &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; light stopped working.</li>
            <li> it was hassle free.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price and more.</li>
            <li> Having used the Sonicare system several years ... and happy with it ...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic piece of technology.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good;</li>
            <li> This one has the UV sanitizer, which is a nice feature... something I occasionally commandeer for my own brush.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the oral b system for years and believe it is a far superior system.</li>
            <li> It took rather a long time to charge up before the first use, but it has had excellent battery life since then.</li>
            <li> and i am very impressed with how long you can go between charging it - even though the logical place to store the hand held unit is on the vertical charging stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s must more gentle on my gums, feels like it cleans better, and is a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> So far we both love the Sonicare, and the addition of the UV sanitizer is nice.   </li>
            <li> The bottom line is that most of these modes are just modifications of others, much like all those \\&quot;cycles\\&quot; found on most washing machines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that most of these modes are just modifications of others, much like all those \\&quot;cycles\\&quot; found on most washing machines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one has a sensitive setting and it feels good on my teeth.</li>
            <li> They arrived very quickly and the sonicare toothbrush is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush VERY much, and strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush VERY much, and strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth super clean!</li>
            <li> Updated as it&#x27;s still working fine since I reviewed the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m also pretty sure that it&#x27;s even making my teeth whiter as it&#x27;s removing some of the stains and most of the plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feature that gives me a quick beep+pause</li>
            <li> I research most products and the reviews were right on target.</li>
            <li> Yeah, right, we needed more bells and whistles to brush our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so just a plain tooth brush works the best for me on the go.</li>
            <li> but, I love my teeth, and wanted my gums and whole mouth to be clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure other reviewers have covered how great this toothbrush is.  </li>
            <li> Its incredibly hygienic due to the snap on head, brush enclosure, and UV light.  </li>
            <li> This is a great unit for anyone who wants clean teeth, or anyone who wants to keep their teeth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Sonicare !!!</li>
            <li> Very nice especially the hygiene unit</li>
            <li> I find this feature very useful.</li>
            <li> I do not find very useful</li>
            <li> Very useful traveller holder which i using in my trips.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and leaves teeth</li>
            <li> the bulb - Phillips sends us emails to let us know the bulb is on back order which is very nice but not helping us with the</li>
            <li> After each brush, my teeth and gums feel more clean and fresh than ever before.  </li>
            <li> Gum care has become very importent to me and this brush has been and will be of great help to me besides my periodontist highly recommended this for me.</li>
            <li> Really makes your teeth feel clean!!</li>
            <li> ive never had a better tooth brush in my life, it makes my whole mouth feel clean like id been to the dentist without the pain!</li>
            <li> Using this toothbrush leaves you with the feeling that you just left the dentists office (in a good way, a clean teeth way, not a just had a root canal way)!</li>
            <li> The newest Sonicare is just as wonderful and effective as the others with a few new features.  </li>
            <li> All I know is that this one is great because it doesn&#x27;t vibrate so much that it hurts or makes my head feel like it&#x27;s full of bees, but it really gets my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I liked the toothbrush and my gums were kept in a healthy shape throughout all these years (helped by a general dentist cleaning</li>
            <li> Out of the dentist clean smooth.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes are kept clean and free of bacteria and viruses.  </li>
            <li> The UV light clean option also doesn&#x27;t reliably turn on.  </li>
            <li> I do like the UV, though I really don&#x27;t know how well it works, and quite honestly, your mouth is already full of bacteria</li>
            <li> Pretty much everything is all good</li>
            <li> I used to own a much older Sonicare and didn&#x27;t use it every day.  </li>
            <li> However, if all three are done correctly, your dentist visits will be quick and easy.    </li>
            <li> which I figured was pretty good catch-up after so much slacking.    </li>
            <li> - you move it evenly across your teeth and gums and the vibration \\&quot;brushes\\&quot; for you, but it quickly becomes easy.    </li>
            <li> but not if it&#x27;s going to break so quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is minimalist and attaches quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable modes are very handy but for my purposes I only use the &#x27;Clean&#x27; and &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; settings.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and made very well.</li>
            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I do love this Sonicare toothbrush very much in the 4 months that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend looks nice on counter.</li>
            <li> I like the UV light because having my toothbrush on the counter charging in the bathroom with the germs that live in bathrooms kind of creeps me out.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and leaves your teeth squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The sonic care flex plus gives  mouth a super clean feeling, however the strong vibration of the brush does take  getting use to.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, easy to use, dependable and very sanitary.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people with arthritis or carpal tunnel in your hands, because it has a wide handle that is easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Original</li>
            <li> As a side note when using any of the modes, and you will probably learn this within five seconds of your first use, make sure the toothbrush is in your mouth before turning it on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of an investment cost-wise, but absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other electric toothbrushes before, this one is definitely the best, the quality is superb.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> As my daughter would say I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Our original version lasted over 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare should extend their warranty period and acknowledge that there is a problem with a significant percentage of their brushes.  </li>
            <li> I originally had an Sonicare Essence, but decided to try an Oral-B model.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this brush, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my dental hygiene, with /far/</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and all you have to do is stand there and let the brush do all the work!</li>
            <li> Years ago, I purchased the original SoniCare.  </li>
            <li> This thing makes brushing FUN!</li>
            <li> Of course, the original will still do the trick</li>
            <li> baffles me is that the warranty is from the day of original purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had to replace the handle five times since my original purchase.  </li>
            <li> My version of this toothbrush has been a significant help on my dental cleaning that I decided my boys needed the benefit as well.  </li>
            <li> The low-end models that cost a quarter of this one have all the features my original Sonicare had.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who takes pride in their smile!</li>
            <li> It is worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I had an original model that lasted forever</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how to use it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> It has a higher quality, more pleasing design than the Oral-B, which looks like a toy in comparison.</li>
            <li> I paid Amazon Prime for the overnight shipping, I was so excited.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth are getting whiter.</li>
            <li> Both me and my dentist have noticed significant improvement in my oral and dental health.</li>
            <li> how user friendly it is.  </li>
            <li> /o the original purchase info</li>
            <li> So far this has proved to be a better and more advanced product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, worth the investment (cheaper than cavities!).</li>
            <li> because the original broke somewhere between the head and the... actuator?</li>
            <li> but it made me more aware of the time I spend brushing the backs of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s pricey, it&#x27;s well worth it!  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure i was going to like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally as a Christmas gift, but once I saw all the features and how it worked</li>
            <li> I originally thought this was a button problem</li>
            <li> At first I said to myself \\&quot;Better call the</li>
            <li> (original unit, plus replacement heads).</li>
            <li> I called the number for customer service and got a friendly rep.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were significantly whiter in 2 minutes than they were in 10 minutes with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You can choose to use the one-minute Massage mode on its own or tack on the end of the normal brushing mode for a three-minute session (Gum Care).  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had one of the original Sonicare toothbrushes and it served me every day for over five years.  </li>
            <li> the original design?  </li>
            <li> it is excellent alternative to ordinary brush.</li>
            <li> Far superior quality and more gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> The Refresh mode is a nice one-minute version of the normal (Clean) mode.  </li>
            <li> very good, reviewes previously helped understand how it worked and works wonders.</li>
            <li> Forget all the nit picking about models, in design alone, this is by far the best &amp;#34;SYSTEM&amp;#34; you can get simply because it&#x27;s super easy to clean, and the head protector / UV sanitizer keeps the part you stick in your mouth clean, and</li>
            <li> My mouth fells so clean and breath is so fresh!</li>
            <li> the box was in a nice package NEW and Neat ....</li>
            <li> However, some will find it nice to try out both sizes before ordering new brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light, easy to keep clean, smart shape!  </li>
            <li> It offers options that are wonderful like \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; that I use between meals that isn&#x27;t your standard 2 min of brush time as in \\&quot;clean\\&quot; that you would use morning and night.  </li>
            <li> Easier to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s not to say the Flexcare doesn&#x27;t clean well...</li>
            <li> It will need more usage to be able to form a complete opinion of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, remarkably powerful.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric toothbrush I have tried that is currently on the market.</li>
            <li> It programs you to clean your teeth longer.  </li>
            <li> The FlexCare+ has a subtler, but more effective, vibration than my earlier model.</li>
            <li> My mouth always feels so clean whenever I used it.</li>
            <li> It clean my teeth so well.</li>

            <li> Gum Care (The 2 minute clean plus 1 minute gum cleaning.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to periodically remove the plastic caddy inside the sanitizer and clean it to prevent build</li>
            <li> They do not come close to the clean feeling you receive after using the flexcare.  </li>
            <li> They all clean your teeth,</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re doing to keep your teeth clean, keep it up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Also, I couldn&#x27;t even believe that there was a UV sanitizer, which makes me feel like my toothbrush is clean every time I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean like an electric toothbrush - polishes</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after a Sonicare brushing I sometimes neglect the flossing step.</li>
            <li> The dentist clean feeling it gives, is addicting and boosts my confidence ensuring me my teeth are squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning and feeling of clean after using it make you want to brush.</li>
            <li> I was using it on the &#x27;clean&#x27; setting when it began emitting a high-pitched whine and</li>
            <li> and I have to say that each brush has its own pros and cons, but this brush is my personal favorite.  </li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li> I have been through numerous spinning toothbrushes but this one is by far the very best.</li>
            <li> I clean my brush head after every use in the UV Sanitizer and clean the sanitizer as instructed once a week.  </li>
            <li> I stick to the Clean mode for the most part, but the Refresh is a nice one minute version of Clean if you doing a simple between brushing touch</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean, just like after a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Light is not that bright and only takes about 10 minutes to run through sanitizing cycle.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I get a extremely fresh clean feeling after every brush, its like going to the dentist everyday :D</li>
            <li> Every time I clean my teeth</li>
            <li> My gum health was deteriorating and I could feel that my teeth weren&#x27;t as clean.</li>

            <li> My mouth feels so clean after brushing</li>
            <li> I tend to use Clean twice a day, and Gum Care once.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, I felt that the Sonicare wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth very well</li>
            <li> Maybe this isn&#x27;t an issue, but I figure why not have a completely clean brush after each use?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to clean after use.  </li>
            <li> Holy clean mouth, Batman.    </li>
            <li> They are so clean that I want to clean them every hour because I feel they get are dirty!&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li> had my teeth so clean.</li>

            <li> My teeth are really clean and my dentist approves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that will then go into your mouth to clean your teeth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like knowing that my toothbrush is clean of germs and bacteria after each use.</li>

            <li> how clean it keeps my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It feels so clean after each brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my fourth Philips sonicare, and, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s the best yet.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> My dentist and my children&#x27;s dentists always marvel at how clean our teeth are.  </li>

            <li> I have owned various electric toothbrushes through the years, but this has been by far my best purchase.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would say together, but the clean feeling you get</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s 100X better than a manual toothbrush and significantly better than the old Sonicare design with the screw on replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> If you want clean and whiter teeth, try this.</li>
            <li> Well... I end up use this toothbrush to clean my teeth up after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said, I use the clean mode almost all the time.</li>
            <li> I never realized you could get that dentist level of clean at home until I tried the Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> But their&#x27;s did not make my teeth feel as clean as this</li>
            <li> and they were so clean they would squeak.  </li>
            <li> but that is how clean my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it has a variety of settings to allow me to clean my tongue and massage my gums.</li>
            <li> Refresh is a shortened Clean.  </li>
            <li> Refresh is a shortened Clean.  </li>
            <li> But when my hygienist saw the results she said she had almost no work to do to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how clean this makes my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> my mouth feels clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that my teeth feel as clean as leaving the dentist office after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What clean power this has.</li>
            <li> We will see what the dentist says, but my mouth feels almost fresh-from-the-dentist clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> I tried cheaper electronic tooth brushes but my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean, and my gums were still irritated.</li>
            <li> Feel SO clean &amp; polished.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the best thing next to having your teeth cleaned professionally.  </li>
            <li> This provides that clean feeling and whitens your teet as promised.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 months now since my checkup/cleaning and my teeth feel just as clean now as the day of my dentist visit.</li>
            <li> and they still don&#x27;t feel clean?</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist was amazed at how clean my teeth were after using this toothbrush for 6 months.  </li>
            <li> A must to keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean even hours after brushing.</li>
            <li> After brushing every time mouth feels really clean.</li>
            <li> how squeeky clean my teeth feel after each brushing.</li>
            <li> Clean with peroxide but STAY AWAY from this model.  </li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> I will say it is certainly the next best thing and pretty close.</li>
            <li> The brush&#x27;s \\&quot;engine\\&quot; slows after two minutes for a single minute of gum massage that feels great.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> Wow, they have too many models!    </li>
            <li> Plusses:  this toothbrush got my teeth very clean, and in fact seemed to work better than my old Oral-B electric toothbrush (not to mention that my dentist recommended the SoniCare over the Oral-B).  </li>
            <li> but Phillips seems to have figured out all of the flaws of their original design and made the sonic toothbrush twice as good, including a sleeker, smaller design.</li>
            <li> Fully charged it and used for full clean once a day which is two minutes a day and battery lasted until feb 7th.</li>
            <li> However the two-minute timer in the clean mode is cool</li>
            <li> You will fine it worth every penny that you spend on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and now she does the full clean almost every night before bed.</li>
            <li> Very cool product, keeps my teeth so clean, even my dental hygienist suspected I was seeing someone else, hahaha!</li>
            <li> Uses a special lamp that contains mercury and requires special disposal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom for Christmas 2009 and it stopped working almost right away!  </li>
            <li> The repair was right on!</li>
            <li> then you really get a much better clean.  </li>
            <li> I can even get a really good clean back on my molars and wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> The older screw-on brush model is still available but this one is slimmer with more bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> The first tooth brush I have used that truly gets your teeth squeeky clean AND massages your gums and sanitizes!</li>
            <li> The best version Sonicare as put on the market with a travel hard case.  </li>
            <li> The sonicare is perfect if you have issues with brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> - Brush worked great and left the clean feeling that an electric toothbrush gives, and the vibration signaling when to switch to a different part of your teeth was a nice touch.     </li>
            <li> - The UV cleaner is a nice addition and makes you feel a little better about using the brush head more than a couple weeks.    </li>
            <li> the design itself is impeccable and makes it easy to clean/maintain (that being said it is an extremely low-maintenance product</li>
            <li> First, design is very cool.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth spending the extra money to get the best model Sonicare offers.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a much cheaper rechargable electric toothbrush first to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li> and I have generally been very satisfied</li>
            <li> if FAR better and FAR more powerful and effective.</li>
            <li> It is pretty pricey, BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;- lasts about 1.5 weeks from a full charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Notably, the Sensitive option offered a much gentler brushing, and the Massage option was a nice change of pace along the gum line.       </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m VERY happy with my purchase, especially the unbeatable price and free shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The head gets much more wear and tear with how fast the brush moves.  </li>
            <li> As for my gums, they seem to be better and not bleeding as much.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this marvel.</li>
            <li> while it is a good marketing tool, I don&#x27;t know how necessary it is.</li>
            <li> I really find that this electric toothbrush cleans my teeth much better than I can do by hand.</li>
            <li> I really like the Flexcare + toothbrush - it has so many features</li>
            <li> It cleans gently and it looks so chic on my counter :)     </li>
            <li> In the end I can&#x27;t offer any negatives on the UV Sanitizer which is good because (as of this writing) the only FlexCare Plus model you can by</li>
            <li> It feels as though we are getting good cleanings, and we are using various cleaning cycles.  </li>
            <li> Who really wants to spend more time sitting in that dental chair?    </li>
            <li> The gum care option on this toothbrush is really cool.</li>
            <li> Oral B is much cheaper and does a better job.  </li>
            <li> but I guess that is why it has the 14 uses building up to full power.  </li>
            <li> I feel I&#x27;m able to ward off tartar before it really sets in.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve already used a Sonicare, you can skip the ramp-up process and start the brush at full power.  </li>
            <li> My teeth look sweet now.     </li>
            <li> If sonic technology is good enough for Doctor</li>
            <li> Who, it&#x27;s certainly good enough for me.    </li>
            <li> I LOVE this so much that I have decided to purchase one for each of my children.</li>
            <li> They were charging full price for their&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> he didn&#x27;t had to do much cleaning compare to most of his clients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tooth brush for about 3 years and love it as much today as I did 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush also comes with a travel case, and brush head covers, which is really cool.</li>
            <li> I really believe that I have this tooth brush to thank for that. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I really believe that I have this tooth brush to thank for that. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and it helps you with the 14 day period that it gradually gets up to full power.</li>
            <li> I drink espresso and eat tomatoes daily, and drink wine often, so I figured this would be a good investment to help keep my teeth in as good of shape as possible.</li>
            <li> and wow what a diffrence its made my teeth are more white then ever, my gums feel great</li>
            <li> but it looks cool.</li>
            <li> The representaative told me that a full set replacement unit would be delivered  to me within 7-10 day By Fedex.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool with the two brushes so my husband and I can both use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does get your teeth super clean though, went to the dentist after a year instead of six months while using this guy....</li>
            <li> The gum cleaning is more gentle.  </li>
            <li> More gentle cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes aren&#x27;t cheap, but the way this toothbrush cleans my teeth makes them worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up for Sonicare!t brushes aren&#x27;t cheap, but the way this toothbrush cleans my teeth makes them worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last toothbrush was a Sonicare Elite and that lasted me a good 5.5 years.</li>
            <li> UV sanitizer is probably more gimmick than of real use.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would spend this much on a toothbrush, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love going to the dentist and having the hygienist say \\&quot;well you didn&#x27;t leave much for me to do.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It really cleans better than anything I used before.</li>
            <li> (surprisingly that&#x27;s the second time I&#x27;ve used that sentence today.)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling super clean and your breath fresher.</li>
            <li> Nice replacement for my 10 year old sonic care.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in the power of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My favorite mode is massage because it helps really get the gum line without being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Having used these for years, I can say they are the best toothbrushes going, however, my one complaint is that you cant replace the battery after it dies.  </li>
            <li> surfaces of my teeth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li> Still love the toothbrush; so much so that I purchased this one for my son.</li>
            <li> like one reviewer said, our mouths are full of germs.  </li>
            <li> True story:</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> are so clean after using it the very first time.</li>
            <li> The agent said that this time, for sure, the new unit would be available and shipped by April 23.  </li>
            <li> Is the new model is built more cheaply that</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I had the right toothbrush as I didn&#x27;t see the 5 brushing mode display not knowing that the text will appear after the toothbrush is fully charge and when I hit the select button.  </li>
            <li> Whats more is that if you leave them standing near or on water, the rubber material grows mildew very quickly.</li>
            <li> The difference is that this model has a slightly more powerful motor (I think - the vibrations are more vigorous), and has the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; option which means the amplitude of the vibration is larger (moves more from side to side) and the frequency lower (vibrates slower, but still very fast).</li>
            <li> Very easy to adjust the settings for example: clean, sensitive, massage etc.</li>
            <li> To me, my experience is so important I must let others know, so you can make the right decision.  </li>
            <li> The new model does a great job cleaning your teeth and stimulating ones gums, but the push button that controls the various features is located in a position that is just too easy to bump while holding the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I love the new Refresh mode for a quick 1-minute clean to supplement my full nighttime and morning, 2-minute Clean.</li>
            <li> The UV light cleaner is nice, but we only ever use the &#x27;Clean&#x27; setting on the brush.</li>
            <li> Super cool.</li>
            <li> After the very first use, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it was really doing.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, my teeth felt just as clean and smooth as when I leave for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Gotta say works great would recommend even to other family members.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> It was great when it worked, but I&#x27;m not willing to pay $150 for a toothbrush every nine months.</li>
            <li> BUT - despite all the negative reviews on this new model, I wanted to have the latest and the greatest, so I ignored the input and purchased this unit.  </li>
            <li> Dentist was so right that this is light years ahead of normal tooth brushing for cleaning teeth and keeping gums healthy.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel so clean after each use and it is worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li> makes mouth feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> my teeth feel so clean after each use and it is worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li> Super cleans teeth.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> Luckily it comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding the + model to be a worthy upgrade.</li>
            <li> Immediately noticeable was the more solid feel, better grip, and improved balance of the handle.</li>
            <li> All in all a worthy upgrade.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a travel case and travel charger, which I haven&#x27;t found too useful myself (thus far), but is nice to have.</li>
            <li> so I shopped Amazon to find the BEST (and most expensive)</li>
            <li> I have the older Sonicare Elite model and it is still running after 3 years, but this newer, lighter flexcare plus model seems to be more prone to failures.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really nice to have the blue light aspect, because bacteria is my No 1 enemy.</li>
            <li> If all is OK with the replacement brush after several years of use, I will update my rating to more stars.    </li>
            <li> That has not been received and it&#x27;s been many more than ten days.  </li>
            <li> plus I have noticed a tremendous amount of improvements.  </li>
            <li> I have had the older models that were more bulky.</li>
            <li> We were advised by our dentist to buy this super toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I researched the different brands to find the best one for the money and the Philips Sonicare FlexCare always came in above the rest.  </li>
            <li> Comes with two heads, charges quickly and comes with a UV cleaner.  </li>
            <li> However, it quickly became negligible, and I now never notice anything but</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Flexcare Plus is a step better than the Healthy White Sonicare I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think Philips thought of just about everything with this brush, and it definitely holds up to its guarantee of better dental checkups. :)</li>
            <li> The real test of the results will be when I go to the dentist next, but I think they will be happy.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a worthy candidate for the Oyster Award (given annually by Consumer Reports for difficult-to-open-packages).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a recommended upgrade.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a worthy candidate for the Oyster Award (given annually by Consumer Reports for difficult-to-open-packages).  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really use the cleaning device much, but still nice to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using various Sonicare models since 2003 and this is definitely the best designed in terms of looks, features, and slim design.  </li>
            <li> Also the UV light is a pretty cool gimmick.</li>
            <li> course, this brush as more modes than most, but are they really necessary?  </li>
            <li> course, this brush as more modes than most, but are they really necessary?  </li>
            <li> (Hopefully so they can figure out why these things break so quickly.)  </li>
            <li> y o u get ued to it really quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I am now able to sanitize my brush regularly.  </li>
            <li> Gum care is easy, fun and very gentle.</li>
            <li> This is another lesson as to why when you get in touch with a company, be friendly, be patient, and 9/10 times, they&#x27;ll do right by you because they value you as a customer.</li>
            <li> Many of my family members have Sonicare brushes and highly recommended to have the cleaning system whenever I was researching for mine.      </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them as their service is top notch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great investment if you&#x27;re a &#x27;lazy&#x27; brusher and just want machine to do all the work for you (since good manual brushing can produce good results as well, at least comparable).  </li>
            <li> This model is an update to an earlier model and in most cases, changes  are minor - a good product is made somewhat better.  </li>
            <li> My gums felt amazing, my teeth were whitened immediately, and I could see newly exposed gum tissue (that had been blocked by permanent tarter) after my first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really encourages you to brush your teeth to the right amount of time and WAY better than a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> Amazon quickly refunded our first one and gave us a free shipping label for return.  </li>
            <li> Excellent Toohbrush, had a previous model for quite a few years, was happy with that one and very please with this one.</li>
            <li> I had my teeth cleaned right before using and they have stayed clean.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and have noticed that I brush my teeth more frequently and for much longer.</li>
            <li> (I have a UV light on both a hot tub and a koi pond, and you can see the difference they make in just a day).    </li>
            <li> First, I have had problems with the antibacterial &#x27;light&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> but Philips has a sleeker product with more possible options in the different packages they sell (and I was happy that my dentist gave me a $[...] mail-in rebate to sweeten the deal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> and now I brush pretty comfortably.</li>
            <li> my regular morning routine, and by the time I am ready to brush, my heads are nice and sanitized &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> very first Sonicare lasted 4 or 5 years</li>
            <li> This is our second Philips Sonicare and we are very pleased.</li>
            <li> Had a sonicare before, this one is even better, multiple speed options and the cleaning container is great not only for cleaning but keeping it contained from dust/dirt in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t pull the head off for a week or so (see the light comments below) be prepared for some pretty gnarly stuff in there.  </li>
            <li> No gingivitis yet, and the &#x27;pockets&#x27; are still within normal range but at 63, I want to keep them that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> The product-of-choice if you really want to use the most current and effective technology in tooth/gum/oralcare.</li>
            <li> It also came with a UV light unit that kills bacteria for the brush heads which I find useful and a nice extra with the kit.  </li>
            <li> The refresh setting I would say is by far more superior than using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, has many choices as to how you brush, easy to travel with, long charge, and my entire  family now wants their own!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gross to think about but your mouth is a pretty gross place and the idea that you can clean your toothbrush is awesome.</li>
            <li> was always self conscious about the spot, so this certainly has made me feel more confident when I smile.  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer to keep bacterias and viruses down, in the tooth brush, is a great</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to be touching something every day for years and putting it in or near your mouth, you want to know that it will stay clean.</li>
            <li> Lithium-ion batteries are more powerful and don&#x27;t have a charge memory like older batteries do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically only use the clean cycle, and it&#x27;s nice that it beeps at you to remind you which section you&#x27;re supposed to be brushing</li>
            <li> So I just received the toothbrush and it seems like a really great product, but the price just went down 15 dollars the day after I bought it.</li>
            <li> This design is far superior to the older one where liquid could leak in to the brush assembly resulting in mold growth.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the UV that much, its nice to have and the non-UV isn&#x27;t that much cheaper right now.  </li>
            <li> I have owned a  Sonicare  toothbrush (for about two years and found very easy to use, absolutely reliable, and very thorough in its brushing (i.e., my dentist compliments me on my teeth and gums).  </li>
            <li> This one is a lot fancier and has a great \\&quot;high tech\\&quot; look with the UV Brush Head Sanitizer that lights up with a spacey blue color when it&#x27;s being used.  </li>
            <li> I love my new Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love my new Sonic.</li>
            <li> I love this new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> know that a new brush always works better in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I love the sleek new design.</li>
            <li> Now better than new.</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Sure, maybe I&#x27;ll get a new one instead of some refurb as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, my teeth feel like new every time I brush them.</li>
            <li> I hope this new handle lasts more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this new top of the line model from Amazon about  a year ago.  </li>
            <li> The new technology for cleaning teeth and revitalizing gum tissue is outstanding.</li>
            <li> The product was great, until it stopped working after less than a year.  </li>
            <li> So far the unit is working fine and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product worked perfectly from the get-go, and I look forward to acing my next (long overdue) check-up.</li>
            <li> Since the unit is within 90 day full refund warranty, i can get the full refund, but will have to pay for the return shipping and the whole process will take 3 months!</li>
            <li> They are easy to tote, and don&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> That Sonicare was wonderful - long lasting, thorough.  </li>
            <li> Replaced my very old sonicare with this one and we love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush, I can not really explain how clean your teeth will feel and the gum massage setting is great for your overall gum health.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for 1 month today, but your teeth will thank you after the first brush!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!</li>
            <li> When I first got the thing, boy oh boy, it was POWERFUL!</li>
            <li> Seems like an eternity at first though!</li>
            <li> This is the best investment in personal care that I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare simply does a much better job!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Tooth brush!!!</li>
            <li> Replaced it with a new one which experienced the same problem within a month.</li>
            <li> I wanted top quality, but learned that the older model, which I could have purchased much, cheaper, would have performed better and most likely still be working.  </li>
            <li> I wanted top quality, but learned that the older model, which I could have purchased much, cheaper, would have performed better and most likely still be working.  </li>
            <li> It has many different settings and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare really leaves my teeth CLEAN; like just after a dental cleaning clean</li>
            <li> From what I understand, older Sonicare devices are great, but from reading the reviews, it looks like their QA has gone into the toilet.</li>
            <li> Overall this is one of my favorite purchases and get excited to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I believe it was due to the lateral (sideways) motion of the head being able to better clean the curved surfaces and between the teeth.    </li>
            <li> The handle, while thinner than the old model, is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Being able to clean the brush head is a major plus as well.</li>
            <li> This being my first ever electric toothbrush, I can say that my mouth/teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> the UV sanitizer compartment is easy to clean as the brush holder slides easily in and out for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 years later.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips for a Super product!</li>
            <li> So - clean teeth and clean brush, no plaque, easy to use, and various special features (like the battery indicator).</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B many years ago and hardly used it because I never felt like it did as good a job as my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I hard many good things about sonic care products.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say besides all the added benefits stated in the other reviews - if you are new to a system like this it just makes brushing easier and more enjoyable, meaning you will do it more.</li>
            <li> It works right out of the box (you have to put the toothbrush head on it) and when you first use it your mouth will feel as clean as it does when you leave the dental office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this product, hopefully as much as I have.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few great products one manages to purchase these days.</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would say I enjoy brushing my teeth, however, this toothbrush makes it a real pleasure.</li>
            <li> This is simply short of amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months, and it has been great.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;To begin with, there is no gross slime getting stuck in these heads, and the UV sanitizer is amazing.</li>
            <li> I had not owned a nice electronic dental care brush in the past but this is an amazing first experience.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX6972 has all the bells and whistles a UV light to kill bacteria between brushings,different modes (really don&#x27;t do anything), and a travel</li>
            <li> After using this tooth brash for 3+ years I can say that it does great job cleaning my teeth, but I have run into some problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sanitizer is great for when you want and bacteria free brush, which should be used at least once a week.</li>
            <li> great battery life, never an issue, even a few days on vacation.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s no worse than the newer light bulbs.</li>
            <li> I waited almost a whole year to review this product so I could give an accurate review</li>
            <li> well (far better than a</li>
            <li> It did a good job cleaning, but with the price I paid, I would expected longer life.</li>
            <li> Of the Sonicare options, the FlexCare Plus offers the most features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ultimately, the cost and convenience of a sanitizer make it a reasonable addition to good oral hygiene regime.</li>
            <li> As I found out, a brush this powerful</li>
            <li> My son loves brushing his teeth and for a 5 year old what more could a parent ask for with dental hygiene?  </li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush about 3 months ago here, I was a bit weary of the price since i had never used a sonic toothbrush before, but I figured it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> UV sanitizer Cant say what its worth.</li>
            <li> but my god it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband has the flexcare model and is pleased with it so far</li>
            <li> Oral B professional (unit and brush head) are cheaper and better made.  </li>
            <li> To cut to the chase, it is not as powerful as the Elite 7500.</li>
            <li> Would I still buy this model, knowing it&#x27;s not as powerful?</li>
            <li> Money worth spending.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really fun to use.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny and change your dreaded dental visits.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is a bit steep, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go for the high-end one again with the sanitizer that I rarely use, but would buy one again.</li>
            <li> For me it has already proven to be well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> yes, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the price for the quality of work it perfoms on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The various cleaning functions are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and does not collect junk like the old model.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> If was worth the price.   </li>
            <li> It is definately worth the price for how well it works on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the lowest price by far (better than BB&amp;B with 20% off).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just investing in a sonic toothbrush, this is well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money I have had mine for over 6 months with no issues.</li>
            <li> They also include a travel charger, which is nice, but you would only need this for an extended trip away from home with the increased battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never used UV on my old toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve survived for 40+ years - I just make sure to rinse it well, and sometimes wash it with soap.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> This brush is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is one of those purchases that you WILL NOT regret and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> additional mini-charger is nice to have, I remember having difficulties packing the big OralB charger while traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost two, one in each of those ways, but I keep replacing them, so take that for whatever its worth.</li>
            <li> it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush so far and haven&#x27;t had any issues a month in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money...</li>
            <li> but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product about three weeks, but so far so great.</li>
            <li> thought this comparison might be useful, since I used the Oral-B for about three years before the battery died completely, and I am using the Philips for more than a year already.</li>
            <li> Well worth every cent with the five modes.</li>
            <li> So far no issues....:)</li>
            <li> for this price its all worth it for 2.5 yrs .</li>
            <li> I love these things, but I purchased mine at the end of June 2012 and just this month it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really a big deal, as I don&#x27;t plan on using it while scuba diving, but it is a nice touch.     </li>
            <li> so the Sonicare wins in the battery department.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is one powerful</li>
            <li> That means I have to move the brush around more than I am used to with my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Dental care is definitely important and something I wish I had taken more seriously in my younger days...  </li>
            <li> My mouth and teeth feel so fresh.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> me, it&#x27;s worth the expense of replacing the brush heads, because what would be the point of using this electric toothbrush,</li>
            <li> me, this Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush has made my teeth alot whiter, given my smile confidence, which in turn has given me confidence.  </li>
            <li> think this Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> &quot; it will be worth every cent.</li>
            <li> The only thing that effectively delivers a plaque-reducing and bacteria-killing mechanism even deeper into the gumline is an oral irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also makes brushing fun for me as well.  </li>
            <li> its worth it in the end.  </li>
            <li> Cust support was nice enough-</li>
            <li> The multiple setting are nice</li>
            <li> I know it is worth</li>
            <li> Sonic Care tooth brush is worth the money I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> and my mom is too nice and did not tell me it broke until last year (2013!)</li>
            <li> They also include a travel charger, which is nice, but you would only need this for an extended trip away from home with the increased battery life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to buy replacement heads at Amazon or Walmart for this particular model.  </li>
            <li> We own several.  </li>
            <li> I thinkthis is the most worse Customer Service I ever experienced.</li>
            <li> It did its job nicely while it was working, but you&#x27;d think that a $200 unit would last a bit longer than 1.5 years.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> id say its worth it...</li>
            <li> Then, the handle started shutting off mid-brush and turning on on its own (including in the middle of the night).  </li>
            <li> Love the fact you can place brush in the blue light cleaning compartment after each brushing.</li>
            <li> and I believe it was worth it.</li>
            <li> but after you open up the box you see this nice silver finsih with no text.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice if you think it actually makes your toothbrush cleaner</li>
            <li> but it is worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> for the increased tissue health it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> then it would be worth it.      </li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but your chompers are worth it, and going through gum surgery (so I am told) is no picnic at the beach.</li>
            <li> The other great thing about this brush is that it has three different settings depending on how much time you have, and I love the massage setting for your gums!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as cheap as buying it here, but I was able to get a 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty &amp; considering how many people seem to have had trouble with motors or batteries failing</li>
            <li> worth considering over the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; Philips, and reading some of the reviews on the design of the Diamondclean</li>
            <li> worth considering over the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; Philips, and reading some of the reviews on the design of the Diamondclean</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This brush also offers a few brushing modes so that you can select what suits you best.</li>
            <li> That being said, I rarely use the UV thing and the charger can get wiped off.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.  </li>
            <li> We are out $148 and have a minimally useful toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li> Rarely get cavities during Dental visit, still lovin this product.</li>
            <li> This is SO worth every penny</li>
            <li> in my opinion, has ceased to be worth the price they charge.</li>
            <li> (so that I can get another replacement under the two year warranty) or 2 years (so that I feel like I got my $$ worth).</li>
            <li> I rarely change it.</li>
            <li> I could not have made a better decision unless I&lt;br /&gt;Lived with a professional dentist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> However, she cannot use this brush every day, as it irritates one of her sensitive teeth, so if that is an issue, hand brushing might be better.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for the brush head cleaning, but different settings that showed a difference would have been nice.</li>
            <li> To ber perfectly honest, this item is a bit of a luxury: it doesn&#x27;t need multiple vibration settings.</li>
            <li> The product is well designed and feels worth the cost.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> It is really worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li> It is nice to use the sterilizer regularly.</li>
            <li> it felt kind of odd &amp; took some getting use to, but when I was done my mouth felt so clean!</li>
            <li> The ability to select different brushing programs for quick touch-ups, normal brushing, or longer brushing is something I have been using more and more.</li>
            <li> If you use this right before bed, you will probably want to close your bathroom door to avoid having the nice blue glow in your bedroom.  </li>
            <li> this is a first electric brush for me - so i don&#x27;t have a true basis for comparison - other than subsequent dentist visits whereby the hygienists were impressed with my gum improvements.</li>
            <li> UV sanitizer is a great little bonus when you really want to clean your brush.  </li>
            <li> so much I wondered if I could keep using it, but by the third brushing that all went away and I just enjoyed the clean smooth feeling it gave my teeth.</li>
            <li> just how well the sanitizer works verses normal rinsing but given how easy it is to use I use it after every brushing.</li>
            <li> You really do get the kind of clean that you only get after getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> the gradual increase in pressure over the first 14 uses of the brush &#x3D; brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;4) multi-level settings for full/extended brushing or quick refreshers when you are headed out somewhere&lt;</li>
            <li> The timer helps you make sure you brush the right amount of time, the different settings give you lots of options, and the technology helps keep your teeth clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Whats more is that to repair these, they were going to charge me as much as it would have been to purchase a new one!</li>
            <li> I have had a previous model of Sonicare for well over 5 years and absolutely loved it, so I was pretty excited to upgrade to the Flexcare+.</li>
            <li> I actually wish I could brush my teeth MORE often - I can&#x27;t get over how awesomely clean my teeth feel, and I want them to feel that way all the time.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Philips Sonicare FlexCare plus, Rechargeable toothbruth with the sanitizer to help keep my teeth, gums, filings, and crowns clean in order to make them last longer and stay healthy.  </li>
            <li> The problem was I kept pulling off the top piece and putting it away in it&#x27;s case every night and the constant wear and tear of that broke the piece that vibrates to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I personally only use the gumcare and clean settings, but after just one week my teeth and gums feel so much better.  </li>
            <li> It worked better than a manual toothbrush, but I was still getting quite a bit of staining on my front teeth from coffee (only one cup a day) and my teeth never felt completely clean after brushings.</li>
            <li> I love the UV cleaner it seems to give my brushes that extra clean that they need to help keep my breath fresher longer.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is good enough that I&#x27;ll be buying another Sonicare, just not this model since it&#x27;s older</li>
            <li> I am looking into alternate toothbrushes, and have found their main competitor to have good reviews, and will give them a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recall my original Sonicare toothbrush, I ended up not using it too much.   </li>
            <li> The motor on this model is also much quieter compared to the original which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I love that the head is smaller and can more easily get to the back teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean the brushes and always ready to go for the next brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never thought I was good at lasting the requisite / needed time period for brushing, but this is so pleasant that I find it&#x27;s not enough to go through only one timed circuit.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if the Sonicare Airfloss and a regular brush would have done the same thing, but I will say that this is a lot more pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I asked my dental hygienist about the difference (she had both models right there)</li>
            <li> This version, the FlexCare plus, gets it right.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> The intensity seems spot on and the 10 minute cycle seems about right.</li>
            <li> right before you press the ON button to start brushing.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> right before I&#x27;m going to brush again.    </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it and He was right.</li>
            <li> Philips should acknowledge that these handles are defective and do the right thing by recalling.</li>
            <li> and I feel that I made the right decision.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even the right model of toothbrush handle.  </li>
            <li> so they tried to put things right</li>
            <li> and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> The first brushing gave me amazing improvement in the overall cleanliness of my teeth and now after a month of use,I have noticed improved health in my gums as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush for the duration of the few months that it is operational, but a 4-5 month replacement cycle is pretty unacceptable.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem to last just fine, but theres something in the body of that mechanism that breaks a bit too easily.</li>
            <li> It works great for the first few months and then begins to lose its mojo.</li>
            <li> The first (Elite model) was amazing and worked for several years.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for the past 7 years and this one by far is the best one to date.  </li>
            <li> (If you give it a full charge, your toothbrush should last more than a week, so you may not need to pack the travel</li>
            <li> (If you give it a full charge, your toothbrush should last more than a week, so you may not need to pack the travel charger).    </li>
            <li> based on what I&#x27;ve experienced so far though, I wish I would have invested in one of these long ago.</li>
            <li> The metal prong is just press fit into plastic, yet it is the main vibrating part.</li>
            <li> Who wants to put slime in their mouth when they are trying to CLEAN their teeth?</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is made real well and is easy to figure ,it does a good job cleaning your teeth and has multiple switches to clean you teeth in different way,</li>
            <li> My teeth whitened up fast and areas where i&#x27;m used to staining are all clean now (from what i can see in my mirror).</li>
            <li> I thought it worked fine for about 2 years with normal use.  </li>
            <li> If you want a toothbrush that really gets your teeth squeaky clean a Philips Sonicare is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li> I tend to swap heads keeping 2 in there clean and ready to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does clean very well</li>
            <li> I also used an Oral-B model and it didn&#x27;t clean my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is simple to use, works great has easy useful functions and operates effortlessly.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get used to the VERY strong sonic power of this brush (even though I came from a basic electronic brush)</li>
            <li> I wish they could tone it down a bit more, say 50% more.</li>
            <li> Keep it simple, save money and purchase the Original SoniCare or Original Oral-B systems!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I spent the money for a great clean and hopefully less time at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I need an old toothbrush to clean the Sonicare handle!  </li>
            <li> GumCare&#x27; takes 3 minutes, the first 2 minutes of this mode are just like clean, and the last minute is more of the &#x27;massage&#x27; feature, which is a bit softer and is meant to use for brushing your gums.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is even more slender than the previous, more lightweight &amp; easier to use.</li>
            <li> The brush has some nice touches such as the electronic head sanitizer, as well as multiple functions (Clean Teeth, Clean Gums, Massage, Quick Brush, etc.).</li>
            <li> She really like it and says it work very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I now have a new toothbrush and it appears to be working just fine.  </li>
            <li> If you have excellent brushing habits as is, then this product is going to make things better and potentially could make things worse.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt so clean after brushing them and the next morning they still felt clean!</li>
            <li> The small travel charger is great.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush but It barely lasted me over a year.</li>
            <li> However, with this brush, it&#x27;s amazing how much cleaner and fresh my mouth feels only after two minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner, the width of the toothbrush head is much smaller and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> The rubber ring that seals the top has apparently deteriorated over time and allowed water to enter the inside of the unit.</li>
            <li> But this line satisfies my neat-freakness and does a great job cleaning, as usual.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard this from other reviewers, and I can tell you from my own experience that after a week of use, I still have full bars (3 of 3) showing on the display.  </li>
            <li> While the price here was good for the HX6972/10, it is about $40 higher than for the HX6992/10 at other places.  </li>
            <li> And the lady on the line was so nice that it did not take long for me to receive a replacement handle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I want to keep my own teeth as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very powerful, yet quiet model and it&#x27;s easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that I&#x27;d have a long wait for delivery, but was very happy when it arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li> Particularly if you are the nerd variety and enjoy fun new gadgets, and being able to tell people that your new space toothbrush has a UV sanitation chamber.</li>
            <li> And after about 3 days the power kind of died down significantly.</li>
            <li> I put my brush in there after every use and after going on long trips to make sure my brush is always clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I believe it&#x27;s a great improvement on personal hygiene, I&#x27;d recommend to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;Especially young people in their 20&#x27;s; as they still have a chance to save their teeth, and this tool is so much better than a regular brush!their 20&#x27;s; as they still have a chance to save their teeth, and this tool is so much better than a regular brush!</li>
            <li> you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly seems like it is a doing a far better job on my teeth than any toothbrush did before, none of that midday \\&quot;film\\&quot; that I used to get.</li>
            <li> I realized that even though it looks like a kid&#x27;s brush it really is far better for my mouth than the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; large brushhead.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use - open the box, read the instructions, plug it in and after charging, it is ready to use!  </li>
            <li> 5 years and 2 month later toothbrush is still going strong!</li>
            <li> So glad we did, as the four of us love it, even the little kids.</li>
            <li> Last, but not least; speaking to the real reason for using an electric toothbrush....my teeth and gums are clean and healthy!  </li>
            <li> The site had a \\&quot;live chat\\&quot; option, but no agents were available according to the chat application.      </li>
            <li> and they are sending me a new toothbrush free of charge.  </li>
            <li> The new brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and they are sending out a new bulb to me for free.</li>
            <li> I told her my issue, gave her my serial number, and an order for a new unit was place free of charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary -  If you buy an electric toothbrush, I highly suggest the original SoniCare product.  </li>
            <li> If you buy an electric toothbrush, I highly suggest the original SoniCare product.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that this new flexcare plus model has a closed handle and the toothbrush goes onto a metal rod so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and finally you clean the enamels of your teeth&#x27;s for the top side and bottom side for a complete clean.     </li>
            <li> I wanted something that would be as gentle as the elite and would have bought a second one, but liked the additional features of the flexcare plus.</li>
            <li> That is, the vibrating action is not as strong...</li>
            <li> Its a great product, my teeth are much white then when i used a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that (basically) gingivitis is initially caused by plaque accumulation and soft plaque can be removed by good hygiene (e.g. brushing AND flossing).</li>
            <li> The brushing does great work and your teeth and gums and made a noticeable difference, especially to my dentist who made mention of it on my next visit.  </li>
            <li> (I know, gross but even if you replace your brush head every 3 months like recommended it&#x27;s easy to forget to clean out the moisture inside which can build up into mold).</li>
            <li> I researched for several months as I still wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth over $100.  </li>
            <li> This is a good upgrade over the previous model.</li>
            <li> I knew I wanted to go back to Sonicare and am so happy I finally did!</li>
            <li> It costs quite a bit more than a regular toothbrush (but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to make the pause between cycles more distinct; if you are not paying attention you can miss the change.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous sonicare which was good</li>
            <li> , this is the most powerful brush Sonicare currently makes</li>
            <li> In summary, a good toothbrush, but plan on replacing it after less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a full 10 minutes to complete a full sanitization session, but I just turn on the sanitation while I am showering and/or flossing-</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT investment in your dental hygiene; dentist bills are a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> The smaller profile is much easier to handle and the improvements in the brush head design are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my good old manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, and is obviously the result of several years of updates and refinement.</li>
            <li> brush head isn&#x27;t easy for young children or those with disabilities to attach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have a great checkup every 6 months even though I only actually brush once a day.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good because I don&#x27;t think the soft case can properly protect the metal stem sticking out of the handle.</li>
            <li> After five days i noticed less bleeding from my gums, this has to be a good thing.</li>
            <li> Easy Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush, White]].</li>
            <li> And if its fun your more likely to do it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for getting it shipped so quickly.</li>
            <li> I previously had another (older) Sonicare and liked that cheaper more basic design much better.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, the toothbrush is incredibly easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush until it has an internal short and melts apart.</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend the purchase for anyone who wants to take really good care of your teeth.</li>
            <li> It has proved to be a very effective response to my lazy dental habits.</li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare flexcare toothbrush for almost 4 years , I fall in love with this toothbrush right away, I tired all kind of electric toothbrushes (more than 10), flexcare by far is the best,the feeling of refreshness is no comparison.    </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to go on about what I like about this toothbrush since many other reviewers go into fine details about what there is to like about it.</li>
            <li> Even after the very first use, your teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I have had many Sonicare brushes, but I think Philips finally got it right with this one.</li>
            <li> I even turned off the easy start mode and tried it at full power, and it still wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth well enough.</li>
            <li> The design is sleek, easy to select different functions (massage, clean, etc.)and is powerful yet gentle.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Philips doesn&#x27;t appear to care very much about customer service.</li>
            <li> He likes this toothbrush very much.</li>
            <li> but i like it very much.</li>
            <li> but now i like it very much</li>
            <li> This new FlexCare is more complex to operate but does a superior job.  </li>
            <li> I just recently upgraded my original Sonicare Advanced toothbrush to</li>
            <li> So far the replacement handle is working just fine</li>
            <li> It worked fine until early November 2013.</li>
            <li> just use the normal &#x27;clean&#x27; function -</li>
            <li> This thing removes coffee/tea stains and removes residue from the gumline better than any other toothbrush/electric I&#x27;ve owned, and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is a beautiful piece of machinery.</li>
            <li> Sure, I called them and they said they would ship me a new handle for free but if this unit had lasted me just 2 months more, the warranty would have expired and there would have been no free replacement!</li>
            <li> it works great; the various timer modes really are useful, particularly the \\&quot;Refresh\\&quot; mode for a quick brush, and they stay set after you use them, so you don&#x27;t need to continually select your preferred mode when starting.  </li>
            <li> My new toothbrush seems very futuristic and easy to use.</li>
            <li> they just don&#x27;t make the new Sonicare as well as the original.</li>
            <li> The CSR said that even if I have a brand new handle from them, the original warranty date stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the brush sanitizer regularly and it gives me a feeling of confidence that my brush is clean to the point of germ free when I use it.</li>
            <li> I only use the UV light once a week to clean the brush head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery life is also a lot better than older models (mine was really old</li>
            <li> I really like the clean feeling that the Sonicare leaves and my gums feel much healthier.</li>
            <li> We upgraded from some older electric toothbrushes and we were quite surprised with how much better they have gotten.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and will suggest my whole family to use it !</li>
            <li> They rush to add and over hype so-called &amp;#34;big improvements&amp;#34; to their products to keep prices high while sacrificing true quality.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little high, but is well worth it as I find its use to be more entertaining than a chore and look forward both morning and night to using it.  </li>
            <li> The replacement unit worked fine for about 6 more months and developed the same problem again.</li>
            <li> Comes with a travel charger and a great travel hard case which protects your brush and keeps it all organized.  </li>
            <li> The gum care mode seemed great for me because I tended to bleed in my gums from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Also comes with a great travel case for brush unit, hard plastic with brush covers.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist told me she hardly had to do any cleaning because my teeth were in great shape.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the warranty is 24 months, so I called Philips and they quickly sent me a new handle of the same model for free.</li>
            <li> Purchased to place a very old original version of the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> My teeth never felt or looked clean afer using a 2 minute cycle, and the brush head after time kept moving around -- I knew it was time for a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge problem for me too, it&#x27;s incredibly sensitive and turns off or changes modes when i&#x27;m holding it like i would a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Basically, this feature starts you off with a gentler brushing experience for your first use, and the power gradually builds throughout the first week (i.e., 14 brushings).  </li>
            <li> This is my first review on any product</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t aware that the device comes with two sizes of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Of course if your looking at this brush the head replacement is probably pretty trivial seeing as how, well, if your willing to spend this money on a brush, purchasing replacement heads should not be an issue.    </li>
            <li> The most recent version of the toothbrush they show is the HX6950.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I like the extra accessory :)      </li>
            <li> This was a first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with both the toothbrush and the company.</li>
            <li> The larger heads also fit in the travel case, so you don&#x27;t have to use the compact travel head if you don&#x27;t want to!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> What is the exact issue you are facing with the unit?  </li>
            <li> : Could you confirm the exact issue you&#x27;re facing with it?  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel so much \\&quot;slicker\\&quot; and fresher than ever before!</li>
            <li> This model has a different type of connection that is much more sanitary.</li>
            <li> This latest upgrade feels like a big step up.</li>
            <li> this latest version is head and shoulders above the rest.   </li>
            <li> I now have next to no tarter, my teeth are cleaner and whiter than ever, my gums are healthy and going to the dentist is now a snap.  </li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted over 13 years and both my husband and me used it.  </li>
            <li> Just got a lot of toothpaste on my shirt and on the floor the first couple of times.</li>
            <li> It actually makes brushing a more pleasurable experience.</li>
            <li> but it is exponentially better at removing plaque than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> is in the process of going to put my toothpaste on and then pressing the bright green circular ON button to start brushing</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> and I am an avid coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> just got a toothbrush like this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush really does give you that \\&quot;fresh from the dentist\\</li>
            <li> The first two times I used this it tickled my mouth</li>
            <li> Love the different selections for program length and intensity of the oscillations.</li>
            <li> I love the different programs it has to choose from</li>
            <li> Still, its a fantastic brush and one that I can directly attribute to healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> In addition, more gadgets equate to potential repair problems.  </li>
            <li> Keep it simple, save money and purchase the Original SoniCare or Original Oral-B</li>
            <li> In addition, more gadgets equate to potential repair problems.  </li>
            <li> So much better than my standard tooth brush!</li>
            <li> Electric tooth brushes never seem to last more than 2 to 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I had a first generation sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure their actual cost is pennies.</li>
            <li> Got the toothbrush on a very timely manner--two days!  </li>
            <li> At first I was leery of the built in timer</li>
            <li> Love all the different modeson it.</li>
            <li> It tickles at first</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love the different levels you can use when brushing.  </li>
            <li> I love mine and will NEVER go back to a manual toothbrush!</li>
            <li> We had to buy another one since the first product came damaged.  </li>
            <li> The first is the Procare brush heads that come with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It takes more effort to switch between modes than to simply take the darn thing out of your mouth halfway through the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no joke when people tell you that you notice the difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li> but then you wouldn&#x27;t get to see the cool blue light when the sanitizer is working).  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s ticklish at first</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> This is the first Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased one for my wife, which is her first, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Although I have only been using the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Plus for about a week I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This is our first electric toothbrush and I wish I bought one years ago.  </li>
            <li> I guess I used that OralB brush for about 6 years (therefore I&#x27;m quite pleased with its reliability) following my dentist recommendation.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> They have been telling me to buy a higher quality brush for years,</li>
            <li> But at the same time I wish they found a way to make the design more</li>
            <li> i received this fourth replacement one month ago, so presumably it&#x27;s from the latest run manufactured.  </li>
            <li> Quadpacer timer to alert you when it&#x27;s time to change from top teeth to bottom teeth, and from inside to outside areas.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> At first i have to admit, it was intimidating because of how my teeth and gums reacted to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But when you first get the toothbrush, the toothbrush automatically knows that your teeth can&#x27;t quite handle it</li>
            <li> After about the first week, I think I got used to it</li>
            <li> The first time it broke, it slipped and fell into the sink.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that the brush gives you a signal when it&#x27;s time to switch to the next section.  </li>
            <li> Love the extra features..</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips!</li>
            <li> If you pay $140 for something, it has to last more than 4 months.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it tickled a lot</li>
            <li> the brush goes so fast, that any toothpaste just flies off the brush!</li>
            <li> but the short modes make me brush more often between meals.</li>
            <li> Just today (almost exactly a year since I got it)</li>
            <li> And because I am better at brushing my teeth, it has been a lot easier to get disciplined about flossing and mouthwashing properly.</li>
            <li> They do a noticeably better job of cleaning, and are easier than regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this Sonicare over the Oral-B at first based on the number of reviews on the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C</li>
            <li> First one broke within 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush and the various settings, as well as the built in timers.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it for the recommended 2 minutes - don&#x27;t cut that time short.  </li>
            <li> First one broke within 1-2 years.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my teeth feel like I just left the dentist, but without the dentist price!</li>
            <li> I love the different cleaning settings and the sanitizing cycle.  </li>
            <li> so I was hesitant at first</li>
            <li> I had to spend several hours before I was able to do so.  </li>
            <li> We used a Sonicare for 8 years and if the on/off rubber switch hadn&#x27;t finally disintegrated, might have used it for 8 more.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience using an electric toothbrush, so I did not know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the idea of having different options.  </li>
            <li> I think your smile is one of the first things, if not the first thing people will notice when they look at you, so to have that added confidence is very important.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hope this helped;-)</li>
            <li> you see a big differences it helps your teeth to be healthy gums buy it</li>
            <li> I really like the way my teeth have that fresh feeling after using this toothbrush that is like just leaving the dentist office.  </li>
            <li> The brush has a timer for each quadrant (outside diameter of top teeth, inside diameter of top teeth, outside diameter for bottom teeth, and inside diameter for bottom teeth).  </li>
            <li> , most seemed the same, like</li>
            <li> I have not tried the ones that come with the flexCare plus yet, I went with the &#x27;upgrade&#x27; ones for my first try.</li>
            <li> Until it died exactly one year after I bought it.</li>
            <li> After the first use (and all others)</li>
            <li> I love the way it times your brushing and lets you know when to move on to the next quadrant</li>
            <li> I have not used the sanitizer yet although I think that is a pretty neat feature.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon</li>
            <li> however i doubt the reliability of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using electric toothbrush about 4 years ago, first started with Sonicare Crest Intelliclean.</li>
            <li> However, the first one broke the day after we got it.</li>
            <li> REALLY!  </li>
            <li> exactly when</li>
            <li> and this is actually my first Amazon review, ever, despite being a customer for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> First world problems.  </li>
            <li> It is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Only time will tell :)</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleans my teeth better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> love the options on the toothbrush and for different types of cleanings.</li>
            <li> On the first use, I was horrified I hadn&#x27;t updated sooner.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> It felt as if my brain would be scrambled at first.</li>
            <li> All their products are stellar but the flexcare plus outdoes anything they have produced before or since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would have lasted me longer if I just kept the same toothbrush head on until I had to replace it.</li>
            <li> but i use &#x27;gum care&#x27; most of the times which is 3 mins in total.</li>
            <li> Ultimately what matters though is the job the brush does, and let me say it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> so i read as many reviews as possible before spending any money.</li>
            <li> These are all just slightly different speeds and durations but everyone can choose their favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is my first battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonicare cleans teeth so much better than regular brushing alone.  </li>
            <li> My first Sonicare toothbrush was a more basic model, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Even after the first time using this one my teeth felt that way.  </li>
            <li> and I love having all the different settings and choices of speeds.  </li>
            <li> and I love having all the different settings and choices of speeds.  </li>
            <li> I have used electric toothbrushes before, but this was my first model that utilized \\&quot;sonic</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter, cleaner and feel so much better than with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It actually tickled my top inside gums to the point i had to move from that area</li>
            <li> Just what they had said in the product description, works exactly what they said.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll bug Philips first, but</li>
            <li> but if you want to take care of your teeth, it is NOT expensive.</li>
            <li> Love the UV feature and the selection of all the different cleaning modes on this model.</li>
            <li> This is my first mechanical toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have owned these sonicare brushes since they first came out</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> and I love the various settings.</li>
            <li> This lasted exactly 2.5 years and the battery died.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much better performance and longevity from the generic heads at a 1/3 the price.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until yesterday (Oct 20, 2012), the unit made a loud noise and the brush stopped moving.</li>
            <li> have owned this product for a week so far, and it has been light on my gums and feels even cleaner and smoother than the Oral B did.  </li>
            <li> This is my first sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is the first electric tooth brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> this is the first sonic toothbrush I ever had</li>
            <li> this toothbrush can only make things better</li>
            <li> and it still works like the day I first tried it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I have used an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Even the green bars that show the charge level are pretty bright.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> What really irks me is that this outfit puts two plug adapters into the box to make it compatible with US outlets!  </li>
            <li> a real winner!</li>
            <li> my first flex care, I would remove the head and sanitize it every night.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t LOVE it is because of the cost of those replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> For the first time, my dentist didn&#x27;t find any cavities.  </li>
            <li> It did seem to work well at first, but can no longer use.</li>
            <li> Sure enough</li>
            <li> This item was sent to me via Amazon AFTER the first one was stolen on delivery.</li>
            <li> What really surprised me at how hassle free the process was.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this toothbrush, which I use daily.</li>
            <li> It was almost one of the first things we bought together after we got married.</li>
            <li> For $129 dollars plus tax?Even at the $100 plus tax my dentist charged with discount, TOO MUCH!</li>
            <li> the first customer service rep had me do.</li>
            <li> The first two each lasted about 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I found that MANY people have had the same issue.  </li>
            <li> Hope it means a better checkup next time.  </li>
            <li> When I received it, it was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t vibrate the brush head consistently.</li>
            <li> different types of brush styles makes it even better</li>
            <li> Rinsing the brush in hot water still works.</li>
            <li> This is my third replacement--over many years--of my Phillips Sonicare, a product I have been using since it was first introduced.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this last year and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this for my hubby as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> I love the sanitizing unit and the overall look of the unit.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks and beyond, I&#x27;m glad to say it worked, and my mouth feels terrific.</li>
            <li> really like these toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li> The sanitizer really makes the brushes seem fresh after every use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I just rinse the toothpaste off first.</li>
            <li> but I can say first hand that after owning this for almost a year now I am blown away by the quality, and the technology.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have bought.</li>
            <li> Besides that, the sonicare is exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I have a similar version, which I love.</li>
            <li> I always put the toothbrush back on the charger and it sits on top of my decorative tissue box.</li>
            <li> I want to have it stand pretty in my bathroom</li>
            <li> only true criticism I have is that the price is definitely steeper than what most people are going to be comfortable paying, and from what I am told these things do NOT have an indefinite shelf life.</li>
            <li> I am sure they will do all they can to help you find a solution if one is possible.</li>
            <li> The different modes are pretty cool, especially the one for people with sensitive teeth like me, and it&#x27;s nice that it comes programmed to start off easy.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it - but could have gotten a double one for less at Costco, but am happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> There are very few products that I can say I actually love, but this is a product I truly love.</li>
            <li> We loved these while they worked, but both my husband&#x27;s and mine died after a year and half!</li>
            <li> There appears to be no distinction between Clean and Refresh, and the directions only indicate that the Clean mode is designed for a two minute brush, while the Refresh is designed for a one minute brush.  </li>
            <li> The gumcare mode is really the main one I use, it combines the 2 minute clean with a 1 minute cycle for your gums.  </li>
            <li> The brush is easier to keep clean and to clean when necessary.  </li>
            <li> Although the cost of replacement heads makes a cheapskate like me less eager to switch out, the heads are very long-lasting nevertheless making it a good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is much easier to keep clean than the older sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I got used to it quickly though and the results are so much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> -  two suffered from a defective battery where the unit would never achieve full charge and would need to be recharged after just a day of use, even from new.    </li>
            <li> You will notice how much cleaner your teeth feel right away.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews here and finally decided to buy it after the overwhelming amount of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Plus the sanitizer insures clean brush heads everytime which honestly is the only reason why I initially bought this.</li>
            <li> So simple and nice to know that your brush is clean for the next day.  </li>
            <li> The literature is really sparse on whether a sterile toothbrush has significant health effects, but there is a growing body of research that implicates dental bacteria in a variety of systemic diseases and disorders, so a sterile toothbrush is certainly not a negative.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine though, as it was more a gimmicky feature for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Works very well to clean my teeth that the normal toothbrush won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have peridontal issues when using a manual brush and my first sonicare turned my dental visits around to a completely positive experience.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is an amazing toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is amazing too; you wouldn&#x27;t believe how many germs sit on the average toothbrush left in a bathroom.</li>
            <li> Though my gums got a good report at my last dentist visit they did discover the first cavity I&#x27;ve had in years between two back molars which my dentist asserts could have been prevented by thorough flossing.  </li>
            <li> They fixed all the issues that existed with the original.  </li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll have to buy your own adapter to charge in other countries.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice that it has the other options too.</li>
            <li> - They swapped the flat part that prevents the brush from rolling from the top to the bottom with this model.  </li>
            <li> It has a lot of power behind each brush, but that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> I usually use the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting, but having the timed &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; quick-brush has come in handy several times and the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; setting is nice too.</li>
            <li> It is so intense that it is very very ticklish at first.</li>
            <li> The hard case and additional small-size charger are nice additions for the traveller, though I wish the charger could somehow fit inside the case with my brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but you will never find a toothbrush that leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than this one, and personally I find it hard to put a price tag on excellent hygiene.</li>
            <li> This is much more user friendly than the previous model&#x27;s Clean, Sensitive, and Massage modes paired with the separate routines of Go Care and Max Care.  </li>
            <li> After a quick troubleshooting they took my address and mailed me out a new handle.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my new one and really feel like I had a clean mouth and teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Successfully meeting my 2 requirements for being happy with my new tooth brush, the Sonicare went above and beyond when it comes to the actual brushing.</li>
            <li> I really like this new toothbrush and its different options, plus the sanitizer is a nice add on.  </li>
            <li> So far they have been very helpful and even sent free brush heads to make up for some mis-information they gave me about the rebate forms.  </li>
            <li> All of these options have an amazing slight pause every 30 seconds, that you use to make sure you are spending equal time in each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare has five modes: Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive and Massage.   </li>
            <li> and wow does it clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go as far as saying I feel \\&quot;dentist\\&quot; clean after using this thing</li>
            <li> So far I have used the Clean and Gum Modes and the quadpacer has does its job well.</li>
            <li> There are five modes to choose from:  Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage.  </li>
            <li> old Sonicare was a pain to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> brushing modes - clean, gum care, refresh, sensitive and massage.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Plus are Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage.  </li>
            <li> So now, the UV sanitizer is history and I clean it the old school way.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel extremely clean after each session as if I just had them professionally done.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean after using both the sensitive and massage options-</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but would be nice to not have to consciously avoid parts of my toothbrush every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips, work on that for the next model please. :)</li>
            <li> I also really like the sanitizer as it provides an extra level of protection against most germs on my brush head.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of cavities as a kid (as I&#x27;m sure you can imagine), and now that I&#x27;m an adult, those old fillings have started to go.</li>
            <li> And she is definitely not enamored with my gripping the whole brush to pull it off.  </li>
            <li> So I upgraded to the elite which I loved but after several years the battery finally gave out.</li>
            <li> FAR better than my old Oral B.</li>
            <li> I really feel something of this price should last more than 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> Possibly it was superior to the current models.</li>
            <li> This is a well-made brush - my mom got a more basic model to replace hers and it seems much cheaper and plasticy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple other Sonicare toothbrushes in the past (the kind that unscrew into 2 pieces &amp; expose the vibrating magnets) &amp; have always loved Sonicare.</li>
            <li> worth their high price.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money, and it came highly recommended from my dentist.</li>
            <li> So that you can choose from five different settings from massage to clean!</li>
            <li> By the way, even with less powerful stokes, felxcare plus is still a very good toothbrush compare to others, It just not up to the standard set by my 4-years old flexcare, That&#x27;s why I gave it a 3-stars.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and has several other (four more, I think) settings for additional mouth care...especially like the refresher one which gives you a quick one-minute go-over.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for a little more than a week, and so far love it.  </li>
            <li> Also, it has several settings and it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> We bought this toothbrush looking at all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews made me choose this brand and model over competitors.</li>
            <li> I pretty much use Clean,GumCare,and Massage.  </li>
            <li> Yes, you can actually feel your teeth becoming cleaner while it works.</li>
            <li> Although the brush itself continues to function, the built-in UV sanitizing port (which sanitizes the brush head in a ten minute light cycle), started acting erratically after three weeks, requiring you to push the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button repeatedly - sometimes more than seven or eight times - and now, this morning, has quit altogether.  </li>
            <li> First let me begin by telling you that I did not care much about brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> It is much lighter weight and easier to handle than the old one I had and seems to have somewhat better brushing action.</li>
            <li> I have had it about 3 weeks and also needed to take it on a trip and was pleased at how long the charge lasts.  </li>
            <li> There was no way I could brush as fast and consistently as that lil guy did.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product so far, I especially like the timer, for changing to the different areas in your mouth</li>
            <li> the other hand, it does as good a job cleaning the teeth as the old model we wore out.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums so every time I brush, the sink is full of blood.  </li>
            <li> I have loved the experience since I bought the brush a few months ago!</li>
            <li> you can afford it by all means go for this one as it is far and away superior to any other electric toothbrush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Since the first time using this Sonicare brush, my teeth finally feel clean -- and definitely look and feel better.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this and have already recommended to a friend who compared it to his older Sonicare which was hard to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> There are many settings to use, typically I&#x27;ll use the normal or normal with gum massage cycles, but sometimes I&#x27;ll do a quick clean cycle just to freshen up.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG great \\&quot;tool\\&quot; to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I had to get rid of my first sonicare, which was fine for a couple of years, then the motor would simply stop.</li>
            <li> This thing took a little while to get used to, but with all the settings on it, I was able to gradually work up to the full \\&quot;clean\\&quot;</li>
            <li> these new toothbrushes do not hold up as well as the older ones which last forever, although they do vibrate faster and more powerful at the beginning.</li>
            <li> one problem I had with the older model was that when you selected what function you wanted - sensitive, regular or quick brush - you couldn&#x27;t tell for sure that you had selected correctly.  </li>
            <li> I am one hundred and ten percent satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I loved the &#x27;sonic&#x27; vibration, and I had very few dental problems.  </li>
            <li> , travel case is pretty hard so thats good.     </li>
            <li> Just one month after using this, the person I gave this gift to went to the dentist and the hygienist commented about the amazing condition of his gums based on previous visits - he \\&quot;must be flossing\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This one has multiple settings and a sanitizing feature which works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> First, it is one of the newest models (they have the UV light for cleaning) and second</li>
            <li> so I bought one for my wife, who is very particular, and she loves it as well.  </li>
            <li> arrived so quickly also, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips did a nice job of simplifying the mode selection over the previous FlexCare model.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush is easy to use and multiple settings allow u to customize brush mode to needed cleaning level.  </li>
            <li> We love the brush cover with the UV light - no more fecal matter from flushed toilets onto my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is easy enough to do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine spending this kind of money on an appliance and have it work for less than 60 days.  </li>
            <li> it is way too easy to accidentally touch the on-off switch or the settings and either turn off the brush or move into a different level of cleaning.</li>
            <li> just dry off the bristles on a towel, nothing more is needed.</li>
            <li> as i read in customer reviews by previous sonicare owners the toothbrush lasts about 5 years and its nice</li>
            <li> In all cases, the motor is very quiet and the slim handle is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is easy to use and keeps your brush heads lasting longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never be able to go back to a normal toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is worth it in the long run, however, since your dental health is important.</li>
            <li> 28 April 2013 - i am about to order this same product for my mother, and thought i would update again to say this toothbrush is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Brush gives great action to clean teeth including behind teeth.</li>
            <li> If anyone reads both parts of my review, my father still has the same tooth brush and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> 5 years later, and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Certainly you get more brushes from a single charge, so you can take the brush traveling without worrying about having to recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From a pure cleaning functionality perspective....</li>
            <li> Perhaps offering a unit without the UV Sanitizer could lower the pricesome, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect a large difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t keep the dock in my bathroom, as it&#x27;s quite large.  </li>
            <li> Large range of levels of intensity.</li>
            <li> This kit is certainly designed to be shared between cohabitants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the unit is slightly loud, but not to the point where you&#x27;ll wake up your whole family, just a normal whirling sound.    </li>
            <li> My wife and I had many problems with a prior model with bleeding gums, etc. - even with new bristles.</li>
            <li> Customer service has been great, but this will be my third handle in less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> The good changes are noticeable: teeth are less sensitive, stronger, cleaner.</li>
            <li> Also, something to note is that the amount of time you brush is very important and you cannot compensate with a harder bristled brush.</li>
            <li> New one is really nice, works well and especially like the built in head clear.</li>
            <li> My new one is even better than the first one and it pays off in the long run.</li>
            <li> There are 5 different settings which work just fine.  </li>
            <li> Purchased originally in August 2012, had the first problem in April 2013 (got a replacement handle from Sonicare), and now having the same problem again.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be just fine, so that is not too big of a deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am interested to know if anyone has found other better electronic tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> It would be great if the door could pop open after the sanitizing was done to allow the brushes to dry naturally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been the pricier way to dental hygiene, but now the consumer is getting  inferior manufacturing and half the size of the original product,and still paying the original higher cost.</li>
            <li> I did just fine without one for the last 4 decades.</li>
            <li> I love having multiple settings for different functions- including the quick setting if I&#x27;m in a hurry or on the go.</li>
            <li> The first was an older type I used for about 2 years, but they discontinued it and no longer made the replacement heads</li>
            <li> and my gums were very high,</li>
            <li> The look and feel of this tooth brush is very high tech and sleek.</li>
            <li> It has very high cleansing power.</li>
            <li> In any case, Philips has taken a very high quality product and, frankly, ruined it.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality.  </li>
            <li> feel the price is too high and probably limiting access to more people; it was one of the main objections to me purchasing it earlier.</li>
            <li> The travel case is nice, although it&#x27;s a little bulkier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Not too convinced with the UV de-sanitizer but the handle and brush quality is pretty high.</li>
            <li> This toothcare was considered a higher end electric toothbrush, and came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Expensive but very good</li>
            <li> The new version is no where near the quality of the original Sonicare and that is a shame.  </li>
            <li> How many times have you brushed your teeth during an illness &amp; wondered if you were simply re-infecting yourself with whatever bug laid you up in the first place?!  </li>
            <li> and I can already tell a HUGE difference in my gum health, and several people have remarked that my teeth seem whiter.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in how I brush my teeth different and it takes no time at all.  </li>
            <li> Also really like the convenience of removing the head section and cleaning with the ultraviolet compartment.</li>
            <li> And although it&#x27;s not THAT intense of a feeling, it&#x27;s as close as you&#x27;re going to get at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush heads can be bought for a reasonable price in packs on</li>
            <li> sanitizer works very well</li>
            <li> On the whole, however, this toothbrush delivers as advertised.     </li>
            <li> Also, if you open the door at any time during the cleaning, the UV light will immediately shut off (tried it).  </li>
            <li> I have no way of really knowing if it is working or not, but it appears to be doing its job.  </li>
            <li> When turned on you see a light illuminate from inside and omit this blue glow.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle but thorough cleaning each time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what I was in for.</li>
            <li> been usin nw for about a month, i thought it was reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> (last time it was a cheap knock off).    </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have read too much advertisement.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> I am really offended  </li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> no matter how much I cleaned it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li> You really do need 3 minutes to brush every area well....</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t brush your teeth and you need to spend this much money in order to motivate yourself, then I guess it&#x27;s a start.</li>
            <li> so that your gums and teeth get used to it, I like the different options available and the fact that it has a built in sterilizer and travel charger.  </li>
            <li> the bottom of the toothbrush will give your toothbrush a really funky odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bottom of the toothbrush will give your toothbrush a really funky odor.    </li>
            <li> I use it along with my wife, with separate brush heads, and the process is very manageable.    </li>
            <li> Both seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for their business.   </li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, my teeth were whiter and my mouth felt much cleaner.</li>
            <li> and this happens very often to</li>
            <li> Gets teeth much cleaner than manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It really changed me</li>
            <li> and I never use a manual toothbrush anymore unless I absolutely have to and without my sonicare.</li>
            <li> With all the modes possible, you are free to choose one variation to suit your mood at use time.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything I would disparage about the Flexcare Plus.</li>
            <li> all without too much thought.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I spent the money to get it.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me, and I highly recommend it to anyone out there who&#x27;s considering it!</li>
            <li> Amazon wants me to write twenty words to qualify for a review</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for the money, much cheaper than those at retail stores that I looked at.  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I felt it was important enough....</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in my gums already and it REALLY cleans my teeth.    </li>
            <li> My teeth were whiter and my mouth felt much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Something internally broke, makes buzzing/rattling sound and does not vibrate anymore as it should.</li>
            <li> Well, we have no way to tell, really.</li>
            <li> It really seems to get my teeth the very cleanest.</li>
            <li> It leaves you with a \\&quot;straight from the dentist\\&quot; feeling each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> I never though I would spend this much money on a toothbrush, but I splurged on it and now I&#x27;m recommending this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t sell just the handle, so I&#x27;d have to go buy the whole kit again.</li>
            <li> I really like the features.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the light bulb didn&#x27;t work and a replacement was to be sent within ten days.  </li>
            <li> There really aren&#x27;t any.  </li>
            <li> But since using this toothbrush, my teeth feel so much cleaner, even at the end of the day</li>
            <li> You can really feel the difference after brushing.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had accicently bumped the stand (gently).  </li>
            <li> Thanks Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to pay over $100 for a TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> She showed me the power the Sonicare has and stated it would really help me with the inflammation of my gums.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an electric toothbrush I would highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Only con is the toothbrush came with a warranty card that lists a website where u can register your product and get an extended warranty for free</li>
            <li> Dentists recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I just want to mention that, straight out of the box, the UV bulb didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended it, and I was reluctant to spend so much money on a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The ultrasonic vibration really massages the gums really well.</li>
            <li> Both of these products are available on-line with a 20% discount (shipping included), a total savings of around $46!!   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans very well&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The carrying case and portable charger are very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This one has to be pulled straight off, and I feel like I am going to break it.    </li>
            <li> I can really feel as my teeth are cleaner.</li>
            <li> I decided to go for this model because it wasn&#x27;t the highest model, yet it still had all the features I really needed.</li>
            <li> This thing really humms.</li>
            <li> This takes some getting used to, and a light touch is key.    </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it, especially considering how important it is to take care of your teeth.</li>
            <li> My hygentist really wanted me to get this model.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it really does.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Who wants a germy brush head</li>
            <li> This really works</li>
            <li> With the enclosure for the brush heads, they are not only protected from this, but they may also be sanitized by the UV light that comes with the unit.  </li>
            <li> and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li> But the whole thing was a comedy of errors.</li>
            <li> The whole rigmarole took 4 months.</li>
            <li> Very ergometric;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I solved both of these issues with this Sonicare, and much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gum issues and this is so gentle but thorough.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but we decided to get this model and then the whole family would use it.</li>
            <li> But now after a couple weeks of twice a day use, I can really see and feel the difference it has been making.</li>
            <li> You want to buy this brush, for real.  </li>
            <li> do you know how much you pay for filling, caps, dentures, etc.</li>
            <li> Have had this toothbrush for a month and really like it.  </li>
            <li> He really didn&#x27;t even want to try it, but I insisted that he give it a week.  </li>
            <li> , it went very well.  </li>
            <li> per my dentist my gums,plaque and everything are so much improved  </li>
            <li> But the quality of the battery is really bad.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The quadrant timer is also very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very</li>
            <li> I really like that it hesitates</li>
            <li> Really?)</li>
            <li> The price has really gone</li>
            <li> Very well calculated.</li>
            <li> It has a very tolerant rechargeable battery that will forgive you for neglecting or compulsively overcharging it.</li>
            <li> the UV light keeps you from re giving it back to yourself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also includes a sanitizer feature, which I really like.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the sanitizer thing so much.  </li>
            <li> I had this product for two years and it worked reasonably well.  </li>
            <li> Yellow charge light flashes and the brush is now a deadweight.  </li>
            <li> Ultra violet light is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> the enamel on my teeth is harder and my gums are much better.  </li>
            <li> everything is solid, parts fit together well, and the materials are sturdy.    </li>
            <li> I went in to get a dentist checkup, and my teeth were reasonably O.K.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m really writing this review is because my toothbrush started turning on and off sporadically this week.  </li>
            <li> The Plus model has a sleeker appearance with the various speeds not showing until you press the \\&quot;mode\\&quot; button to light up the choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the toothbrush, because when we don&#x27;t use Sonicare, the dentists notice.  </li>
            <li> I thought with the way this brush moves so fast that it would cause bleeding too</li>
            <li> I can say now that I have healthy pink gums that no longer bleed when I floss or brush.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about spending so much for a toothbrush</li>
            <li> Aside: I do the same with my Brita faucet filter because the LED light is flaky.    </li>
            <li> Really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is much like the one we owned before.</li>
            <li> This really works well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this month ago and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Teeth and gums feel much healthier and need for flossing is reduced.  </li>
            <li> This one seems to leave my teeth much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel that much cleaner</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks for selling this</li>
            <li> do i really need this ultraviolet device that disinfecting brush?</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the timed alerts that tell you after 30 seconds have passed when you are brushing your teeth so that you can move to a different section of your mouth to brush.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my teeth are much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> This unit has spent most of its life in the box.</li>
            <li> I really have a use for them now with my $150 toothbrush paperweight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried regular toothbrushes of course &amp; those cheap electric rotary toothbrushes that pretend to be sonic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After much research I decided to get this one.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy brush heads almost every 6 month because they get worn out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> After using &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode for more than a year I get a gum recession and had to switch to a &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; mode and be careful around those areas.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The timer is very helpful, and I really do find myself with a cleaner mouth (or so I feel it).  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> thanks mom &amp; dad) but</li>
            <li> I automatically bought the whole family sonicare toothbrushes</li>
            <li> The unit worked as advertized and was,in fact, better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The customer service was really polite on the phone, I got an email response confirming they had received my receipt within 5 minutes of me emailing it to them</li>
            <li> This unit has a pulsing blue light when the sanitizer is on which can light up an entire room at night.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well until now.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is absolutely fantastic and definitely goes along with the mission of encouraging people to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely spend the extra $10 to get a US model and hassle free packaging.  </li>
            <li> I could never bring myself to spend so much on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel much cleaner than manual</li>
            <li> Real customer service glitch.</li>
            <li> But once you get used to it, there really isn&#x27;t anything better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I got used to the brush, the cleaning mode was absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care about any of the &#x27;modes&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this toothbrush takes care of all areas in my mouth without much effort.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll probably get a much cheaper, disposable model.</li>
            <li> We contacted the Phillips customer service and they walked us through the tier one fixes; check the bulb, check the switch - the whole deal, and nothing helped.  </li>
            <li> weeks later, we called again - no product available, but it would be in and shipped ...</li>
            <li> I really like how it cleans itself.</li>
            <li> Really like this tooth brush and the sanitizer feature is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> It has really improved my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much, much cleaner than they were when I used a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Philips needs to work on the internal quality of their brushes and stop being so cheap about it.</li>
            <li> But when the time comes I do replace it, because when it woks it works really well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I also really like the sanitizer function for the heads.</li>
            <li> Our teeth really did feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The brushes were reasonable then as well.</li>
            <li> The different options might light up or not, the unit may or may not come on.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really need.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sonic toothbrush is all it is advertised to be and confirmed by numerous professionals reviews who advised that \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> and she is very picky about her teeth</li>
            <li> Thanks everyone for all the info.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on a quality product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much cleaner my mouth is since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I use it over my whole mouth and tongue after I brush my teeth with it-</li>
            <li> I paid a packet for this on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and I really regret it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really neat.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s supposed to be fully charged at the third light.  </li>
            <li> It really reduces gum problems as claimed and tooth decay.</li>
            <li> I like the portability as I travel and the case is very well designed.</li>
            <li> This is a much advanced product with several additional settings.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have not felt so smooth since my last dentist appt.</li>
            <li> Very cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can reach the rear molars really well</li>
            <li> The in-built timer is a real help to allow you to focus upon each quadrant in turn.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.  </li>
            <li> The whole \\&quot;germs\\&quot; thing...</li>
            <li> it is very efficient for tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it has been a good decision as this brush shouldn&#x27;t need the constant cleaning of the old one</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is easy to use, though I am mainly interested in the cleaning and massage effects, and not particularly in the &#x27; refresh &#x27; aspect ?</li>
            <li> For $30, the replacement brushes are the big catch here, kind of the same rip off as overpriced ink for computer printers.</li>
            <li> I liked it when it worked, but for the initial purchase price, plus the cost of brush replacements I&#x27;m going to look elsewhere for my next brush.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a big deal unless you&#x27;ll be traveling for more than two weeks, but I do frequently go on extended trips, and I&#x27;d rather have a case that holds everything I need.</li>
            <li> The textured bristles along with the 31,000 vibrations per minute not only remove plaque on the surface of the teeth, but effectively penetrate several millimeters below the gumline to break up plaque and kill bacteria.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I have have shared this brush but using our own brush heads for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t use the various functions even though I got this because my dentist said my gums were beginning to recede, and I also had a cavity at the same appointment.  </li>
            <li> That feature may be disabled, but I find it most useful.  </li>
            <li> I slowly went up to a cheap Oral B electric toothbrush, and it seemed to do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Bought this unit thinking it would be good as I have used sonic tooth brush for over 10 years now.&lt;br /&gt;This was the most disappointing product I purchase from Philips.</li>
            <li> It is fairly quiet and my husband seems to love it so far.</li>
            <li> I like the new Phillips Sonicare FlexCare Plus very much.  </li>
            <li> only problem I encounter is the brush head must fit on the handle in a certain direction -- you have to fit it on a rod, which is flat on one side.  </li>
            <li> I share this with my girlfriend, so we each have our own brush heads, and having the closed stand right next to it</li>
            <li> This one works great, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is nice too, just a little extra security for a clean mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning features are ok and pretty typical but the bells and whistles are bogus.  </li>
            <li> It tickled at first on my upper inside gums, but you quickly get used to it</li>
            <li> They are alittle pricey, but I do notice the difference when Iam using a new brush head, or closer to when I first have changed it, to when it&#x27;s closer to the 3 month</li>
            <li> First, they sent me a new toothbrush replacement.</li>
            <li> With the way the unit holds a charge, it can be easily taken on a long weekend trip without having to recharge.  </li>
            <li> I used an older sonicare model for a few years prior to purchasing this one, and it was great too.  </li>
            <li> This one works good like the others but will last longer cause spit/water won&#x27;t get inside it like the other models.    </li>
            <li> for the past three years, and even though that product is still available, for a slight price increase, the FlexCare Plus adds incremental improvements to what was already a very nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Wish they can very more and better color selections, for example, red, yellow, and green.</li>
            <li> After being told I was out of warranty and the unit was junk, I took it apart to confirm that yes, the main piece inside had separated and is made of cheap Chinese components.</li>
            <li> Significant advancement over prior products in this line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this for $190 on many other sites</li>
            <li> The Sonicare flexcare cleans better than any other model that I have used before.</li>
            <li> I have used the original Sonicare toothbrush for about 6 years until I noticed my dentist had this model sitting in his office at my last check up</li>
            <li> and they sent me out a replacement charger/sanitizer with prepaid shipping to send the original charger/sanitizer back to them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with this model with the UV sanitizer and all of the other accessories.</li>
            <li> However, I had to purchase this newer one because my other battery eventually died, so hopefully this one will have a longer shelf-life, even if that means more charges in-between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I had to purchase this newer one because my other battery eventually died, so hopefully this one will have a longer shelf-life, even if that means more charges in-between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush is so much better than the Sonicare Elite (and all other E Series) model.</li>
            <li> Apparently, many other people have found this problem too.</li>
            <li> My original Sonicare unit, not made by Philips, finally died.  </li>
            <li> and I think I replaced it only because I was excited about the newer models, not because it died...</li>
            <li> There may be other products that are better</li>
            <li> WHITENS AND CLEANS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER WE HAVE PURCHASED.</li>
            <li> We have tried many other styles and brands.  </li>
            <li> did the same experiment on the original toothbrush....</li>
            <li> I believe you might get better battery life using some of the other modes the brush possesses, so Phillipsis not misleading anyone with battery life claims.</li>
            <li> battery lasts longer than the other model I had, love the added travel case and charger.</li>
            <li> have since switched to the Philips Easy Clean (the last one lasted almost twice as long as this one).</li>
            <li> The old OralB did a good job, no doubt, but my recent FlexCare+ experience makes me wonder why did I wait for so long before switching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li> when I got the flexcare plus, right at first try, I felt the difference, the plus is less powerful and  didn&#x27;t clean my teeth properly, I though my feeling is fooling me (the plus is much quieter than my 4 years old flexcare) , I did a water test, I put both toothbrushes into  a pot of water, both full charged, turn them on, see how water splashes.    </li>
            <li> I am sure that the money that I spend purchasing these for my children will be well spent as I am sure that when I take them to the dentist, the savings will really show by way of less cavities.</li>
            <li> The booklet gives you an example of how to clean your teeth using different quadrants, but however you decide to do it, the whole idea is to use 4 30-second quadrants to clean your entire mouth in a 2 minute period.  </li>
            <li> A couple months in I could feel the tip where the brush attaches becoming loose.</li>
            <li> Confirmed with current owners and found that this product really does live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> They are sending me a new handle and a prepaid box to sent my old one back, for free!</li>
            <li> When I tried to brush with a regular toothbrush, I didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> It actually does give you that after the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel clean the entire day.  </li>
            <li> Most people write reviews after the first few months of having a product.</li>
            <li> toothbrush actually shoots water/(spit, too?)/toothpaste in between your teeth instead of just spinning to clean the surface.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is accidentally changing the setting from clean to another of the settings-</li>
            <li> In fact, one time the dentist asked if I had just had my teeth clean recently, but I had not since my checkup about a year before.  </li>
            <li> Clean\\&quot; cycle is a much cleaner feel than the older sonic technology.</li>
            <li> which is why i ultimately settled on this model, newest and no nooks &amp; crannies to clean).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having just used a regular brush all my life, I was amazed at the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;options&amp;#34;  like clean, gum care, etc.</li>
            <li> different heads (diamond clean)</li>
            <li> We upgraded from an older Sonicare system and really like the increased power and longer battery life of this model.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My teeth feel extra clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush stays clean enough, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The different modes on the toothbrush (clean, gum care, refresh, massage...</li>
            <li> It works very well, is comfortable to use, and has a timer to help me keep track of how long to brush.</li>
            <li> Only the &#x27;Clean&#x27; setting.  </li>
            <li> I have never felt such a clean after using this product.</li>
            <li> For the actual toothbrush I would give it 5 stars for ease of use, features, and ability to clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels extra clean after using this</li>
            <li> I have personally noticed how clean my teeth get.  </li>
            <li> Gum Care is actually an extended Clean.  </li>
            <li> Gum Care is actually an extended Clean.  </li>
            <li> But getting older I decided to really kick it up a notch and went for the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned multiple electric toothbrushes over the years, and I&#x27;ve had problems keeping them clean.</li>
            <li> if this brush worked only as well as a competitor, I would pick it for its ease of keeping clean.</li>
            <li> I still use a regular toothbrush to clean my tongue, but the sonicare can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I do like the capability of sanitizing the brushes and I definitely see a difference with the color of my teeth and the clean feeling after brushing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear good (or dark colored) clothes while using this thing:  Since the mouth has to be open while using the device (to keep it properely positioned and to avoid having teeth shattered -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted that I haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist yet since getting it, I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I will try to remember to come back and report if there is any positive changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy for water to be trapped under the UV sanitizer door which leads to mold growing in there.</li>
            <li> While I was spitting and rinsing after brushing the 2nd time with the Sonicare, I was surprised at how many food particles that my old brush missed!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to share a single handset and</li>
            <li> brush itself works great of course, and my mouth has never felt as clean as it has these past few days since I got it.  </li>
            <li> Usually I would have stains again 5 months later but my teeth are still nice and clean.</li>
            <li> rarely leave product reviews, but had to for this particular one so others are aware of the lack of quality within this Philips product - and potentially all Sonicare products .</li>
            <li> : If you decide to purchase a new Sonicare toothbrush, to help offset some of the cost, I can offer you 15% off your total Sonicare purchase along with free shipping at our Philps online store.   </li>
            <li> stopped working after 6 months, but it honestly makes very little sense anyway.</li>
            <li> A new habit seems to be developing between us: when either finishes brushing in the morning or before bed, we have been returning our brush to the sanitizer and installing the appropriate brush head for the other so that it is ready for immediate use.</li>
            <li> The blue light is fairly bright and much larger than the green battery indicator on the main brushing unit.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money, my dentist visits are always quick and never much plaque.    </li>
            <li> This brush is gentle enough to where my gums don&#x27;t bleed but are adequately cleaned.</li>
            <li> As a quick replacement I got a battery operated Sonicare which also worked well, but I saw this one on line and thought I would really like it because of the choice of settings, especially the gum care.</li>
            <li> Insructions easy; the pause system that tells u when u have spent enough time on a section of your teeth makes this so user friendly.</li>
            <li> The battery life before recharging is long and it is comfortable   to use it.</li>
            <li> It is a UV light, that I just read not too long ago, contains mercury.</li>
            <li> I was completely sold on this brush within the first couple days.  </li>
            <li> The infrared brush cleaner is also cool especially if you are a germ-a-fobic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another really cool thing about this brush is that it comes with 2 different chargers!</li>
            <li> After one full week, no one call me back</li>
            <li> I was told to contact the manufacturer when I first purchased it because it immediately developed problems.</li>
            <li> Although I liked it initially, after an unacceptablly short amount of time, it started making an unusually loud noise and</li>
            <li> but I usually end up ignoring that and doing my own thing.  </li>
            <li> It has a 30 second timer for each section of your teeth for a full two minutes of cleaning.</li>
            <li> The push button \\&quot;switch\\&quot; only worked intermittently and would not stay on for a full sanitizing cycle, let alone a recharge.  </li>
            <li> [For full disclosure, I am actually evaluating the \\&quot;PROFESSIONAL\\&quot; HX6992/10, obtained from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> This has been true of the last 3 Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The second model did stop working (gradually got weaker and weaker until it wasn&#x27;t really doing much more than a regular toothbrush)</li>
            <li> Have really liked using sonicare toothbrush in the past.  </li>
            <li> There are improvements in all areas compared to the previous FlexCare model, from the better cleaning modes, to the nice plastic travel case, the improved battery life that lasts twice as long as the old model, and the slightly quieter sound during its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sonicare can hold a charge for much longer than the Oral-B.     The UV lamp was a big selling point for me at first, but after I bought it, I thought it was overkill, and probably not necessary as I have been doing fine for over a quarter of a century without a germicidal lamp for my toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> but I like the Sonicare better overall for the sound and the clean feeling it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> The sensitive mode is okay, even though I consider myself to have sensitive teeth, I didn&#x27;t find it necessary to use that particular mode.</li>
            <li> I sent it off to get it fixed, and it came back just fine.</li>
            <li> I had to press it down it in its support for a better contact</li>
            <li> But the Philips customer service is outstanding, so should anything happen down the road</li>
            <li> They were very kind and helpful and allowed that they would ship a new unit along with a return shipping label (for the broken unit) immediately.  </li>
            <li> It tickles the inside of my mouth a little, but not so much that I fall on the ground laughing and can&#x27;t finish brushing :)</li>
            <li> In addition, you will save mega-bucks on the original system purchase, and the replacement brushes are cheaper than the new &#x27;tiny&#x27; heads.  </li>
            <li> In addition, you will save mega-bucks on the original system purchase, and the replacement brushes are cheaper than the new &#x27;tiny&#x27; heads.  </li>
            <li> Decided it was time to treat the teeth to a new experience!  </li>
            <li> In 11/2013, I purchased a new handle (here on Amazon- yay!)</li>
            <li> This new brush is thinner, lighter and has nowhere for the wetness from brushing to accumulate!</li>
            <li> TO BRUSH MY TEETH WITH MY NEW PHILLIPS SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH!</li>
            <li> I sometime feel like brushing a little longer just to make sure each tooth got clean enough.</li>
            <li> The brush heads come in 2 sizes, small and large, and one of each is included in the package, and I use the large ones and have still never had any issue with them fitting in the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I opted this time to just buy a whole new one.</li>
            <li> Oh, and thanks for recommending that I spend another 20 bucks on new brush heads to try to correct the issue.</li>
            <li> It brings in a whole new dimension to brushing your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has told me how much she likes her new Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I live alone and gently use this product without any form of abuse</li>
            <li> than as noted above; probably a useful device to keep teeth extra clean, and a neat toy.</li>
            <li> My previous Oral B lasted more than 8 years.</li>
            <li> I could have two of them with more attachments for less money at Costco, than I what I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The magnet keeping the door close is better than the latch of the previous model also.</li>
            <li> how much better it is than my previous</li>
            <li> I previously used the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush, and like many reviewers, I had a problem with buildup at the bottom of the brush head.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads for this latest model are also a lot cheaper than with their previous models.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a top of the line Sonicare toothbrush at $50 less than retail.</li>
            <li> Be sure to purchase extra brushes if you want same size for two people.</li>
            <li> As for differences between this and the elite, the main difference I&#x27;ve noticed is the difference in use options,</li>
            <li> You should buy Sonicare only if you are satisfied with it lasting 2 years.</li>
            <li> Not all Sonicare toothbrushes have a UV sanitizer, so this would be the main reason for me to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;DIFFERENCES with older HX6930 MODEL&lt;</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer comes with this Kit, and while I can not vouch for the scientific benefits of such a devices, the blue light comes on every night, and it at least makes me feel more comfortable</li>
            <li> This Sonicare FlexCare Plus is replacing an older model from 14 years ago.</li>
            <li> The main thing that scares me is removing and replacing the brush heads after each use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be lucky if the replacement handle will last me a year.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and all the different settings especially the timer</li>
            <li> Yes, you may get the same, or even more vibrations per second...</li>
            <li> so I quickly turned the timer back on.  </li>
            <li> this is the 3rd Phillips I have owned and all have been key to keepin my gums and teeth healthy.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy the more basic model - unless you simply have to have the UV disinfection.</li>
            <li> The current modes only run for a top time of 3 minutes which doubles for anybody with braces.</li>
            <li> I can already notice an improvement in my teeth compared to my older oral-b.</li>
            <li> So many people have had the same problem as me: their toothbrush dying after 2 years, just outside the warranty.</li>
            <li> Then I looked up the reviews, and saw many people talking about the same or similar problems.    </li>
            <li> I particularly like the sanitizing bay.</li>
            <li> May. So, my main issue is not with Amazon; they did their  job in getting me the Sonicare FlexCare Pus in two days.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an older sonicare model.  </li>
            <li> The main takeaway:</li>
            <li> I wish I had stayed with the older screw on brush model</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll get use to it (mainly because of how it vibrates</li>
            <li> The battery life of this toothbrush is a lot longer than the older toothbrush models, which is a plus if you are traveling or don&#x27;t want the hassle of always having to charge your toothbrush.     </li>
            <li> I do like the gum care setting as well as the \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; setting for a quick brush in between regular brushings.</li>
            <li> I had an Braun that was older than I want to admit.  </li>
            <li> Simple to use, more options than probably necessary, it is a toothbrush not a car.</li>
            <li> and I did a lot of research before purchasing this particular model.  </li>
            <li> For a couple of years before purchasing this toothbrush, I had an older generation Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush</li>
            <li> The Flexcare+, however, suffers from manufacturing defects that seems to give each toothbrush an effective shelf life of at most 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the same thing happen with so many manual toothbrushes that I don&#x27;t even look at the blue colored section of my ProResults brush and rely on a calendar.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a tooth brush could make such a difference, but thing thing is in a word AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I had been using an older model for three years and it was time to upgrade.</li>
            <li> It vibrates the brush head quickly and pressing gently against the teeth at the gumline makes for a slightly sensitive strange experience at first.  </li>
            <li> We really enjoyed it but after only two weeks it simply stopped.  </li>
            <li> love the different settings, especially the gum cleaning setting.  </li>
            <li> Once I had a sonicare toothbrush I cannot go back to a regular toohbrush also since my dentist has seen better results since using.  </li>
            <li> There is a newer Sonicare Toothbrush available (The DiamondClean) and it is possible they fixed the issue in that model.</li>
            <li> It appears that the main difference between the units is about $57.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cleans much better than a standard toothbrush, my mouth actually feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> Still holds a decent charge and the sterilizer still works.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace an older Sonicare toothbrush...</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare HX9672 to replace an older model Sonicare toothbrush that seemed to be a favorable home for mold where the brush head connected to the handle.  </li>
            <li> Never realized my older toothbrush wasso  inferior until using the Sonicare Flex Care Plus.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the older models it just doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am horrible when it comes to brushing my teeth for more than 20 seconds, this toothbrush vibrates through each phase of brushing, which is awesome and makes me brush longer.  </li>
            <li> The brush is noticeably gentler on my teeth and gums and my gums in particular look a lot healthier now.</li>
            <li> I replaced my older model with the flexcare because Costco was not always carrying the older brush heads.  </li>
            <li> It lost power after a year, but customer service is so good that after a few minutes of resetting the device, they simply replaced the defective brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What upsets me is that the newer models are of a lower quality compared to the older Philips models.</li>
            <li> main reason we purchased this unit was because of the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> (i was searching for it online and called amazon to no avail, but luckily found it in my browser history) for those buyers who purchased one before August 12th and September 2nd, 2012, with the rebate deadline being September 17th, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I went with this particular model because of the attached stand that held brushes.</li>
            <li> I always considered myself someone with pretty good oral hygiene - brushed (with a regular toothbrush) twice a day, floss every other day.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering how it cleans, it&#x27;s pretty much a vibrating toothbrush that you go back and forth at a angle towards your teeth (with some pressure applied for maximum clean) at a forward and back motion.</li>
            <li> The technology has come a long way since i purchased my original brush 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> it was nice to have the low power mode where it slowly ramps up to full power over time, to get you used to the feel of an ultra-sonic toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> The 30-second reminders are also a good addition, makes it much easier to time your brushing, although I&#x27;m not sure why they only work with the outside/inside of the teeth, and consider the \\&quot;bite edge\\&quot; of the molars as something to be done afterwards?  </li>
            <li> I previously used the cheap Crest Spin brush consistently.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is far more powerful than my preceding one and the narrow head lets me clean harder to get at areas.  </li>
            <li> I love that there is a sensitive stage for my teeth, and it&#x27;s no big deal for my husband or me to change it back to regular clean or vice-versa.</li>
            <li> If you have the older FlexCare model, I would wait until it is time to replace your old one before upgrading as the differences, while improvements, are not substantial.some, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect a large difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;SO, I go to my dentist, they give me a free Oral-B Professional Care 5000 toothbrush, I give away my Sonicare because I need the money, and here I am 3 months later, waiting for my new Sonicare to come in the mail</li>
            <li> But still, I was more surprised with this brush than any other I had before!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently, it also has a setting that for the first few uses, it slowly increases its pressure so you can get accustomed to it-- a feature which was ingeniously awesome for people like me, switching from a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> While I may not have LIKED brushing my teeth before, I would always be extremely thorough when I brushed.</li>
            <li> This is a VAST improvement over the old non-hygienic original model.</li>
            <li> Just recieved my sonicare toothbrush the other day, and so far I love it</li>
            <li> Purchased this product along with the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush for myself and my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li> sonicare flexcare plus on gum setting, with Colgate sensitive smart foam and listerine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge improvement over the soft cases of previous models, and should go a long way to keeping my brush safe when I travel (which I do a lot).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I use little pressure and can feel better results, thus eliminating the possibility of eroding my enamel.</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic activity of this tooth brush takes a little time to get accustomed to its vibrations, but it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning more thoroughly than its predecessor.  </li>
            <li> At Amazon the price varies, I once saw it for 125$, I paid a little more though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: my unit stopped working after little more than 1 year, while still under warranty.</li>
            <li> This unit was a little more</li>
            <li> This one was a little more finicky -</li>
            <li> Much better than those little ones you can purchase at Wal Mart, etc.  </li>
            <li> I chose this one because I thought it would work a little better than my Oral-B with the rotating head.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but your teeth will be glad you bought one.</li>
            <li> However, after just 1 year of use, the unit has completely stopped working!!</li>
            <li> You simply place the brush head into the cleaning unit, hit the clean button and it will automatically shutoff when complete.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, I started experiencing problems with charging the unit through the main charger, so I switched to the travel charger, which worked better.</li>
            <li> In addition to the regular clean, sensitive, and massage modes, there are now \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Refresh\\&quot;  modes.  </li>
            <li> Third, 5 functions: clean, sensitive, massage (gum care), go care (2 min),</li>
            <li> My teeth feel straight from the dentist clean minus the bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> As a son of a dentist I figured myself for a pretty good caretaker of my teeth but after having neglected my dental checkups for about 3 years, I finally went in and found out I needed some fairly serious work done.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, due to it&#x27;s ergonomic design, that thoroughly cleaning your teeth and mouth is effortless.</li>
            <li> NICE, HARD PLASTIC TRAVEL CASE which holds the handle and two brush heads --</li>
            <li> Since there are no exposed internal parts to rust from water damage, I expect this one to last much longer than my original Sonicare (which unfortunately only lasted a year &amp; actually cost more than the one I have now).</li>
            <li> I decided to pay a little extra thinking $12.50 a month for better oral health would be worth it.</li>
            <li> It really leaves your teeth feeling like something effective has been done, and with such little effort.</li>
            <li> They are really expensive, and I never, ever see any special deals on them, which would be nice.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what the other one did except for one important change on the &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; mode which replaced &#x27;Max Care (which is why I picked the new one over the old) &#x27;.  </li>
            <li> This particular mode, with the UV Disinfectant Station is new to us, but it appears to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is important since the sanitizer becomes a closed container, and excess water could cause mold/mildew.  </li>
            <li> Yep- I was skeptical, and not too happy about the price...</li>
            <li> We have used it for nearly one month, and really like it.</li>
            <li> We replaced an old Sonicare model, and this one is easier to use, easier to store, probably much easier to take traveling.  </li>
            <li> The advance features are not that effective to spend about 2 times more of price of a ordinary electric brush...for mine the 30 sec timer did not worked properly.</li>
            <li> So far, I think this is a very beneficial product.</li>
            <li> the tone that is used for reminding that the 30 seconds are up is quite soft and gentle...</li>
            <li> He travels frequently for work and the sanitizer and travel accessories are very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Amazing design, waterproof, great contact-free charging base, simple to use included UV head cleaner, etc.</li>
            <li> Naturally, he broke it, probably from too much pressure.</li>
            <li> The brush head is small, but I find this a good thing, because anything bigger would be a nuisance once it started buzzing in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It takes 24 hours to give this product a full charge, but once it&#x27;s charged, you won&#x27;t need to do it again for a long while.  </li>
            <li> When you first start using this, I would suggest that you be as gentle as possible with the speed (based on my experience).</li>
            <li> love the comfort of knowing that the germs on my toothbrush have been killed off.</li>
            <li> Last year, I had $20,000 worth of dental work done.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews of products I purchase (probably out of indifference)</li>
            <li> me, that made it worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more of a maintenance issue than I prefer, but hopefully it&#x27;ll pay off in the long run, especially in the dentist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> Although I give this product 5 stars because of its outstanding performance, but there are few things need improvement.      </li>
            <li> Even though we use pretty basic features, this product seems very well made</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush - you must get a version with a timer, don&#x27;t even have to think about if you&#x27;re brushing long enough.</li>
            <li> I would pretty much bleed every time I brushed my teeth--</li>
            <li> but unlike a normal tooth brush, you don&#x27;t have to move your arm around.</li>
            <li> I had practically no plaque on my teeth (and no cavities, but that was normal anyway).</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel noticeably cleaner and healthier than they did with normal brushing.</li>
            <li> I actually find it fun to brush my teeth using this.</li>
            <li> so I used that for a few more month.</li>
            <li> But it would be nice if the company saw this complaint--</li>
            <li> definitely overpriced, your teeth are worth every penny invested in their maintenance and care.</li>
            <li> It is well worth having, though I wouldn&#x27;t mind having the option of buying the unit without the sanitizer so as to make the unit smaller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CLEANING mode: 2 minutes of normal cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CARE mode: 2 minutes of normal cleaning plus 1 additional minute to concentrate on the gums (Quadpacer beeps every 15 seconds for the gum care minute).  </li>
            <li> They said all I need know is a normal cleaning.</li>
            <li> (keep in mind, my wife and I use it, twice daily each at a minimum), it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I somehow often accidentally change out of the normal mode.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush comes with a couple of different modes and settings such as gum brushing but to be honest I only use one of them for brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> For Sonicare, I liked how the brush head was more closely related to a traditional toothbrush, rather than a circular shape of Oral-B. Some of the reviews for Oral-B indicated a minor irritation when the toothbrush would stop in the middle of brushing, telling you to move to the next &amp;#34;section.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For this kind of money, I wish could get at least five years of service of it.  </li>
            <li> This item broke under normal use.</li>
            <li> Aside from the technical jargon and scientific proof i can say that this makes brushing fun.</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ve never been concerned about germ &#x27;buildup&#x27; on a normal toothbrush, so this feature is something I&#x27;ll use, but</li>
            <li> The DiamondClean seems like more money simply for a cool design but no more function over the FlexCare+.  </li>
            <li> The DiamondClean seems like more money simply for a cool design but no more function over the FlexCare+.  </li>
            <li> They normally cover the battery and will replace it for you.</li>
            <li> This item might seem pricey, but it has definitely been worth it.</li>
            <li> I chipped a substantial part of one of my front teeth biting my fork at breakfast and had to have an emergency resin filling, I used this on the normal setting that night without thinking and finished without even realizing</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action of this brush is superior (in my opinion) for cleaning over the reciprocal action of the Oral-B, and less likely to damage gums and cause</li>
            <li> The build quality is very nice, I like the different options for tooth brushing (although there seem to be a few options that aren&#x27;t really necessary).</li>
            <li> It stays charged for a very long time and  cleans my teeth better than I ever could with a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush head will come out slightly warm, but only slightly.  </li>
            <li> (so it occupies less bathroom counter space and is far more compact to pack into luggage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (so it occupies less bathroom counter space and is far more compact to pack into luggage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral-B 5000 also lacks any display that shows which mode you have selected, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal since you can easily tell by the different types of vibrations.     </li>
            <li> This has far more options than the previous model I owned.</li>
            <li> Long charge, very slim and especially easy for travel with its smaller secondary charger plug.</li>
            <li> The model I bought from my dentist almost a decade ago worked for seven years before the metal rod that vibrates the head finally vibrated the rubber seals right off.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I gave this four stars is because of the cost, and difficulty finding, the right replacement heads.</li>
            <li> At the very least, it&#x27;s a placebo that makes me feel like it&#x27;s becoming clean</li>
            <li> No way did I get the same clean feeling as I did with my old Oral B with floss action electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Something internally broke on top where you connect the brush, it is totally loose now.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that it was a really nice product when it worked, it failed early and the manufacturer does not seem to interested in supporting it.  </li>
            <li> It has many different modes such as a gum care mode which is the standard brushing with a one minute period of gentle gum care massage.</li>
            <li> It offers several different settings, and it is much easier to keep clean than older models.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older model of the Sonicare toothbrush for the past two years and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was not convinced the other reviews were really accurate when they said it felt like they had just been to the dentist.</li>
            <li> When my toothbrush broke randomly, I spent 5 minutes on the phone with Sonicare&#x27;s friendly and apologetic customer service.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works extremely well, but after nine months the shaft broke free of the motor.</li>
            <li> Good for me to have since I take frequent short business trips and rather avoid taking along the travel charger even if it&#x27;s quite small.    </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in buying the ultimate toothbrush at any price.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll get a new one.</li>
            <li> It was time to get a new brush head</li>
            <li> so I decided to go ahead and get a new brush while I was looking around.  </li>
            <li> and I like the new &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; routine.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s time to move to a new part of your mouth</li>
            <li> The new model fixes that.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you want an electric toothbrush that makes you feel like your teeth are brand new.</li>
            <li> &amp; I needed a new brush...</li>
            <li> After using the toothbrush for 4+ months I went to a new dentist</li>
            <li> So the question is, if you already have a Philips Sonicare Flexcare, do you need this new model?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using the new Flexcare design, I have also needed two new crowns...</li>
            <li> We have used this new brush for about a week now</li>
            <li> After my son saying get a new toothbrusher cleaner.  </li>
            <li> New Flexcares are the way to go in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the new Sonicare FlexCare</li>
            <li> because it was out of warranty, I would have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to get a new toothbrush, but after that experience, I&#x27;ll have to go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> you can call philips and they will send you a new one after you give them your product number on the bottom of the unit.</li>
            <li> when the new flexcare came in, i was ecstatic.  </li>
            <li> it was new.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare Flexcare+, along with a new Sonicare Airfloss for about two weeks now.</li>
            <li> The modes on the new FlexCare</li>
            <li> New one sent Feb. 15, and now it is March 2</li>
            <li> Amazon sent a new one next-day.  </li>
            <li> I eagerly waited for my new gadget.</li>
            <li> I figured maybe it&#x27;s time for something new in my routine.    </li>
            <li> prefer this new one.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to purchase a new Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li> So, they sent me a new charger.</li>
            <li> The new toothbrush still wouldn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> Then they decided to try another new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is made to break after the warranty so you can buy their new model.</li>
            <li> The new handle also die on Sep 2013.</li>
            <li> i called philips service and got a new</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s out of warranty, i have to think about to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> #34;USA is USA, UK is UK, buy a new brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> one completely new feature  </li>
            <li> I had a plan to buy a new ipod this summer</li>
            <li> Some reviews were by new comers to the electric toothbrush world and others who weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> When the battery stopped holding a charge on the Elite, I looked around for the new model and settled on the FlexCare+.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even want a new one, maybe a coupon or something.</li>
            <li> I bought the new one on July 13, 2012.</li>
            <li> Sourced the new multi-voltage Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I did some research online for one of the new electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Sonicare and because the brush was within the 2 year warranty they immediately shipped me out a new toothbrush that I received in a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will be getting the new unit in about a week.</li>
            <li> and she could give me 15% off of a new 150 dollar toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have both and this new one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to bother and just go looking for a new brand.</li>
            <li> I reicntly bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I checked the internet for ratings of another product and found a posting on how to repair this issue after I ordered a new replacement.</li>
            <li> (see the cons) and they sent me a new one, no questions asked that arrived within a week of me sending them my receipt.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, we received a new (or refurbished) \\&quot;sanitizing unit\\&quot; and recharger for our defective Sonicare Flexcare+  </li>
            <li> I have been using this new FlexCare</li>
            <li> Then, DON&#x27;T REMOVE THE BRUSH until you plan to replace it with a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Costco replaced the package with a new batch, I think there&#x27;s 5 to a package.</li>
            <li> but That just means these new heads will get twice the workout.</li>
            <li> I have two new heads that will not get used, at $18 for the pair.</li>
            <li> That is when I new</li>
            <li> bothered though that I still have two brand new brush heads for the e series.  </li>
            <li> I anticipate I will not need a new one for years to come.  </li>
            <li> Each new one costs about $10 each - and you buy them in packs of multiples, like 6 or 7.  </li>
            <li> I could live without the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Phillips and was told that we need a new bulb and they will send us one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (the warranty does not reset after they send you a new unit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She also hinted that the replacements where not brand new, but refurbished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It even helps rebuild receding gums, if you spend more time consistently on the troubled areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: they have these new sensitive tips which consist of soft bristles that work perfectly for vulnerable gums that bleed easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> In two minutes of use, it feels like your teeth and mouth are as clean as if you spent four minutes with a manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Basically bluer color than the old one which was more of a green color.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> When I had trouble with my older brush this summer, I easily reached a company rep on the phone</li>
            <li> well, it also adds an added benefit of helping the brush dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> Well, the SoniCare Flexcare Plus system was the most EXPENSIVE system available (around $170.00 dollars)....  </li>
            <li> Well, the SoniCare Flexcare Plus system was the most EXPENSIVE system available (around $170.00 dollars)....  </li>
            <li> One of the things I criticized on my older FlexCare brush was the soft travel case.  </li>
            <li> If you have the older FlexCare model, I would wait until it is time to replace your old one before upgrading as the differences, while improvements, are not substantial.</li>
            <li> but it sounds like it would be a good idea to disinfect at least weekly, if not several times a week.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare also has a nicer display on the handle which actually shows the setting you select and the battery indicator is more modern, compared to the old-fashioned calculator type black LCD on the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> For the price of this unit, we fully expected it to last more than 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised this tooth brush did a decent job on removing all the plaque or color or dye...</li>
            <li> You would think that these bulbs would be available at a local store such as Target or Walmart, but no.</li>
            <li> but many are too harsh for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The battery does not fully charge the toothbrush; it only charges to the second light after 24hrs</li>
            <li> I cannot use a regular one now because it simply does not work half as good.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it seems that I should let the brush head dry a little more because if I put it in right after brushing when I get home form work/school the head is damp.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer was a major selling feature because my wife and I can each store our separate brush heads in the sealed unit away from the circulating air (remember that this sits on the counter top in the same bathroom where the toilet flushes!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl who grew up using technology from a very young age.</li>
            <li> This model is MUCH easier to keep clean and also has a much smaller diameter handle (probably half the size of the first Sonicare I had).  </li>
            <li> i have very sensitive teeth and gums and it took some getting used to</li>
            <li> Only the first charging bar would blink, normally the first two are lit up while the third one flashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised they have not remedied this defect yet.  </li>
            <li> and it is hard to get them real clean with a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I figured I would upgrade to a new brush that my significant other and I could share.     </li>
            <li> Brush heads seem to last a long time and are easy to swap out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moved from sensitive to normal seeting within a week.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical about what to expect from a teeth cleaning system promising such great things, and the price also caused me some hesitation.  </li>
            <li> Further, I could not detect any difference in intensity during my first 14 brushings, but this may be the point of the feature.       </li>
            <li> I ordered more of the regular size heads, as it only comes with one regular and one travel head, and both my husband and I share it!</li>
            <li> I like proResults small brushes more as their are easier to operate with.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare on the other hand, gets your teeth whiter &amp; cleaner, significantly reduces tarter and improves the health of your gums.  </li>
            <li> I was only aware of it when i changed the brush (every 3 months, as recommended by my dentist), but i didn&#x27;t like the idea.</li>
            <li> : 29 November 2011 - It has now been well over a year since i first posted the above review about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> charge lasts for an inordinately long time--for me, about a week&#x27;s worth of morning-only brushings without recharging.</li>
            <li> SoniCare Flexcare Plus system is smaller than the first SoniCare I purchase years ago.  </li>
            <li> It was under warranty the first two times only.   </li>
            <li> I started with the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; level for the first two weeks and then switched to regular cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The instructions recommend charging 24 hours prior to the first use, but I doubt this is necessary given that the brush will only be used minutes a day and likely be able to charge 23 hours minimum every day that you use</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this toothbrush, you and your dentist will be much happier!</li>
            <li> pretty basic.  </li>
            <li> Solid product, but not substantially better than other models or makes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Sonicare products over the years and this is the first one that died (after 9 months).  </li>
            <li> and i am so amazed to see that in first use it removes the yellow ting from my teeth ,</li>
            <li> i will write more in few weeks after my teeth will show some change!</li>
            <li> The many other reviews that say the same thing were what finallyconvinced me to take the leap, and so now let me add this review to theirs to help convince</li>
            <li> I originally turned off the setting that allowed thebrush to beep every 30 seconds, indicating you should move onto another quarter of your mouth, I actually turned it back on, because I found if it wasn&#x27;t on</li>
            <li> /&gt;After hearing about his ordeal, and seeing his difficulty in eating with dentures, I know I want to keep my teeth as healthy as possible, to possibly avert having to go through the same thing.  </li>
            <li> I know some people might want to set it for the one they like and have it always use that option, but me personally, I like to use different modes at different times, so it would annoy me more if it was set to one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told the Oral-B is not much better in quality, so I&#x27;m stuck with Sonicare until I can find a better product.  </li>
            <li> there are others, and fixed it!</li>
            <li> Wow, once you get used to this thing it keeps your teeth polished-clean!  ...</li>
            <li> I actually still have my original Sonicare and that toothbrush dates back to 1999</li>
            <li> So you have to be prepared for a pretty big investment in brush heads after purchasing this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unsurprisingly, they weren&#x27;t interested in replacing the device outside of warrantee.</li>
            <li> When I brushed my teeth for the first time with this</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> After having a lower level Sonicare Electric toohbrush for several years and pleased with its performance, I purchased a much more expensive FlexCare model as it was recommended for people with gum issues.</li>
            <li> I brushed 2X a day and felt I was being pretty thorough.  </li>
            <li> The first one broke after about a year, similar to another person&#x27;s review.  </li>
            <li> I had used an earlier version of the Sonicare years ago, and was pleased with it, but stopped using it due to sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> First, the head began wobbling shortly after purchase (from my dentist).</li>
            <li> First I got 2 cavities in my back molars</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Last week I was woken up in the middle of the night by a loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the brush is actually more powerful than previous ones, or if the battery on my old one had slowly faded, but I thought the FlexCare Plus was more powerful off the bat.  </li>
            <li> It has 5 different settings which is particularly nice if you&#x27;ve just had a cleaning or feel a little sensitive (sensitive setting).</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is a nice feature since we can clean our brush heads thoroughly if we get a cold virus</li>
            <li> You only thought you had brushed your teeth clean until you use a Phillips Sonicare</li>
            <li> However, I had the older model first and noticed that the newer one doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long.</li>
            <li> However, I had the older model first and noticed that the newer one doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews say our teeth feel really clean after this.</li>
            <li> We have had other electric tooth brushes and nothing compares to the clean feeling this one gives you.</li>
            <li> If you have the money then buy this because its really like no other as far as taking care of your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 10/2011 - After using my brush multiple times daily for more than 1.75 years, the head of the brush handle was starting to make loud noises and had become \\&quot;loosened\\&quot; from the pressure of brushing</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 10/2011 - After using my brush multiple times daily for more than 1.75 years, the head of the brush handle was starting to make loud noises and had become \\&quot;loosened\\&quot; from the pressure of brushing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a dentist&#x27;s clean feeling every day, but your teeth and mouth definitely feel far cleaner and more refreshed after a Sonicare brushing than using any regular brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though the toothbrush gently increases intensity through the first 10 or so times you use it, my gums bled slightly the first few times I used it - my hygenist said that was actually a good sign at first as long as it didn&#x27;t continue (it didn&#x27;t) - it means pockets in your gums that were previously undisturbed are being cleaned.</li>
            <li> When I did connect, the company said it was a clearly covered case, and would send a new unit.  </li>
            <li> The Powerfloss has already been replaced, and the new unit works, but makes loud crunching sounds.  </li>
            <li> They fixed that in this new one.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old toothbrush and new</li>
            <li> We were somewhat surprised to find this new FlexCare</li>
            <li> but ANYWAY - I called and within 5 minutes, Mike was sending me a new handle via fed ex with pre-paid labels to send the old one.  </li>
            <li> New head design considerable improvement.  </li>
            <li> liked this model, however I found that I didn&#x27;t really use the extra modes all that much, and seeing as I have all the accessories still from this set (hard case, sanitizer, multiple chargers)</li>
            <li> On both the old and new FlexCare model, I actually rarely ever use the UV Sanitizer as I find that just thoroughly rinsinig the brush head after each use and letting the brush head thoroughly dry before I use it again is sufficient.  </li>
            <li> Incredibly refreshing, and you just don&#x27;t realize how many unpleasant things are on your teeth until you use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used the UV sanitizer several times, but, as a microbiologist, I&#x27;m not sure it is doing anything amazing.  </li>
            <li> It starts off real gentle the first few days and increases in intensity..  </li>
            <li> Amazon.com is always easy to order from, and I received the product in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> The brush handle itself also lights up showing the different settings such as Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive and Massage.  </li>
            <li> The other Sensitive and Massage modes, however, demonstrated their unique value.  </li>
            <li> good base products but the bells and whistles bring no value; the &#x27;clean&#x27; function works very well, but the UV chamber, &#x27;massage&#x27; option,</li>
            <li> There is also a quick 30 sec mode and 1 minute mode.</li>
            <li> I like the 30 second timer, so I can get full and equal coverage.  </li>
            <li> Charge it the second you get it for 24 hours for a full charge (last three weeks, maybe longer)  </li>
            <li> Works well on its own, but I received my set with foreign wall plugs, and one foreign to US travel plug (or whatever it is called).</li>
            <li> On the few trips we have had to take away from home, it holds a charge for a nice long time.  </li>
            <li> It will feel offensive at first, especially if you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I mention this because the sonic vibration created by the new style so much less than the sonic vibration produced by my original SoniCare.  </li>
            <li> I was using an Oral B one, but it was only okay when it came down to it.</li>
            <li> My dental health is too important to mess around with any longer</li>
            <li> I went looking for a new brush for two reasons: one, the Oral-B brush heads always accumulated a gross slime inside of them, that really grossed me out.</li>
            <li> The second reason I went looking for a new toothbrush, is that I really wanted a UV sanitizer for the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> This latest model isn&#x27;t too much different than last year&#x27;s though there are a few minor upgrades and all of the Sonicare brand toothbrushes are fine dental hygiene products  </li>
            <li> This is a definite upgrade from previous models; lighter, longer battery life, and more controlled cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I like the many different modes on this toothbrush, and the toothbrush itself is lighter and sleeker than the previous models.</li>
            <li> Less brushing, more timing, hitting specific dental \\&quot;regions\\&quot; and the built in timer reminds you when it&#x27;s time to switch.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t know for sure how this toothbrush is working until my next dental appointment, but after a month my teeth are feeling cleaner and look slightly whiter.</li>
            <li> hard case is easily the only useful improvement (for me).</li>
            <li> It worked great until I had to change a brush head which is the only way that could have broke, despite the fact that I only applied the level of force necessary to remove it and no more.</li>
            <li> What I really appreciate is that they are sending me new unit before I send back the old one (they will include a label).</li>
            <li> But the strange thing is, the other 3 units I gifted are still working without any problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken it on a few weekend trips without my charger and battery has held fine.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have had better check ups at the dentist over the past few years because of the Sonicare toothbrush and while my dentist will agree that you don&#x27;t need the fancy UV light to have healthier gums, this is a definite upgrade that was well worth the investment on my part.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because after a certain time, the battery seems to die...</li>
            <li> Back in the \\&quot;old days\\&quot; when I was still using manual (non-electric) toothbrushes, I have always alternated between two manual toothbrushes, thoroughly rinsing each brush after use and letting each totally dry in between use, and I never had any issues with hygiene from contaminated brush bristles (heck, doorknobs, public drinking fountains, kitchen sink sponges, and shaking peoples&#x27; hands can carry more</li>
            <li> This UV light sanitizes the brush in as little as 10 minutes</li>
            <li> While the toothbrush vibrates it&#x27;s just a little sound it makes that tells you 30 seconds have passed and</li>
            <li> It comes with a sanitizer with a UV light bulb that you can sanitize the brush heads inside this little door.  </li>
            <li> The unit is light and the brush is like a little cleaning vibrating beast.  </li>
            <li> bit pricey, but if you are the lazy person that does not like to brush their teeth this will make you change your mind, once you learn what clean really</li>
            <li> I figured I can make do with a traditional toothbrush just fine, and not spend a lot of money on something that would provide minimal benefit.</li>
            <li> I feel as though a battery powered option would have been nice seeing as electrical outlets are typically not very abundant in bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I like having a little extra time at the end if I feel like some of my teeth need a bit more attention.</li>
            <li> the individual brush heads come with caps as well, which could help you feel a little better about cleanliness if the unit stays out on the counter as opposed to in a drawer or medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I love all the little features like the different modes to use</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a little silly, but now I am confident in knowing my toothbrush is clean!</li>
            <li> I called Phillips after the one they sent me to replace my original one lasted less then a year.  </li>
            <li> so I love the travel charger and hard case.</li>
            <li> I am hard on it and have to replace brushes much more often that my husband.</li>
            <li> For those suffering from brushing too hard, this toothbrush is sincerely a must-have.</li>
            <li> Since using this, I hardly notice any food coming out when I floss because it removes most of it for you already.</li>
            <li> Construction is of very high quality and cleaning is simple.</li>
            <li> Because I like the brush so much I was prepared to buy a new one, but first I called customer service to check if there was something I could do to fix it, and they offered to send me a new handle free, and a pre-paid shipping label to send back the broken one.  </li>
            <li> Also, the heads have a little plastic circle on it that comes in a few different colors, which is great for couples who share the toothbrush-</li>
            <li> They can be found at CVS and various other retail stores and online.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived as stated and very quickly.</li>
            <li> Even though I liked the product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another, and I would likely think hard before I bought another product by this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, it did kind of tickle, but it takes very little time to adjust to using this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy a brand new Oral B ever 3 months, have a nice clean handle, rather than buy a head for Sonicare only to put it on top of my nasty ole Sonicare handle.  </li>
            <li> Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I purchased it because it&#x27;s great for cold and flu</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different motion and very pressure sensitive too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The old Sonicare toothbrushes used to last much longer.</li>
            <li> one has a Gum Care mode, which previously with the electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had is Max Care, which is 2 minutes of Clean, and 1 minute of Massage, so the options are changed alittle by name.  </li>
            <li> Great to know if I want to go on a vacation and not want ot take a charger (although it does come with a small travel case and small portable charger)</li>
            <li> In fact, I can see a clear difference in the tarter buildup (or lack of) while using this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> still use this, my teeth are clean and you *can* feel a difference if all you&#x27;re used previously is a manual brush.</li>
            <li> The included instructions are clear.</li>
            <li> So this is clearly a product quality issue with the handle.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, when I use it on the roof of my mouth, it helps clear my sinuses during allergy season.</li>
            <li> If you consider how much whitening products and cavity fillings cost, you can save yourself a lot of money by purchasing equipment (such as this electric toothbrush).</li>
            <li> Perhaps the settings change too easily as i frequently find the setting changed after my wife uses it.</li>
            <li> Fact that it has a method for completely sterilizing brushes made me take the jump to buy.</li>
            <li> vs. 20 2-minute brushings of the old one&lt;</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not going to go into it that far with this review.  </li>
            <li> 02/2014 - I have had the replacement brush for nearly 2.5 years now with no problems whatsoever.t some of this</li>

            <li> toothbrush can harbor a variety of germs capable of causing illness and even reinfection with the same disease (see dentalresource dot org slash topics25 dot htm).  </li>
            <li> Now you may not use all of them, but Philips offers them to us for the folks that will.  </li>
            <li> I will Only write reviews on items that really make a difference.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> I had Oral B Professional for 5-6 years</li>
            <li> Same goes for brushes - their functionality degrades much faster than advertisted.</li>
            <li> I am also using the UV sanitizer frequently.</li>
            <li> As far as my wife and I can tell, it looks like it reduces stains somewhat.</li>
            <li> Why would you make an electric toothbrush that isn&#x27;t completely waterproof???</li>
            <li> and you should be brushing softly.</li>
            <li> If you have arthritis, etc., this is probably the only reasonable alternative.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself to help with a sensitive tooth/gum issue that I had.  </li>
            <li> I brush my teeth frequently</li>
            <li> Sensitive</li>
            <li> (The adjustment for sensitive teeth)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Three weeks ago my Dental Hygienist told me that I have gingivitis and the early stages of periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> Beats manual brushing by far.</li>
            <li> 3) Sensitive, massaging, etc.      </li>
            <li> not because the crowns were old or failing, but because bacteria had entered underneath and into the nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I see no problems with it as far as cleaning it or it opening during travel.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you have sensitive teeth or just want to massage your gums, there&#x27;s a setting for those.  </li>
            <li> After brushing with the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush, I feel like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> No issues so far</li>
            <li> have a different brand of electric toothbrush that is much cheaper</li>
            <li> 9 months, it stopped working, at first it gave a strange noise...</li>
            <li> &quot; setting that gives you some extra time with gentle brushing to work on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sonicare stops suddenly making you wonder if the brush is really over</li>
            <li> and I have to do it rather frequently to keep it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I cannot say much about the system reliability, obviously.</li>
            <li> Most commonly we use the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; cycle.  </li>
            <li> was so old it cracked.    </li>
            <li> Also to note is battery was not dead at this date, it was on</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my old Sonicare that the battery was dying on.  </li>
            <li> + every time you do to get it fixed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect that it will last much longer.  </li>
            <li> a day)&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that compared with the Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and the tooth brush I was using ULTREO went out of biz.  </li>
            <li> The old versions used magnets to vibrate the head.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll really see at the next visit to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I figured Amazon would ask me to send the whole unit back</li>
            <li> so I contacted Philips directly.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]].     </li>
            <li> like I just had them professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of days now and what a difference between my old Oral-B and this one.</li>
            <li> I get that professional cleaning feel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product so far.</li>
            <li> I now have to go directly to the manufacturer, box the damn thing up, and wait weeks for a replacement unit (assuming they honor the warranty).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the most reliable flosser, to say the least.</li>
            <li> negative thing I can say about is that, when you put in the toothpaste, MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing the job of my now defunct, 10 year old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush about a month ago to replace a 6 year old rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use the UV sanitizing feature but really have no way of telling if it is of any benefit and will probably discontinue it&#x27;s use.   </li>
            <li> If you want an additional adult brush for the spouse, you have to buy it separately.  </li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality and performance.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this and as far as the $ goes if it saves me time in \\&quot;THE</li>
            <li> I purchased this to update my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I put it in my old charger and it wouldn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> After using the this Sonicare for awhile, I went on vacation and grabbed my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li> really like the different brushing mode options. &#x27;</li>
            <li> I had an old sonicare</li>
            <li> After going with the $20 cheap-o \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrushes, I finally upgraded to the real thing.  </li>
            <li> The cost to make a replacement is most likely less than $.25 in material and $1-1.50 total cost and the cheapest I have found my particular replacement is $9.00 if i purchase three at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking forward to going back to the dentist in November and hearing what the hygienest has to say about the state of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I also like the quad pacer feature-my old one had this and the battery operated</li>
            <li> The basic unit works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li> I really like it, and 14 months later, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I had an old Sonicare Elite that died, and I decided to go up a couple models for this one.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare sending a replacement handle and a return label for the old handle.</li>
            <li> I bought a smaller charger without the brush cleaning thing, it&#x27;s much simpler and easier.</li>
            <li> Something like this should have a far longer warranty.  </li>
            <li> But now... this brush blows the old one away.</li>
            <li> The uv sanitizer is also neat, obviously didn&#x27;t take that much care in sanitizing my toothbrush head before but now that i have something to do that...</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Sonic care toothbrush (it lasted 6 years)</li>
            <li> I attribute it to the controls being at a natural holding place.</li>
            <li> i use the sensitive heads with it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommend this toothbrush after my old one which was an Oral B went</li>
            <li> young kids</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t understand the concept of the Quadpacer technology (at least my kids didn&#x27;t); and rather than using the appropriate mode, they just play with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as cleaning your teeth, you just can&#x27;t beat a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> There is a \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; setting on the brush for people with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> Brushing is like getting a professional cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Flexcare handle is much longer than the Elite handle, which results in a larger case.</li>
            <li> I never had a cavity my whole life until the last two trips to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this junk just to be told that there is nothing they can do after it breaks 3 months into usage.</li>
            <li> I never liked electric toothbrushes, but I sure do like the ultrasonic one.  </li>
            <li> Every time I brush, I feel like I just had a professional cleaning...no joke.</li>
            <li> These things are gret they really hold pu even over several years.  </li>
            <li> When done just pull the brush from the handle,rinse it off, and pop it into the hygenic cleaner and your ready for the next cleaning.</li>
            <li> Rechargable Sonic Toothbrush - DENTAL PROFESSIONAL MODEL HX 6992/03]]</li>
            <li> (mine had a UV sanitizer as well), and the Oral-B Triumph [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> The version here in town doesn&#x27;t have the sensitive gum feature.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> In that case we just revert to the old brushes we have.  </li>
            <li> No bleeding to sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> This replaced our old Sonicare and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> doing its job so far.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s now nearly a year post purchase and the tooth brush</li>
            <li> but somehow I could never avoid needing something fixed until I got this brush.</li>
            <li> We are stuck with junk and cannot get it fixed.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel FAR</li>
            <li> He is going to be surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought some generic ones cheaper, but plan to pick up some of the name brand to really see if there is a difference.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> have used my unit for a couple of years and from the very beginning, my checkups have shown definite improvements.  </li>
            <li> We read some reviews and forums regarding this problem and tried almost everything; letting it completely drain, not use it for a wile, keep it unplugged, etc., but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li> I have used the travel case frequently.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use Sensitive mode yet, as I just haven&#x27;t needed it.  </li>
            <li> and perhaps it was because it was 4 years old</li>
            <li> It is of course completely out of warranty.</li>
            <li> (my old one stopped holding a charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The 4 stars is for my old Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> Maybe all the different cleaning cycles isn&#x27;t really needed.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I never have an tartar on my teeth when they are professionally cleaned</li>
            <li> Although my toothbrush was a week out of warranty customer service sent me a replacement toothbrush handle and sent a postage paid label to return my old one.  </li>
            <li> The product is NOT made in the USA as advertised; the box reads \\&quot;Developed in U.S.A./Made by Phillips in China.  </li>
            <li> It makes me wonder how regular tooth brushes are even legal.</li>
            <li> Those inconveniences would cause me to give the product a 4-star rating, but the fact that my instrument simply died after 14 months of ownership really bothers me.  </li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush, and I really like the disinfecting feature of this model.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d think they should be bright blue, red, yellow, green, orange.</li>
            <li> The oscillating action leaves your mouth feeling as though you have just had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> (he uses a different brush head) and he does not have the gum issues that I have, but he really likes this toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li> Recommend using sensitive head to prevent overbrussing.</li>
            <li> I know this product is expensive, and I know there may be more bells and whistles than you&#x27;re looking for on a toothbrush, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> It comes with two heads of different sizes, for different jaw sizes, which is useful if there are two that would use the brush.</li>
            <li> You then have to press the green button OFF, press the silver button however many times to get back to the one you want</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a brush worth of $135 to work for only so short of time; so I&#x27;ve stocked up my brush heads.</li>
            <li> For this price and short lifetime, it only worth 1 star.</li>
            <li> My teeth as sparkling white and started looking better after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Have used various electric teeth cleaning systems for over a decade with mixed success.  </li>
            <li> Different head size brushes are a useful personal option    </li>
            <li> writing your review, please consider the following guidelines:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focus on the product and your individual experience using it&lt;br /&gt;Provide details about why you liked or disliked a product</li>
            <li> Actually, I used the 30 second smile tooth brush system before using this one......</li>
            <li> When traveling, it stays charged for at least 1 week, but has a nice carry case and smaller charger that fits in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> The Philips models are good, but if something is wrong the customer service response is variable depending on who picks up the telephone.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use it, we each have our own head (he uses the grey band, I always get dark blue).  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unfortunate, but with that being said, I think whether or not this is a good product depends solely on that.</li>
            <li> The cheaper model makes awfully loud sound and it can&#x27;t clean -- turns out that the motor is very weak, they used cheap plastic instead of rubber around the shaft, which made the little vibration sounds horribly loud.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any data on the effectiveness of the ultraviolet light on germs on the brushes, especially at the base of the bristles where they would likely to grow, but I am pretty sure that any intensity strong enough to kill germs aren&#x27;t doing anything to help to the longevity of the nylon brushes.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, Phillips wants us to buy new ones every three months, but I suspect that could be stretched to six months.</li>
            <li> Much like other products in the same family, the Sonicare \\&quot;brushing style\\&quot; can be unusual at first, but after a day or two you&#x27;ll barely notice a thing.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is working fantastic, and there have definitely been positive changes - no more cavities, and the gum damage that was going on has been completely resolved.</li>
            <li> As emphasized by one reviewer, the hard plastic end piece to which the actual toothbrush is attached vibrates furiously and has the potential to be genuinely hazardous when it contacts teeth at certain angles (i.e.: if the brush end is not carefully positioned while the toothbrush is in one&#x27;s mouth).  </li>
            <li> This will improve you&#x27;re oral health no matter how good or bad it is right now.</li>
            <li> The next time it broke, I just missed the stand and it fell onto the shelf right next to the charger.</li>
            <li> I foolishly bought another right away, and it last only 5 months.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare and they FINALLY got the head design right.  </li>
            <li> Second, sanitizer has space to store 2 brush heads, and while sanitezer does its job, there is a space right next to it to charge toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It definitely improves overall dental hygiene more than any other product.</li>
            <li> that the toothbrush can last up to 2 weeks on a single, full charge.  </li>
            <li> I like that it comes with a travel kit (hardcase and small adapter) which makes traveling with this tooth brush easy.</li>
            <li> I expect these other good habits to taper off as time goes on, but at least I&#x27;ll still have my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> clean and ready for the next round.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> but the charging cables are a little too thick and wild, but I can live with that, so all is good.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean that I now use the refresh mode after every meal as I can&#x27;t stand the sensation of having little particles in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are so clean it feels almost like I just walked out of the dentist after I finish brushing (except a little slimier).</li>
            <li> The price was $10 less than the Amazon easy open package.  </li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised that it works so well particularly in comparison to what I have been using for several years.</li>
            <li> The UV light didn&#x27;t last that long though, only about 4 months.</li>
            <li> No mess.     </li>
            <li> Oral B and other brands are not as powerful.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that the other toothbrush wasn&#x27;t as powerful as the Sonicare model the hygienist showed me.</li>
            <li> Still better than the old design which had a giant well under the brush head and two small holes leading into that well so that the well collected all sorts of grossness in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> different modes are nice, but I usually just stay on the same setting.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> After about 8 months of use the internal timers for the regular brush cycle were starting to get shorter and shorter, sometimes they would be longer than normal, sometimes they would be about the right time length.  </li>
            <li> Of course if you think about the extra 1 minute gum cycle adding an extra 1/3 time to the brush cycle, it kind of makes sense that the brush would wear out an extra 1/3 faster, i.e. 2 months instead of the typical 3.    </li>
            <li> There are of course other specialized cleaning including with the brush such as gum care, message, and sensitive clean.  </li>
            <li> Now in the last 4 years I have had to buy a new flexcare toothbrush 3 times!  </li>
            <li> When I then asked what I should do if the new bulb does not work either at first they said that the warranty did not cover \\&quot;parts and accessories\\&quot;, but when I pushed the issue a little the rep then told me that if the bulb does not work to contact them again and they would send a new sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to go to the dentist and see what he thinks of my clean teeth!</li>
            <li> It was bought to replace an older Sonic that finally quit.</li>
            <li> And the reason for this is that while handling the brush prior to brushing you don&#x27;t realize your are indirectly pressing that silver button once or twice or more, so when you finally come to press the ON button it&#x27;s been set to a different mode than when you last brushed.</li>
            <li> Personally i did not notice or feel any difference in dental care between the older elite and newer flexcare+ models.</li>
            <li> I say, go for the older ones since they last longer and perform just as well!</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to brushing my teeth first thing in the morning and last thing at night.</li>
            <li> The charge on the battery last for almost two months as this is well built as compare to the older models.</li>
            <li> actually brushed my teeth with my old toothbrush as I normally would</li>
            <li> At my second visit they both suggested I should look into getting a Sonicare, any model but in particular one that had the gum care settings.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this particular model and I can&#x27;t thank her enough.</li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare for 12 years-it finally died.</li>
            <li> Today, the second one broke as well, same problem as the first one: doesn&#x27;t vibrate thus now</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this from an Essence after it finally stopped holding a decent charge.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare Toothbrushes for years and this one is pretty similar to the last one that I had with the exception of the extra gum care setting and the fact that the indicators are not visible unless you are using it which gives a sleeker look as compared to the older versions.  </li>
            <li> Slimmer design  - 2nd charger (w/o UV sanitizer) is small and convenient  - Cleans better than the Elite.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an older model of the same brand.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting to get 5 years out of it, otherwise it&#x27;s pretty expensive to be replacing more often.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush will give you a decent check mark when you see your dentist next time.</li>
            <li> Either the design of the newer handles is faulty, or the product is no longer made with the same care as the older models were.</li>
            <li> Sonicare, when your newer units work as well as your older units, I may be back.</li>
            <li> decided on this particular model because it has the extra Gum Care mode that the lower models do not.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hygienist says that my home dental care is excellent and e cleanings are much quicker and less painful.</li>
            <li> Not only does the new handle design eliminate that truly icky build-up under the replaceable brushes (gross!), but the brush sanitizing light (gimmick or not) at least makes you feel like you&#x27;re being a little more safe, germ-wise.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t dock any stars for my own clumsiness, but this is a piece of equipment that is used multiple times daily, and is subject to wet and slippery conditions.</li>
            <li> Older models were notoriously hard to clean and would collect water and get mildew.  </li>
            <li> We use the diamond clean heads on the advice of other reviewers and i would recommend the same.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this terrific product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them, you simply may not need all the bells and whistles</li>
            <li> I have no idea how well this actually works to sanitize a brush and whether it really is necessary to protect yourself from putting germs back into your mouth that you may have put onto your own brush a few hours before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Forced to revert back to the rotating head style item which produced much poorer results and required more extensive flossing and a combination of nonelectric hand brushing.    </li>
            <li> had a defective UV light unfortunately, but a quick call to Philips, and a replacement is on the way.  </li>
            <li> I can actually clean my back teeth without activating my gag reflex, because the head is smaller (than my old regular brush) and I don&#x27;t have to saw back and forth, as the electric brush does the scrubbing for me.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, it brushes so fast that you don&#x27;t need to be spending long time brushing the teeth at all!&lt;br /&gt;Second, it reaches between the teeth, something my circular (rotating brush) toothbrush had difficulty</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer these modes to the previous model&#x27;s Clean, Sensitive, Massage, Go Care, and Max Care.  </li>
            <li> So I gave Philips another chance because as long as it was working, I really like how well it cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably because I was apparently brutalizing my teeth and gums with my old manual.    </li>
            <li> but I only use the normal cleaning setting.  </li>
            <li> The smaller normal stand is also included, which is what I now use.</li>
            <li> The first sonicare I purchased, I used a couple of years but there were rough edges around the toothbrush(bad design).</li>
            <li> , I use only a normal one for two minutes.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to touch the ring where the device attaches to the head while you brush or you will get burned, it gets hot.</li>
            <li> The higher vibration takes some adjustment but it will tickle you pink, at the results.</li>
            <li> The malfunctions started out as the unit turning off prior to the full 2 minute brush cycle, and beeping at intervals other than 30s.  </li>
            <li> I have traditionally been a firm brusher, putting a bit more pressure on the brush than necessary, but I don&#x27;t find myself being that way with this brush.  </li>
            <li> We normally put it back after every use</li>
            <li> What was once worth $100 plus dollars to me is now not worth replacing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can go back to the normal toothbrush now</li>
            <li> Will have to see how things go over time, as I have a lot of trouble with plaque build-up and staining as I&#x27;m a &#x27;full pot&#x27; coffee sipper.</li>
            <li> But then, a few weeks ago, I accidentally dropped it in a sink full of water and it immediately shorted out.  </li>
            <li> The total operating costs ( replacement brush heads seem pretty pricey, also )of these products and what would appear to be deteriorating quality are hard to stomach, even if they do keep my teeth super shiny.</li>
            <li> The vibration takes a little getting used to, but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> You can easily brush for half as long, or 50% longer . . .</li>
            <li> The bristles seem fine and still firm enough to continue but I feel its a bit misleading.  </li>
            <li> I first found this annoying because it&#x27;s not that easy to fit the cord into the grooves in the bottom of the charger.  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s out of warranty there is no possibility of repair and all they give you is a coupon worth 15% off of their online store (which sells products at approximately 15% higher price than Amazon!).  </li>
            <li> This model cleans more signifcantly than any other model that I have previously used.</li>
            <li> Also seems to keep gums less irritated, I noticed a significant increase in irritation when going back to the manual toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would be nice if they would make the selection button a little more difficult to depress</li>
            <li> What got me excited about this toothbrush was the UV light which plugs right in like normal and next to it, you can charge the toothbrush base.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a new toothbrush when my current one (Oral B) is still working.  </li>
            <li> Contacted Philips online help and received a new one for replacement, except they shipped a standard size brush head instead of a compact one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using my new tooth brush for only 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> When Iam on my last brush head, I order or buy new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And they could only offer discount on new item.</li>
            <li> Between all these sonicare toothbrushes and replacement heads (I even bought my mom a new model this last Christmas)</li>
            <li> noticed a brand new Oral B only costs $35</li>
            <li> 3) Battery for the Flexcare+ seems to last about a week longer (3.5 weeks) than my Elite when it was new.</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy a new one or something similar.</li>
            <li> Hoping this new one not only helps keep teeth cleaner, but helps us stay healthier by keeping the brush heads cleaner.</li>
            <li> I missed using the toothbrush for the short time it took to receive the new one.</li>
            <li> new extra one.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to get a new electric toothbrush and did some research and Sonicare seemed to be the way to go.</li>
            <li> However the Sonicare HX6970 has lasted for 20 months (having just recently died).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Philips to process a warranty replacement, and they are sending me a new unit under the two year warranty.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;minuses\\&quot; to the new model are that the sterilizer no longer indicates if the brushes have been sterilized at the end of the cycle (previously there was a steady green light):  </li>
            <li> But by doing this sometimes you have to scroll through the modes (pressing it several times) to get to the mode you previously had it on -- in my case, the &#x27;Clean&#x27; mode.</li>
            <li> &quot; that really seem like a waste of money - - they just make the brush run for more or less amount of time, rather than the standard 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, keep in mind that you still have to floss (at least twice a day). :-)</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush, but my complaint about the mold build-up in the earlier model persists to this model.</li>
            <li> Although they tend to be the most expensive brushes, they have longevity which stands out, much like the Kitchenaid of stand mixers.  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve just manually brushed my teeth and my dental hygenist said I really needed to get back to electric.  </li>
            <li> Much simpler than brushing back and forth at different angles.      </li>
            <li> I am a bit more careful when pulling it off, as you do have to tug it firmly, and it seems to be doing quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually called up Sonicare to find out what some of the differences were between the different models and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li> I finally confessed I had gotten a different brush but was trying to make it work because of how much I paid for it.</li>
            <li> sonic brush has 5 modes which accommodate different durations and vibration speeds, so if you are worried whether or not this will offend your sensitive teeth try the sensitive setting and work your way up.</li>
            <li> It is used at least once a day and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> It was a good brush while it worked, but entirely too expensive.</li>
            <li> The small head makes it so easy to clean hard to reach places</li>
            <li> New design of brush head stays clean and no more gunk build up!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The downside, of course, is the Sonicare price tag (and ongoing replacement brush head costs), but, in the end, I feel it&#x27;s worth it and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever go back to using just a regular toothbrush again after so long with a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> There is no other toothbrush that gives you the results of the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I have been using oral-b toothbrushes for over 10 years, and finally decided to give sonicare a try and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> But this is nothing major, I can</li>
            <li> I had gotten a bit lazy with brushing and flossing, and I started to notice some significant gum problems.</li>
            <li> I am a person that buys from Amazon without checking other sources because I feel that Amazon&#x27;s price is generally pretty competitive.</li>
            <li> This product is defective and should not be bought without a major redesign.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised as I have had sonicare toothbrushes for as long as I can remember with years and years of trouble free operation.</li>
            <li> The major selling point for me was the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I use the smaller head on my daughter and I&#x27;ve been using it on her on the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; setting for over a year and it makes her teeth sparkle!</li>
            <li> build of this device is very solid, which makes sense because it is meant to vibrate at incredible speeds, the Sanitizing charging base on the other hand is not as substantial so be careful to keep this away from your counter top ledge.  </li>
            <li> My dentist asked me what I was using because when I went in for my cleaning, there was very little for them to clean.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth a little better than mu old brush and is less bulky to hold.</li>
            <li> It is definitely less than 2 years old, not this model exactly, but I was checking my order history to see if I bought it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> teeth also feel much cleaner even using less toothpaste than I normally would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It quickly boiled down to a choice between this one and the comparable Oral-B model and my choice was made due to aesthetics and features; the two products seem to function pretty much same</li>
            <li> I like this model even better, hopefully this one will last as long as the previous one!</li>
            <li> When the 2nd unit started to experience the same issue a few month later is investigated more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> The last batch of heads I purchased from Costco, I returned immediately,due to loose bristles that actually came off with the FIRST use!</li>
            <li> No more having to clean out the gunk on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun and Oral-B toothbrushes in the past and they just don&#x27;t come close to the Sonicare in the way they clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Much cleaner than previous Soniccare models and entire motor and unit feels much stronger and robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So you could see that after a time, the amount spent on replacement heads would exceed the price spent on the original toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very intense cleaning action (vibrates gums) and takes a little time to adjust to.  </li>
            <li> I spent a large amount of time trying to contact customer service on the phone.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth every cent.</li>
            <li> The little cleaner booth may or may not be useful</li>
            <li> /&gt;Options: There are a couple different brush head types that you can use with this particular model, I tend to use the standard longer brushes.</li>
            <li> The first week or two my gums were a little sensitive</li>
            <li> Also I cant figure out how to fit the charger into the hard case but there must be a way.</li>
            <li> so I picked up a basic mode 2 Series Plaque Control last week from SAM&#x27;s club since I thought I don&#x27;t need all the bell and whistles on the high end model</li>
            <li> The quality is definitely an upgrade from cheaper electric toothbrushes, and I highly recommend this product after having now used it personally for a month.  </li>
            <li> Overall a solidly build, high quality product.</li>
            <li> Too bad, because while it works, it is great.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t charge once a week I can go at least 2 weeks with just one light on the battery going</li>
            <li> /&gt;But more importantly, it cleans like crazy!</li>
            <li> after I have cleaned my teeth, I take the brushhead off, rinse it, then I put it into the small area where the UV Sanitizer is, press that button, which turns on the blue light to sanitize the brush head.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recomend the toothbrush, but not sure if there is a problem with the UV light</li>
            <li> This is clearly the final step.  </li>
            <li> This is apparently a newer model.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never in my life spent this much money on a toothbrush</li>
            <li> the stronger brushing action and the fact that the battery on the flex care+ last a lot longer between charging.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old Elite 7500 (NiCd batteries) finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
            <li> I used to have sensitive gums despite flossing once a day and brushing twice a day with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Is it possible that people who use the Sonicare may not have to go to the dentist as frequently as regualr toothbrush users??</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used all of the functions yet as it is only 3 weeks old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about 6 months now and so far it is living up to its potential and delivering on all the points referenced in the product description</li>
            <li> The 5 different options for brushing make it completely personalized based on the type of brush you want to accomplish.  </li>
            <li> It has different speeds for softer brushing, massage and sensitive modes.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve barely used it since I&#x27;ve gotten this product.  </li>
            <li> then the motion of the brush head reduced to the point the &#x27;vibration&#x27; was barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the case may be I will be sticking to changing the heads every 3 months even if the blue markers fade early.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are sensitive, and I can already feel an improvement, especially in my gums.  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to call Sonicare directly since it&#x27;s still within the warranty.</li>
            <li> I tried buying this product from the Philips company direct, but they were actually out of stock.  </li>
            <li> I recently switched to this Philips version and I&#x27;m surprised to see, after each brush, my teeth felling smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li> - Compared to the Oral B Professional series brush I had, this was definitely an upgrade...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is different from the old style sonicares.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am myself medical professional</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush, and so far, it&#x27;s the highest quality Sonicare I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the FlexCare Plus two to three times daily for about a month now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any buildup so far.    </li>
            <li> this product was a gift for my girlfriend; her old sonicare which was proabaly the basic one broke</li>
            <li> After only a few uses my whole mouth felt much cleaner.</li>
            <li> There are several brushing settings so, if you have sensitive teeth, there is a setting for that.  </li>
            <li> you find one regular adult brush.  </li>
            <li> On a recent visit to the dentist with my 8 year old son, the hygienist recommended he use a Sonicare as he wasn&#x27;t getting the job done.</li>
            <li> You simply pop them onto the pegs, making sure that the brush head is facing the center, close the door and push the green button...</li>
            <li> Finally, died completely.</li>
            <li> so well that I never want to go back to my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I recommend using the smaller brush on the sensitive setting to get used to it.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare Flexcare Plus is a big improvement over my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li> You can barely feel that button even when you are paying attention.  </li>
            <li> I finally got this in January and haven&#x27;t missed my old toothbrush at all.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it after reading several scholarly research articles on the benefits of \\&quot;true\\&quot; sonic action in toothbrushes over manual brushing.</li>
            <li> My dentist kept suggesting a sonic toothbrush because of my sensitive gums which I finally decided to fork out the money for one.</li>
            <li> After about 9 months, the unit developed problem, turning on by itself and would not charge properly.</li>
            <li> The improvement was quite apparent.</li>
            <li> I did not order a replacement because my old one died, I just thought it didn&#x27;t have the ooomph of its former self.</li>
            <li> So as far as I can determine not only has Phillips quality control deteriorated but they are not environmentally  friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when I switched back to the old brush head.  </li>
            <li> I have an old Sonicare that is still working 7 years later.</li>
            <li> I formerly used the old bulky Sonicare and cleaning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using SonoCare for years and my old one finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> the hum was higher pitched and the actual metal stick that the toothbrush goes on was not really moving anymore.  </li>
            <li> Checked the old handle on both chargers (wall and travel) and got the same results: Two beeps, pause, third beep, with charging light on handle going from green to orange and toothbrush starting and stopping erratically, so problem seems to be the handle.</li>
            <li> Ok, it&#x27;s broken, we&#x27;ll send you</li>
            <li> I bought an Oral B a few months ago, strictly for my travel and rarely use it, but it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;TWO CHARGERS: a small travel charger and a full size charger that is attached to a UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> Tip - let the brush do the work with light pressure and slow movement around the mouth.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much more effortless than a traditional manual toothbrush since you simply put the Sonicare brush against the teeth at the gumline and slowly move it across the fronts and backs of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> With this brush, you get that fresh from the dentist feeling everyday, and how can you beat that?</li>
            <li> That is the most frustrating part of this device.</li>
            <li> This newer one has more features that are poorly implemented.</li>
            <li> it would be even better if price could be a little lower and the body of brush can be made less bulky.</li>
            <li> First run the battery down by continuously restarting when it times out.</li>
            <li> I had this dark spot on one of my upper teeth,in the upper right hand corner, near the gum line.</li>
            <li> brush gives off a tone of 500Hz, meaning it moves at about 500 brushes per second, and feels like a massage device, only vibrating much faster!&lt;br /&gt;Using it tickles the gum a bit (comparable to when your arm or leg is asleep (due to lack of blood flow) comparable to the &#x27;pins and needles&#x27; feeling, only much softer, with the difference that the feeling goes away as soon as one stops brushing the gum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I see that is happening over time is the full charge is lasting less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I had to go several days with a regular toothbrush before my new toothbrush arrived.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this new one was much more short-lived.  </li>
            <li> The new brush heads snap on, have no place for debris to be trapped, and are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the new model for a short time now, about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I hope this new unit will last for about the same time or longer.</li>
            <li> However, during that same time, I have had to obtain three new handles, all for the same reason:  </li>
            <li> No one can convince me otherwise that they don&#x27;t know what they are doing...making a defective product in China that will not last and then turning their backs on you when the product dies - even if you register it - the only &amp;#34;goodwill&amp;#34; they give is &amp;#34;allowing &amp;#34; you to purchase a new product from them again.  </li>
            <li> I did find that after the 10 minute cycle was complete, the brush head was dry as far as I could tell.  </li>
            <li> The handle suddenly felt less powerful after 8 months of use.</li>
            <li> They worked better than a manual toothbrush, which is what I expected from this, but other than that I had no real expectations.    </li>
            <li> For several months there were no problems, but then the toothbrush suddenly became very loud.</li>
            <li> After having used a Sonicare FlexCare brush for over a year and a half, I highly recommend this model to anyone looking for a new power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> After having used a Sonicare FlexCare brush for over a year and a half, I highly recommend this model to anyone looking for a new power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and germs are killed with the UV light after a single push of a button.  </li>
            <li> The first stopped vibrating properly within 2 years and the other 2 brushes stopped just after the 2 year warranty ended.   </li>
            <li> Other than that this is only product I will ever use because of this consistent results.</li>
            <li> Keeps teeth significantly cleaner than manual brushing (I&#x27;ve been brushing with a manual brush - see cons - for a couple months and had a 6th month cleaning in which the hygienist commented on some extra scale build up, usually they&#x27;re in and out of there in no time with no complaints when I&#x27;ve been brushing with the Sonicare and flossing</li>
            <li> The brush heads are typically the same price as an online purchase so replacements can quickly be picked up when necessary.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super slick when I rub my tongue over them and shiny.  </li>
            <li> work-around solution is simple: put the brush on carefully, lubricating with water if it seems a little too tight, and making sure not to try to push it all the way to the top of the handle (there is supposed to be a small gap).  </li>
            <li> I used to view brushing as more of a chore and typically brushed too hard and too long.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only negative thing I have to say about this fine, well-made toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You can store and clean the brush head in a small compartment next to the recharging handle.  </li>
            <li> Only drawback is the recommended weekly cleaning of the device, but small price to pay for a clean brushhead.</li>
            <li> This one does not clean teeth or gums as well as the 30 second smile.  </li>
            <li> I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  </li>
            <li> That means this last time when it died, with a nearly $200 toothbrush breaking after barely 6 months of use since last replacement, the conversation concluded with a \\&quot;sorry.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about six months ago and as other reviews note, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product.</li>
            <li> The brush completely stops after 2 minutes and you need to restart the cycle again to brush the flat surface areas.</li>
            <li> There was hardly anything at all for her to clean.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m a little worried that this is going to break on me after a few months after some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
            <li> This feeling will last for a few months about 4 to 6 before you have to change the head, (they recommend ever 3 but with the included sanitizer and the easy  way they recommend brushing these heads last a long time.)</li>
            <li> They also included a shipping label to send back the defective unit on their dime for proper recycling (gold star for being green friendly assuming they actually recycle it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It started to decrease in its brushing power, and after trying a new brush head and determining that it wasn&#x27;t the problem, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that its the actual brush that is having these problems and that its simply on its last legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most dramatic thing happened tho.  </li>
            <li> I never liked electric toothbrushes because my teeth never felt clean afterward.</li>
            <li> Your risk is increased if your brush is kept near your toilet or if your home has roaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It lasted me several years before the internal battery died completely</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see whether my dental hygienist thinks that there is an obvious &#x27; difference &#x27; at my next professional &#x27; cleaning &#x27; appointment.  </li>
            <li> I believe they only have 3 colors (grey, dark blue, light blue).</li>
            <li> The old screw-on type traps water and toothpaste residue and requires me to regular take off the collar to rinse it out properly.</li>
            <li> This version comes with the hard case instead of the strange soft case Flexcare originally shipped with.</li>
            <li> This shuts it off after approximately 2 minutes, which almost always isn&#x27;t enough time for me to cover all the surfaces/areas (but that&#x27;s probably just the meticulousness/OCD in me, more than anything</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have never owned a electric brush I liked and always went back to the manual type.</li>
            <li> To top it off the UV light in the base stopped working within a couple of months of use.</li>
            <li> Looks like the company is pumping up its profits by making them in a way that consistently breaks down shortly after the warranty expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to get used to at first, however, once you get used to the vibrations</li>
            <li> While I have purchased and used several electric tooth brushes in the past, none of them has left my teeth feeling as clean as the Phillips FlexCare Plus HX6972.</li>
            <li> but with a new \\&quot;toy\\&quot; like this the two minutes don&#x27;t seem long enough.</li>
            <li> I had a problem of placing to much pressure while brushing using a conventional toothbrush, but using the FlexCare</li>
            <li> The different cycles on the handle are easier to understand and set, it comes with a hard, more protective case (previous was soft), and I think the battery lasts longer (time will tell).  </li>
            <li> After my wife and I each had a recent trip to the dentist, where the previous version to this model of electric toothbrush was demonstrated and recommended by the hygienist, I started shopping around to find exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The price may seem high for some, but this will last for a long time and is essential if you want to protect your teeth.</li>
            <li> I put very little weight on the UV Sanitize feature, however I came down with flu virus shortly after I began using this brush and what a relief to have that available!    </li>
            <li> , Philips SoniCare told me the SoniCares last generally 2-5 years but sent a $15 off coupon as a consolation prize.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely not anti-big business, but I have to echo the general complaints of companies taking advantage of their customers.  </li>
            <li> The biggest complaint I had of the original was the mold that would build up on the inside of the handle unless you cleaned it meticulously on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> One day, the vibration was suddenly weaker to the point of being barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li> The massage setting soothes my gums, which don&#x27;t like being brushed, and that two minute timer is a Godsend (I am five, apparently, and</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with this toothbrush and can only hope it lasts as long as the old one did!</li>
            <li> first of all, the electric plug did not fit usa electric outlets.&lt;br /&gt;second</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a regular viewer of the Mythbusters show, you&#x27;ll no doubt have seen the episode dealing with toothbrush hygiene and how ridiculously difficult it is to keep germs, especially of the fecal kind, off the brush head.</li>
            <li> The sensation was off-putting at first, but I got used to it after a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent this much money on much more useless things.</li>
            <li> The first few times using it takes some getting use to it.  </li>
            <li> Regarding the different modes, and whether or not this is better than the base model, I honestly only ever used the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting, and I don&#x27;t think many other users would stray too far from that setting either.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is worth it to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush exactly 2 years - it is a few days out of warranty.  </li>
            <li> (My gums were pretty bad too start anyway) but its very comfortable now.</li>
            <li> (see my previous review for a detailed write up) for about a year and a half before getting</li>
            <li> I hope the competition gets the message that Sonicare is going down hill fast.</li>
            <li> after buying my first electric toothbrush, I regret all the years passed without having it, I don&#x27;t think with a regular tooth brush I was doing any good for my teeth except gum recession which is horrible, high quality if you can afford get it it will save you even cleaning your teeth at the dentist</li>
            <li> And my teeth are much whiter while not changing any other dental habits!</li>
            <li> I thought I had found a winner with my previous Oral-B brush; I got lazy and mostly stopped brushing for 5 months, and started again in the last month with that brush.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my lips felt a little tingly with the vibration but even the second time of use I was used to it and now is a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to keep my mouth closed as much as possible,  but you really have to keep your mouth open to brush your teeth properly.  </li>
            <li> The reason is when I called Philips, a nice CS rep named Sarah hooked me up with a new base and three brand new brush heads.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for very long but so far I would reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand and model primarily due to the high revues of others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend one model or the other.</li>
            <li> My gums are not sore (in the front of my mouth- where I am less than gentle) and my teeth feel like I have been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> :  Much like previous units, this is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;Different&#x27; color, looks very similar - its &#x27;Soft Sky Blue&#x27; instead of &#x27;Medical Blue&#x27;.</li>
            <li> least in my case, I could quickly notice the difference in the quality of my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Also comes with a smaller travel charger (though you can make it at least 2 weeks on a full charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hated it the first day but loved it by the fifth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird at first to get used to, but you will in time and fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;standard&#x27; design of the brush head combined with the up and down motion of the toothbrush worked really well for the front side of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having owned the previous model of this toothbrush, heres the dirt: It has one additional setting, slightly better looks, a hard case, and bristles that fade with use.</li>
            <li> This is our third Sonicare--our 2nd one was still alive when we sent it to the farm because it wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge on long trips.</li>
            <li> My old brush didn&#x27;t have a timer and based on what my dentist used to tell me, I obviously was not brushing long enough.</li>
            <li> Especially when it&#x27;s too late to get a full refund and my money back.</li>
            <li> The tip (where the brush heads connect to the toothbrush) came loose and started to make a loud noise and rattling around.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although one is capable of cleaning their teeth just as well with a manual toothbrush, people are less likely to brush for the recommended two minutes when using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit I had previously lasted over a decade was repaired only once a a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I suggest you get a cheaper model, unless you really need all these settings for your teeth, and don&#x27;t mind if it does you wrong quickly.</li>
            <li> And you cannot buy replacement wands only so you will be forced to buy a whole new set.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to brush my teeth twice because it did not clean very well.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with the loose shaft that others are reporting,and fixed it.</li>
            <li> She said I didn&#x27;t have any new cavities (I usually  get new cavities every time I see her)</li>
            <li> This helps me not spend to little or too much time on any one area and keeps me focused when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> and it can irritate your gum, again, it all about getting use to it, and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure towards your teeth or it will hurt, a little bit will do).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had other problems with the new Flexcare system.  </li>
            <li> I realize the product is out of warranty, but they made not attempt to try to help me other than to tell me to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> but again, when the motor stops working 1 month after purchase, it&#x27;s hard to say a fancy toothbrush with lights is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I felt a little guilty about spending $$$ on a toothbrush, but I figured it would be a good investment.  </li>
            <li> It charges fairly quick and usually lasts me about 1-2 weeks on a single charge.</li>
            <li> was preparing to order a new unit today when I thought to check the Sonicare website to see it the warranty was still active.  </li>
            <li> Not going to throw good money after bad on this.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in the color of my teeth (whiter) and the elimination of plaque build up behind my front teeth.</li>
            <li> not sure how useful the variable speeds/setting are, but the total care cleaning setting definitely left my mouth feeling refreshed and throughly cleaned without taking too long to be doable on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Humans don&#x27;t as yet have three arms, which makes applying toothpaste the way it&#x27;s normally done (with two hands - especially if you&#x27;re a woman) problematic, because when you lay the Sonicare down it rolls over.</li>
            <li> if you have multiple brush heads, you could potentially share this one unit with a spouse/significant other (completely up to you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now come to the bad part, my old my trusty flexcare is still going strong, but the silver foil is chipping,so I decided to buy a new one</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve heard many bad things about the older models of sonicare such as mold build up/gunk build up/stale water (</li>
            <li> Mine went through a spell of sounding odd (which is why I gave it four instead of five stars) but has since started sounding normal again.  </li>
            <li> My old handset was due for a replacement head and the battery was starting to goso</li>
            <li> After reading all the back and forth, I pulled out my old brush and gave it a careful cleaning underneath the brush head--and it now works!  </li>
            <li> (Automatic electronic vacuum cleaner collecting dust in the corner, for example.)    </li>
            <li> A waste of ~$150 bucks...  Would not recommend purchasing, especially if you are under the same impression as I was that Sonicare is everlasting (given older products).</li>
            <li> but I am convinced that the overall sonic range was less on the new design.  </li>
            <li> How tough is it to just push the button again at the end of the two minute Clean cycle?  </li>
            <li> How tough is it to just push the button again at the end of the two minute Clean cycle?  </li>
            <li> I would prefer two of the the larger heads instead of one large and one small.  </li>
            <li> It leaves teeth cleaner than other models by far.</li>
            <li> The only negative comment is that my first brush only lasted 2 yrs.  </li>
            <li> a bit more difficult than on the model that opened up completely but certainly not worth subtracting a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when my Oral B electric toothbrush started to get old, I asked around about what other people used.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;spam\\&quot; content, or references to other products, offers, or websites</li>
            <li> But I think the price is a little bit high.</li>
            <li> Regardless, what kind of quality control do they have, or not, when such an expensive item breaks down so soon, or even at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would not recommend as it just quit working yesterday, less than 3 months after it arrived, hoping to get a refund or a new one to try again</li>
            <li> Not only is it gentle on my gums, I can instantly feel the difference, especially in the \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; areas in the back of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer it to be a little less powerful in the sensitive mode, but other than that I have no complaints and as I have mentioned after getting used to it</li>
            <li> I have never, never experienced this level of clean with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is one powerful unit.</li>
            <li> They were starting to recede slightly and they would often be sensitive and bleed when brushed.</li>
            <li> Did not last long until I went back to my manual brush.</li>
            <li> so I know when I have brushed long enough.</li>
            <li> These products both work well on your teeth, but the build quality seems to be so low that they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> but I am totally disapointed in how long they last.</li>
            <li> It definitely does take some getting used to, especially learning how to NOT have spit/toothpaste sputter out of your mouth, but it doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t like to brush all that long, so she goes with the regular mode, and I go with the &#x27;gum care&#x27; mode which is essentially 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> bought the older Sonicare Flexcare HX6930 from Amazon a few years ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- requires some getting used to if you&#x27;re new to Sonicare electric toothbrushes (loud vibration if the hard part of the brush touches your teeth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vibrations on that toothbrush were coarse, and the toothbrush so loud that I worried about waking other family members who were still sleeping!</li>
            <li> Nice clean molars and no more bloody gums.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND PUSHES PRETTY HARD ON IT , SO I GUESS THATS</li>
            <li> At the frequent nagging of my dentist, I finally sprang for this, and bought it at the dentist&#x27;s office for a slight discount.</li>
            <li> My teeth are less sensitive due to using this brush as opposed to my old battery operated brush.</li>
            <li> The color rings for distinguishing different brush heads are similar and limited.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much of a problem with microorganisms on my toothbrush in the past.    </li>
            <li> I did not realize how much the design had changed in the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> battery lasts long enough for 2-3 weeks trip.</li>
            <li> It rests flat on the charging area without any grooves to drain water.</li>
            <li> It rests flat on the charging area without any grooves to drain water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare line of toothbrushes for a few years now and recently upgraded after my old one finally burnt out.  </li>
            <li> That was not the case, and long story short, I now use an [[ASIN:B002HWS9GG</li>
            <li> I hope this rechargable toothbrush lasts as long as my last one.</li>
            <li> and the battery last for a long time too.  </li>
            <li> and considering these machines last for so long</li>
            <li> If anything, I used to brush too long as part of my oral hygiene routine, especially at night, so this does a thorough job in a set amount of time, and I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> I should have done this long back.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and I only charge once a week, but it the charging time has lengthened since I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery life.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I should&#x27;ve purchased a Sonicare toothbrush a long time ago.</li>
            <li> However, you have 6 areas to brush if take into account that you still have the flat surface areas of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t know how long this unit is going to last</li>
            <li> Insert the screw so that the head is on the flat side of the bracket,and the the threads come through the side with the cylindrical cutout.</li>
            <li> The only minor quibble I guess might be the location of the power button.</li>
            <li> am now stuck with a piece of junk toothbrush and no apparent chance of collecting on the guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I brush my teeth twice a day, and try to avoid going to the dentist as long as humanly possible.  </li>
            <li> There are five options for tooth and gum care, zone timing for brushing, a long lasting charge, and a UV brush sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> Give us a flat side.</li>
            <li> I like using the toothbrush, but it seems a big price to pay if it is only expected to last two years.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to figure out the new toothbrushing routine, but once you&#x27;ve figured it out</li>
            <li> It just goes to show, just because something is new, shiny and lights up, doesn&#x27;t mean its better than the older models that didn&#x27;t break down randomly.</li>
            <li> Philips usually has a decent warranty, so I came back to look at my order and find out if it&#x27;s still covered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As such, I recently had to have seven of them replaced (thankfully, no new cavities!).</li>
            <li> minor complaint is that the heads that attach to the toothbrush are grotesquely overpriced; i end up making them last for many months before changing them, and although not perfect at that point, they do still fairly well.</li>
            <li> This is a fancy little gizmo, a BIG upgrade from my 5 or 6 years old Oral B Braun power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> , I just used the old basic hand toothbrush, but I&#x27;ve become so spoiled and the travel charger takes up so little room that I take this one along.  </li>
            <li> After only a few weeks of use I can already tell a difference in my gums, which generally did not get a proper cleaning with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have very good dental health overall, but I&#x27;m terrible at making myself floss, and a sonic toothbrush can mitigate some of that neglect.    </li>
            <li> Case is now hard plastic instead of the soft case that comes with the old model</li>
            <li> It comes with a decent hard travel case, where the Flexcare comes with a minimal soft case  </li>
            <li> , other systems are available with a much smaller base with toothbrushes whose Clean cycle works just as well.  </li>
            <li> , other systems are available with a much smaller base with toothbrushes whose Clean cycle works just as well.  </li>
            <li> The first one was still working when I went to the second; I only did it because the brush heads were getting very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> brushheads don&#x27;t seem to last very long.  </li>
            <li> As said in other reviews, it takes a little getting adjusted to the tickle feeling when brushing certain areas of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, my visits to the dentist show multiple new problems, serious problems such as deep root and deep gum problems.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t get charged any less for dental visits, I do not have near the plaque and haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a toothbrush that vibrates really could be that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> will be buying these as gifts (hoping that they don&#x27;t take it the wrong way) and recommend this product to anyone who wants their teeth and gums to feel really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is necessary to remove the head and dry the space every time the brush is used.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush mode button is positioned to be extremely easy to hit accidentally and you&#x27;ll be unable to see that the mode has changed while brushing.  </li>
            <li> Previously, Phillips provided a soft case with the brush.</li>
            <li> I have had this for only a few days and it knocks the pants off of my old Sonicare Elite that I have had for almost 5 years.</li>
            <li> I think the early wear is because i have a few crowns and vaneers where my husbands doesn&#x27;t  (we have been using it the same amount) .....</li>
            <li> Flushing the toilet with the lid up can spray fecal particulate in a 6 foot radius.  </li>
            <li> I am now awaiting my 3rd replacement toothbrush after the previous two would no longer charge (using either the standard charger or the travel charger), and I expect this to by my last as it will die shortly after my warranty is</li>
            <li> that floats in the air eventually lands on uncovered bristles, including what goes in the toilet and gets aerosolized when you flush...  </li>
            <li> They state that the product is only expected to last 3-5</li>
            <li> The only concerns I see is it is not real important to buy the model with numerous settings such as this one as often</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, the toothbrush made a loud &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; noise and died.</li>
            <li> But after using it for several years and not having a single cavity in that time and getting compliments from my dental hygienist</li>
            <li> Thus, I no longer have two units that need plugging in, but only a single.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Sonicare toothbrushes and have used them twice a day for YEARS without a single problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush based on the claims and the negative to positive review ratio.  </li>
            <li> Walk away from the product everyday feeling like you just got home from a professional teeth cleaning!</li>
            <li> The brush modes are labeled in plain English--Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage--rather than settings like Go Care and Max Care that I never understood on my earlier model.</li>
            <li> The problem is with a screw that comes loose where the shaft attaches to the inner body.</li>
            <li> really a toothbrush review, but the Philips packaging for this product is horrible - eight spot-welded plastic plugs, at least three or four of which must be cut, and if you use a sharp instrument (knife, scissors) to open it, which you must, you stand a pretty good chance of lacerating either your skin, the family pet or the furniture.  </li>
            <li> reserve the right not to post your review if it contains any of the following types of content or violates other guidelines:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obscenities, discriminatory language, or other language not suitable for a public forum</li>
            <li> The travel charger is nice, and I actually use it daily instead of the larger base with the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> The first replacement heads were soft and gentle; the heads were hard and uncomfortable in the second order I received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset about this, not just because it&#x27;s an inconvenience (for anyone who is used to one of these, going back to a manual toothbrush is not pleasant at all), but because as I&#x27;m looking through these reviews to see if I&#x27;m the only unlucky one, I&#x27;m seeing a lot of customers in my situation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a previous version of this product and truly enjoyed it, the only discourse I have, it fail prematurely.</li>
            <li> for all the other modes (massage, refresh, etc) I don&#x27;t use them and hope Philips doesn&#x27;t keep adding gimmicky features which don&#x27;t add real value.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, due the longevity of my last toothbrush by Sonicare (7+ years and didn&#x27;t break), I can imagine that this one will last even longer!  </li>
            <li> because the standard brush is longer it makes it more difficult to reach the inside contours of your teeth!</li>
            <li> Possibly a charger issue (they only replaced handle last time), but even then, the charger is still less than 2 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11-19-13:</li>
            <li> Now less than 18 months later, and several handles later as well, Philips are refusing to replace it again.</li>
            <li> Not hot enough to blister, enough to jolt you though.</li>
            <li> It says it can last up to three weeks, however my case I&#x27;m using the standard cleaning mode versus the other modes the brush collapse.</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, one of the handles is the correct one and the other is for a completely different model.  </li>
            <li> A typical Sonicare will last several days on a charge anyway, but for those longer trips out of town, you now have the ability to keep your traditional, manual toothbrush at home.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of Sonicare products, but the last two have failed relatively quickly ( 1 month, 7 months, respectively ).</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;ve had something particularly offensive for dinner, I usually just fall into bed, plaque and all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an older version, however, was not able to find it, as such--I am going with Braun.  </li>
            <li> The sonicare action of the toothbrush took a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;update\\&quot; from the previous FlexCare model is slight, but real.  </li>
            <li> the included hard case and a travel charger, this toothbrush is portable and ready to go wherever you go.</li>
            <li> I really do like the hard case travel kit with this edition.  </li>
            <li> I really like the hard travel case.  </li>
            <li> This one comes with a hard case, which I really really appreciate.</li>
            <li> However, I love that geeky little detail, because I am a stereotypical consumer that needs to push extra buttons and feel in control.</li>
            <li> With a replaceable head, identifiable with colored bands, different people can use the same base, very cool.</li>
            <li> The travel case is really nice because I can pack this thing up, throw it in my bad, and not worry about it turning on or getting damaged while traveling.</li>
            <li> Expensive  2) CHEAP Carrying case.</li>
            <li> This brush comes with two heads; one small to reach back in there and inside the teeth and one wide for front and normal sides.</li>
            <li> Lasts long time between charging--nearly a month.</li>
            <li> You can also leave the toothbrush in the charger after each use, and once the device is fully charged, it is designed to draw only minimal power from the outlet.       </li>
            <li> carries a charge for a long time before I have to recharge (a month perhaps?).</li>
            <li> Scott, how long did you charge the unit before turning it on?  </li>
            <li> you have spent enough time in each zone of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> This will still rattle your teeth if the back of the brush touches them, so be careful</li>
            <li> What I would say is a minor inconvenience</li>
            <li> I am a long time philips user.</li>
            <li> and they had no idea how long before it would be in stock.  </li>
            <li> I need to be reminded how long to brush).</li>
            <li> I prefer this Flexcare Plus model because:  - The battery lasts twice as long as Flexcare models  </li>
            <li> Sanitizing station died a long time ago</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Strange to say</li>
            <li> I believe this product will pay for itself in the long run.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of my time.  </li>
            <li> This is not really the Sonicare&#x27;s fault but is still gross.    </li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already subscribed to replacement brush heads pack from Amazon every 3 months since I intend to use this beauty for a long time...</li>
            <li> Brushing with this toothbrush feels like scrubbing your body after a long summer day.</li>
            <li> so I did not need to charge it for week long trip.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> A minor problem is that sometimes when brushing, my hand hits the off button.</li>
            <li> It has too steep of an arc so the center of the brush doesn&#x27;t come in contact with my teeth properly.  </li>
            <li> Since no one else is writing a review.. or a long one that is.. here it is.    </li>
            <li> Long battery life (3 weeks)  6.</li>
            <li> Had to get used to the vibration, and now that I have I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this product, even though my dentist recommended it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, and the battery lasts quite a long time when traveling.  </li>
            <li> Hoping that it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, the battery stays charged for a really long time.</li>
            <li> I know I spent hours trying to filter through all the different brands.</li>
            <li> Since this toothbrush only lasted about 33 months for us, we spent nearly $200 in that period (including brush heads - they&#x27;re not cheap).  </li>
            <li> Had we used traditional toothbrushes, we would have spent between $11-22 during that</li>
            <li> they give you a year long warranty.</li>
            <li> I miss my long working sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember my gums have bled after brushing my teeth, even when brushing by hand.  </li>
            <li> If, however, you are not sensitive to the vibrations of this device.</li>
            <li> but I have made it this long without one.    </li>
            <li> it 1 year (to the day) from the date of order, and decided to start making strange noises.  </li>
            <li> When my old Sonicare toothbrush died a few months ago I did a lot of research on electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Which will save me money long term.  </li>
            <li> Long life out of the battery</li>
            <li> technology has came a long ways...</li>
            <li> Long time owner of this brand and product type.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush stays charged a long time</li>
            <li> It also lasted for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how an issue like this could arise from a company that has been using inductive chargers for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am amazed that it has held up for this long.</li>
            <li> Then it stopped keeping a charge for long.  </li>
            <li> Guess I should have returned this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This cleans your teeth better than a regular tooth brush, but it&#x27;s very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Heck, I&#x27;ll even agree to pay $50 or something reasonable to get the base unit&#x27;s battery replaced, but I&#x27;m not paying full price for another one that might only last until days after the warranty expires.fer to help me, I&#x27;ll find another brand, or get used to a manual toothbrush again</li>
            <li> Heck, I&#x27;ll even agree to pay $50 or something reasonable to get the base unit&#x27;s battery replaced, but I&#x27;m not paying full price for another one that might only last until days after the warranty expires.</li>
            <li> problem doesn&#x27;t come up in Amazon reviews which are usually written right after purchase and give little hint as to reliability.</li>
            <li> I felt having a warranty where I can just drive down the street and swap it out if something goes wrong more convenient.</li>
            <li> The Oral B helped me step down from scrubbing back and forth with a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> That unit finally broke down after 2 years of regular use and 2 moves.  </li>
            <li> So I bought a second one, broke down around the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got down to the 3rd brush and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> I would rate it overall a 4, but the shipping issues with this and many of my products lately have been RIDICULOUS!  </li>
            <li> This is my first expensive toothbrush, and it really shows its difference from previous ones.</li>
            <li> more mold collecting in the base in this new design.</li>
            <li> The brush head fits right inside the compartment on a small peg, and the door shuts firmly even though there&#x27;s no latch.  </li>
            <li> (I am getting a gingival graft next month), primarily due to improper and excessive brushing with a regular toothbrush from a young age.  </li>
            <li> The basic operation of the FlexCare Plus is the same as the previous model.  </li>
            <li> Usage is the same as previous models--in the basic mode, it will give you a signal every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> I went through one in less than three months, and the second one is already starting to wear.  </li>
            <li> I found maintaining the correct brush head orientation on the back side of the teeth difficult if not impossible.  </li>
            <li> This may not truly mean much, but I do take comfort in the fact that I have the option of killing germs off if I want to sanitize the toothbrush</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a long term toothbrush that you can share with other people, look no further!</li>
            <li> Mines barely made the 9 months mark (the sanitizer broke in less than 3 months).</li>
            <li> first time I used it, I ran the Sensitive mode, just to see how hard it would be on my teeth,or how hard it would be to get used to.  </li>
            <li> the toothbrush vibration system comes loose and stops the vibration action after a few months.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said that it feels like your just got back from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself going back and using any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It does feel like other comments like I just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> This kit comes with an extra brush head &amp; other accessories.</li>
            <li> I was in the process of having peridontal treatment due to deep \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; (5-6), so I bought my FlexCare Plus toothbrush at the recommendation of my dental hygienist about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> The battery charge is very solid, and for two people, using it everyday, it seems to last a long time.    </li>
            <li> considering all the other reviews complaining about the same thing, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve gotten it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone so long with a manual toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to upgrade my electric toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smaller brushheads - I have a smaller mouth, even so the small brushhead seemed too small at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken two stars away from this product due to the fact the replacement heads do not last the 3 months as advertised by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I can see how the shaft might have come off in some of the other reviews, the pull required to remove the brush is enormous.  </li>
            <li> On the &amp;#34;Gum Care&amp;#34; setting, it gives you the timer for these quadrants, along with an additional minute for other areas of the mouth that need attention (definitely the tongue, cheeks, and chewing surfaces of the teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also promotes proper brush time due to</li>
            <li> I have read some other reviews that mentioned that daily use of the UV sanitizer can be cumbersome.</li>
            <li> My other Sonicare brushes did not come with extra travel</li>
            <li> I can feel larger, slower circular vibrations than in any other mode.  </li>
            <li> I have periodontal disease that has progressed to a little gum receding and deep pockets in the back teeth.</li>
            <li> For an hour or two there was a few small flashes of light, but now it&#x27;s completely dead.</li>
            <li> &quot;  The cord is a little more difficult to wind up in the unit to shorten it.  </li>
            <li> &quot;  The cord is a little more difficult to wind up in the unit to shorten it.  </li>
            <li> The only time it becomes an issue is if someone travels away from the other.</li>
            <li> Expensive as hell, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> so I feel like I updated a little bit but nothing major.</li>
            <li> The SonicCare Toothbrush may brush your teeth well (it doesn&#x27;t seem that much different than any other electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had).  </li>
            <li> Other terrific features?</li>
            <li> The rings are 3 drab colors that aren&#x27;t that much different from each other.</li>
            <li> searched online today and it seems other people have had this same problem.</li>
            <li> The next visit to the hygienist will prove this one way or the other...  </li>
            <li> It has a cleaner appearance with most of the front being a dark chrome look, also instead of the green led&#x27;s, it has a backlight behind the selected brushing mode.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging base is very compact and will sit nicely on the corner of a vanity sink or a small shelf.</li>
            <li> but I replaced it because after about three years, the charge no longer lasts very long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to come off the hip with this amount of money, but I highly recommend it for your dental health.</li>
            <li> Sanitizers most likely do not help, but they can&#x27;t be bad either.</li>
            <li> You just pop the brush head off the unit, rinse and dry and put it inside the sanitizer, press on, and voila...</li>
            <li> Let dry overnight.</li>
            <li> One bothersome thing is that the UV sanitizer does not also dry the brush(es)</li>
            <li> After purchasing the Clarisonic last summer, a few months later I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> --I don&#x27;t put it back on the charger everyday, only about once a week</li>
            <li> Not that far a drop, but enough to break the delicate metal inside.</li>
            <li> The blue strip will turn white and the bristles aren&#x27;t as firm in a matter of weeks, not months.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is completely dead after 1 1/2 years of very basic use by only myself.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth in the morning while taking a shower, prior brushes I owned (earlier Oral B models) would malfunction after a few months.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers had similar problems and reported less success with customer service, rating the brush poorly.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a travel charger that is nice and compact so you don&#x27;t have to stuff the entire base unit in your suitcase to go on vacation.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to over brush with my manual toothbrush and that is not good since sometimes it cause sore gum on certain tooth.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve \\&quot;downgraded\\&quot; to a HealthyWhite 710 which is similar to this model but has pared-down modes that I will actually use, and is half the price (albeit doesn&#x27;t have as \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; a brush handle!)</li>
            <li> My only partial complaint is that the brush heads do need to be replaced quicker than a normal manual toothbrush, but this was something I expected going in.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts at least throughout the 2 year warranty period since the cost was so high.</li>
            <li> The biggest negative as is my issue with all Philips toothbrush products is that the replacement brushes are \\&quot;extremely\\&quot; high in price.</li>
            <li> limited warranty.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single cavity since I started using Sonicares</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not had a single issue with it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I walked out of the dentist&#x27;s every single day.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush as a replacement for single toothbrush without UV.  </li>
            <li> Another plus is the battery life; it is supposed to last twice as long as the previous model.    </li>
            <li> I have had trouble with sensitive teeth and softening of the enamel on my teeth due to dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> the old one making a small turbulence , but the plus shows just almost nothing.    </li>
            <li> I have natural small gaps on my bottom teeth and can tell when plaque builds up because the gaps starts to close.</li>
            <li> For only two years of reliable use, this brush is not worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I used the old brush the other day, boy what a waste of time that was.</li>
            <li> Stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been attempting to replace the UV sanitizer bulb for several months now with no success.  </li>
            <li> You cannot buy any replacement parts or have it fixed (unless you know of a small appliance repair store).  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is cool, but probably useless.</li>
            <li> A standard cleaning session consists of 30 seconds on your front top teeth, 30 seconds on front behind teeth, 30 seconds of front bottom teeth, 30 seconds of bottom behind teeth.</li>
            <li> first time, it broken because it cannot be recharged.</li>
            <li> One morning all of a sudden this tooth brash stopped working after 3 years and a month of careful using only at home.</li>
            <li> and I can feel the pieces of food dislodging themselves as the brush \\&quot;shakes\\&quot; them loose.  </li>
            <li> Do this over a newspaper or a table as the loose parts may fall out.</li>
            <li> The stem was getting loose</li>
            <li> Something came loose inside the handle, and it would make a lot of noise, but not do it&#x27;s thing anymore.</li>
            <li> The brush shaft became loose after 22 months of use.</li>
            <li> If you have gum issues or a head cold, you just put the toothbrush head in the sanitizer for 10 minutes and it is clean for the next time.  </li>
            <li> , I find myself constantly pressing it when I pick up and put down the brush.  </li>
            <li> When you break it down over the years of service we expect to get from this brush it is not that big a deal.  </li>
            <li> By the end of one month the blue was all the way down.  </li>
            <li> Even after it has run down it will still buzz for a second when turned on.</li>
            <li> I admit, it took me years to finally break down and buy one of these.</li>
            <li> If I were to purchase again I&#x27;d either go for the platinum or down a model to one that still used the same brush heads but doesn&#x27;t have the features that you probably will use once.  </li>
            <li> I bought it after reading rave reviews on a Japanese consumer products review magazine - that Philips beats Oral B hands down....</li>
            <li> As always the directions are down right useless and barely readable.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;sonic vibration&#x27; has slowly reduced over time due to the loose shaft... finally, last week, the shaft stopped vibrating completely.  </li>
            <li> Instead of having a 3 minute routine with 45 seconds each quad (30 normal + 15 massage) for a total of 3 min; they now have it where it goes 30 seconds each quad with an added 1 minute at the end for &#x27;problem areas&#x27; which is broken down into four 15 second intervals.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I know other reviewers have mentioned that the programming of the brush modes can be annoying, but honestly it is just pushing one button next to the name of the program you wish to use at that time.</li>
            <li> Not really a toothbrush review, but the Philips packaging for this product is horrible - eight spot-welded plastic plugs, at least three or four of which must be cut, and if you use a sharp instrument (knife, scissors) to open it, which you must, you stand a pretty good chance of lacerating either your skin, the family pet or the furniture.  </li>

            <li> My previous Sonicare lasted for almost six years before its motor finally died.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleans as well although the cleaning properties seem less \\&quot;mechanical\\&quot; than the obvious scrubbing effect of the Oral B.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Braun Oral B Pro Care set that lasted over three years, and this one totally blows it out the water.</li>
            <li> Before having the Sonicare Flexcare, I would only brush my teeth once per day with your typical $4 toothbrush from CVS.</li>
            <li> My previous sonicare only lasted a couple of years</li>
            <li> Battery will last for slightly longer than a week before being charged.</li>
            <li> My second order of this electric brush just died again - a bit after 1 year - like the previous one -</li>
            <li> /&gt;-same fragile neck as previous flexcares (when someone in my office saw me get it</li>
            <li> Much less come back to say the thing broke after two years.</li>
            <li> Just like the previous units, setup is simple.  </li>
            <li> The travel case is a big improvement over the previous case, but I do have one pet peeve--</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has had the same results as the previous one</li>
            <li> The only other nit I have  is the ease of hitting the selection button for all the other speeds.</li>
            <li> There are brief pauses, as with previous versions, to alert you when you&#x27;ve cleaned a quadrant and need to move to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> The battery may last longer than previous models.  </li>
            <li> only problem I have had was about a year and a half after having it, the battery stopped charging or holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> It also has a sleeker, less cluttered look on the outside (probably easier to clean/rinse as well).  </li>
            <li> Has the sanitizing option for the toothbrush head - big improvement over previous versions</li>
            <li> I went to Europe twice with this brush and not having to worry about bringing a charger and dealing with odd international outlets</li>
            <li> I get regular checkups, and I&#x27;ve had no degradation in my teeth or any of the work that I&#x27;ve had previously done since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> I had figured that a year and a half was the lifespan of the product, it does receive daily use from three people.  </li>
            <li> addresses, URLs, phone numbers, physical addresses or other forms of contact information&lt;br /&gt;Critical or spiteful comments on other reviews posted on the page or their authors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> My only problem is that mine came from Korea and I have to use a voltage converter (which was included), but I have this black plug extending from my wall plug in.</li>
            <li> The bulb, meant to last \\&quot;5 years\\&quot; lasted less than 9 months.  </li>
            <li> Go through brushes quickly which gets expensive.  </li>
            <li> Took only one week to get use to the new tough cleaning style of the brush.</li>
            <li> They both told me that they each used one daily and had seen other patients improve drastically and that even though it seemed expensive, they really thought that it would improve my teeth/gums enough to basically pay for itself.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would not be able to hear the beeping signal at the time to change, however, It seems it tends to hiccup at the intervals that need to rotate your location and shut down when time is up.</li>
            <li> However, I hate it when the new and supposedly improved model drops important features</li>
            <li> /&gt;After years of struggling with horrid teeth problems and poor discipline in proper hygiene since it didn&#x27;t seem to matter what I did anyway, I started going to a new dentist and hygienist.</li>
            <li> There is a smaller &#x27;travel&#x27; dock that you can keep if you have a tight space.  </li>
            <li> The case looks a little better and the sanitzer door no longer has a button to open the door which is one less thing to get dirty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual brush ever again - there&#x27;s no clean like a Sonicare toothbrush gives.</li>
            <li> The battery life wasn&#x27;t quite as long as expected from other reviews but everything else was as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Switching from a manual to an electric toothbrush made a big difference, and took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Splurge a little and get the extra features and UV Sanitzer.</li>
            <li> Helpful little details like color-coded rings for multiple users, cord wraps to eliminate cord snarls, travel charger and travel case, 2 sizes of brushing head and an intelligible instruction</li>
            <li> We bought packs of extra brushes and the kids use the little brush heads.</li>
            <li> After initially bypassing the &amp;#34;acclimation period&amp;#34; I ended up re-enabling it, as the vibration did take a little getting used to...  </li>
            <li> Each is a little different speed although some are so close</li>
            <li> The little pin that holds the brush head now wiggles back and forth.</li>
            <li> I like the actual tooth brush and wand, but the unit was very difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Few weeks ago handle first started running weaker than usual, then started making odd buzzing noises and finally died few days</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the toothbrush isn&#x27;t hard on your mouth.  </li>
            <li> What you get is dull blue, blue/grey and white (whiskey tango foxtrot?)  </li>
            <li> After a recommendation from my dentist about a year ago, I finally broke down and purchased this product and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  </li>
            <li> Philips did a great job on the FlexCare Plus and added a hard plastic travel case that holds the base unit and two brush heads.</li>
            <li> I had been unlikely to consider a competing brand based on my original high regard for the Sonicare line, but I would have to think very carefully about purchasing from them again after this extremely frustrating experience.</li>
            <li> At least this time the switch was to (as far as I can tell) an equivalent product.</li>
            <li> This model (HX6950) is currently the ultimate rechargeable toothbrush that dental offices seem to recommend (or at least have coupons for).</li>
            <li> The battery has enough power to last for at least four days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering this one, when I could have bought a different version for a much lower price here in stores.</li>
            <li> While Sonicare was ready to replace the units, I personally have reached my limit on aggravation, disappointment, and loss of confidence in Sonicare&#x27;s overall performance.</li>
            <li> and he told me there&#x27;s nothing they can do - brought back memories of 3 1/2 years ago when I complained that the LAST one I had also stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the sonicaretoothbrush for a few years now and short of going to the dentist</li>
            <li> It continues to work as expected.     </li>
            <li> Switch it to \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; for a few brushings and by 2nd brushing</li>
            <li> &quot; Flexcare are minimal, that is probably why all they did is add a + to the end of the name.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Contrary to 20 years of trial and error experience, I took a chance and spent almost $200 on this toothbrushing system.  </li>
            <li> Will the battery last for a few years?</li>
            <li> I would actually give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars but figured I&#x27;d round to 5.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste to ever ship overnight because it only gets there about 50% of the time.  </li>
            <li> I love this company, but have noticed since last year its shipping is getting worse and worse!</li>
            <li> This was not really an option since it was a gift.  </li>
            <li> That problem is solved with a snap-in brush head instead of the hollow screw on replacement head.</li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; side is that the charger does not fit in the travel case.</li>
            <li> It worked properly until a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush but noticed it didnt have the UV Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is left with a \\&quot;squeeky clean\\&quot; feeling and it hasn&#x27;t changed during the few months I&#x27;ve been using this.  </li>
            <li> so I guess that is to be expected).     </li>
            <li> Switched to regular toothbrush for a few months but couldn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> You replace the brush heads every few months but the handle to supposed to last for years.</li>
            <li> I had minimal to non existant plague and tarter.</li>
            <li> Although the brush heads can be expensive, its worth it.</li>
            <li> Come on Phillips, this was not ready for prime time.</li>
            <li> With minimal hassle, the manufacturer of this product agreed to send me another unit.  </li>
            <li> However, after a number of weeks, they sent me an empty mailing tube in the mail.  </li>
            <li> After carefully comparing brands, costs, model features, and durability, I knew I wanted a Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> and I do want to keep my teeth from rotting out of my head, but I&#x27;ve never really been a night brusher.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel as if i had just left the dentist everyday.</li>
            <li> It is now May 2012, roughly 15 months after receiving the replacement, and it has now quit working.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve stupidly spent hundreds of dollars on extraneous dental care.  </li>
            <li> I expected to like it, but...  </li>
            <li> One hour wasted when it could have simply been shipped with a delivery confirmation.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe my toothbrush would be all wet inside, but it dries out my toothbrush for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a con for me, but perhaps it is for some people.)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and I am careful not to leave it on the charger continuously, which I think helps.</li>
            <li> Brought a earlier version of the Philips Sonic a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Carefully pull out the inside body.</li>
            <li> It will be very loose or not attached at all.</li>
            <li> I already had been using sonicare prior to this purchase for a few years.</li>
            <li> My rough handling of the toothbrush when doing this, may have caused some problems and it eventually stopped working.</li>
            <li> I also  like that each setting (settings for gum and teeth) is roughly a two minute brush by default.</li>
            <li> I have been told it should last for a few years.</li>
            <li> so your brush head(s) stays wet for quite some time in a closed environment.  </li>
            <li> unreliable, stops working properly after few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it wet??  </li>
            <li> The brush functions as expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sonicare several years ago and when it quit on me, I didn&#x27;t buy another one for a few years.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush a few weeks prior to the dental visit and used the brush diligently.</li>
            <li> I take care of my gums, since I will be getting my braces off in the next few months.</li>
            <li> And I have been using regular vibrating 5 dollar brushes for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> You can share it among family members - just pick up a few extra heads</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s really no reason for the issues I&#x27;ve had with longevity.</li>
            <li> I would still recommend a Sonicare toothbrush minus the mercury.</li>
            <li> I told him that I don&#x27;t get the bottom wet.</li>
            <li> but if this saves my dental bills, it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> I wonder what is really going on behind the closed door.</li>
            <li> Cleaning performance is about the same, although the head design is much better and doesn&#x27;t get build up under the base.  </li>
            <li> but for a nearly $200 investment, it failed far too</li>
            <li> The nice thing about the UV is it creates a wider base which helps to stabilize the toothbrush from being knocked about.    </li>
            <li> My only major complaint is how quickly the handle gets dirty with gunk.  </li>
            <li> The rubber on the handle is colored differently, and I suspect will show stains less after long use than the pale green of the earlier FlexCare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> : The extra modes on this toothbrush are gimmicky and not very useful to me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the same type of premature failure as the blue colored section of the bristles.</li>
            <li> In the mean time  the&lt;br /&gt;toothbrush would keep turning it self on until I get the battery drain completely.</li>
            <li> Certainly not a reason not to get it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not large and clunky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Comes with a small base for when you&#x27;re traveling, that way you can take your toothbrush on all your travels without packing the huge base with the sanitizer in it, worked great without a current converter when I took it to Australia.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy the least expensive bottle that has only the clean</li>
            <li> A month and a half is way too long.</li>
            <li> Another small complaint is that the head is a bit more difficult to remove than prior models I have owned where you screw them off.  </li>
            <li> About teh big mess on your face a goop going down the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really an electric toothbrush aficionado, so I don&#x27;t know from one to the other.</li>
            <li> It feels like a small earthquake in my mouth and really vibrates hard.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased the ProSeries Sonicare toothbrush after a few years of using a conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> With a little trouble shooting it was only a loose bulb.</li>
            <li> you ever question why you&#x27;d want to keep the bristles covered in the bathroom, take a look at the Myth Busters segment on how clean (or dirty)</li>
            <li> However, the U/V sanitizer only worked the first time I used it and after that would not work at all, which was disappointing given the cost of this product.</li>
            <li> A few days later, the handle became worse and simply gave a faint buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> If there is any down side it would be that the replacement heads are not cheap, but I only replace mine once a year or so</li>
            <li> A couple minor things I do not like are the brush color designators they give you in the form of little rubber rings.</li>
            <li> but the new design is really weak.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, the Oral-B is terrible in comparison, and I can&#x27;t live without my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> New customer service agent who sadly announced, the product is on back order, but would be in and shipped ...</li>
            <li> I never liked the soft case that came with the previous SonoCare.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love the head and handle--the older models allow water to drip down inside the handle compartment and nasty, slimey film starts growing and the smell is horrible--this one does not have this problem.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this - watching online reviews and comparing it to other Sonicare models.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compair it to the other models.</li>
            <li> because my gums were receding due to \\&quot;vigorous\\&quot; brushing.</li>
            <li> The heads on this product are small enough for me</li>
            <li> I suffered at the dentists office for years due to tarter build up and gum problems.  </li>
            <li> This flexcare has a snap-on brush with no space beneath for anything foreign to build up.</li>
            <li> And I usually forget to check this prior to brushing.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I&#x27;ve used like 3 other power brushes.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I hope it will last me a few years!</li>
            <li> This is a product I will continue to use and have recommended to other relatives and friends.</li>
            <li> Based on some other reviews, I am concerned this problem is not an isolated case</li>
            <li> It is basically a small and short beep every 30 seconds to signal you when you should switch brushing from one quadrant of your teeth to another.  </li>
            <li> I have owned Sonicare products in the past but for some reason or another went back to a manual brush for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, since I have never purchased a sonicare toothbrush before, but after using this product I&#x27;m a believer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care what anyone says about oral b or other electronic toothbruch products.</li>
            <li> Sort of like helping each other out.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush came sooner than I expected and was fully charged!  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product due to my sensitivity and receding gums.  </li>
            <li> You are notified by a stop of small pause in vibration to tell you to move on to the next area.</li>
            <li> EDIT: SCAM ALERT SONICARE HAS POSTED MAIL IN REBATE FORM FOR THIS BRUSH AND ALL OTHER MODELS</li>
            <li> she says you are not doing your job,which i tried my level best,but failed for years.this brush is my first one</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s been a wonder worker.</li>
            <li> the UV sanitizer stopped working, something that I recall seeing other reviewers comment about.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Sonicare models but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several toothbrushes in the past and none of them have cleaned my teeth like this Sonicare has.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually works, but I put my brush head in for a cleaning after every use.</li>
            <li> And, if you are a gross person like me who usually doesn&#x27;t like brushing, it will change your outlook.</li>
            <li> : This was my first expensive battery toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need the other stuff.</li>
            <li> And we don&#x27;t use the other features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One has the sanitizer attached to it, and the other one it for travel and does not come with a sanitizer.</li>
            <li> It comes with a regular-sized brush head and also a small brush head; I purchased additional brush heads, as I did not care for the smaller one and both my husband and I are using this model.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the extreme vibrations of the sonic-care system.  </li>
            <li> For something I spent 150 buck, I hope it works for longer than that!</li>
            <li> Contacted Philips and because it&#x27;s beyond the 2 year warranty, they&#x27;re not willing to do anything.  </li>
            <li> We were extremely careful with this brush (it&#x27;s almost $200 after all!), but it still broke.  </li>
            <li> All my other electric toothbrushes have lived for years and years.</li>
            <li> , I cannot express it any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price of this toothbrush is small compared to what you&#x27;d pay in dental bills later.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Sonic Care toothbrush over the past 13 years.  </li>
            <li> My sister had the same problem: the toothbrush started acting out and she finally had to get rid of it as it became useless.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush comes with one regular and one small brush head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Elite and Intelliclean and other brands of sonic toothbrushes</li>
            <li> comes with small travel charger in addition to standard charger</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve always used the traditional toothbrushes I buy in a bulk pack from Costco.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was a gift for my husband and days after his first use, his mouth broke out in canker sores.</li>
            <li> I picked the UV sanitizer model primarily due to curiosity.    </li>
            <li> Be aware that the replacement heads are rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> We had an other model and gave it up for the 900 series because of the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> This is the third sonicare toothbrush I have purchased in the past 8 or 9 years.</li>
            <li> The brushes look like they are durable too and don&#x27;t show signs of wear as other brands do soon after you start using them.</li>
            <li> I use to have issues where no matter how often I brushed and flossed my gums they were still not healthy.</li>
            <li> other websites.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, it has different settings so if you are lazy you can just set it to refresh..</li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush looks and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Afraid of other contamination or damage in the bathroom environment?  </li>
            <li> I eventually did and I think it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I used the Flexcare for 3 years before the seals broke on it and it died due to water in the case.</li>
            <li> I went to some consumer rating sites, and found that my problem was one expressed by literally hundreds of other customers.</li>
            <li> Possibly the electronics need to go the way of the dodo bird and Sonicare should stick with what worked so well in the past.</li>
            <li> There are several settings and one is for cleanings which is what I usually use, but I also used the one for gums.  </li>
            <li> As I read in other reviiews, the sonic vibrations on this toothbrush took some time to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned at the price, but when I googled it other online stores were selling it for $200+</li>
            <li> I called customer service and ended up speaking to someone in a foreign country.  </li>
            <li> I started out with Crest battery operated, tried some other brand I can&#x27;t remember and then this.</li>
            <li> I have bought this toothbrush 2 times and had it replaced once due to it breaking during the warranty period.  </li>
            <li> Other people have posted online about this problem.</li>
            <li> The unit failed within the first year but was replaced by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> If not then my complaint is that the handle should have lasted longer than barely out of warranty.  </li>
            <li> I had other powered tooth brushes but none even compare.</li>
            <li> And I have not changed anything other than my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> No thanks!  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;sonic vibration&#x27; has slowly reduced over time due to the loose shaft... finally, last week, the shaft stopped vibrating</li>
            <li> brush is no exception, with all the standard features of other models, but in a sleek new design that cuts down on some of the flashy lights, but not on the features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to be very careful in brushing these areas affected.</li>
            <li> It takes about 25 minutes to go through their chat support to get to the part where they agree it is broken and offer to send a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum, it works well, but replacing broken toothbrushes and buying new brush heads will run you around $200+ per year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Phillips replaced my broken tooth brush with a refurbished one or new one.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare sends a new handle, so if you have a broken one, under warranty, contact them.</li>
            <li> The brush heads appear to be almost identical, except the \\&quot;new\\&quot; heads have a very pale blue set of \\&quot;reminder\\&quot; bristles that are supposed to show generally when they need changing, but are hard to tell apart from the pale green \\&quot;normal\\&quot; bristles (on the standard heads)</li>
            <li> The brush heads appear to be almost identical, except the \\&quot;new\\&quot; heads have a very pale blue set of \\&quot;reminder\\&quot; bristles that are supposed to show generally when they need changing, but are hard to tell apart from the pale green \\&quot;normal\\&quot; bristles (on the standard heads)</li>
            <li> This brush is not as gentle as the elite even in sensitive mode, but it is not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected, this model improves on previous models.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was always skeptical of \\&quot;useless\\&quot; electronics such as juicers and electronic toothbrushes, but this Sonicare has completely changed my mind.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I was annoyed about, was the smaller brush it comes with.</li>
            <li> all soaking wet even though I carefully washed and dried the toothbrush off after each use.  </li>
            <li> When battery has run down down take a wide bladed flathead screwdiver to the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li> The first few uses left me with a face numb from the vibrations, but that&#x27;s no longer an issue after 4-5 days of use.    </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that spending $200 on a toothbrush would get you something that would last beyond the first six weeks - you&#x27;d be wrong, at least in this case.</li>
            <li> It is a bit awkward the first few times because you don&#x27;t actually \\&quot;brush\\&quot; with the sonicare</li>
            <li> The connection joint of the compact brush head became very loose after about 2 days of use and could not stay tightly on the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My only complaint which is a bit frustrating is the blue bristles, after three uses, starting fading.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after a few years the rubber on the handle has started to peel off and if you allow water droplets to dry on the inside of the sanitizer it will discolor the mirror coating.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Oral B Pro model but found the sound a bit annoying; reminded me of an tiny out-board motor.</li>
            <li> Unlike other power brushes this one will last at least 5 days without being recharged.  </li>
            <li> Not right.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare product was recommended by my oral hygienist as I was failing with conventional brushing.  </li>
            <li> The product is not very robust and I am loath to spend another $150 with a company that cares so little for its customer.  </li>
            <li> If you want to have that dentist clean feeling get this, if you hate that feeling keep brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird the first couple of times but you get used to the vibrating sensation.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting this model to get the toothbrush head UV cleaner, the hard travel case, and the gum cleaning mode, but I have to confess I have only used the gum cleaning mode once.  </li>
            <li> I have never purchased a power toothbrush until my dentist gave me a hard time during my last appointment.</li>
            <li> Too thorough, actually - my dentist saw some gum recession where I&#x27;d been brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Forth, set include 2 brush hears: standard and compact (for hard to reach areas).</li>
            <li> I had gum issues and this toothbrush not only helps me get to the hard to get places, but also messages my gums...</li>
            <li> However, if you find that your dentist or hygienist can sell you this unit for a hundred bucks, you might find it hard to beat that price a smaller unit.</li>
            <li> This version rectified those issues, such as the head of the handle had a hollow well that could get nasty if you didn&#x27;t clean it religiously every day with a sanitizing product.</li>
            <li> My only negative is that the settings on the toothbrush are too hard on my gums, so the only one I can use is the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> I honestly do not believe you can go wrong with this product and you will be hard pressed to find something better.  </li>
            <li> This particular model, is the Flaxcare+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UV Sanitizer: I cannot give a clinical evaluation of the sanitizer, however I can say ever since I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush with the sanitizer I haven&#x27;t been sick nearly as often.</li>
            <li> I can tell you the first time I used this bad boy i would say I would never go back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d feel better about that, except that I&#x27;ve read that the replacement ones are of no better quality (this isn&#x27;t a one off bad handle</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say about this toothbrush (</li>
            <li> This is very dissapointing given how expensive these brushes are.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely NOT worth the $140.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an average of over once per year.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who once thought that electric toothbrushes were a gimmick and were not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> What made me sad though was that the toothbrush is very prone to breaking.</li>
            <li> The first model I got failed after a few years, and after warranty, when the rubber over the button cracked.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing about this product -- the UV bulb sometimes won&#x27;t come on, so</li>
            <li> The dentist didn&#x27;t freak out and tell me my gums were about to rot, but I did have much worse scores than I expected, considering I am a generally well-kept 25-year-old woman.</li>
            <li> but this one stays much cleaner and all the weird gunk does not acumulate on the device.</li>
            <li> The second one is a small round baby brush?  </li>
            <li> It seems so expensive for a toothbrush, and I was hesitant to spend so much, but now that I have it</li>
            <li> , so it was definitely too late for Sonicare to rectify the situation.  </li>
            <li> Think about it - the average cost of a toothbrush is $1-2.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> This is just not worth it for a brush that will break.</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> For almost $200 for a toothbrush, not worth it.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The battery holds the charge for at least a week so it has been to several vacations with me.</li>
            <li> I currently am unable to think of any real downsides to the brush.</li>
            <li> cleaning and even took away a dark area on a recessed tooth.</li>
            <li> average</li>
            <li> It constantly loses its charge, even when left on the charger.</li>
            <li> Now, the one big complaint with resulted in the 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> Buy a second unit, or at least another handle.  </li>
            <li> Fedex is 20 minutes away for me, and not worth the gasoline to return it yet again.</li>
            <li> I wished that Philips kept offering a version without the UV Sanitizer since the recharging base is more compact without also including the UV Sanitizer unit on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made sure that the Plus does not have its ramp-up (on charger base, hold power-on button until one beep).</li>
            <li> If you hate going to the dentist but love how your teeth feel after having your teeth cleaned this tooth brush is for you.</li>
            <li> Either the button is located in a poor position, or the button is way too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> A feature that is not advertised, but should be, is the fact that you can keep the toothbrush on the charging base so that it constantly has a full charge without adversely effecting the battery.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on Consumer Reports and Amazon, I am confused about replacing my old e series Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It just had a bad bulb in it, but they are sending me a whole new base unit to swap out, free of charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one takes a little more precision, which isn&#x27;t difficult, but maybe not something for younger kids, those with poor eyesight or shaky</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact, hands down.</li>
            <li> I still waited for another month before I broke down and bought one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes down to a question of return on investment.</li>
            <li> but after using this toothbrush for just two weeks, my gums have come down</li>
            <li> I have had two SonicCare toothbrushes - in a bit of irony, one was given to me by a friend who was a dentist - and both broke down within a year.</li>
            <li> I changed my rating from 5 down to 4 stars</li>
            <li> Then the battery was totally down.</li>
            <li> 141 dollars down the drain</li>
            <li> Finally the toothbrush, base, every inch of the thing quickly fills every crack with dirt and grime.  </li>
            <li> and if it breaks down, whether Philips would send me another one or not.</li>
            <li> With the toothbrush off push down on the shaft until it pushes out the bottom.</li>
            <li> However, beware that the 2 year warranty does not cover the charger, which in my case broke down just 10 days before the end of the warranty.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to as I had been using an Oral B which rotates and this one goes up and down.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It could have came loose during shipping, but my parents initially thought the product was broken.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;After waiting a little over a month, in late January 2011, Philips sent me a replacement for the unit I described above.  </li>
            <li> I love the ultraviolet cleaner because it makes me feel like I&#x27;m not putting any bacteria back in my mouth, especially after I&#x27;ve been sick or had a cold.  </li>
            <li> it are very small, like half the side of my last Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended to preserve not only teeth, but also to minimize heart problems that may result due to bad teeth.</li>
            <li> Previously when I had seen the sonicare toothbrush in my Dennis office</li>
            <li> Two have died on me in less than a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I wrk out of the country half the year,</li>
            <li> with the previous model of the Sonicare FlexCare, I cannot verify the efficacy of the UV Brush Head Sanitizer to kill bacteria.  </li>
            <li> did notice that while the previous FlexCare model gave you the option to purchase the product *without* the UV Sanitizer ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and I can see my teeth getting slightly brighter and whiter.</li>
            <li> If you keep your face level or slightly tilted up.</li>
            <li> The previous model lasted 5 years - this one broke after 10 month...</li>
            <li> I got this unit less than 2 months and now the UV sanitizer is not working.  </li>
            <li> The newer brush heads are less wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My family has been using it for half a year already.</li>
            <li> Could you make an option that comes with two charge spots as well as brushes that would be less costly than purchasing two separate units?</li>
            <li> My previous model did not have the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Since then, Philips has made some slight improvements.</li>
            <li> knowing I have less germs on my toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll need all the settings on this one, get a cheaper one with less options.</li>
            <li> My previous lower end Sonicare brush(Elite Series) lasted over 5 years.</li>
            <li> less build-up.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I went back to my Oral-B that has served me well for the last six years.</li>
            <li> The previous design lasted me for years.  </li>
            <li> However, if I were to purchase again, I would choose the Sonicare Healthywhite for half the price or buy 2 of those instead of 1 of these.  </li>
            <li> My previous was an Oral B I had paid $60 for online, and it lasted me 5 years.</li>
            <li> You can get a Sonicare for much less than this.  </li>
            <li> it seemed to correct all of the things that bugged me about the previous generations.    </li>
            <li> you use a lot less toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive item to stop working in just 14 months, especially something this simple.</li>
            <li> My previous rechargable toothbrush from another company doesn&#x27;t come close to this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> it feels really odd and almost tickles.</li>
            <li> my teeth seem whiter and the brushing time is cut in half.</li>
            <li> It is alot less strain on your hand and arm using an electric toothbrush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This brush fixes previous design flaws of the Sonicare electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> He had his previous Sonicare for over 7 years.</li>
            <li> It quit working in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> bulb that sanitizes just stopped working in less than a month.</li>
            <li> The FlexCare Plus appears to be gentler than the previous model, but my teeth still get that dentist-clean</li>
            <li> It is too expensive to last only a year!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this unit on March 19, 2013, just slightly over a year and the unit will not turn on at all.</li>
            <li> but I spang for it after my previous ones.</li>
            <li> With the previous model I had to soak the brushes in hydrogen peroxide to sanitize them.  </li>
            <li> With the previous model I had to soak the brushes in hydrogen peroxide to sanitize them.  </li>
            <li> Plaque accumulation is reduced and the gums are stimulated and less prone to disease as well as prevent cavity.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is less than diligent with flossing, or if you have problems with staining in between dentist appointments.  </li>
            <li> I now find much less plaque when I floss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5/5 stars, except the UV sanitizer bulb burned out after less than a month of use.</li>
            <li> A user of the previous model [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> are worth the extra money over the base model.  </li>
            <li> Went for my dental checkup and the dental girl worker scraped my teeth less than I ever had.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be a slight design flaw with this model.  </li>
            <li> Has anyone else noticed this company has reduced the size of replacement heads by half.</li>
            <li> I called the company and they sent 2 replacement heads half the size of the previous brushes.</li>
            <li> After less than a year &amp; 5 months, it quit working.</li>
            <li> submitted reviews are subject to the terms set forth in our Terms of Use</li>
            <li> One less cord for electronics that I have to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended this, and since I have been using it I have had much less plaque when I go for my annual visit.</li>
            <li> My problem is that the battery on the toothbrush itself stopped holding a charge after less than three months of use.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I had an Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It has been less than 6 mos and the motor has gone on this one now too.  </li>
            <li> I bought it when my previous one lost the ability to take a charge to the battery.  </li>
            <li> Black mildew and juck inside the brush part,</li>
            <li> It worked that way for a year and a half</li>
            <li> Takes up less space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> As you get accustomed to the toothbrush this happens less and less.</li>
            <li> Is there a way to get that money back because that&#x27;s just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> i had this for LESS than a year</li>
            <li> This was my third Sonicare in approx 9 years - unfortunately they all die the same way - they just stop charging JUST after the warranty is up</li>
            <li> We chose these as the brush heads wouldn&#x27;t be sitting out collecting germs and other stiff.</li>
            <li> At the high cost of the toothbrush itself and the expensive replacement heads...I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
            <li> Other than initial cost being tough for those of us who&#x27;ve never gone this route before, I can&#x27;t think of any reason not to recommend it to everyone...</li>
            <li> Wait times were excessively long (eg, at least 5 mins per attempt).  </li>
            <li> They got my email address wrong, I missed a number of emails sent to the wrong address and can not get them sent back to me again with the right email address now.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are a small enough size to maneuver around inside my mouth &amp; get all the hard to reach</li>
            <li> Does not clean between teeth.  </li>
            <li> I had before, it does not clean as well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s expensive considering they don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that the Flexcare+ has a serious design defect that leads to this early failure.</li>
            <li> The last few years I had become a sole caregiver for my ill mother and had neglected my own health terribly.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but</li>
            <li> The sonic part takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> However, now, suddenly, the vibrations are so slowed and weak that I might as well be using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to me that this unit pulses a little faster, yet it is also quieter while running.  </li>
            <li> Progressively builds in speed and pressure to allow your gums to to adjust to the vibration and pressure resulting in little to no gum bleeding.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It took to write this little rhyme</li>
            <li> This broke after little over a year.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush stopped working a little after the 2 year warranty period</li>
            <li> The replacement heads could be a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get used to the feel of the bristles/ vibration but</li>
            <li> those that have never used a Sonicare toothbrush before, it does take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever use anything other than the cleaning mode).</li>
            <li> It takes a little to get adjusted to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cons are, the brush heads refills are pricey, and I&#x27;ve found the storage space gets a little gunky and needs to be scrubbed out every week or so, despite the UV disinfecting</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I had my toothbrush a little over a year.</li>
            <li> The various types of handle failure include: no longer accepting a charge, randomly turn on by itself, and will no longer oscillate due to internal mechanism breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery Life: In terms of battery life, the previous models would last approximately 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The base still works fine, and I&#x27;m still a fan.</li>
            <li> After another month we got the base unit and it worked fine for about 2 months.  </li>
            <li> The newer models have the Li-ion which is supposed to mean that the brush will run longer on a single charge, and won&#x27;t develop a memory by leaving it on the charging stand.</li>
            <li> The newer models have the Li-ion which is supposed to mean that the brush will run longer on a single charge, and won&#x27;t develop a memory by leaving it on the charging stand.</li>
            <li> One drop onto hard tile, too much pressure applied the wrong way in your luggage and bam.</li>
            <li> I still have a hard time using it and not drooling like an idiot, but I&#x27;ll get the hang of it soon, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> this brush lasted us a little less than 4 months!</li>
            <li> Finally giving up and buying an Oral B.   Not only is replacing the handle expensive, it is increasingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li> i was unhappy, because i had to settle for a lesser toothbrush from a local store.</li>
            <li> I like the antibacterial chamber especially now that cold and flu season are approaching.  </li>
            <li> It would go off by itself when it sat on the base, it wouldn&#x27;t brush when we needed it to, and it just all around became a huge nuisance.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about this product except that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a few years now.</li>
            <li> But there are a few differences between</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is also a few changes in what the battery display shows with its charge</li>
            <li> The brush head is firmly placed on the toothbrush itself.  </li>
            <li> I choose it for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks I could feel my gums improving.  </li>
            <li> I have a throat problem and brushing my teeth can cause me trouble.  </li>
            <li> Plus there is a UV light in the base for sanitizing the brush heads.</li>
            <li> a few years ago.</li>
            <li> So trapped water *inside*</li>
            <li> So trapped water *inside*</li>
            <li> I just had it for a few days</li>
            <li> I had read that sometimes it takes the gums a few weeks to get used to the electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> gradually it did not charge, it did not vibrate, it became a heavy piece of junk  :</li>
            <li> Somehow I managed to tear the rubber on the green start button so water seaped in.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, here i sit with yet another broken handle, my FOURTH replacement in a year, and my warranty has expired.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few uses to get use to how it works</li>
            <li> The Flexcare Plus is dead and I am about to contact Philips for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Completely dead.</li>
            <li> The price is not justified.</li>
            <li> Everyday my teeth feel</li>
            <li> I will see how the results are when I visit the dentist again in a few months.</li>
            <li> &quot; will come flying out, so it is a bit messy when you use this.    </li>
            <li> I had used an Oral-B for years and didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing.</li>
            <li> So, to sum it up, they sent me a defective model to replace the dead one and ended going through 2 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally a waste of money ($50/month) for a toothbrush like this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s $140 wasted.</li>
            <li> The charging/sanitizing base is stable and hassle free to use.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble of having to deal with Philips customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waiting to hear what warranty says, as this was not a cheap investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few Sonic electronic toothbrushes years ago.  </li>
            <li> is just wasted money.  </li>
            <li> even I use cautiously everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brush.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now - and using Sonicare for even longer.  </li>
            <li> this toothbrush will have you feeling like you went to the dentist for a cleaning everyday.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;ProResults\\&quot; label rubs off on my toothbrush after I pull the toothbrush on and off a few dozen times.</li>
            <li> but after a few days that sensation passed.</li>
            <li> Big props to Philips for standing behind this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Hopefully, this defective one is just a few fluke.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a few helpful features that I do use.  </li>
            <li> use the head cleaner every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> After almost 3 years of use my toothbrush is dead and out of warranty.</li>
            <li> go round.</li>
            <li> (I even dropped it a few time on tile floor)</li>
            <li> I told her about the only change, she brought the dentist in, and we all marveled about my gum health, decreased sensitivity, lack of plaque, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was the handle, not the base unit with the UltraViolet light</li>
            <li> Run the brush a few seconds in a half-cap of antiseptic mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> But for now, buy something else and don&#x27;t waste your money on this item until they fix the quality &amp; reliability issues.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t waste your money on the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> Bulbs are not readily available, and there&#x27;s no guarantee that the bulb was the problem since the filament appears to be intact.  </li>
            <li> thing is not cheap, but it does all I want from a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have been using electric toothbrushes for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> We bought this on recommendation from whirlpool, but these toothbrushes were not available in Australia.</li>
            <li> It truly does feel as though you have been to the dentist for cleaning after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It would stay on for two minutes, turn off for a few minutes and then start up again.</li>
            <li> Today it started up again and it would stop for a few seconds, but then restart again.</li>
            <li> The lights behind the different modes started to fade and eventually die, then when I pressed the power button on morning the toothbrush was just dead.</li>
            <li> but the shaft has started to wobble loose and the lightweight seal around it has broken - don&#x27;t know if it broke because of the extreme wobble or what.  </li>
            <li> and she was not able to find the Fedex tracking number because system down.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item in January 2012 and in May 2013 I picked it up to brush my teeth this morning when I was shocked to see that the toothbrush had melted just to the right of the power button.</li>
            <li> Prefer a less plasticky one!</li>
            <li> less gum receding and improved plaque and stain removal!</li>
            <li> It is hard to use other tooth brushes once you get used to the cleanness Philips Sonicare provides.</li>
            <li> Plus because of gum erosion due to my brushing my teeth too hard (and because my boss recommended hers).  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, he was not willing to try it again to find out, so I had to send it back.    </li>
            <li> week later, my brush doesn&#x27;t charge anymore; and it&#x27;s dead completely.  :(</li>
            <li> Seems to be a common problem according to other reviews.</li>
            <li> Not good enough--they couldn&#x27;t keep the date and store but expected me to keep this little slip of paper.</li>
            <li> Sadly, less than a year, I mean months short of being a year, this thing started acting crazy buggy.</li>
            <li> Even without keeping it on the charging base, the battery life is very long, lasting around 3 weeks with moderate (twice a day) usage.     </li>
            <li> If you use the flexcare before, I strongly NOT recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I know I never had such dramatic results ever using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tooth brushes are still not easily removed, my wife has to use a metal gizmo to pry hers off, but they are a bit easier to remove for me.</li>
            <li> purchased three different model Sonicares over the past 7 years, approximately.</li>
            <li> The bristle&#x27;s are still a little too hard and the vibrations are still too hard as well, so can I recommend this, not really.</li>
            <li> This is not the case for all brands, and if they are not sealed it&#x27;s very easy for water to get inside and start growing nasty things.</li>
            <li> I think I may have gone a little overboard purchasing this model though.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a little lazy</li>
            <li> The UV cleaning feature failed after less than 6 months and their desire to get you to buy brushes after a relatively short usage strikes me as strictly an attempt to generate money.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the first one I got</li>
            <li> Replaced a very inexpensive &#x27;vibrator&#x27; type brush with very difficult to replace heads with this technology on the recommendation of my dental hygenist.</li>
            <li> because the past few days it had been extra-loud when i turned it on.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave mine off the charger unless the battery is dead and do any charging/sanitizing during the day when I&#x27;m not trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> They are full of crap, don&#x27;t want to admit the problem with the unit.</li>
            <li> I am very mad about the price cut of but with this new low price</li>
            <li> have a really sensitive (ticklish) upper lip, so at first this thing was AWFUL difficult to use because of the tickling, but after a couple weeks I got over it</li>
            <li> Not worth it!!</li>
            <li> Note: the first few times we used this thing it tickled so bad it was hard to use</li>
            <li> (bad thing about the elite was inside the handle where inserted the toothbrush, mildew would build up and was very hard to bleach and keep clean.)</li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed to find out that unlike the Elite, handle on the FlexCare is not dishwasher safe.</li>
            <li> At the beginning it was a little hard to get used to it since it vibrates a lot, but after a week you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that my previous Sonicare brush lasted only three years, but $220 for an electronic tooth brush that lasts barely longer than one year is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> It worked well initially, but in less than 2 years the base of the brush where it charges became yellow; the rubber that seals the device/battery was torn and as a result, the brush started to malfunction.</li>
            <li> Would I recommend this model, probably not, but I would definitely recommend a model with less settings and a larger base.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to clean the base of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Usually I would have a little plaque in those hard to reach places, but now it was practically all gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve adjusted since, but the sensation was very awkward the first few times.</li>
            <li> Takes up very little space at all.  </li>
            <li> usually keep mine on the Gum Care setting.</li>
            <li> some small amount of toothpaste and/or saliva will splatter while using it: I had to mop up a dozen or so spots of toothpaste from my bathroom mirror (and once a shirt)</li>
            <li> Inadmissible for such an expensive item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been sitting in the charger for the past 6 hours and no lights are coming on  Sally:</li>
            <li> The last toothbrush, the Sonicare Elite has the highly distasteful tendency to get</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t find anything other than a weak abstract on the Philips site.</li>
            <li> Before i started using the Sonicare, the dental hygienist used to have to do a lot of plaque scraping, but no more.     </li>
            <li> (not sure about the longevity of the battery</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!    </li>
            <li> sometimes newer is NOT better.  </li>
            <li> sometimes newer is NOT better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about whitening claims.</li>
            <li> I bought my brush in March 2011 and it suddenly stopped working randomly in September 2013.</li>
            <li> I have always been somewhat lazy about tooth care.</li>
            <li> for the UV Sanitizer, I am not able to do a scientific test of whether or not it provides added benefit.  </li>
            <li> This has do with the way the head attaches, instead of screwing on with a threaded skirt, they push onto a small peg.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest SpinBrush for the past couple of years and just switched to the Sonicare FlexCare+ with UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> As usual Amazon comes through with what they promised.</li>
            <li> Have had the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus H6972/10 Rechargeable Toothbrush for the past month.  </li>
            <li> and I was just not satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Contacted Amazon, and since it was past 30 days since my purchase, they referred me to Philips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric tootbrushes in the past.</li>
            <li> brush in the past.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $150!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So paying extra for a sanitizer that is useless after the bulb burns out</li>
            <li> It even allows you to brush a few times and it slowly gets stronger to allow you to adjust.</li>
            <li> The reason for the four stars instead of five is a small matter</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to toss it out (via e-waste disposer) because of the mold on the handle and the low battery life.    </li>
            <li> Initially, I was hesistant buying this product since it was expensive...</li>
            <li> If you look where the shaft attaches to the handle,there is a small screw holding a 1/4 square bracket to the lower part of the shaft.</li>
            <li> Using a small philips head screwdriver,(a jewelers</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re obsessed with oral hygiene you can get your fix in multiple ways&lt;</li>
            <li> While it lasted quite a while, I&#x27;m not sure I would buy again.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I should let it sit on the charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You click the button, it makes a small noise and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> It died a noisy death last night, randomly turning on in the middle of the night and disturbing family and pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend buying a low-end model that has fewer functions for this reason - fewer things to break.</li>
            <li> Attempts to turn it back on per the doc failed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just a small thing, what electric toothbrush to get.  </li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended a Sonicare toothbrush for my past two routine visits.  </li>
            <li> The only con is that the brush heads are expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> My wife has used Philips Sonicare in the past and had encouraged me to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that my dental visits have been only downhill since then.</li>
            <li> The secondary one was not far behind.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s still expensive for a toothbrush, I&#x27;m hoping this will last me a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive to replace and so are the brushes of which now I have extra that I can not use.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied and will contact amazon and phillips in attempt to get what I paid for and not this malfunctioning stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> Hey, fellas, its ROUND!</li>
            <li> must have if you&#x27;re too lazy to go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I hope the replacement lasts a few years!</li>
            <li> Scary too when I&#x27;m sleeping and all of a sudden the toothbrush starts buzzing and there is no way to turn it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been advised by dentists that I brush too hard, but with this brush my teeth feel clean without pressing hard, so no more destroyed brushes and bloody gums.</li>
            <li> I typically think of things like UV sanitizers as unnecessary and gimmicky, but it at lease appears to be doing something.</li>
            <li> The cumbersome nature of the product was such that I concluded that my wife who is blind would find it frustrating in the extreme.</li>
            <li> The new brush heads are less likely to accumulate grim.</li>
            <li> Was out of the office in less than 20 minutes!!  </li>
            <li> I had to buy another large one for myself and then just leave the small one in a drawer somewhere to never be used. :(</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended that I get an electric toothbrush (not this one specifically), but I saw this product and read the reviews and found it much less expensive on Amazon than other places</li>
            <li> There is a warning label on the product, and my bad during research, if I had caught that before hand I would not have bought this particular model.</li>
            <li> On the older E-series Sonicare brushes, the screw on heads would become absolutely filthy and black with toothpaste residue and who knows what else.  </li>
            <li> Previous models would fill up with disgusting junk, while this one stays clean</li>
            <li> Toothbrush died, switch is defective, 6 months after warranty expired, guess Phillips knows how long to make their products last. :-(</li>
            <li> They apologized and gave me a return address to send the toothbrush handle back and explained that they were currently out of stock on the base unit.</li>
            <li> Since this one has a different design with no open space dome at the base</li>
            <li> Literally it whitened my teeth over time, reduced the plaque that had built up from poor prior brushing/ flossing, and when used in conjunction with the waterpik water flosser took years of poor dental hygiene off of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not very good unit died already</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing - for the $$ the brush handle should last at least a few years, not one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I chatted with Philips and after long series of rather tiresome questions they promised a replacement.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you are a poor or even average brusher.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t grip the shaft or even the brush at the base of the bristles where it is wider and pull it off with thumb and forefinger, it takes the whole hand!  </li>
            <li> I have long been wary of electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]]), for their newer FlexCare Plus model, there is no option to purchase a version that lacks the UV Sanitizer (which, as with the previous FlexCare model, would also make it less expensive).  </li>
            <li> too)&lt;br /&gt;-large base, if bathroom counter space is at a premium, you will end up ditching the uv base and using the smaller travel base, negating one of the best features</li>
            <li> All of them agreed that a sterilizer was unnecessary for home use but half of them used one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its nearly impossible to explain the sensation of the Sonicare, but it truly cannot compare it to my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare lasted 11 years and I only got rid of it then because I didn&#x27;t like how it got black mold in the toothbrush base.</li>
            <li> It took some time to get used to using it without making a spit mess and it tickled my behind teeth.</li>
            <li> We travel at different times and it&#x27;s difficult to share a single base and single toothbrush, even though you can change the head on it.</li>
            <li> (I would consider myself a hard brusher).</li>
            <li> (I would consider myself a hard brusher).</li>
            <li> with all electric toothbrushes, you should not push and press the toothbrush too hard into your teeth and gums, both to keep from damaging the tooth enamel and gums and also to help the motor not work so hard.  </li>
            <li> with all electric toothbrushes, you should not push and press the toothbrush too hard into your teeth and gums, both to keep from damaging the tooth enamel and gums and also to help the motor not work so hard.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to to help prevent gum recession from brushing to hard.</li>
            <li> I must brush my teeth too hard, so this helps me not do that.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to use the traveling kit, but looking at it, it&#x27;s a hard plastic shell that can hold your tooth brush as well as a travel charger.  </li>
            <li> Anyhoo, I was probably being unnecessarily hard on the thing, having a \\&quot;brutal\\&quot; history with toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> but it would be hard to imagine.  </li>
            <li> I like the hard case that comes with the unit too.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I brush too hard for my gums.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush comes with 2 ProResults brush heads, the UV Brush Head Sanitizer, 1 travel charger, 2 hygienic travel caps, and 1 hard travel case.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit bulky making it hard to handle sometimes.  </li>
            <li> but I hardly ever used it.</li>
            <li> I like the hard travel case, too, and the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Maybe I brush my teeth too hard?</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m hard on them.</li>
            <li> However, if you find that your dentist or hygienist can sell you this unit for a hundred bucks, you might find it hard to beat that price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time making it work.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product for me because I have an issue with receding gums because I brush too hard.</li>
            <li> The brush pauses if you press too hard, and hence, helps avoid ruining the enamel on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Which also makes it slip around and around in your hand while brushing your teeth, resulting in the hard plastic side of the brush \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; my $27,000 porcelain caps.</li>
            <li> I like the sanitizer built into the charger and the hard traveling case that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Sonicare FlexCare Plus to anyone thinking of purchasing it; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had been brushing too hard and pushing my gum line away from my teeth when my dentist recommended looking at rechargeable options to slow the damage I was doing.  </li>
            <li> Used this product and like it so far, however the build quality is too bad</li>
            <li> If your like me and wanted to know at least some of this, it should help you decide between the two.  </li>
            <li> the least, putting the brush head in the sterilizer is easier than using boiling water or bleach water.  </li>
            <li> At the least, putting the brush head in the sterilizer is easier than using boiling water or bleach water.  </li>
            <li> When it went bad we hated to use a manual brush and decided to purchase this brush since it had good reviews.</li>
            <li> At least within warranty.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the brush heads that came with</li>
            <li> It just sucks when it costs $30</li>
            <li> All told, the difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t is so drastic that I will take the time to brush my teeth even if I overslept and am late to work, no excuses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like, at least until it breaks again.    </li>
            <li> Negative 10000 stars....</li>
            <li> I would expect something sold at this price would lasted for at least 3 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get scum that builds up.</li>
            <li> never have to take charger on trips because it lasts at least three weeks.</li>
            <li> It was confusing when the picture on the box shows the 5 brushing mode</li>
            <li> a lot of others leaving negative reviews, I&#x27;m a long-time Sonicare user.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get at least 5 years out of the handle.</li>
            <li> My dental tech complained about my tea stained teeth during my 2X a year cleanings, even tho</li>
            <li> It helps me remember to brush for at least two minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was told by the receptionist that was a common complaint from the patients who purchased it.</li>
            <li> After failing to visit the dentist for over three years, I was afraid to finally go in for my checkup and x-rays.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a common problem now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Included in the box is the sonic toothbrush, 2 heads (one normal sized and one small one), a charging base with an ionic sanitizer, a travel charger, and a carrying case that holds the toothbrush and 2 heads.</li>
            <li> Just work slow on the under-side of teeth not to hit teeth.</li>
            <li> For those who have not been use to an electric brush, it will break you in slowly so your gums will not be sore.  </li>
            <li> Slowly push in until it clicks into place.</li>
            <li> I hate the whole idea</li>
            <li> I literally feel as if the sonic vibrations shake the plaque off my teeth, if you floss after using the toothbrush you&#x27;d understand what I mean.</li>
            <li> I am sad that I had lost it and probably would buy and up-to-date version of this brand or other brand that makes electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> i mean BORROW it to use for himself.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been debating on whether to buy this toothbrush or not, I would definitely recommend purchasing it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> If anyone is having concerns or doubts and are not sure what to buy, just go with this one!</li>
            <li> I am not sure!    </li>
            <li> I mean, come on.</li>
            <li> It had the ghost behavior that some of the other reviewers have described, meaning that it would turn itself on while on the charger at random times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 2 weeks and all I can say is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> but I assure you no damage is done, but that doesn&#x27;t mean make a habit of it.</li>
            <li> Sadly it has been cast aside and now resides somewhere under our sink for the past few years.</li>
            <li> That issue with the Elite version was a design failure in my mind.    </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be realistic, bathrooms are filthy places.  </li>
            <li> , I have to wonder if failure is part of their business model.</li>
            <li> Like other commentators I have found the construction of this unit to be of very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> very uncomfortable initial use</li>
            <li> While some may feel that after two years, products stop -- this was an expensive toothbrush and average cost was $80 year based upon two year run-rate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly disappointing that it has zero long term reliability.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to keep toothpaste and salave from running down your chin.  </li>
            <li> They are shipping me a new base unit.  </li>
            <li> New toothbrush design reduces mold build-up at the base of the brush stem (part where it connects to the handle).</li>
            <li> Hate it now that I have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The difference is also subtle between Clean/Refresh and Gum Care.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a simple no brain er to me but mission impossible to Phillips/Norellco.</li>
            <li> I had been using another less expensive electric toothbrush for a number of years.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used the previous generations until i literally got bored and bought a newer generation or the rubber on/off button</li>
            <li> After less than a year this one has failed too.</li>
            <li> model was recommended and sold by our dentist but Amazon was less expensive.</li>
            <li> $50 a year for a toothbrush is ridiculous if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier for them to change brush heads, and it&#x27;s simpler and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering how bad and slow customer service was last time.</li>
            <li> The less expensive Sonicare models are just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D; included hard case for travel.. to compensate for weak point in the neck&lt;</li>
            <li> I have a history of terrible problems with my teeth and this has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B is gentler and easier to use (difficult to use improperly), but tends to develop mess on the exterior and interior and is not as robust as the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> But then, after less that one month post purchase, we went on vacation for a month, leaving the base unit behind, taking only the travel charger with us.  </li>
            <li> I have never had an electronic toothbrush before and was a little leary of ordering one so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have had my sonicare for a little over a month now and nothing seems to be wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this toothbrush even though it is a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> This may be a little on the expensive side</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side</li>
            <li> Like any device that requires consumables (think water filters in refrigerators with ice makers), the supplies are expensive and you have little choice but to buy from the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> than that, the BUILD quality is just simply too BAD to justify the price, i am SAD&lt;</li>
            <li> initially I thought it was bad luck</li>
            <li> There is simply nothing bad to be said about this brush.</li>
            <li> I asked him if this was just a bad batch of toothbrushes and did the current ones have this problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Some sport messy toothpaste dispensers (Intelliclean) or difficult to reach pit (Elite).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No good on anything.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a complete piece of crap.</li>
            <li> One problem we both have--the on/off button is in a place where we frequently hit it by accident which is annoying.</li>
            <li> There is a small gap between the brush head and the base that gets a lot of gross gunk in it.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if it lost charge from being left off the base the night before.  </li>
            <li> Wish it came with a small travel charger because the base is too big to travel with.</li>
            <li> The base on my old one quit but the handle still works so I am still using it....</li>
            <li> The second minor thing is the cost of the replacement brushes, insane.</li>
            <li> If you put the brush on the base even a little wet</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous and almost criminal.</li>
            <li> (Duh!).</li>
            <li> That brush was used only by me and carefully but the part that vibrates eventually gets lose and starts to make horrible noises and it gets worse from here...</li>
            <li> I was not sure what went wrong.</li>
            <li> You have to take off the brush head and rinse daily to make sure that this doesn&#x27;t turn into something nasty (worst case: mold) inside your toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;OK, now that we have resolved the issue of a weak handle, as well as uv bulb burn-out issues others have reported, one may ask \\&quot;if we are not going to use the sanitizer, why pay for it?  </li>
            <li> Without fail for the past three years I&#x27;ve had to replace this after a year.  </li>
            <li> kicking my self is that a month later i found this WAY cheaper at Costco :(</li>
            <li> It makes it much less awkward when moving the brush along your teeth...</li>
            <li> One day it randomly started making very loud, annoying noises.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s the VERY slow mail over the Holidays?</li>
            <li> ...see what I mean by options!  </li>
            <li> I have troubled gums that get inflamed, red and painful if neglected even for one day.</li>
            <li> recognize that a number of reviewers have commented that sanitizers are unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> However the sanitizer and brush storage area were unnecessary and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> I got a replacement from Philips but its broken now as well.</li>
            <li> Sonicare comes with a nifty travel kit--a holder for the base and both brushes, and a separate, smaller \\&quot;travel charger\\&quot; (without the sanitizer unit).  </li>
            <li> -  three suffered from a broken shaft where you could still hear the unit buzz, but the shaft/toothbrush itself no longer vibrate.  </li>
            <li> It is now March 28, and I still have nothing but my broken toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I want to let people know about the poor company Philips is.</li>
            <li> , I remember hearing my brothers old sonic care version, and hated the noise it made, on this one you don&#x27;t notice it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a poorly made product if it can&#x27;t withstand brushing twice a day.</li>
            <li> Poor design AND poor manufacturing.</li>
            <li> the parts were there, travel case and base and extra head&lt;br /&gt;been</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a bit confused about the difference between the NiCad battery and the Li-ion battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a bit confused about the difference between the NiCad battery and the Li-ion battery.</li>
            <li> This product might work well at the beginning but the handle unit has a problem that the company will not stand behind nor fix....</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it broken again...</li>
            <li> but what I found in the box is Only the brushhandle without the charge base unit with UV Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> the charger unit and the Rep told me that Warranty Policy only covers brush but not the base charger which I should call retailer namely Amazon.com for replacement then hung up on me.</li>
            <li> The UV brush sterilizer is built into the brush&#x27;s base rather than being an independent unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;OK, this is nit-picking, but I miss the tabs that allowed me to open the base to roll the cord for storage.  </li>
            <li> It died approximately 2 months after the expiration of the warranty.  </li>
            <li> Dentist is not happy - no funds to put kids through collage</li>
            <li> There are numerous design flaws including:  The base unit door will stop working.  </li>
            <li> a brush this expensive, you would expect it to, at least, be reliable.  </li>
            <li> Ghostbusters\\&quot; but then I realized my tooth brush had just broken again.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of lugging all the stuff around</li>
            <li> Not great.  </li>
            <li> I have also changed the base and plugged it into different outlets.</li>
            <li> A seal must have broken - water drops showed in the charging bar and it stopped working ..</li>
            <li> And so, our $150 toothbrush ends with a 50 cent broken piece of metal.</li>
            <li> It has been pooping out lately and when I changed the brush head this morning, it failed to work.  </li>
            <li> so why pay 2X for a Sonicare and then have to put up with lame, rude customer service?</li>
            <li> I was a bit annoyed at this point, but it still worked.</li>
            <li> Since I have purchased this toothbrush, the gum recession has not gotten any worse, and my gums are not sore anymore.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, I mean, $100+ for a toothbrush?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for other options to replace the one going bad.  </li>
            <li> this toothbrush is not becoming as dirty as others.</li>
            <li> the base is flat.</li>
            <li> This is beyond ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try the small one</li>
            <li> In the past, if I had a cold, I always felt the need to change my brush head</li>
            <li> I thought I should upgrade since black mold is bad.</li>
            <li> There are some suggestions that I would make to Philips if they are listening: We had to purchase two of these rather expensive models because there is only one charge spot on the base</li>
            <li> They then offered me a pathetic 15% off coupon (only works with their store) and were frankly rather rude.  </li>
            <li> One day the vibration got so weak it&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> Yes, and if I knew I wouldn&#x27;t have that slight disappointment!  </li>
            <li> I thought it was just another way to sell you an expensive upgraded toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Boy I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but this is a questionable blessing as you may be prone to accidentally push these buttons while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m doing anything wrong...</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m really sorry about the inconvenience</li>
            <li> Sally: Unfortunately, our Toothbrushes are not repairable.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m sorry about that..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to say if the sanitizer works</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong here.  </li>
            <li> (And, hopefully, eliminates throwing away those expensive brush replacements every time you&#x27;ve got the</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend the amount of money I considered expensive for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My hands have arthritis and don&#x27;t provide the ability to get to the difficult areas of the mouth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here --it</li>
            <li> sorry, I need to run, I have a dental</li>
            <li> Expensive, yes, but how valuable are your teeth??</li>
            <li> Rather expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I need to protect that work and prevent having to go through it again.</li>
            <li> Now I have a rather expensive, unrecyclable</li>
            <li> To change these brush heads every month is a bit too expensive for me to keep up with.  </li>
            <li> WTF?  </li>
            <li> Their assistance (if you could call it that) was disappointing and frustrating.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t abuse the toothbrushes or use them for anything weird.  </li>
            <li> Even Gum message is useless.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive for a toothbrush</li>
            <li> WTF?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> I purchased it when it was on sale at $109 dollars, so if its too expensive wait for price drop.     </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they just don&#x27;t seem that well made, and the support is problematic.     </li>
            <li> To attempt to not make an already-long review even longer, I am now obsessed with brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to using it!</li>
            <li> this feels like its also flossing your teeth, I might be wrong though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be wary of the product for this reason.  </li>
            <li> brush handle wore out in 1.5 years!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty expensive for the time it lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brush replacements are rediculously expensive.</li>
            <li> Expensive brush heads compared to Oral b.    4.</li>
            <li> Also it seemed expensive for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Yea its kinda expensive</li>
            <li> This product is of poor quality!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this unit completely failed (mechanically-seems the motor just &#x27;gave out&#x27;)-after aprox 3yrs.</li>
            <li> If felt clunky inside my mouth, and the vibrating felt almost useless.</li>
            <li> Started going off randomly then just died.</li>
            <li> It is highly unlikely I would ever buy a Philips brand Sonicare ever again.  </li>
            <li> Get the cheapest unit that does the job you want and expect it to fail within a year.  </li>
            <li> If you buy it, be forewarned that it will fail.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> Then began to make a weird noise and</li>
            <li> With repeated use; one gets used to that uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> all three cases, the item was unable to power on, and no response to the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an expensive manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It has oscillating and back-and-forth movement to work well at disturbing biofilm in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of expensive trips to the dentist for cleaning, I decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li> If not for the lousy shipping method the brush gets 5 stars</li>
            <li> I have no problem hearing it but for someone who has hearing that is not quite that keen anymore, it is truly difficult to hear the beep.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I was disgusted when I found mold growing on the inside of the handle; despite cleaning, the mold kept coming back.</li>
            <li> then I asked for supervisor again then talked with Kay who found that my name was wrongly spelt as Tolson instead of Thompson</li>
            <li> The beauty is, even if it fails you can return to the manufacturer for a replacements.  </li>
            <li> Weird.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to feel a lot of difference with the toothbrush in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is useless to me because I don&#x27;t believe anyone shares their toothbrushes these days.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a reg toothbrush sometimes since the Elite had some blind spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried using the travel base and the old toothbrush&#x27;s base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable failed after about three years and Philips ceased making a 240 voltage version.  </li>
            <li> The reliability of this product is laughable.</li>
            <li> Looks like the problem is not with all the units but with some random ones.</li>
            <li> so I suspect are useless for that purpose; just change the brush when the head looks worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I suspect are useless for that purpose; just change the brush when the head looks worn.  </li>
            <li> that can be tossed when they eventually fail.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these Philips and both times has failed sooner than I would like.  </li>
            <li> downside is that the brushes are stupidly expensive.</li>
            <li> recommendation was from this skeptical hygienist, and I was reluctant to spend the money.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> We have since been using a boring regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But after 13 months it started randomly turning on all on</li>
            <li> There is something wrong with this design and the handle</li>
            <li> u can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are way to expensive.  </li>
            <li> I used to just manually brush my teeth but this toothbrush was recommended by my dentist and since i am obsessed with my teeth</li>
            <li> I think if you&#x27;re going to spend money on an expensive toothbrush like this, you might as well go all the way.</li>
            <li> I took it apart and discovered there&#x27;s a shaft inside which fractured, rendering the device useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it just failed again and is out of warranty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep it until it fails</li>
            <li> what an expensive piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> Cons:  expensive -</li>
            <li> Took another 5 months of complicated phone calls and backordering to get a replacement which still didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have had three of these brushes stop working on me; the brush would not engage in the handle resulting in a useless brush.</li>
            <li> (also included are a few interchangeable brush base rings that allow you to differentiate whose brush is whose.)</li>
            <li> items are too expensive and the replacement heads ridiculously expensive.  </li>
            <li> It was weird and very frustrating.</li>
            <li> In the end, the product was very poor and the customer service was too...</li>
            <li> This has been very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> However this one, the hx6892/10, has very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> The OEM attachments are very expensive and usually of poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Simply plug in the base sanitizer/charging unit combo and place the base handle on the peg to begin charging.  </li>
            <li> I also like the hard travel case, as it holds 2 heads with the base.  </li>
            <li> Philips stepped up on the FlexCare Plus and added a hard plastic case that holds the base unit and two brush heads.  </li>
            <li> this is expensive piece of equipment ,very expensive</li>
            <li> so I am out a little over $150 on this terrible toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t fix my one tooth that is badly cracked and will probably need a root canal, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Be prepared for irst time use---it will tickle like crazy.</li>
            <li> Customer service stinks.  </li>
            <li> It also felt awkward.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to become some crazy germophobe.  </li>
            <li> However,  the shape of the brush is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> she is so unhappy.  </li>
            <li> a cold?</li>
            <li> I look at it like the \\&quot;chicken soup\\&quot; argument -</li>
            <li> and I guess the glass cup it sits in can get dirty.  </li>
            <li> Also, the base is rather small and you need to place it in a manner where you will not continue knocking the brush off the base.  </li>
            <li> sorry, I need to run, I have a dental appointment!</li>
            <li> For the price, it is of extremely poor quality!!  </li>
            <li> how can you even think this is an expensive piece of equipment...honestly!  </li>
            <li> The feeling was an unpleasant tickling feeling, but after about one week, it no longer bothered me.  </li>
            <li> I was very sad when it died.  </li>
            <li> Finding a replacement is very difficult.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very expensive</li>
            <li> but it should at least not be disgusting.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are very expensive though.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to take the brush off the shaft.  </li>
            <li> Someone with arthritis would find it impossible.  </li>
            <li> I feel bad not having it all these years and brushing like a caveman.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that because I haven&#x27;t had any cavities since using it, and it also helped with gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> This is a bad product.</li>
            <li> Philips doesn&#x27;t sell a part, and there is no aftermarket support - which is too bad because I could replace the part if I could buy it.</li>
            <li> Now one of the replacements is going bad (works sometimes), and they will not replace it because it is out of the two year warranty</li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade from the Sonicare Elite as I was getting tired of seeing the nasty gunk that would grow inside of the handle.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the hand motions required with manual brushing are painful and aggravating for people with carpel tunnel or arthritis.  </li>
            <li> They also did a periodontal exam (which I hadn&#x27;t had in a couple years), and I was shocked by how bad the results were.</li>
            <li> (I was shocked).  </li>
            <li> and it was downright painful for me.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be shocked.</li>
            <li> so I am shocked that this happened out of nowhere.</li>
            <li> germs whiny our sick</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed - this product is way too expensive to be replaced every year.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the Soniccare.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed when the handle broke after 1 year of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed...</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED, we have had Sonicare for years.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed-</li>
            <li> Here are their guidelines: (if anyone can see where I was remiss, please point it out to me.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used the Oral B system for almost 1 year and was very unhappy...</li>
            <li> Very disappointing............  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!!</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t buy a flexcare until sonicare fixes this generation and takes responsibility for its poorly designed/manufactured products by offering a refund and/or extended warranty!!!</li>
            <li> The base of the charger also has a way for you to wrap the power cord under the device.  </li>
            <li> (I had also tried the Oral-B rotating brush but it annoyingly tickled the nerves in my nose.)    </li>
            <li> Never could bring myself to throw out the two magnets on each of those, so always pried them off the brush base and keep them in the garage.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s base after every use.</li>
            <li> During the two year warranty period, this would be merely annoying</li>
            <li> This is a bit annoying.  </li>
            <li> The base unit no longer charges.</li>
            <li> The brush head screws onto the brush base, and allows water and tooth paste to gather in the space.</li>
            <li> I called  the Sonicare customer Service on 11/18/13 to report that both the tooth brush and the charger base unit with UV sanitizezer are malfunctioning that needs to replaced.  </li>
            <li> If you are considering the base model, just don&#x27;t bother.  </li>
            <li> the model also includes a separate base you can use while traveling.  </li>
            <li> and Philips replaced the base under warranty.  </li>
            <li> it leave the brush on the charging base.</li>
            <li> Just use the charger base with the UV disinfecting module.</li>
            <li> If your bathroom is like mine and has any opening into your bedroom you are going to hate this sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> When we returned home, the base unit, with Sanitizer, would not turn on.  </li>
            <li> The metal head came out of the base . . .</li>
            <li> Warranty repair said that they did not have any base units in stock but would send me one in 4 to 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> The tab goes into a slot on the base which activates a micro switch.</li>
            <li> and I had picked it up from the base</li>
            <li> but someone else could have noticed it was off the base and replaced it.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I figured I would leave it on the base</li>
            <li> I hate dentists and will do anything to improve my dental health.</li>
            <li> It begins by buzzing off and one while in the charging base.</li>
            <li> In order to stop the relentless buzzing off and on, the base must be unplugged.</li>
            <li> What I hate is the fact</li>
            <li> However, when I realized how disgustingly filthy they get after when taking it apart</li>
            <li> I share the toothbrush base with my fiance</li>
            <li> (my teeth hate me, my wife hates me, my wife&#x27;s teeth hate me... who would have thought a toothbrush could take away so much hate?</li>
            <li> And it is virtually impossible to replace!  </li>
            <li> had a bad dentist visit since I purchased!</li>
            <li> It felt like the toothbrush was way to brutal on my teeth.</li>
            <li> My gums are very bad, and even flossing hasn&#x27;t helped.  </li>
            <li> I have very bad quality teeth</li>
            <li> When it wore out, replaced it with two Philips E Series and are very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - don&#x27;t buy this model.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The Philips web site is pathetic.</li>
            <li> and I hated it!</li>
            <li> They are horrible.  </li>
            <li> The inside began making an awful rattle, and it&#x27;s getting to the point that I feel like using it off instead of on.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this was a coincidence, or truly a nasty side-affect for folks who suffer from canker sores.</li>
            <li> The Elite had that cavity that used to get nasty.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, the worst case scenario, if you do drain the battery fully, is that it becomes \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; vs. a \\&quot;Sonicare</li>
            <li> Horrible product design!  </li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Replaced a very inexpensive &#x27;vibrator&#x27; type brush with very difficult to replace heads with this technology on the recommendation of my dental hygenist. Very pleasantly surprised that it works so well particularly in comparison to what I have been using for several years. Very pleasant against the gumline and seems to be doing the job in keeping the plaque from returning. Will have to see how things go over time, as I have a lot of trouble with plaque build-up and staining as I&#x27;m a &#x27;full pot&#x27; coffee sipper. I&#x27;ve never thought I was good at lasting the requisite / needed time period for brushing, but this is so pleasant that I find it&#x27;s not enough to go through only one timed circuit. I&#x27;m depending upon the brush rather than watching my own clock or watch, but it seems to be shorter than 30 seconds per quarter section. Anyway it&#x27;s no big deal to just click the button to take up where I leave off. Also really like the convenience of removing the head section and cleaning with the ultraviolet compartment. So far we&#x27;re all good! Other than initial cost being tough for those of us who&#x27;ve never gone this route before, I can&#x27;t think of any reason not to recommend it to everyone...</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this - watching online reviews and comparing it to other Sonicare models. In the end, I&#x27;m really glad I decided on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a super-sharp design, for one. Although that&#x27;s not something I ever thought I&#x27;d want/need from a toothbrush, it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But more importantly, it cleans like crazy! Other reviewers have said that it feels like your just got back from the dentist. And although it&#x27;s not THAT intense of a feeling, it&#x27;s as close as you&#x27;re going to get at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually keep mine on the Gum Care setting. I like having a little extra time at the end if I feel like some of my teeth need a bit more attention. But the Refresh setting is great if you want to freshen up before going out somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it gave you the option to choose only compact brush heads. The larger brush head always led to toothpaste splashing everywhere. I prefer the compact, hands down.</li>
            <li> Very cool product, keeps my teeth so clean, even my dental hygienist suspected I was seeing someone else, hahaha! Still running well after almost 2 years of having it, with no issues at all.  Easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> I have been using the sonicaretoothbrush for a few years now and short of going to the dentist you will not be able to get your teeth thus clean.  Previously when I had seen the sonicare toothbrush in my Dennis office I thought it was just another way to sell you an expensive upgraded toothbrush. But after using it for several years and not having a single cavity in that time and getting compliments from my dental hygienist I can&#x27;t see myself going back and using any other toothbrush. My only complaint is that after a few years the rubber on the handle has started to peel off and if you allow water droplets to dry on the inside of the sanitizer it will discolor the mirror coating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a few years now. Gotta say how much I love it. Battery life is exceptional. Travels well and overal 5 star product. Will definitely buy a sonicare again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush. The UV sanitizer to keep bacterias and viruses down, in the tooth brush, is a great idea!&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts long enough for 2-3 weeks trip. It&#x27;s great! Compact with a good travelling case!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> After a week of use of Phillips&#x27; HX6972-10 &#x27;FlexCare Plus&#x27; kit I offer the following observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  It appears to perform its basic function (bushing teeth) well (far better than a regular toothbrush);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  As emphasized by one reviewer, the hard plastic end piece to which the actual toothbrush is attached vibrates furiously and has the potential to be genuinely hazardous when it contacts teeth at certain angles (i.e.: if the brush end is not carefully positioned while the toothbrush is in one&#x27;s mouth).  Therefore, this might not be great for inattentive toothbrushers or smaller mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  If you use an HX6972, make sure that you put the toothbrush into your mouth before turning the device on: Toothpaste will fly off the toothbrush before it reaches your mouth if you turn the brush on before it&#x27;s in the mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  Don&#x27;t wear good (or dark colored) clothes while using this thing:  Since the mouth has to be open while using the device (to keep it properely positioned and to avoid having teeth shattered - only slight exaggeration - by the vibrating plastic) some small amount of toothpaste and/or saliva will splatter while using it: I had to mop up a dozen or so spots of toothpaste from my bathroom mirror (and once a shirt) after each of several uses. Eventually, and with good fortune, you will master its operation (hopefully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)  Wait for respectable pricing (list price is outlandish) and rebate opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than as noted above; probably a useful device to keep teeth extra clean, and a neat toy.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for myself. It works great. But I think the price is a little bit high. I like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works as advertised.  Holds charge for good length of time.  Super cleans teeth.  Highly recommend this terrific product.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush that is worth the price! If you consider how much whitening products and cavity fillings cost, you can save yourself a lot of money by purchasing equipment (such as this electric toothbrush). While I do use mine every day, I don&#x27;t use all of the brushing modes. The only negative thing I can say about this toothbrush (but it&#x27;s standard now on almost every electric toothbrush) is the fact that it has a built in timer. This shuts it off after approximately 2 minutes, which almost always isn&#x27;t enough time for me to cover all the surfaces/areas (but that&#x27;s probably just the meticulousness/OCD in me, more than anything else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you need to know about this toothbrush (in a nutshell):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- lasts about 1.5 weeks from a full charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- requires some getting used to if you&#x27;re new to Sonicare electric toothbrushes (loud vibration if the hard part of the brush touches your teeth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it does a great job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- brush heads can be bought for a reasonable price in packs on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- sanitizer works very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- if you have multiple brush heads, you could potentially share this one unit with a spouse/significant other (completely up to you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- YOU SHOULD BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Without hyperbole, I can honestly say it gets your teeth as clean as a hygienist at the dentist, and quickly.</li>
            <li> 2014.11.23 Update: this product is fantastic. It continues to work as expected.     Original:  This toothbrush works great for my wife and I. It is surprising how well the charge lasts and how well it charges wirelessly. The toothbrush has many options on how to brush. Perhaps the settings change too easily as i frequently find the setting changed after my wife uses it.</li>
            <li> My dentist noticed a difference in my gums after using this toothbrush for a month. Cleans well, has almost too many brushing options but makes my mouth feel clean and stimulates my gums. My wife and I use it every day and when it wears out. We&#x27;ll get a new one.</li>
            <li> Avoid this product like the plague. Two have died on me in less than a year and a half. Others have had the same problem with this model dying after a relatively short time. What really upsets me is that I threw away a perfectly good electric toothbrush that worked perfectly well for more than 5 years and cost me less than $20.00 when I bought it. This toothbrush is a complete piece of crap.</li>
            <li> worked great then started turning on and off on its own no it wont start at all. dont have paper work to retun</li>
            <li> first of all, the electric plug did not fit usa electric outlets.&lt;br /&gt;second, there was an import tax, on the item, i think the tax was about $20.00 which i paid.&lt;br /&gt;the emails from the south korean company assured me that if i bought an adaptor plug, that i could use it in the usa.&lt;br /&gt;the south korean company emails were nice, but they didn&#x27;t understand that i didn&#x27;t order what they sent me, and i didn&#x27;t want to buy an adaptor so i could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i sent it back...i think the return postage was about $30, which i paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon reimbursed me for all the outlays, and refunded the amount i paid for the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i was unhappy, because i had to settle for a lesser toothbrush from a local store.</li>
            <li> Bought this 3 years ago and it died last month. It did a good job cleaning, but with the price I paid, I would expected longer life. My previous Oral B lasted more than 8 years. I wanted to give it another try so I picked up a basic mode 2 Series Plaque Control last week from SAM&#x27;s club since I thought I don&#x27;t need all the bell and whistles on the high end model and I could just save some money by sticking to the basics. Boy I was wrong. The cheaper model makes awfully loud sound and it can&#x27;t clean -- turns out that the motor is very weak, they used cheap plastic instead of rubber around the shaft, which made the little vibration sounds horribly loud. I will have to return it and say byebye to Sonicare -- I am going back to Oral B.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible. my teeth feel so clean after each use and it is worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li> Dentist told me few years ago this was the best way to protect your teeth and gums. Didn&#x27;t get around to buying. Dentist was so right that this is light years ahead of normal tooth brushing for cleaning teeth and keeping gums healthy. Fact that it has a method for completely sterilizing brushes made me take the jump to buy. Insructions easy; the pause system that tells u when u have spent enough time on a section of your teeth makes this so user friendly. Lasts long time between charging--nearly a month. Be prepared for irst time use---it will tickle like crazy. Switch it to \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; for a few brushings and by 2nd brushing I had no tickling sensation. You immediately adjust. Moved from sensitive to normal seeting within a week. If a family---you&#x27;ll need more than one power wand, since if one of you is traveling, who gets custody of the Sonicare becomes an issue! After I bought this, saw some sets come with multiple wands.</li>
            <li> The differences between this model and the \\&quot;older\\&quot; Flexcare are minimal, that is probably why all they did is add a + to the end of the name.  But there are a few differences between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Most notably is the \\&quot;new\\&quot; look.  It has a cleaner appearance with most of the front being a dark chrome look, also instead of the green led&#x27;s, it has a backlight behind the selected brushing mode.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Gone are the &#x27;Go Care&#x27; and &#x27;Max Care&#x27; and in their place are &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; and &#x27;Refresh&#x27; mode.  They do exactly what the other one did except for one important change on the &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; mode which replaced &#x27;Max Care (which is why I picked the new one over the old) &#x27;.  Instead of having a 3 minute routine with 45 seconds each quad (30 normal + 15 massage) for a total of 3 min; they now have it where it goes 30 seconds each quad with an added 1 minute at the end for &#x27;problem areas&#x27; which is broken down into four 15 second intervals.&lt;br /&gt;3.  &#x27;Different&#x27; color, looks very similar - its &#x27;Soft Sky Blue&#x27; instead of &#x27;Medical Blue&#x27;. Basically bluer color than the old one which was more of a green color.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Supposedly lasts longer - 42 2-minute brushings, vs. 20 2-minute brushings of the old one&lt;br /&gt;5.  Case is now hard plastic instead of the soft case that comes with the old model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a few changes in what the battery display shows with its charge but I&#x27;m not going to go into it that far with this review.  I decided to upgrade from the Sonicare Elite as I was getting tired of seeing the nasty gunk that would grow inside of the handle.  It was time to get a new brush head so I decided to go ahead and get a new brush while I was looking around.  Overall I think it has been a good decision as this brush shouldn&#x27;t need the constant cleaning of the old one and I like the new &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; routine.  So if wanted to know the differences, there you go, you probably now know more than you wanted about a toothbrush. If your like me and wanted to know at least some of this, it should help you decide between the two.  I hope this helps you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/2011 - After using my brush multiple times daily for more than 1.75 years, the head of the brush handle was starting to make loud noises and had become \\&quot;loosened\\&quot; from the pressure of brushing (I would consider myself a hard brusher). Luckily it comes with a 2 year warranty. I called them up and was sent a replacement brush immediately, excellent customer service! The brush I received is perfect and I have been using it since. Great product with great customer service to back it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 02/2014 - I have had the replacement brush for nearly 2.5 years now with no problems whatsoever.t some of this, it should help you decide between the two.  I hope this helps you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/2011 - After using my brush multiple times daily for more than 1.75 years, the head of the brush handle was starting to make loud noises and had become \\&quot;loosened\\&quot; from the pressure of brushing (I would consider myself a hard brusher). Luckily it comes with a 2 year warranty. I called them up and was sent a replacement brush immediately, excellent customer service! The brush I received is perfect and I have been using it since.

            <li> I have been using the predecessor Philips Sonicare FlexCare for 16 months (and this brush for a week) and love the brush and the company.  When I had trouble with my older brush this summer, I easily reached a company rep on the phone and they promptly sent me a replacement (registering the brush made it easier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work at a dental school and Sonicare is the brush we use and recommend.  Of the Sonicare options, the FlexCare Plus offers the most features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although one is capable of cleaning their teeth just as well with a manual toothbrush, people are less likely to brush for the recommended two minutes when using a manual toothbrush.  Furthermore, the hand motions required with manual brushing are painful and aggravating for people with carpel tunnel or arthritis.  This brush also has an automatic shutoff after two minutes so you don&#x27;t have to time yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not used to using an electric toothbrush, this brush will gradually increase the intensity as your gums get used to the extra stimulation.  You can also manually change speeds and vibrations but this is a questionable blessing as you may be prone to accidentally push these buttons while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize that a number of reviewers have commented that sanitizers are unnecessary.  Here&#x27;s my take on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your toothbrush can harbor a variety of germs capable of causing illness and even reinfection with the same disease (see dentalresource dot org slash topics25 dot htm).  Your risk is increased if your brush is kept near your toilet or if your home has roaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American Dental Association says \\&quot;data do not demonstrate that they (sanitizers) provide a specific health benefit\\&quot; but they do recommend ways to keep your toothbrush germ free and a sanitizer will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I surveyed the head of dental hygiene and five dental professors, including one charged with monitoring the school&#x27;s sterile environment.  All of them agreed that a sterilizer was unnecessary for home use but half of them used one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the least, putting the brush head in the sterilizer is easier than using boiling water or bleach water.  While it is inexpensive to replace a manual toothbrush every couple of weeks, we tend to keep the $13 electric heads for a couple of months, putting them at greater risk of harboring an infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the cost and convenience of a sanitizer make it a reasonable addition to good oral hygiene regime.lf of them used one anyway.

            <li> I am thoroughly impressed with the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus.  I was somewhat skeptical about what to expect from a teeth cleaning system promising such great things, and the price also caused me some hesitation.  On the whole, however, this toothbrush delivers as advertised.     MODES: There is no shortage of brushing options here.  The Sonicare has five modes: Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive and Massage.   After reading the directions and making several trials with each one, I still can&#x27;t quite figure out why Refresh is on here.  There appears to be no distinction between Clean and Refresh, and the directions only indicate that the Clean mode is designed for a two minute brush, while the Refresh is designed for a one minute brush.  The difference is also subtle between Clean/Refresh and Gum Care.  Nothing wrong with having too many modes per se, but it almost seemed like Philips just wanted another selling point by offering five modes.     The other Sensitive and Massage modes, however, demonstrated their unique value.  Notably, the Sensitive option offered a much gentler brushing, and the Massage option was a nice change of pace along the gum line.       As a side note when using any of the modes, and you will probably learn this within five seconds of your first use, make sure the toothbrush is in your mouth before turning it on.  As I found out, a brush this powerful can and will spray toothpaste everywhere.       PERFORMANCE: There is no denying that my teeth feel cleaner after each use of this toothbrush.  The Sonicare does all the work, so there is no actual \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; involved on your end.  The brush head is designed well.  It gets into all the crevices and does a great job between the teeth and on the gums.       I discovered one interesting thing upon reading the directions.  The Sonicare comes defaulted to setting called Easy-start.  Basically, this feature starts you off with a gentler brushing experience for your first use, and the power gradually builds throughout the first week (i.e., 14 brushings).  The directions say this feature is there for you \\&quot;to ease into the Sonicare experience.\\&quot;  If you don&#x27;t feel the need to ease into a toothbrush, don&#x27;t worry, there&#x27;s a way to turn off Easy-start.  Further, I could not detect any difference in intensity during my first 14 brushings, but this may be the point of the feature.       Also, I noticed that while brushing, the Sonicare sometimes stopped its buzzing for brief moment.  After looking this up in the manual, I learned that this is the toothbrush&#x27;s way of letting you know it&#x27;s time to move to a new part of your mouth (e.g., after 30 seconds it&#x27;s time to go from the front of the lower teeth to the back of the lower teeth).       DESIGN: The handle of the toothbrush has a nice grip.  The brush head is small, but I find this a good thing, because anything bigger would be a nuisance once it started buzzing in your mouth.  The front of the handle will highlight which mode you are in, and it is very easy to tell which mode is highlighted.  You can only switch modes when the Sonicare is turned off.       UV SANITIZER: The UV sanitizer takes 10 minutes, if that.  The brush head fits right inside the compartment on a small peg, and the door shuts firmly even though there&#x27;s no latch.  You push a button to start the cleaning process, and the UV light will turn off automatically.  Also, if you open the door at any time during the cleaning, the UV light will immediately shut off (tried it).  This is a safety feature.  The brush head will come out slightly warm, but only slightly.  I like this feature.  I can&#x27;t imagine what a hotbed of germs a toothbrush is, and the UV light kills 99% of bacteria and viruses.       CHARGERS: It takes 24 hours to give this product a full charge, but once it&#x27;s charged, you won&#x27;t need to do it again for a long while.  I&#x27;ve heard this from other reviewers, and I can tell you from my own experience that after a week of use, I still have full bars (3 of 3) showing on the display.  The device comes with a travel charger as well, but you may just want to leave it in the drawer if you&#x27;re only going out of town for a week or so.  You can also leave the toothbrush in the charger after each use, and once the device is fully charged, it is designed to draw only minimal power from the outlet.       The base of the charger also has a way for you to wrap the power cord under the device.  This just allows you to shorten the amount of cord you have exposed to view.  I first found this annoying because it&#x27;s not that easy to fit the cord into the grooves in the bottom of the charger.  Once done, however, it was nice to get the excess cord out of the way so it wasn&#x27;t bunched up on the counter top.     BOTTOM LINE: I know this product is expensive, and I know there may be more bells and whistles than you&#x27;re looking for on a toothbrush, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  Dental health is important, and we too often take it for granted.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on any product and I wanted to be sure I rated this one 5 stars.  I have been using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for the past 7 years and this one by far is the best one to date.  It offers options that are wonderful like \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; that I use between meals that isn&#x27;t your standard 2 min of brush time as in \\&quot;clean\\&quot; that you would use morning and night.  There is \\&quot;gum care\\&quot;, \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; and \\&quot;massage\\&quot;...see what I mean by options!  Now you may not use all of them, but Philips offers them to us for the folks that will.  Now the brush sanitizer is a fantastic addition to this system.  I have no way of really knowing if it is working or not, but it appears to be doing its job.  When turned on you see a light illuminate from inside and omit this blue glow.  My son loved my toothbrush so much that I purchased him the Kids Sonicare toothbrush which I would rate 100 stars if I could.  My son loves brushing his teeth and for a 5 year old what more could a parent ask for with dental hygiene?  Thank you Philips as you have done it again.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for a while.  The biggest drawback was the screw-on top.  It meant you really needed one each and it was not entirely hygenic as fluid got trapped inside the head.  The new model fixes that.  Heads snap on and off so it&#x27;s easy to share a single handset and the travel pack is much more compact and accomodates two brush heads.  They must have listened to feedback.  This time it&#x27;s 100%.</li>
            <li> Bought this terrific toothbrush after seeing it at Bed,bath and beyond. Saved over $60 from buying at Amazon.  It cleans so well and has several different setting for cleaning teeth and gums.  I love the brush sanitizer and my teeth are so clean after using it the very first time. It is gentle but thorough cleaning each time I use it.  Best oral hygiene product I ever purchased!</li>
            <li> I like the new Phillips Sonicare FlexCare Plus very much.  Easier to keep clean.  Just took on 10 day trip without having to recharge.  Wasn&#x27;t aware that the device comes with two sizes of toothbrushes.  Be sure to purchase extra brushes if you want same size for two people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what I was in for. I bought this after my dentist recommended I switch to it from my manual toothbrush, since I had problem areas between my teeth. Seriously, this is a beautiful piece of machinery. My husband and I share it, since it comes with two brush heads and can store/santize two at a time. The different modes are pretty cool, especially the one for people with sensitive teeth like me, and it&#x27;s nice that it comes programmed to start off easy. Overall I&#x27;m VERY happy with my purchase, especially the unbeatable price and free shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Having tried a jackhammer, sand blaster, steel wool, and chipper shredder, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this product beats all of the above. I had a problem of placing to much pressure while brushing using a conventional toothbrush, but using the FlexCare I&#x27;ve noticed I use little pressure and can feel better results, thus eliminating the possibility of eroding my enamel. It&#x27;s hard to come off the hip with this amount of money, but I highly recommend it for your dental health.</li>
            <li> The handle, brush and charger were fine. However the sanitizer and brush storage area were unnecessary and cumbersome to use. Whoever got an infection from leaving his personal toothbrush in the atmosphere? The cumbersome nature of the product was such that I concluded that my wife who is blind would find it frustrating in the extreme.</li>
            <li> Works great. Go through brushes quickly which gets expensive.  One of the lights went out on the handle.  But overall very happy</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush about 3 months ago here, I was a bit weary of the price since i had never used a sonic toothbrush before, but I figured it was worth a shot.  I have been more than happy with this toothbrush.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.      The UV light works well, it also adds an added benefit of helping the brush dry quickly.  The gumcare mode is really the main one I use, it combines the 2 minute clean with a 1 minute cycle for your gums.  The 1 minute gum cycle has it&#x27;s own quadpacer as well, which is kind of neat.    My only partial complaint is that the brush heads do need to be replaced quicker than a normal manual toothbrush, but this was something I expected going in.  The head gets much more wear and tear with how fast the brush moves.  I got about 2 months out of the head before it needed to be changed.  Of course if you think about the extra 1 minute gum cycle adding an extra 1/3 time to the brush cycle, it kind of makes sense that the brush would wear out an extra 1/3 faster, i.e. 2 months instead of the typical 3.    Of course if your looking at this brush the head replacement is probably pretty trivial seeing as how, well, if your willing to spend this money on a brush, purchasing replacement heads should not be an issue.    I definitely will never go back.  I was completely sold on this brush within the first couple days.  Great product Philips!!!</li>
            <li> This is my 1st Sonic purchasem and Im completly happy with it, it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and then some. been usin nw for about a month, i thought it was reasonable price on Amazon. great deal. I wrk out of the country half the year, so I love the travel charger and hard case.</li>
            <li> This is the newer version of the Sonicare I&#x27;ve been using for years.  This one has multiple settings and a sanitizing feature which works well and is easy to use.  My only negative is that the settings on the toothbrush are too hard on my gums, so the only one I can use is the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a terrific product.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush and my mouth was FOREVER CHANGED.  My gums felt amazing, my teeth were whitened immediately, and I could see newly exposed gum tissue (that had been blocked by permanent tarter) after my first use.&lt;br /&gt;SO, I go to my dentist, they give me a free Oral-B Professional Care 5000 toothbrush, I give away my Sonicare because I need the money, and here I am 3 months later, waiting for my new Sonicare to come in the mail tomorrow!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I love this toothbrush, the Oral-B is terrible in comparison, and I can&#x27;t live without my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Oral B tooth brush for 5 years. I knew about Sonicare and refused to try it ever time my friends told me about theirs.  For some reason at my last dentist visit I asked my Dentist about it. She explained to me how it covers so much more of the tooth area than the Oral B. Being that she had one in the office, she turned it on to let me feel the sonic vibrations that cleaned the tooth area a thousand times better.  I still waited for another month before I broke down and bought one.  My teeth feel much cleaner and the options are amazing!!! I&#x27;m especially excited about the case attachment that zaps bacteria.........genius!![[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus, Rechargeable Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]] for the past three years, and even though that product is still available, for a slight price increase, the FlexCare Plus adds incremental improvements to what was already a very nice toothbrush.  There are improvements in all areas compared to the previous FlexCare model, from the better cleaning modes, to the nice plastic travel case, the improved battery life that lasts twice as long as the old model, and the slightly quieter sound during its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the previous model of the Sonicare FlexCare, I cannot verify the efficacy of the UV Brush Head Sanitizer to kill bacteria.  On both the old and new FlexCare model, I actually rarely ever use the UV Sanitizer as I find that just thoroughly rinsinig the brush head after each use and letting the brush head thoroughly dry before I use it again is sufficient.  Back in the \\&quot;old days\\&quot; when I was still using manual (non-electric) toothbrushes, I have always alternated between two manual toothbrushes, thoroughly rinsing each brush after use and letting each totally dry in between use, and I never had any issues with hygiene from contaminated brush bristles (heck, doorknobs, public drinking fountains, kitchen sink sponges, and shaking peoples&#x27; hands can carry more germs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that while the previous FlexCare model gave you the option to purchase the product *without* the UV Sanitizer ([[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]]), for their newer FlexCare Plus model, there is no option to purchase a version that lacks the UV Sanitizer (which, as with the previous FlexCare model, would also make it less expensive).  I wished that Philips kept offering a version without the UV Sanitizer since the recharging base is more compact without also including the UV Sanitizer unit on it (so it occupies less bathroom counter space and is far more compact to pack into luggage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all electric toothbrushes, you should not push and press the toothbrush too hard into your teeth and gums, both to keep from damaging the tooth enamel and gums and also to help the motor not work so hard.  My previous Sonicare lasted for almost six years before its motor finally died.tizer unit on it (so it occupies less bathroom counter space and is far more compact to pack into luggage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all electric toothbrushes, you should not push and press the toothbrush too hard into your teeth and gums, both to keep from damaging the tooth enamel and gums and also to help the motor not work so hard.  My previous Sonicare lasted for almost six years before its motor finally died.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product described on this page: HX6972/10  What I got was the HX6992/10  This is apparently a newer model.  I have been unable to find any technical information on the HX6992/10 while I was able to find technical info on the HX6972/10.  While the price here was good for the HX6972/10, it is about $40 higher than for the HX6992/10 at other places.  The Philips web site is pathetic. The most recent version of the toothbrush they show is the HX6950. Also under specifications, they list the frequency as \\&quot;31,000 brush strokes per minute\\&quot;. This is deceptive as frequencies are always measured in cycles/second, so the correct number is 517 strokes per second. So this toothbrush is sonic, but not ultrasonic (ultrasonic is for frequencies above 20,000 cycles per second).    This is the second time I have been mislead by an Amazon product. At least this time the switch was to (as far as I can tell) an equivalent product. (last time it was a cheap knock off).    I gave 4 stars because the toothbrush I got works well, I just wish the marketing matched the product.</li>
            <li> I will Only write reviews on items that really make a difference. This is my first electric toothbrush so I can&#x27;t compair it to the other models. But I have wanted one for years. I have always looked into Flex Care. I use Oral B for manuals but Fles Crae I thinks blows them away with the chose of electric.     Well Its only been a week and I can see my teeth getting slightly brighter and whiter. About teh big mess on your face a goop going down the toothbrush. If you keep your face level or slightly tilted up. Wow No mess.     I would recommend it. It does feel like other comments like I just left the dentist. I am very mad about the price cut of but with this new low price I wouldnt think twice about getting one.     UV sanitizer Cant say what its worth. If you wanna save money just buy the brush. I like the extra accessory :)      Don&#x27;t think twice buy it now! I feel bad not having it all these years and brushing like a caveman.</li>
            <li> This was a first electric toothbrush. The quality of this item is amazing. I would recommend this if you want an electric toothbrush that makes you feel like your teeth are brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never in my life spent this much money on a toothbrush but my god it is well worth it. I literally feel as if the sonic vibrations shake the plaque off my teeth, if you floss after using the toothbrush you&#x27;d understand what I mean. It&#x27;s gross to think about but your mouth is a pretty gross place and the idea that you can clean your toothbrush is awesome. I love the santitizing or however you spell it, being able to swap out brush heads is convenient (sp) so that you pay one time for the brush and then just replace the top. I would absolutely recommend this toothbrush. oh, and who doesn&#x27;t love going to the dentest and hearing that you&#x27;ve done a great job.</li>
            <li> The handle broke after 10 months. Something internally broke on top where you connect the brush, it is totally loose now. We take very good care of our stuff, did not fall or anything like that. The previous model lasted 5 years - this one broke after 10 month...</li>
            <li> Significant advancement over prior products in this line.  The product-of-choice if you really want to use the most current and effective technology in tooth/gum/oralcare.</li>
            <li> I previously used the cheap Crest Spin brush consistently.  After 2 days of brushing with the Philips Sonicare,  I noticed reduced tartar &amp; plaque.  I know I don&#x27;t floss as often as I should, but the Sonicare does a great job keeping my teeth and gum line clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upgrading from a Braun rotary head on the recommendation of my dentist.      The ultrasonic activity of this tooth brush takes a little time to get accustomed to its vibrations, but it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning more thoroughly than its predecessor.  The unit itself is very good and feels solid.  The built-in timer is good to prevent cheating by brushing each portion of the mouth for the full time period.      The final test will come on the next semi-annual checkup.</li>
            <li> I bought the flexcare plus to replace my sonicare elite that died after several years.  I wanted something that would be as gentle as the elite and would have bought a second one, but liked the additional features of the flexcare plus. This brush is not as gentle as the elite even in sensitive mode, but it is not too bad.  At this point I&#x27;ve had it for about three months and have not had to recharge the battery yet. I like the battery life indicator, the sanitizer and the multiple modes for use. I would prefer it to be a little less powerful in the sensitive mode, but other than that I have no complaints and as I have mentioned after getting used to it it&#x27;s not bad.  As for differences between this and the elite, the main difference I&#x27;ve noticed is the difference in use options, the stronger brushing action and the fact that the battery on the flex care+ last a lot longer between charging. I&#x27;ve left it off of the charger since the initial charge and it still has battery life after almost three months of use.  My husband has the flexcare model and is pleased with it so far I don&#x27;t notice a lot of differences between the flexcare and flexcare plus when it comes to performance.   I&#x27;ve contacted sonicare customer service a couple of times about rebate information. If you register the brush you get an e-mail coupon for money off a second toothbrush and/or replacement brush heads bought after the date of the e-mail. So far they have been very helpful and even sent free brush heads to make up for some mis-information they gave me about the rebate forms.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased with both the toothbrush and the company.</li>
            <li> I got this unit less than 2 months and now the UV sanitizer is not working.  I had Oral B Professional for 5-6 years and it&#x27;s still working.  I will switch back to Oral B.  I feel that Oral B cleans my teeth better.  I decided to buy a new toothbrush when my current one (Oral B) is still working.  Such a waste.  I shouldn&#x27;t have read too much advertisement.  Oral B professional (unit and brush head) are cheaper and better made.  I will switch back to Oral B.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried an electric tooth brush before so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  On the recommendation of my dentist I tried the Philips Sonic.  I can definitely say that I&#x27;ll never go back to the regular brush. My teeth and gums look and feel clearer than they ever have before.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it - but could have gotten a double one for less at Costco, but am happy with this one.  I expect my gums will be in much better shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple other Sonicare toothbrushes in the past (the kind that unscrew into 2 pieces &amp; expose the vibrating magnets) &amp; have always loved Sonicare. This one is the best of the ones I&#x27;ve used so far. Before this Flexcare toothbrush I changed over to Ultreo (sonic &amp; ultrasound waves) which, like this one, was a 1-piece unit with no parts to rust from water exposure. It was similar to Sonicare but different &amp; took some adjustment to get used to. It lasted me several years before the internal battery died completely &amp; I needed a new brush...enter Flexcare. (I had also tried the Oral-B rotating brush but it annoyingly tickled the nerves in my nose.)    This toothbrush is even more slender than the previous, more lightweight &amp; easier to use. It gives me 30-second intervals on the 2-minute brushing timer &amp; several cleaning options (though they all feel the same). I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual brush ever again - there&#x27;s no clean like a Sonicare toothbrush gives. I keep mine in my shower caddy &amp; the battery carries a charge for a long time before I have to recharge (a month perhaps?). This kit comes with an extra brush head &amp; other accessories. It&#x27;s a bit of an investment cost-wise, but absolutely worth it! Since there are no exposed internal parts to rust from water damage, I expect this one to last much longer than my original Sonicare (which unfortunately only lasted a year &amp; actually cost more than the one I have now).</li>
            <li> My 6 year old Elite 7500 (NiCd batteries) finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge so I bought this Sonicare model to replace it. To cut to the chase, it is not as powerful as the Elite 7500. That is, the vibrating action is not as strong...the FlexCare without the ramp-up feels like the Elite with its ramp-up. I&#x27;ve made sure that the Plus does not have its ramp-up (on charger base, hold power-on button until one beep). The brush head is firmly placed on the toothbrush itself.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m doing anything wrong...just doesn&#x27;t feel as strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not to say the Flexcare doesn&#x27;t clean well...I think it does. I asked my dental hygienist about the difference (she had both models right there) and she thought she had also noticed the difference in power, but no difference in cleaning ability. Still, it&#x27;s a bit of a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages are the UV sanitizer and the Li-ion batteries. My hygienist has me spending much more time brushing my teeth than the \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; says...in fact I spend about double the time, that is, 4-5 mins total, twice a day. So the extended battery life is great.  Also the brush heads are cheaper than for the Elite series.  Never could bring myself to throw out the two magnets on each of those, so always pried them off the brush base and keep them in the garage. The newer brush heads are less wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for all the other modes (massage, refresh, etc) I don&#x27;t use them and hope Philips doesn&#x27;t keep adding gimmicky features which don&#x27;t add real value.  I would rather they allow one to set the cleaning time desired, instead of fixing it at two minutes total with 30 seconds a period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all the FlexCare Plus continues the great Sonicare function.  Would I still buy this model, knowing it&#x27;s not as powerful? Yes, and if I knew I wouldn&#x27;t have that slight disappointment!  Hence this review.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  But like others and this one I have owned the power button is in a place that when I hold it I always seem to hit that button and turn it off.  But when I push it back on the place in the cycle is correct.  Great toothbrush.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush after a lot of research and many family members recommending Sonicare.  I choose it for a few reasons. First, it is one of the newest models (they have the UV light for cleaning) and second, it has the gum care option.  My gums are very bad, and even flossing hasn&#x27;t helped.  I have had the toothbrush for a month now, and my teeth are whiter with just regular brushing and regular toothpaste.  We don&#x27;t use any whitening products, so it was amazing that after a week, it was so noticeable.  My teeth also feel cleaner after brushing.  I would definitely recommend this toothbrush to everyone.  I also like the hard travel case, as it holds 2 heads with the base.  I ordered more of the regular size heads, as it only comes with one regular and one travel head, and both my husband and I share it! The larger heads also fit in the travel case, so you don&#x27;t have to use the compact travel head if you don&#x27;t want to!  As for my gums, they seem to be better and not bleeding as much. The update... the warranty ran out in June and here it is October and the toothbrush has died 2X&#x27;s. Last year we had to have it replaced and after another year, the 2nd one has died. I don&#x27;t think I will buy a Sonic Care again!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied. It comes with a case and extra charger. I always keep it in the case, and recharge once is several days. My family has been using it for half a year already. The good changes are noticeable: teeth are less sensitive, stronger, cleaner. Gum care is easy, fun and very gentle. I&#x27;ve tried several other electric toothbrushes before, this one is definitely the best, the quality is superb. I like proResults small brushes more as their are easier to operate with. It was expensive, but worth it. At Amazon the price varies, I once saw it for 125$, I paid a little more though.</li>
            <li> This particular Philips Sonicare is the best one they make. It leaves teeth cleaner than other models by far. My dentist recommended it and now I know why.</li>
            <li> I used to have sensitive gums despite flossing once a day and brushing twice a day with a regular toothbrush.  My dentist suggested this toothbrush so I decided to give it a try.  Within a few weeks I could feel my gums improving.  After using the toothbrush for 4+ months I went to a new dentist and she immediately said, do you use an electric toothbrush?  She told me that my gums are perfect, my teeth are very clean, and I have no cavities.  I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommend the Philips Sonicare line.  While I have purchased and used several electric tooth brushes in the past, none of them has left my teeth feeling as clean as the Phillips FlexCare Plus HX6972.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. I bought it at the recommendation of my dentist. I haven&#x27;t used all the functions yet. I use the UV thing after every brushing and it&#x27;s nice to know that my toothbrush is clean. The first week or two my gums were a little sensitive and I had to get used to it. (My gums were pretty bad too start anyway) but its very comfortable now.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Flexcare+ because my gums were receding due to \\&quot;vigorous\\&quot; brushing. After using this toothbrush only twice-- I am impressed! My gums are not sore (in the front of my mouth- where I am less than gentle) and my teeth feel like I have been to the dentist for a cleaning. I woke up this morning feeling like I had brushed my teeth only minutes before my alarm clock went off! I wonder why dentists do not recommend the Sonicare to everyone. Is it possible that people who use the Sonicare may not have to go to the dentist as frequently as regualr toothbrush users?? I am SOLD! ;)</li>
            <li> Purchased in February 2010 and died a couple of weeks ago. Inadmissible for such an expensive item. Same goes for brushes - their functionality degrades much faster than advertisted.</li>
            <li> The product was great, until it stopped working after less than a year.  Once it&#x27;s out of warranty there is no possibility of repair and all they give you is a coupon worth 15% off of their online store (which sells products at approximately 15% higher price than Amazon!).  Here&#x27;s the online chat I had with them:  Welcome to Philips Chat, you&#x27;re chatting with Sally. How may I help you?  Sally: Hello Scott  Scott: Hi - my Sonicare Elite 9000 (XH9882) has stopped working  Scott: I assume it is out of warranty, but how do I get it repaired?  Sally: What is the exact issue you are facing with the unit?  Sally: I&#x27;m really sorry about the inconvenience and I&#x27;ll try my best to help you with it.  Sally: Could you confirm the exact issue you&#x27;re facing with it?  Scott: It won&#x27;t turn on and when we put it in the charger no lights come on that indicate it is charging  Sally: Okay.  Sally: May I also have the serial number which is a 6 digit number that immediately follows the HX model number.  Scott: 071015  Sally: Thanks.  Sally: When was it purchased?  Scott: 2010  Sally: Which month?  Scott: December  Scott: but I don&#x27;t have a proof of purchase because it was a Christmas gift  Sally: Okay.  Sally: Scott, how long did you charge the unit before turning it on?  Scott: It&#x27;s been sitting in the charger for the past 6 hours and no lights are coming on  Sally: Alright. Please place the handle in the charger and charge it for 24 hours before turning it back on. If the handle still does not stay charged, my best suggestion would be to purchase a new Sonicare.  Sally: Unfortunately, our Toothbrushes are not repairable.  Scott: are you kidding?  Sally: If you decide to purchase a new Sonicare toothbrush, to help offset some of the cost, I can offer you 15% off your total Sonicare purchase along with free shipping at our Philps online store.   Sally: no  Sally: Our records show the unit is out of warranty.  Scott: I am really offended  Sally: I&#x27;m sorry about that.. However, since it isa gift, I doubt you have a purchase receipt.  Sally: Have you registered the product?  Scott: these things aren&#x27;t cheap.  Sally: I can understand that..</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this marvel. I absolutely love it and have noticed that I brush my teeth more frequently and for much longer.</li>
            <li> It worked well initially, but in less than 2 years the base of the brush where it charges became yellow; the rubber that seals the device/battery was torn and as a result, the brush started to malfunction. I contacted Philips, but they refused to replace it because it was out of warranty. For the price, it should be better quality. I must say that I took meticulous care of the toothbrush, wiping/drying it&#x27;s base after every use.</li>
            <li> I was in the process of having peridontal treatment due to deep \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; (5-6), so I bought my FlexCare Plus toothbrush at the recommendation of my dental hygienist about 6 months ago. My dental check ups dramatically improved (\\&quot;pockets\\&quot; are now 1-2). My daughter was wanting an electric toothbrush for Christmas, so I bought her one and she loves it! Teeth feel so much \\&quot;slicker\\&quot; and fresher than ever before! I also love being able to sterilize the bristles with the UV light. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have never had an electronic toothbrush before and was a little leary of ordering one so expensive.  I had done quite a bit of research on them and the benefits of the electronic toothbrush.  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product...so much so I bought one for my wife, who is very particular, and she loves it as well.  The battery charge lasts about 2 weeks brushing 2 times per day.  The automatic timing let&#x27;s you know you have spent enough time in each zone of your mouth.  The gum control function works great and provides an extra minute of brushing.  Your teeth and gums feel real clean when finished.  It&#x27;s difficult to say if the sanitizer works but we use it once a week anyway.  Haven&#x27;t used all of the functions yet as it is only 3 weeks old.  Very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.  Money worth spending.</li>
            <li> Contrary to 20 years of trial and error experience, I took a chance and spent almost $200 on this toothbrushing system.  Best thing I ever did for my mouth, teeth and gums.  Period.  It makes brushing easy.  It makes brushing effective - really clean teeth.  Awesome product that actually delivers.  I am also using the UV sanitizer frequently.</li>
            <li> So far the unit is working fine and easy to use. It will need more usage to be able to form a complete opinion of its effectiveness. As far as my wife and I can tell, it looks like it reduces stains somewhat.</li>
            <li> would not recommend as it just quit working yesterday, less than 3 months after it arrived, hoping to get a refund or a new one to try again</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is easy to use, though I am mainly interested in the cleaning and massage effects, and not particularly in the &#x27; refresh &#x27; aspect ? I love the UV brush heads sanitizer.  Just the thought of not having bacteria hanging around your toothbrush heads ..is fantastic: for hygiene purposes ! Hope that having to get replacement toothbrush heads in the future, doesn&#x27;t turn out to be a &#x27; breaking the bank &#x27; deal ?! I am waiting to see whether my dental hygienist thinks that there is an obvious &#x27; difference &#x27; at my next professional &#x27; cleaning &#x27; appointment.  THAT will be the acid test !</li>
            <li> After Only a year, it just stopped recharging, for what it cost to Buy that is not Cool.&lt;br /&gt;It really was wonderful otherwise.</li>
            <li> Product was recommended by our dentist.  A little pricey but in life you get what you pay for and this toothbrush delivers all it promises and more.  Easy to use, remarkably powerful.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have a throat problem and brushing my teeth can cause me trouble.  The heads on this product are small enough for me and wow does it clean.  Especially on the &#x27;gums&#x27; setting.  After just a week of using it I got &#x27;applause&#x27; from my hygenist.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. We had used an older version of the Sonicare toothbrush for years, and although it did an excellent job of cleaning our teeth, it had some drawbacks. This version rectified those issues, such as the head of the handle had a hollow well that could get nasty if you didn&#x27;t clean it religiously every day with a sanitizing product. This model has a different type of connection that is much more sanitary. Plus there is a UV light in the base for sanitizing the brush heads. There are some suggestions that I would make to Philips if they are listening: We had to purchase two of these rather expensive models because there is only one charge spot on the base and it only comes with one toothbrush. We travel at different times and it&#x27;s difficult to share a single base and single toothbrush, even though you can change the head on it. Could you make an option that comes with two charge spots as well as brushes that would be less costly than purchasing two separate units? Also, the heads that come with the brush are the compact type. If you prefer the standard heads as we do, you will have to purchase them separately. Otherwise they have performed as advertised and have some very good features that we like. I have not tested the length of the charge yet, but will edit my review if it does not match what is advertised. They arrived two days after purchase as promised using my Amazon Prime account.</li>
            <li> I had this toothbrush for one year, and was loving it.  But then, a few weeks ago, I accidentally dropped it in a sink full of water and it immediately shorted out.  It won&#x27;t turn on, charge, or anything.  Why would you make an electric toothbrush that isn&#x27;t completely waterproof???</li>
            <li> The sonic care flex plus gives  mouth a super clean feeling, however the strong vibration of the brush does take  getting use to.  It stays charged for a very long time and  cleans my teeth better than I ever could with a regular brush.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> After purchasing the Clarisonic last summer, a few months later I purchased this.  You can&#x27;t go wrong here.  When you first start using this, I would suggest that you be as gentle as possible with the speed (based on my experience).</li>
            <li> Its a great product, my teeth are much white then when i used a regular toothbrush. My gums use to bleed but now after 2 weeks of using this my gums have stopped bleeding and are getting much better. I suggest if you buy this product use it with mouth wash and a tongue scrubber for maximum effect. Great buy, it was really worth the money.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been Sonicare fans for years and used several earlier versions of their brushes. This latest upgrade feels like a big step up. Not only does the new handle design eliminate that truly icky build-up under the replaceable brushes (gross!), but the brush sanitizing light (gimmick or not) at least makes you feel like you&#x27;re being a little more safe, germ-wise. (And, hopefully, eliminates throwing away those expensive brush replacements every time you&#x27;ve got the sniffles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how useful the variable speeds/setting are, but the total care cleaning setting definitely left my mouth feeling refreshed and throughly cleaned without taking too long to be doable on a daily basis. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a dentist&#x27;s clean feeling every day, but your teeth and mouth definitely feel far cleaner and more refreshed after a Sonicare brushing than using any regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside, of course, is the Sonicare price tag (and ongoing replacement brush head costs), but, in the end, I feel it&#x27;s worth it and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever go back to using just a regular toothbrush again after so long with a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love my new Sonic toothbrush. It was bought to replace an older Sonic that finally quit. I had to go several days with a regular toothbrush before my new toothbrush arrived. It felt like forever. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my new one and really feel like I had a clean mouth and teeth. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have owned each of the last 3 generations of Sonicare toothbrushes... this latest version is head and shoulders above the rest.   I can&#x27;t recall my original Sonicare toothbrush, I ended up not using it too much.   The last toothbrush, the Sonicare Elite has the highly distasteful tendency to get mold/gunk inside the body of the brush no matter how much I cleaned it.  That issue with the Elite version was a design failure in my mind.    This version, the FlexCare plus, gets it right.  The controls on the handle are easier than the previous versions and I am very very happy with how Sonicare has improved the design of the toothbrush head to avoid the issues that the Sonicare Elite had.       I don&#x27;t use the UV that much, its nice to have and the non-UV isn&#x27;t that much cheaper right now.  The nice thing about the UV is it creates a wider base which helps to stabilize the toothbrush from being knocked about.    From a pure cleaning functionality perspective.... this is a great toothbrush, works very well.    Best product out there in my mind.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric toothbrush I have tried that is currently on the market. The bristle&#x27;s are still a little too hard and the vibrations are still too hard as well, so can I recommend this, not really. I still say a soft or ultrasoft bristled brush is the best for MOST people. I do like the UV, though I really don&#x27;t know how well it works, and quite honestly, your mouth is already full of bacteria and if you are healthy, there should be a good balance and while it is a good marketing tool, I don&#x27;t know how necessary it is. This will still rattle your teeth if the back of the brush touches them, so be careful, it&#x27;s quite a jolt. You will still get toothpaste all over the place. Even at it&#x27;s lightest setting it&#x27;s just too much. Also, something to note is that the amount of time you brush is very important and you cannot compensate with a harder bristled brush. You really do need 3 minutes to brush every area well....and you should be brushing softly. I would have given this 3.5 stars if it were possible. If you don&#x27;t brush your teeth and you need to spend this much money in order to motivate yourself, then I guess it&#x27;s a start. Keep in mind that (basically) gingivitis is initially caused by plaque accumulation and soft plaque can be removed by good hygiene (e.g. brushing AND flossing). Once the plaque hardens it needs to be scaled off and there isn&#x27;t a brush in the world that will remove it (or if there is it shouldn&#x27;t be in your mouth). If you have arthritis, etc., this is probably the only reasonable alternative. I wish they could tone it down a bit more, say 50% more. Lastly, keep in mind that you still have to floss (at least twice a day). :-)</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing toothbrush ever. As my daughter would say I love it so much! I also like the fact it has a sanitizer attached to sanitize me brush heads. Thanks Sonicare !!!</li>
            <li> Works great, holds a charge for many days. Love all the features. It programs you to clean your teeth longer.  You need this, floss, a scraper for plaque, a mirror, and voila! you are your own hygienist.</li>
            <li> I have owned Sonicare products for many years but this one is exceptional.  You can see the difference in the brightness of your teeth and feel how smooth your teeth are.    The UV sanitizer just adds another level of confidence in the cleanliness of the brush heads.    If you have any problems with your gums or teeth or wish a preventative measure then this is your device.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself and as a giftfor someone else.      Just one month after using this, the person I gave this gift to went to the dentist and the hygienist commented about the amazing condition of his gums based on previous visits - he \\&quot;must be flossing\\&quot;.  He had a GREAT checkup and raved about the Sonicare saying that he wasn&#x27;t flossing, it was the new toothbrush.    I bought this for myself to help with a sensitive tooth/gum issue that I had.  This worked beautifully and I no longer have the issue with my tooth.  It&#x27;s also a fantastic investment because it WORKS and it&#x27;s really fun to use.  I look forward to using it all of the time.    I&#x27;ve seen this for $190 on many other sites so this was a BARGAIN!</li>
            <li> There is no other toothbrush that gives you the results of the Sonicare.  I suffered at the dentists office for years due to tarter build up and gum problems.  My dentist suggested I get a Sonicare but I procrastinated for years.  Finally, I purchased one (13 years ago) and it changed my life.  I now have next to no tarter, my teeth are cleaner and whiter than ever, my gums are healthy and going to the dentist is now a snap.  My first Sonicare lasted over 13 years and both my husband and me used it.  We now use the Flexcare Plus and love it.  I love that the head is smaller and can more easily get to the back teeth, I love how the toothbrush has a break-in period so that your gums and teeth get used to it, I like the different options available and the fact that it has a built in sterilizer and travel charger.  The Sonicare has proven itself over and over for years.  There is no product that compares to this.  Throw you electric tooth brush away as it does nothing except make brushing \\&quot;easier.\\&quot;  The Sonicare on the other hand, gets your teeth whiter &amp; cleaner, significantly reduces tarter and improves the health of your gums.  It is worth every penny and change your dreaded dental visits.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonicare toothbrush; I had it for about a month now and it works great, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, with complete features, to take care of your oral care</li>
            <li> When my toothbrush broke randomly, I spent 5 minutes on the phone with Sonicare&#x27;s friendly and apologetic customer service. After a quick troubleshooting they took my address and mailed me out a new handle.  Impressed!</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back but never reviewed it until now of course (Duh!). Let us get to the point of the matter. This brush wasn&#x27;t the best electric toothbrush at the time but it did the job well. I am sad that I had lost it and probably would buy and up-to-date version of this brand or other brand that makes electric toothbrushes. One thing I noticed about me cleaning my mouth with this toothbrush is that it easily made my gum lighter.</li>
            <li> My dental hygeine has benefited infinitely from the Sonicare line of toothbrushes. This is my third Sonicare brush and it replaces a first-generation [[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]]. I&#x27;m finding the + model to be a worthy upgrade. Immediately noticeable was the more solid feel, better grip, and improved balance of the handle. The brush modes are labeled in plain English--Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage--rather than settings like Go Care and Max Care that I never understood on my earlier model. I brush my teeth frequently and I love the new Refresh mode for a quick 1-minute clean to supplement my full nighttime and morning, 2-minute Clean. The FlexCare+ has a subtler, but more effective, vibration than my earlier model. My previous model did not have the sanitizer. I typically think of things like UV sanitizers as unnecessary and gimmicky, but it at lease appears to be doing something. Who knows, it can&#x27;t hurt. The hard case and additional small-size charger are nice additions for the traveller, though I wish the charger could somehow fit inside the case with my brush. All in all a worthy upgrade.</li>
            <li> It is a awesome toothbrush. There are multiple brushing modes, that can depend on your time or needs.It lights up when you are using it, and then when it&#x27;s off the handle turns back to the silver; like their was nothing there.My mouth always feels so clean whenever I used it.My teeth and gums are whiter, and my dentist surely noticed the difference.I&#x27;d say the drawbacks are that it&#x27;s kinda tall.Also, the price is a bit steep, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> i really love this product, i got braces so its very easy and comfortable to brush teeth with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great investment for good dental health. I love it. It clean my teeth so well. I brushed morning and evening and it&#x27;s great for travelling as well. Nice design :)</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for over 10 years.  Our original version lasted over 5 years.  3 of the last 4 brushes have stopped working properly.  The first stopped vibrating properly within 2 years and the other 2 brushes stopped just after the 2 year warranty ended.   This is very dissapointing given how expensive these brushes are.  Sonicare does a great job but the life span of handles is just not acceptable.  Sonicare should extend their warranty period and acknowledge that there is a problem with a significant percentage of their brushes.  You should buy Sonicare only if you are satisfied with it lasting 2 years.</li>
            <li> This model (HX6950) is currently the ultimate rechargeable toothbrush that dental offices seem to recommend (or at least have coupons for). I&#x27;ve noticed less plaque build-up and healthier gums ever since I started using the older model (HX6930) a few years ago. So the question is, if you already have a Philips Sonicare Flexcare, do you need this new model?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UV SANITIZER&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I love the comfort of knowing that the germs on my toothbrush have been killed off. The UV sanitizer does a quick and effective job of that. Just insert up to 2 toothbrush heads and press the button. Not all Sonicare toothbrushes have a UV sanitizer, so this would be the main reason for me to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Sonicare website, the UV bulb lasts about 1800 hours (about 2 years) and can be replaced from their webstore. The recommended frequency of using the UV sanitizer is once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIFFERENCES with older HX6930 MODEL&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the older Sonicare Flexcare HX6930 from Amazon a few years ago. Since then, Philips has made some slight improvements. These improvements seem to be cosmetic only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that the UV sanitizer door now magnetically closes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The names of the toothbrush modes are changed but seem to have the same functions as the earlier model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Clean (The basic 2 minute clean)&lt;br /&gt;- Sensitive (The adjustment for sensitive teeth)&lt;br /&gt;- Massage (The gum massage mode)&lt;br /&gt;- Refresh (The 1 minute clean. This is re-named from \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;- Gum Care (The 2 minute clean plus 1 minute gum cleaning. This is re-named from \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRIPE&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I love this toothbrush, but my complaint about the mold build-up in the earlier model persists to this model. It&#x27;s very easy for water to be trapped under the UV sanitizer door which leads to mold growing in there. You&#x27;ll need to periodically remove the plastic caddy inside the sanitizer and clean it to prevent build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll also need to wipe off any water on the toothbrush before placing it back on the induction recharger. It rests flat on the charging area without any grooves to drain water. So trapped water *inside* the bottom of the toothbrush will give your toothbrush a really funky odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTRAS&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Includes a convenient travel case and travel charger.

            <li> After having surgery to restore the gum line that I&#x27;d destroyed with a standard toothbrush, I finally invested in the Sonicare.  I bought three last year for Christmas and all are still functioning.  Mine went through a spell of sounding odd (which is why I gave it four instead of five stars) but has since started sounding normal again.  I am hard on it and have to replace brushes much more often that my husband. My son has used one for years and swears by it.  My daughters also like theirs.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go for the high-end one again with the sanitizer that I rarely use, but would buy one again.</li>
            <li> My Daughter N law told me about this product and how my son loves it.  I purchase it and found it is a excellent product.  I am waiting for my next dentist appiontment for the final result.</li>
            <li> Not very good unit died already</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. I use it along with my wife, with separate brush heads, and the process is very manageable.    I use the compact and she uses the regular brush head. Both seems to work very well.  The brush has several settings depending on time you want to dedicate to the brushing, based on sensitivity of gums and also includes a gum massage mode.    The battery charge is very solid, and for two people, using it everyday, it seems to last a long time.    The UV sanitizer comes with this Kit, and while I can not vouch for the scientific benefits of such a devices, the blue light comes on every night, and it at least makes me feel more comfortable knowing I have less germs on my toothbrush.    Look out, or search on the internet for a $15 coupon that is sometime available as a rebate from Sonicare.    Enjoy this product, hopefully as much as I have.</li>
            <li> The dentists tell me it&#x27;s far and away the most effective cleaning tool, so I use it diligently, and now they say my home care (which also includes twice-daily flossing) is excellent. Initially the noise, a bit like a dental drill, was off-putting, but I got used to it. Too bad the first one I got lasted just 2 years--when it died, Philips SoniCare told me the SoniCares last generally 2-5 years but sent a $15 off coupon as a consolation prize.  Despite the premature demise, I am satisfied with this machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a 2 other brand named rechargeable toothbrushes,  this one is the best! Love it, your teeth will love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a dismal visit to the dentist and on his recommendation. My teeth have never felt cleaner - and I&#x27;ve noticed them a bit brighter and whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of warnings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The brush heads don&#x27;t last 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) If you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll need all the settings on this one, get a cheaper one with less options. The UV light cleaner is nice, but we only ever use the &#x27;Clean&#x27; setting on the brush.</li>
            <li> Three weeks ago my Dental Hygienist told me that I have gingivitis and the early stages of periodontal disease. She also told me to \\&quot;buy a Sonicare...now\\&quot;. I admittedly experienced some \\&quot;sticker shock\\&quot; when I started looking, but after two weeks of using this toothbrush I enjoy brushing, feel better and my teeth look whiter and feel cleaner. For me it has already proven to be well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these.  My husband and I both love it!  The small head makes it so easy to clean hard to reach places and I love the sanitizer.  Expensive yes, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I did some research on this sonic power toothbrush along with similar products before I selected this one.  I wanted to know options such as cleaning teeth, gum care along with massaging my gums.  It was important the power toothbrush had to be rechargeable and had sonic power to tackle plaque.  Cleaning brushes was another factor. I&#x27;m pleased with the selections on the power toothbrush, the feeling of a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; dental cleaning each and every time I brush my teeth.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean the brushes and always ready to go for the next brushing.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I received the flex-care + system for christmas.  This is the best toothbrush I have ever used.  I have used manual toothbrushes as well as a powered oral-B.  They do not come close to the clean feeling you receive after using the flexcare.  Your mouth will feel like you just left the dentist office.  There is a reason why these brush systems are more expensive than others.  I love the UV sanitizer.  If you worry about bathroom germs on your toothbrush watch the video on the bottom of this page: [...]</li>
            <li> It is an excellent toothbrush, and does a much better job of cleaning my teeth than I was doing by hand.  After using it for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;m sold on it.  I appreciate the timing so that I get an equal brushing for all parts of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy way to shop.     the box was in a nice package NEW and Neat ....Thanks for their business.   I will recoment everyone.    Yes.!!!    oh, and best  price  too.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by our dentist and it works. This will improve you&#x27;re oral health no matter how good or bad it is right now.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews say our teeth feel really clean after this. It&#x27;s a little weird the first couple of times but you get used to the vibrating sensation. Hopefully this will help with our gums. We&#x27;ll find out on our next cleaning. Toothpaste thrown off b/c of vibrating so I end up having to apply the toothpaste on my teeth before turning on the brush. Not a big deal. Just got a lot of toothpaste on my shirt and on the floor the first couple of times.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend the amount of money I considered expensive for an electric toothbrush. I figured what is the difference between this model and the lower priced models? They all clean your teeth, right? Wrong!! This model cleans more signifcantly than any other model that I have previously used. After two weeks of use, my teeth were whiter and my mouth felt much cleaner. The brush has some nice touches such as the electronic head sanitizer, as well as multiple functions (Clean Teeth, Clean Gums, Massage, Quick Brush, etc.). This product is well worth the price for the quality of work it perfoms on your teeth and gums. It definitely improves overall dental hygiene more than any other product. It actually makes brushing a more pleasurable experience. I have been using this brush for over three weeks, and the novelty has not worn off. The only question I have is regarding the products durability. Will the battery last for a few years? My previous lower end Sonicare brush(Elite Series) lasted over 5 years. I would expect to receive greater longevity from this product.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare FlexCare Plus is replacing an older model from 14 years ago.I can&#x27;t wait to brush every day. The design is sleek, easy to select different functions (massage, clean, etc.)and is powerful yet gentle. The UV brush head sanitizer works well --though I wonder what is really going on behind the closed door. Buy it, use it. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I originally had an Sonicare Essence, but decided to try an Oral-B model.  I didn&#x27;t really like using the Oral-B after a few weeks, so I switched to the FlexCare.  It&#x27;s a very powerful, yet quiet model and it&#x27;s easy for me to use. The various cleaning functions are a nice touch. I don&#x27;t really use the UV sanitizer, but it&#x27;s a nice option I suppose. I would definitely recommend this model for anybody looking for a very good tootbrush.</li>
            <li> We have had other electric tooth brushes and nothing compares to the clean feeling this one gives you. Stays charged forever too!</li>
            <li> A Sonicare was recommended to me by my dentist, and after looking at all the options, I decided to go with the FlexCare Plus. All in all, I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase. It comes with two heads of different sizes, for different jaw sizes, which is useful if there are two that would use the brush. It also comes with a travel case and travel charger, which I haven&#x27;t found too useful myself (thus far), but is nice to have. Ever since I started using this brush, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my dental hygiene, with /far/ less build-up. In short, this is a good product with a fair price tag.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for its claim to improve the health of gums.  I saw my dentist within 2 weeks after I started using the product, and the hygienist said she did notice an improvement.  I&#x27;m thinking of giving one to my brother as a gift.</li>
            <li> After a recommendation from my dentist about a year ago, I finally broke down and purchased this product and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Every time I brush, I feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the cost -- but realize you get what you pay for!  Highly recommend . . .</li>
            <li> So far so good. I love this toothbrush. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go as far as saying I feel \\&quot;dentist\\&quot; clean after using this thing but it is exponentially better at removing plaque than a regular toothbrush. I discovered quite quickly that if you want your toothpaste to stay on your brush be sure to place the brush head inside your mouth before turning on the Flexcare+. So far I have used the Clean and Gum Modes and the quadpacer has does its job well. I think I prefer Gum Mode as I like the extra 15 second intervals (1 min total) at the end for targeting the insides of my molars. I have been using the UV sanitizer after each brushing and I assume it is doing its job. The intensity seems spot on and the 10 minute cycle seems about right. I&#x27;ve been digging for the actual clinical studies that Philips commissioned but I can&#x27;t find anything other than a weak abstract on the Philips site. You would think if this UV thing of theirs worked as they claim they would give consumers access to the detailed results.     I have not had any issues with this product yet. I hope it lasts at least throughout the 2 year warranty period since the cost was so high. The main thing that scares me is removing and replacing the brush heads after each use. All that pushing and pulling seems like it is destined to break something in the handle.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Oral B Pro model but found the sound a bit annoying; reminded me of an tiny out-board motor. This toothbrush cleans as well although the cleaning properties seem less \\&quot;mechanical\\&quot; than the obvious scrubbing effect of the Oral B. I like it a lot and have had it a couple of months with no problems at all. It has a great battery life and smooth, quiet operation. I had to start using electric toothbrushes since I have some gum recession. The Oral B helped me step down from scrubbing back and forth with a regular toothbrush but I like the Sonicare better overall for the sound and the clean feeling it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I bought it to to help prevent gum recession from brushing to hard. When I tried to brush with a regular toothbrush, I didn&#x27;t feel clean. And, the battery life is awesome. Ended up in transit for a week and didn&#x27;t have to charge it. Didn&#x27;t lose power. Very happy.</li>
            <li> this is my third Sonicare toothbrush, and the best. It definitely cleans teeth superbly - not only can i tell it, but the dental hygienist i go to says \\&quot;Whatever you&#x27;re doing to keep your teeth clean, keep it up\\&quot;. Before i started using the Sonicare, the dental hygienist used to have to do a lot of plaque scraping, but no more.     The last Sonicare i used had a screw-on brush, and over time gunk built up under the screw-on cap. I was only aware of it when i changed the brush (every 3 months, as recommended by my dentist), but i didn&#x27;t like the idea. This flexcare has a snap-on brush with no space beneath for anything foreign to build up. Even better, this unit has an ultraviolet light that kills germs and keeps the brush sanitary. (I have a UV light on both a hot tub and a koi pond, and you can see the difference they make in just a day).    The battery stays charged for over a week of use when on trips, so no need to carry the charger.     So - clean teeth and clean brush, no plaque, easy to use, and various special features (like the battery indicator). Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and does not collect junk like the old model. Very satisfied with the upgrade!</li>
            <li> excellent product - i read all the mixed reviews about several versions of the Sonicare before finally deciding to purchase this one (FlexCare Plus).  whatever problems there may have been with earlier iterations, i believe Philips has resolved.  some definite pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the design itself is impeccable and makes it easy to clean/maintain (that being said it is an extremely low-maintenance product anyway)&lt;br /&gt;2) i purchased the one with the UV sanitizer which is great, but even if you don&#x27;t go that route the individual brush heads come with caps as well, which could help you feel a little better about cleanliness if the unit stays out on the counter as opposed to in a drawer or medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;3) the gradual increase in pressure over the first 14 uses of the brush &#x3D; brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;4) multi-level settings for full/extended brushing or quick refreshers when you are headed out somewhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about 6 months now and so far it is living up to its potential and delivering on all the points referenced in the product description (not sure about the longevity of the battery - i haven&#x27;t had any need to travel since buying mine and i keep it stored on the base).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this information helps you in your purchase decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: 29 November 2011 - It has now been well over a year since i first posted the above review about this toothbrush.  it is still in great working condition, and my husband now has his own brush head attachment so he can steal, er...i mean BORROW it to use for himself.  So far so good; a sound investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: 28 April 2013 - i am about to order this same product for my mother, and thought i would update again to say this toothbrush is still going strong.  i&#x27;ve also traveled with it a couple of times now, and it has easily held its charge for an extended weekend trip (so, i can vouch for about 3 days with no worries!).</li>
            <li> I would actually give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars but figured I&#x27;d round to 5.  There&#x27;s no need to go on about what I like about this toothbrush since many other reviewers go into fine details about what there is to like about it. And I&#x27;d have to say just about everything. I do love this Sonicare toothbrush very much in the 4 months that I&#x27;ve been using it. But the one detail or flaw that I find to be bothersome is the silver button to scroll through the different brushing modes.  I always brush in the \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode of the five modes and since this button is in the mid area of where your fingers wrap around the handle to hold it what happens is in the process of going to put my toothpaste on and then pressing the bright green circular ON button to start brushing is 4 out of 5 times it ends up being on a different mode. And the reason for this is that while handling the brush prior to brushing you don&#x27;t realize your are indirectly pressing that silver button once or twice or more, so when you finally come to press the ON button it&#x27;s been set to a different mode than when you last brushed. You then have to press the green button OFF, press the silver button however many times to get back to the one you want and then press turn it back on. What I would say is a minor inconvenience and this happens very often to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To resolve this problem is fairly simple, which is to check the mode your on (by pressing the silver button) right before you press the ON button to start brushing. But by doing this sometimes you have to scroll through the modes (pressing it several times) to get to the mode you previously had it on -- in my case, the &#x27;Clean&#x27; mode. And I usually forget to check this prior to brushing. That&#x27;s the only negative thing I have to say about this fine, well-made toothbrush. Certainly not a reason not to get it.</li>
            <li> still works great. Had for about 4 years I think.  Gets teeth much cleaner than manual toothbrush.  Can&#x27;t go back now.</li>
            <li> ...makes me feel like I&#x27;m living in a futuristic time.  Maybe it&#x27;ll TALK to me one day...j/k.  Beats manual brushing by far.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist. My brother is a dentist and he gave me a sonicare flex+  It really changed me and I never use a manual toothbrush anymore unless I absolutely have to and without my sonicare. It&#x27;s powerful and all you have to do is stand there and let the brush do all the work! I&#x27;ve used Oral B before. Did not last long until I went back to my manual brush. Oral B and other brands are not as powerful. Trust me, I&#x27;ve used like 3 other power brushes. They were sub par, so I don&#x27;t even remember what brand they were.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush and the best Sonicare yet!  Would be nice if they would make the selection button a little more difficult to depress, I find myself constantly pressing it when I pick up and put down the brush.  Not a big deal, but would be nice to not have to consciously avoid parts of my toothbrush every time I use it. ;)  Thanks Philips, work on that for the next model please. :)</li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty good.  I would rate it overall a 4, but the shipping issues with this and many of my products lately have been RIDICULOUS!  It&#x27;s a waste to ever ship overnight because it only gets there about 50% of the time.  I have left 2 emails for Amazon customer service and not heard a thing.  I love this company, but have noticed since last year its shipping is getting worse and worse!</li>
            <li> Excellent Toohbrush, had a previous model for quite a few years, was happy with that one and very please with this one. Cleans very effectively, and really like the drier that you put the brush head in when your done to kill germs.</li>
            <li> I decided recently that my dental hygiene routine needed an overhaul, and after some research decided this was the brush to get. Switching from a manual to an electric toothbrush made a big difference, and took a little getting used to. The first few uses left me with a face numb from the vibrations, but that&#x27;s no longer an issue after 4-5 days of use.    This product worked perfectly from the get-go, and I look forward to acing my next (long overdue) check-up.</li>
            <li> The littlest you need to know: this is a great electric toothbrush, buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare Flexcare Plus is my daily indulgence. With all the modes possible, you are free to choose one variation to suit your mood at use time. From the more intensive and longer \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; to the \\&quot;Refresh\\&quot; mode, there&#x27;s something here for even the most rushed of users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts for an inordinately long time--for me, about a week&#x27;s worth of morning-only brushings without recharging. With a replaceable head, identifiable with colored bands, different people can use the same base, very cool. Although the cost of replacement heads makes a cheapskate like me less eager to switch out, the heads are very long-lasting nevertheless making it a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a regular viewer of the Mythbusters show, you&#x27;ll no doubt have seen the episode dealing with toothbrush hygiene and how ridiculously difficult it is to keep germs, especially of the fecal kind, off the brush head. Well, the Flexcare plus comes with an Ultraviolet brush head sanitizer. I don&#x27;t know how effective it truly is--you&#x27;d need a microbiologist on hand for that--it gives you a good feeling nevertheless to know you&#x27;re brushing with a sanitized brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the included hard case and a travel charger, this toothbrush is portable and ready to go wherever you go. There really isn&#x27;t anything I would disparage about the Flexcare Plus. It makes brushing easier and more efficient, all without too much thought. What&#x27;s not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended and five stars!</li>
            <li> Probally the best electric toothbrush that ive ever used. I would recomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have owned this toothbrush for a week now. I was also considering the Oral-B 5000, and I can&#x27;t be happier with purchasing the Sonicare Flexcare Plus. After the standard 2 min brushing cycle I have been doing a minute gum care cycle in my routine too. My teeth feel perfectly clean and gums feel great. My girlfriend stated that my teeth look a lot whiter and I am an avid coffee drinker. Oddly enough when I went to my dentist yesterday I overheard him recommending this toothbrush by name to a patient before me. It kinda made me chuckle. This toothbrush has impressed me so much I actually just picked up a second for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> I just recently upgraded my original Sonicare Advanced toothbrush to this FlexCare Plus and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  It is so much more compact, light, and feels great in the hand while brushing.  The 5 different options for brushing make it completely personalized based on the type of brush you want to accomplish.  Also, I couldn&#x27;t even believe that there was a UV sanitizer, which makes me feel like my toothbrush is clean every time I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is by far the best toothbrush I have used and maybe even seen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, due the longevity of my last toothbrush by Sonicare (7+ years and didn&#x27;t break), I can imagine that this one will last even longer!  I have to clarify that I didn&#x27;t upgrade because my last toothbrush broke either.  It was simply time for an upgraded brush.</li>
            <li> I really find that this electric toothbrush cleans my teeth much better than I can do by hand. My hands have arthritis and don&#x27;t provide the ability to get to the difficult areas of the mouth. My dentist said she uses the Sonicare and I am glad I spent the money to get it.</li>
            <li> This is the best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I previously had a Braun Oral B Pro Care set that lasted over three years, and this one totally blows it out the water. Amazing toothbrush, but the handle broke after 4 months. Phillips is sending me a replacement because it&#x27;s still under warranty, but considering all the other reviews complaining about the same thing, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one. I&#x27;ll be lucky if the replacement handle will last me a year. Once this one dies, I&#x27;m heading back to Braun.</li>
            <li> PROS:  1) Clean like an electric toothbrush - polishes well  2) 4 quadrants timer!! I needed that when I am still waking up in the morning... helps to know when I am done with each quadrant.  3) Sensitive, massaging, etc.      CONS:   1) Expensive  2) CHEAP Carrying case. Prefer a less plasticky one!</li>
            <li> OMG this Sonicare is fantastic! I should&#x27;ve gotten it a long time ago! It was recommended to me, and I highly recommend it to anyone out there who&#x27;s considering it! Don&#x27;t delay! You&#x27;ll regret it!</li>
            <li> The sonic part takes a little getting used to but now that I&#x27;ve had it awhile I wouldn&#x27;t want any other toothbrush. I&#x27;m glad bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Philips Sonicare electronic toothbrush religiously for the last two years and the state of my gums has improved immensely.  I no longer get lectures about the proper way to brush or hear dire warnings about gingivitis at the dentist&#x27;s office.  This latest model isn&#x27;t too much different than last year&#x27;s though there are a few minor upgrades and all of the Sonicare brand toothbrushes are fine dental hygiene products  worth their high price.  But you still have to floss!  Though my gums got a good report at my last dentist visit they did discover the first cavity I&#x27;ve had in years between two back molars which my dentist asserts could have been prevented by thorough flossing.  My teeth feel so clean after a Sonicare brushing I sometimes neglect the flossing step.</li>
            <li> just got a toothbrush like this for the first time.  Blew my mind.  I can never use another.</li>
            <li> Could not have asked for a better product. Worth the money. Walk away from the product everyday feeling like you just got home from a professional teeth cleaning!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, per her dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  She has periodontal issues and this sonic toothbrush is fantastic for her.  It is much gentler, yet more effective in cleaning between her teeth and gums.  I&#x27;m going to buy myself one of these.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and was extremely happy with it for the first couple of months.  Then, the handle no longer would hold or take a charge.  The manufacturer&#x27;s website, suggested returning it to the store where it was purchased.  This was not really an option since it was a gift.  I looked on the site to see about getting it serviced, but no luck there either.  The site had a \\&quot;live chat\\&quot; option, but no agents were available according to the chat application.      Bottom line is that it was a really nice product when it worked, it failed early and the manufacturer does not seem to interested in supporting it.  Even though I liked the product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another, and I would likely think hard before I bought another product by this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have heard about these toothbrushes and wish I would have ordered it sooner. What an amazing brushing experience. This toothbrush really does give you that \\&quot;fresh from the dentist\\&quot; feel. I can imagine going back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> With a manual toothbrush, I could feel plaque on my teeth just a couple hours after brushing. With my sonicare, I love feeling my teeth throughout the day. If you want a refresher, there are different options you can choose from. Just all around the best toothbrush I have ever had. I have had my sonicare for a little over a month now and nothing seems to be wrong with it. Although I wish it came with more replaceable heads than one.[[ASIN:B003O9TN2A Philips Sonicare Flexcare+ with UV Sanitizer HX6992]]</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I had a Oral-B prior to using this Sonicare the Sonicare is much better.</li>
            <li> This design is far superior to the older one where liquid could leak in to the brush assembly resulting in mold growth.    I also really like the sanitizer as it provides an extra level of protection against most germs on my brush head.</li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare flexcare toothbrush for almost 4 years , I fall in love with this toothbrush right away, I tired all kind of electric toothbrushes (more than 10), flexcare by far is the best,the feeling of refreshness is no comparison.    Now come to the bad part, my old my trusty flexcare is still going strong, but the silver foil is chipping,so I decided to buy a new one , I go for \\&quot;Flexcare plus\\&quot; thinking it will be slightly better.      What a mistake! when I got the flexcare plus, right at first try, I felt the difference, the plus is less powerful and  didn&#x27;t clean my teeth properly, I though my feeling is fooling me (the plus is much quieter than my 4 years old flexcare) , I did a water test, I put both toothbrushes into  a pot of water, both full charged, turn them on, see how water splashes.    the old one making a small turbulence , but the plus shows just almost nothing.    so I returned it, Amazon did a great job, they sent me the replacement unit right away. (in 2 days)      I did the same test, this replacement plus generates the same wimpy stokes.    If you use the flexcare before, I strongly NOT recommend this toothbrush.  (only flexcare plus, I don&#x27;t know how current flexcare works)    By the way, even with less powerful stokes, felxcare plus is still a very good toothbrush compare to others, It just not up to the standard set by my 4-years old flexcare, That&#x27;s why I gave it a 3-stars.</li>
            <li> The first two times I used this it tickled my mouth so much I wondered if I could keep using it, but by the third brushing that all went away and I just enjoyed the clean smooth feeling it gave my teeth. I love this brush and all the different settings especially the timer so I know when I have brushed long enough. Excellent product and speedy fast delivery</li>
            <li> My teeth became 20% whiter in days and so did my girlfriends. It&#x27;s light, easy and thorough! Amazon wants me to write twenty words to qualify for a review but frankly I don&#x27;t have much more to say about a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Great product, but no longer functions after about a month of ownership. I&#x27;ve owned a number of Sonicare products, but the last two have failed relatively quickly ( 1 month, 7 months, respectively ). The total operating costs ( replacement brush heads seem pretty pricey, also )of these products and what would appear to be deteriorating quality are hard to stomach, even if they do keep my teeth super shiny.</li>
            <li> I really like the Flexcare + toothbrush - it has so many features I haven&#x27;t learned them all.  It has different speeds for softer brushing, massage and sensitive modes.  It also has two chargers and a sterilizer.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for the money, much cheaper than those at retail stores that I looked at.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here --it arrived so quickly also, I was pleasantly surprised.  I rate this purchase A-One and this seller AAAAAA!!!  I&#x27;m buying another for my husband!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is outstanding, does everything it described and more!   Easy to use, gets my teeth cleaner than I&#x27;ve ever been able to accomplish; and the gum treatment sequence is an added plus.  I heartily recommend this model, especially if you&#x27;ve never used an electric one before.      WER</li>
            <li> Just as expected, this model improves on previous models. Love the different selections for program length and intensity of the oscillations. Really makes your teeth feel clean!!</li>
            <li> If you hate going to the dentist but love how your teeth feel after having your teeth cleaned this tooth brush is for you.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended.  As I&#x27;m aging, my gums were receding.  I thought I was doing a good job brushing until I purchased and used the Sonicare... what a difference and it looks like I won&#x27;t have to see a periodontist!  Just purchased one for my son.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush a month ago.  I had braces put onto my teeth and brushing with the Sonicare toothbrush makes brushing an ease.  I love the different programs it has to choose from and I do use them all!!  I have noticed a huge difference in the color of my teeth (whiter) and the elimination of plaque build up behind my front teeth. I drink a lot of tea each day and there are no tea stains at all since I have been using this brush.  I wish I had purchased it years ago!  Well worth the money.  Love the ultraviolet cleaning station, no germs on my brush!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is far more powerful than my preceding one and the narrow head lets me clean harder to get at areas.  I also like the four brushing modes and sanitizing feature.  While I don&#x27;t get charged any less for dental visits, I do not have near the plaque and haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase! Before having the Sonicare Flexcare, I would only brush my teeth once per day with your typical $4 toothbrush from CVS. Now, every time I enter my bathroom the flexcare staring me in the eye. It&#x27;s like the herion to a herion addict. I must brush my teeth whenever I come in contact with my flexcare! The dentist clean feeling it gives, is addicting and boosts my confidence ensuring me my teeth are squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, anyone looking to purchase this toothbrush... you will not regret it :)</li>
            <li> Have used this toothbrush since July 2012 and really liked it, however it just died after almost 3 years of use.  It&#x27;s too bad that because I haven&#x27;t had any cavities since using it, and it also helped with gingivitis.  I wish it had more than a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare line of toothbrushes for a few years now and recently upgraded after my old one finally burnt out.  Much like other products in the same family, the Sonicare \\&quot;brushing style\\&quot; can be unusual at first, but after a day or two you&#x27;ll barely notice a thing.  The brushing does great work and your teeth and gums and made a noticeable difference, especially to my dentist who made mention of it on my next visit.  I really do like the hard case travel kit with this edition.  It&#x27;s a huge improvement over the soft cases of previous models, and should go a long way to keeping my brush safe when I travel (which I do a lot).  I think I may have gone a little overboard purchasing this model though.  The UV Sanitizer seems like a nice add-on but I&#x27;ve barely used it since I&#x27;ve gotten this product.  Seemed like overkill to me, but perhaps I can start trying to use it again.  Additionally, I&#x27;ve yet to find a use for all of the different brushing \\&quot;modes\\&quot; and tend to keep it on \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; 99% of the time.  Still, its a fantastic brush and one that I can directly attribute to healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> I had the Sonicare Essence and I hated it! I used it only for a week and could not stand how vigorously it brushed my teeth. What a waste of money!    But I love, love this Sonicare Flexcare Plus! It cleans gently and it looks so chic on my counter :)     Granted I just had it for a few days so I cant comment on the longevity of the toothbrush. I hope it will last me a few years!</li>
            <li> I liked it better than the top model Oral B electric toothbrush but then it broke after only five months...</li>
            <li> Years ago, I purchased the original SoniCare.  I used that SoniCare for years, without problems, until the battery stopped.  I loved the &#x27;sonic&#x27; vibration, and I had very few dental problems.  When I shopped to replace my toothbrush system, I decided to try the Oral B &#x27;rotating&#x27; system.  I used the Oral B system for almost 1 year and was very unhappy... I had more dental problems, and my teeth never felt clean... so I shopped Amazon to find the BEST (and most expensive) SoniCare currently being sold.  I decided to buy the SoniCare Flexcare Plus &#x27;sonic&#x27; system... I was sold on the compact size of the Flexcare Plus, and I was especially pleased with the antimicrobial light that magically dissipated germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have had the Flexcare Plus for about 13 months.  I never write reviews, but I felt it was important enough.... so here I sit.  To me, my experience is so important I must let others know, so you can make the right decision.  Here is what I experienced over the last 13 months.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SoniCare Flexcare Plus system is smaller than the first SoniCare I purchase years ago.  I mention this because the sonic vibration created by the new style so much less than the sonic vibration produced by my original SoniCare.  I am not an engineer, but my guess is the smaller sized handled reduced the space needed for the maximum movement of the metal shaft.  Yes, you may get the same, or even more vibrations per second... but I am convinced that the overall sonic range was less on the new design.  Additionally, my visits to the dentist show multiple new problems, serious problems such as deep root and deep gum problems.  Since I&#x27;ve been using the new Flexcare design, I have also needed two new crowns... not because the crowns were old or failing, but because bacteria had entered underneath and into the nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had other problems with the new Flexcare system.  First, I have had problems with the antibacterial &#x27;light&#x27;.  The light works about 50% of the time.  At one point, I thought the bulb needed replacement, but upon further fideting, I discovered the bulb would come on when I tapped the unit.  The second, bigger problem is the vibrating shaft has loosened.  The &#x27;sonic vibration&#x27; has slowly reduced over time due to the loose shaft... finally, last week, the shaft stopped vibrating completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok... The unit has a 2-year warranty.  I will see how great the Customer Service team responds to my service call.  I am a consumer that detests having to call, package, ship and wait for any repair.  I prefer to pay top dollar and have NO problems.  Well, the SoniCare Flexcare Plus system was the most EXPENSIVE system available (around $170.00 dollars)....  I wanted top quality, but learned that the older model, which I could have purchased much, cheaper, would have performed better and most likely still be working.  IN ADDITION, what about the $2,900 in dental bills I&#x27;ve now accumulated?  Do you think SoniCare will help pay these bills?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary -  If you buy an electric toothbrush, I highly suggest the original SoniCare product.  It has a hefty handle, but performs so much better.  In addition, you will save mega-bucks on the original system purchase, and the replacement brushes are cheaper than the new &#x27;tiny&#x27; heads.  I learned a valuable lesson... sometimes newer is NOT better.  In addition, more gadgets equate to potential repair problems.  Keep it simple, save money and purchase the Original SoniCare or Original Oral-B systems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after I discuss my problems with Customer Care... sorry, I need to run, I have a dental appointment!t one point, I thought the bulb needed replacement, but upon further fideting, I discovered the bulb would come on when I tapped the unit.

            <li> My wife and I have used the same power tooth brush for about 13 years. Yes, 13 years for one power tooth brush. When it went bad we hated to use a manual brush and decided to purchase this brush since it had good reviews. We also found out that our son owns a Sonicare and is very satisfied with his brush as well.  This brush is amazing!!  The cleaning and feeling of clean after using it make you want to brush. We have used this new brush for about a week now and we both feel we have made a good decision on an excellent product.  Expensive, yes, but how valuable are your teeth?? When you break it down over the years of service we expect to get from this brush it is not that big a deal.  We would recommend this item to everyone.</li>
            <li> So much better than my standard tooth brush! I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for 1 month today, but your teeth will thank you after the first brush! This thing makes brushing FUN!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.   If was worth the price.   I can tell a difference in my gums already and it REALLY cleans my teeth.    We are going to order another one for our vacation house!</li>
            <li> The greatest toothbrush I have ever had. It was a bummer when the battery stopped holding a charge after almost a year.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work well while it lasted, but it lasted only four months.  I was using it on the &#x27;clean&#x27; setting when it began emitting a high-pitched whine and then the motion of the brush head reduced to the point the &#x27;vibration&#x27; was barely perceptible.  Thought it might have reverted to the &#x27;easy start&#x27; mode, but went through the process for &#x27;activating/deactivating&#x27; easy start and it made no difference.  Very disappointing............  UPDATE:  Contacted Phillips.  They are sending me a replacement handle under the warranty.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare flexcare cleans better than any other model that I have used before. My teeth were whiter and my mouth felt much cleaner. The only downside is that the UV bulb sometimes does not come on properly. It is definately worth the price for how well it works on your teeth and gums. I am a long time philips user.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, easy to use, dependable and very sanitary.  The unit is also ideal to share with family members.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;standard&#x27; design of the brush head combined with the up and down motion of the toothbrush worked really well for the front side of the teeth.  The back side of the teeth however was another matter altogether.  I found maintaining the correct brush head orientation on the back side of the teeth difficult if not impossible.  Ended up returning the product.</li>
            <li> This product does everything that it says it will.  It leaves my teeth feeling like they were just cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office, it even gets in between my teeth.  It is very easy to use.  I highly recommend it.  Amazon.com is always easy to order from, and I received the product in just a few days.  All-in-all, a great experience.</li>
            <li> The unit broke within 3 months. I have the older Sonicare Elite model and it is still running after 3 years, but this newer, lighter flexcare plus model seems to be more prone to failures. Since the unit is within 90 day full refund warranty, i can get the full refund, but will have to pay for the return shipping and the whole process will take 3 months! Personally i did not notice or feel any difference in dental care between the older elite and newer flexcare+ models. I say, go for the older ones since they last longer and perform just as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush-the best that Philips makes and after a few months the handle stopped vibrating.  I contacted the company who said they would send a replacement handle.  After waiting 2 weeks I contacted the company and was told it is on backorder and they had no idea how long before it would be in stock.  I asked to be sent another model until my replacement came in.  They said no.  I now have a $200 manual toothbrush.  Customer service stinks.  Go for the Braun instead.</li>
            <li> OK.  Had to be replaced under warranty.  Electric tooth brushes never seem to last more than 2 to 3 years.  My dentist recommends a vibrating brush head rather than a rotating head, hence selected this.  Rather expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended this. It takes about a week to get use to it but now I love it.  Amazon had the lowest price by far (better than BB&amp;B with 20% off).</li>
            <li> Purchased this product along with the Oral-B Professional Care Smart Series 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush for myself and my girlfriend.  I have owned each for about 8 months now and I have to say that each brush has its own pros and cons, but this brush is my personal favorite.  The Oral-B is gentler and easier to use (difficult to use improperly), but tends to develop mess on the exterior and interior and is not as robust as the Sonicare.  The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes more adjustment on the part of the operator.  I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  The ability to us the brush on your tongue is a definite plus as well.  Purchased Philips Sonicare HX6023 ProResults Compact Brush Heads, 3pk along with the brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product the single best thing I have done to improve my dental heath period --- highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I took my time researching the internet for the best toothbrush on the market before selecting Phillips sonicare. I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance and am pleased with my selection. IT does everything it is advertised to do,</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  It takes a little bit to get used to at first, however, once you get used to the vibrations then you really get a much better clean.  Many of my family members have Sonicare brushes and highly recommended to have the cleaning system whenever I was researching for mine.      After only a few weeks of use I can already tell a difference in my gums, which generally did not get a proper cleaning with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had a first generation sonicare. Battery finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. This new version is much more effective is removing stain and plaque. Recommend the compact brush. Travel holder is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Greatly improves oral hygiene, easy to use and keeps your teeth deeply clean. I love everything about my sonicare except: I wish the Philips would find a way to make the batteries easily replaceable.  My previous sonicare only lasted a couple of years and I had to replace it with this one. This life cycle is too short for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used the original Sonicare toothbrush for about 6 years until I noticed my dentist had this model sitting in his office at my last check up so I was intrigued. Of course, the original will still do the trick but Phillips seems to have figured out all of the flaws of their original design and made the sonic toothbrush twice as good, including a sleeker, smaller design. The biggest complaint I had of the original was the mold that would build up on the inside of the handle unless you cleaned it meticulously on a regular basis. (I know, gross but even if you replace your brush head every 3 months like recommended it&#x27;s easy to forget to clean out the moisture inside which can build up into mold). That problem is solved with a snap-in brush head instead of the hollow screw on replacement head. What got me excited about this toothbrush was the UV light which plugs right in like normal and next to it, you can charge the toothbrush base. This UV light sanitizes the brush in as little as 10 minutes and it&#x27;s not large and clunky. The motor on this model is also much quieter compared to the original which is a plus. Overall, I have had better check ups at the dentist over the past few years because of the Sonicare toothbrush and while my dentist will agree that you don&#x27;t need the fancy UV light to have healthier gums, this is a definite upgrade that was well worth the investment on my part. I love the bonus of a built-in sanitizer on my toothbrush! If you&#x27;re just investing in a sonic toothbrush, this is well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush.  They just keep getting better.  This new FlexCare is more complex to operate but does a superior job.  Recommended by my dental technician.</li>
            <li> I have two of this brush. Both can&#x27;t hold longer than 8months. I got a replacement from Philips but its broken now as well. Can I get another replacement?</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush which has numerous modes. As I am not a man of many words, I will say this: \\&quot;It is by far the best toothbrush I have ever owned.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the Soniccare.  I used a Oral-B cleaner for the last six years.  After my son saying get a new toothbrusher cleaner.  I bought this Soniccare toothbrush.  My teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean.  The Soniccare hurt my gums that i had to see the dentist for the pain.  Needless to say, I went back to my Oral-B that has served me well for the last six years.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush. Design of where the mode select button is was not fully thought out.   Otherwise love it. Travel case is awesome.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 8/11: The replacement died after 6 months. What a piece of garbage.    ----------------    Broke after 10 months. Something internally broke, makes buzzing/rattling sound and does not vibrate anymore as it should. I chatted with Philips and after long series of rather tiresome questions they promised a replacement. Will see. Virtually every Philips product I ever bought broke. DVD player. Died. Electric kettle. Died. Toothbrush. Died. At least within warranty.</li>
            <li> At the frequent nagging of my dentist, I finally sprang for this, and bought it at the dentist&#x27;s office for a slight discount. The sensation was off-putting at first, but I got used to it after a few days. It does throw off the toothpaste, so one must smear it on one&#x27;s teeth before turning the brush on. It seems to clean fairly well, and my gums do feel healthier, if nothing more. I&#x27;m not sure about whitening claims. Does the sanitizer work? Well, we have no way to tell, really. You place the brush inside the case and it glows like uranium. For $30, the replacement brushes are the big catch here, kind of the same rip off as overpriced ink for computer printers. Naturally, Phillips wants us to buy new ones every three months, but I suspect that could be stretched to six months. Still, if you are making the big switch to electric, you have no choice but to buy them periodically. I&#x27;m sure their actual cost is pennies. If you care to drop over $100 on a toothbrush, this appears to have the endorsement of many dentists.</li>
            <li> Got the toothbrush on a very timely manner--two days!  Our dentist recommended it.  I like the idea that it has a sterlization unit.  The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; side is that the charger does not fit in the travel case.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is really incredible. At first I was leery of the built in timer but I realized soon that without it I was spending more than two minutes longer brushing my teeth so I quickly turned the timer back on.  The UV cleaner does quite well but sometimes it seems that I should let the brush head dry a little more because if I put it in right after brushing when I get home form work/school the head is damp.</li>
            <li> Like several reviewers on here, my unit broke after a year.  One day, the vibration was suddenly weaker to the point of being barely perceptible.  The previous design lasted me for years.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Phillips sonicare hx6972/10 flexcare rechargeable electric toobrush. There is obviously a short as batteries are changed every week. Because we have had it more than one month CVS Pharmacy will not exchange it or let us return it for a credit.</li>
            <li> Last year, I had $20,000 worth of dental work done. Needless to say, I need to protect that work and prevent having to go through it again. I have some problematic teeth so I splurged and got this toothbrush. I&#x27;m not really an electric toothbrush aficionado, so I don&#x27;t know from one to the other. All I know is that this one is great because it doesn&#x27;t vibrate so much that it hurts or makes my head feel like it&#x27;s full of bees, but it really gets my teeth clean. The massage setting soothes my gums, which don&#x27;t like being brushed, and that two minute timer is a Godsend (I am five, apparently, and I need to be reminded how long to brush). And it&#x27;s really nice to have the blue light aspect, because bacteria is my No 1 enemy. My dentist actually noticed a difference after only a week of using this. When this one finally dies someday I will definitely get another.</li>
            <li> I could quote you the troubleshooting tree for this model by heart because I had the same phone call every 6-12 months. Try this, plug in that. Ok, it&#x27;s broken, we&#x27;ll send you a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What baffles me is that the warranty is from the day of original purchase. That means this last time when it died, with a nearly $200 toothbrush breaking after barely 6 months of use since last replacement, the conversation concluded with a \\&quot;sorry.\\&quot; Now I have a rather expensive, unrecyclable brick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes down to a question of return on investment. This model has proved to not meet it for me.</li>
            <li> I have been through numerous spinning toothbrushes but this one is by far the very best. It really seems to get my teeth the very cleanest.</li>
            <li> At the beginning it was a little hard to get used to it since it vibrates a lot, but after a week you get used to it.  after 2 weeks of use, I saw obvious improvement in my gum health!!! As they say on the ad this is not a lie. I have very bad quality teeth and my gums were very high, but after using this toothbrush for just two weeks, my gums have come down and I can see very obvious improvement.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!! WORTH THE INVESTMENT!!</li>
            <li> Amazing toothbrush.  It leaves you with a \\&quot;straight from the dentist\\&quot; feeling each time you use it.  I never though I would spend this much money on a toothbrush, but I splurged on it and now I&#x27;m recommending this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Pretty much everything is all good EXCEPT... for me I keep pressing the on/off button as I brush my teeth.  Either the button is located in a poor position, or the button is way too sensitive.  I find myself pressing the button to turn it back on as I am brushing my teeth.  Can definitely be a pain in the rear, for me.</li>
            <li> The Soncare FlexCare Plus was recommended by my dental hygienist.  I already notice an improvement in my gums after only using for one month!!  This is a product I will continue to use and have recommended to other relatives and friends.</li>
            <li> By far the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Love all the different modeson it. Leaves my teeth super clean!</li>
            <li> If you want a cordless tooth brush, with, UV protection. Then this is the one for you! As always the directions are down right useless and barely readable. So is the travel case. Other than that it is simple to use, works great has easy useful functions and operates effortlessly. I like most every Phillips/Norellco product that I own. However; its always the same issues with this company. When will they get the packaging, directions and travel cases right I&#x27;ll never know. If Phillips/Norellco ever does fix these issues they wont have any competition. Seems like a simple no brain er to me but mission impossible to Phillips/Norellco. Even with these issues this is the top of the line Cadillac of cordless tooth brushes. I doubt if you will regret this purchase. Enjoy your tooth brush!  Update: over 3 years old now still perfect! and 5 years of daily use! There&#x27;s not to many quality products anymore but anything Phillips/Norelco lasts!</li>
            <li> My Oral Hygenist recommended this to me because I have bacteria in my gums and this is supposed to get rid of that.  It tickles at first but you stop noticing after a bit.  Gotta say works great would recommend even to other family members.  Even my girlfriend says she notices a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> We bought this toothbrush looking at all the positive reviews. It worked properly until a few days ago. It continues to make a sound as if it&#x27;s working, but there are no vibrations of any kind in the brush itself. It is like brushing your teeth with a regular brush, plus the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In total this brush lasted us a little less than 4 months! It is definitely NOT worth the $140.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent electric toothbrush. I&#x27;ve used the ones you buy in the grocery store and this is sooooo much better.  I used to own a much older Sonicare and didn&#x27;t use it every day.  Again, this is sooooo much better.  It is much slimmer and fits into my hands nicely.  I like the different settings and it holds a charge well; I took it on a five day trip without a problem.  I brush my teeth even more now than I ever did and even floss more.    The UV sanitizer is nice and gives me peace of mind knowing my brush is clean.  I just put it in, push the button, and the next morning all is well.    This is one of the few great products one manages to purchase these days.</li>
            <li> I bought my brush in March 2011 and it suddenly stopped working randomly in September 2013. The handle simply stopped moving the brush head back and forth like it used to and just makes noise. I contacted support and of course they said that it&#x27;s out of warranty and they don&#x27;t sell just the handle, so I&#x27;d have to go buy the whole kit again. I liked it when it worked, but for the initial purchase price, plus the cost of brush replacements I&#x27;m going to look elsewhere for my next brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush last April after my last Sonicare toothbrush finally died after almost ten years of use.  Unfortunately, this new one was much more short-lived.  If I had rated it right after I got it, it would have received five stars as I liked all the features and, according to my hygienist, it did a great job cleaning my teeth.  Especially liked that I could take it with me traveling for short trips without having to bring a charger.  However, now, suddenly, the vibrations are so slowed and weak that I might as well be using a manual toothbrush.  I called Philips Sonicare and they are sending me a new toothbrush free of charge.  Based on some other reviews, I am concerned this problem is not an isolated case and I am hoping I won&#x27;t have to replace it repeatedly.  During the two year warranty period, this would be merely annoying but I would expect a toothbrush that costs this much to last well beyond the warranty period.  If all is OK with the replacement brush after several years of use, I will update my rating to more stars.    UPDATING this review.  I have had to replace the handle five times since my original purchase.  That&#x27;s an average of over once per year.   It was under warranty the first two times only.   Finally giving up and buying an Oral B.   Not only is replacing the handle expensive, it is increasingly hard to find.  Philips Sonicare will not sell a replacement handle; they reserve them for warranty replacements.   Too bad, because while it works, it is great.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this toothbrush. I love having multiple settings for different functions- including the quick setting if I&#x27;m in a hurry or on the go.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush.  I really like the features.  I pretty much use Clean,GumCare,and Massage.  Its great because I really feel like my teeth are clean after.  Before I brush I use my Waterpik Ultra Flosser and together they are a strong team in cleaning my teeth. I clean my brush head after every use in the UV Sanitizer and clean the sanitizer as instructed once a week.  The brush holds an excellent charge and Im even thinking of leaving it off the charger during the day to not over charge the battery.  I really like the hard travel case.  I have not had to use it but I see no problems with it as far as cleaning it or it opening during travel.  My only complaint which is a bit frustrating is the blue bristles, after three uses, starting fading.  Now I know it says you replace the brush heads every three months but it also says that the blue bristles are a marker for when the heads should be changed.  By the end of one month the blue was all the way down.  The bristles seem fine and still firm enough to continue but I feel its a bit misleading.  Whatever the case may be I will be sticking to changing the heads every 3 months even if the blue markers fade early.  To change these brush heads every month is a bit too expensive for me to keep up with.  I was curious about the Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush but noticed it didnt have the UV Sanitizer.  Since it was a lot more expensive I felt this was just more practical.</li>
            <li> I reviewed electric toothbrushes on the net, and this one came up the best. I had been using an Oral-B, but it was getting to the end of its life. Well the Phillips Sonicare is the &#x27;best&#x27;. It leaves your mouth feeling like you have just been to the dental hygienist. The timer,ultra violet light for decontaminating the toothbrush head, the travel pack, these are just some of the features I like. Dislikes you ask? To date know I just enjoy the post brushing experience. A phillips Electric Toothbrushes in the home is like having yur own dental therapist and chair.</li>
            <li> this is the 3rd Phillips I have owned and all have been key to keepin my gums and teeth healthy.  would, couldn&#x27;t do without it</li>
            <li> After reviewing information on several electric toothbrushes, I ordered this one.  I love it!  I feel like my teeth are getting the best care in a long time.  Everytime I brush with this toothbrush, my teeth feel like I just got a cleaning at the dentist.  I love the different levels you can use when brushing.  I started with the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; level for the first two weeks and then switched to regular cleaning.  I had read that sometimes it takes the gums a few weeks to get used to the electric toothbrush.  I loved this toothbrush so much, I bought one for my Mother for Mother&#x27;s Day and she loves it also.  To be honest, this is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used so I have nothing to compare it to.  But I would highly recommend it.  It also has a travel case that is perfect!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cleaner feeling mouth and better results from a toothbrush, this is the one you wnat to buy! I love mine and will NEVER go back to a manual toothbrush! The Sonicare is the most efficient way to taking excellent care of your teeth this toothbrush is it!  I have noticed a huge difference just with the color of my teeth and my dentist is pleased with the condition of my teeth since I started using this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is our 2nd Sonicare, since the purchase of the Sonicare Elite with over 6 yrs of great performance, it was time to try the newest from Sonicare.  Cleaning performance is about the same, although the head design is much better and doesn&#x27;t get build up under the base.  The UV is a nice added feature and it even comes with a travel case. A+!</li>
            <li> I owned an older Philips Sonicare and loved it; this one is much better!  My teeth feel really clean after using it and my teeth looked whiter after just a couple days!  I love the timer on it and the fact that you can do 2 or 3 minutes.  Also, if you have sensitive teeth or just want to massage your gums, there&#x27;s a setting for those.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Am happy to have this toothbrush system.  HOWEVER, the light bulb didn&#x27;t work and a replacement was to be sent within ten days.  That has not been received and it&#x27;s been many more than ten days.  Perhaps it&#x27;s the VERY slow mail over the Holidays?</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a reference to our dentist.  My husband needed alot of his plaque removed and she said this item would work.  He did not like the feeling of the vibration, so I gladly tried it out. I love how my teeth feel every morning and evening.  I have seen a reduced amount of blood from brushing.  We had to buy another one since the first product came damaged.  The carrying case and the UV light did not work.  Amazon quickly refunded our first one and gave us a free shipping label for return.  I am glad I spent the money for a great clean and hopefully less time at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have always been somewhat lazy about tooth care. This is a toothbrush I look forward to using. It feels like I just came from the dentist after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT investment in your dental hygiene. I have had this for only a few days and it knocks the pants off of my old Sonicare Elite that I have had for almost 5 years. New Flexcares are the way to go in my opinion. The look and feel of this tooth brush is very high tech and sleek. In comparing the Elite model with the Flexcare plus I have noticed a tremendous amount of improvements.  The first is the Procare brush heads that come with this toothbrush.  They are slightly more course (which I like) than the original brush heads that I bought for my Elite.  They also have a blue strip on them which diminishes in time to signal when you need to replace the brush head. It just feels like my teeth are cleaner than when I used the Elite. Also the 5 modes of cleaning you can choose from compared to only one with my Elite. The quadpacer feature is pretty nice.  It is basically a small and short beep every 30 seconds to signal you when you should switch brushing from one quadrant of your teeth to another.  And the last thing that leapt out at me was the UV sanitizer built in to the charger. After 5 years with one model, I was growing paranoid about the cleanliness even though you change up brush heads. Some added accessories come in very handy if you travel a lot. A miniature travel case with an extra brush head and a miniature charger come with this purchase. I highly recommend this item to anybody.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son.  He doesn&#x27;t have dental insurance. My version of this toothbrush has been a significant help on my dental cleaning that I decided my boys needed the benefit as well.  Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Has performed flawlessly. Have gotten very good check ups.</li>
            <li> Ordered this toothbrush at the recommendation of a family member.  Have used it for a little more than a week, and so far love it.  My teeth and gums are sensitive, and I can already feel an improvement, especially in my gums.  The 5 different brushing modes are great.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a good sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great leaves your teeth feeling nice and smooth. It was worth the money I have had mine for over 6 months with no issues. Battery will last for slightly longer than a week before being charged.</li>
            <li> BACKGROUND:  I have been using the [[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]] (see my previous review for a detailed write up) for about a year and a half before getting the FlexCare Plus with the UV Sanitizer.  For this review, I will highlight the differences between the two models as well as comment on the UV Sanitizer, and I will conclude with an overall recommendation between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SETUP:  Much like previous units, this is a breeze.  Simply plug in the base sanitizer/charging unit combo and place the base handle on the peg to begin charging.  The instructions recommend charging 24 hours prior to the first use, but I doubt this is necessary given that the brush will only be used minutes a day and likely be able to charge 23 hours minimum every day that you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For multiple users, Philips again includes the standard colored rings to distinguish one brush head from another.  For this unit, Philips includes both a standard and a compact brush head.  These compare well with manual toothbrushes so it&#x27;s a matter of preference.  However, some will find it nice to try out both sizes before ordering new brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE:  The basic operation of the FlexCare Plus is the same as the previous model.  It uses the same Quadpacer signal in thirty second intervals over two minutes in the \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode.  It seemed to me that this unit pulses a little faster, yet it is also quieter while running.  You can still discern the signal when it is time to change \\&quot;zones\\&quot; on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips did a nice job of simplifying the mode selection over the previous FlexCare model.  There are five modes to choose from:  Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage.  This is much more user friendly than the previous model&#x27;s Clean, Sensitive, and Massage modes paired with the separate routines of Go Care and Max Care.  I stick to the Clean mode for the most part, but the Refresh is a nice one minute version of Clean if you doing a simple between brushing touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the UV Sanitizer, I am not able to do a scientific test of whether or not it provides added benefit.  I did some research that suggests that UV Sanitizers are effective, but that is taking someone else&#x27;s word for it.  What I can say is that it does operate as the instructions indicate.  Once you remove the brush head and insert it into the peg stand and close the door, pressing the power button once starts a 10 minute cycle that shuts off automatically.  The blue light is fairly bright and much larger than the green battery indicator on the main brushing unit.  If you use this right before bed, you will probably want to close your bathroom door to avoid having the nice blue glow in your bedroom.  I did find that after the 10 minute cycle was complete, the brush head was dry as far as I could tell.  This is important since the sanitizer becomes a closed container, and excess water could cause mold/mildew.  In the end I can&#x27;t offer any negatives on the UV Sanitizer which is good because (as of this writing) the only FlexCare Plus model you can by is this one.  There is currently no standalone model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is rated for 42 two minute brushings, but I don&#x27;t think most people will ever put this to the test.  An individual would have to be away from home for three solid weeks and not take their travel charger to drain the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACCESSORIES:  One of the things I criticized on my older FlexCare brush was the soft travel case.  Philips stepped up on the FlexCare Plus and added a hard plastic case that holds the base unit and two brush heads.  They also include a travel charger, which is nice, but you would only need this for an extended trip away from home with the increased battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRAWBACKS:  There really aren&#x27;t any.  Some may find the price steep, but you do get what you pay for.  Perhaps offering a unit without the UV Sanitizer could lower the pricesome, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect a large difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:  Philips has done what all manufacturers should strive to do in the next generation of a product.  They kept what worked and made improvements in the shortcomings of the prior version.  After having used a Sonicare FlexCare brush for over a year and a half, I highly recommend this model to anyone looking for a new power toothbrush.  If you have the older FlexCare model, I would wait until it is time to replace your old one before upgrading as the differences, while improvements, are not substantial.some, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect a large difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:  Philips has done what all manufacturers should strive to do in the next generation of a product.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about a week and am amazed at the difference between this and when I used a regular toothbrush!  I always considered myself someone with pretty good oral hygiene - brushed (with a regular toothbrush) twice a day, floss every other day.  But since using this toothbrush, my teeth feel so much cleaner, even at the end of the day right before I&#x27;m going to brush again.    My favorite aspects:  - the UV tootbrush head cleaner - kills 99% of bacteria and is really quick  - the fact that the cleaning is divided into 4 parts, 30 seconds each. It makes sure you brush for the full two minutes and get every part of your teeth.  - the travel charger that comes with it  - the fact that I know my gums are getting a great workout - it even has a setting called \\&quot;gum care\\&quot;    The best thing about it is that though it gives you a great clean, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or scratch your gums.  The bristles are soft and the toothbrush isn&#x27;t hard on your mouth.  I definitely recommend this toothbrush, you and your dentist will be much happier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush for about a month and I love it - my teeth have never felt so clean!  However, if I were to purchase again, I would choose the Sonicare Healthywhite for half the price or buy 2 of those instead of 1 of these.  You basically pay alot of money for 2 things: UV disinfection and modes.  I never used UV on my old toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve survived for 40+ years - I just make sure to rinse it well, and sometimes wash it with soap.  But it&#x27;s the \\&quot;modes\\&quot; that really seem like a waste of money - - they just make the brush run for more or less amount of time, rather than the standard 2 minutes.  Big whoop.  You can easily brush for half as long, or 50% longer . . . the thing beeps every 30 seconds . . . pretty basic.  It takes more effort to switch between modes than to simply take the darn thing out of your mouth halfway through the cleaning cycle.  WTF?  I just don&#x27;t get it. Save your money and buy the more basic model - unless you simply have to have the UV disinfection.</li>
            <li> After brushing with the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush, I feel like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned. My dental hygienist recommended this product; since using the brush my gums are healthier and no bleeding.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this Sonicare toothbrush.  You can really feel the difference after brushing.  It&#x27;s a pleasure to brush our teeth.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Pro Results toothbrush is our 3rd Sonicare, and the best yet. I say this for two reasons, 1.) The heads do not collect toothpaste, gunk, etc in the bottom like the cheaper models can. This has do with the way the head attaches, instead of screwing on with a threaded skirt, they push onto a small peg. Very easy, very clean. Plus the UV head cleaner is a nice bonus 2.) The ability to select different brushing programs for quick touch-ups, normal brushing, or longer brushing is something I have been using more and more. Definitely worth spending the extra money to get the best model Sonicare offers.</li>
            <li> After my wife and I each had a recent trip to the dentist, where the previous version to this model of electric toothbrush was demonstrated and recommended by the hygienist, I started shopping around to find exactly what I was looking for.  It quickly boiled down to a choice between this one and the comparable Oral-B model and my choice was made due to aesthetics and features; the two products seem to function pretty much same but Philips has a sleeker product with more possible options in the different packages they sell (and I was happy that my dentist gave me a $[...] mail-in rebate to sweeten the deal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  YOU BET!  It&#x27;s no joke when people tell you that you notice the difference after the first use.  My mouth is left with a \\&quot;squeeky clean\\&quot; feeling and it hasn&#x27;t changed during the few months I&#x27;ve been using this.  The UV sanitizer was a major selling feature because my wife and I can each store our separate brush heads in the sealed unit away from the circulating air (remember that this sits on the counter top in the same bathroom where the toilet flushes!) and germs are killed with the UV light after a single push of a button.  It comes with a travel case and the handle is supposed to work for 2 weeks between charges--I don&#x27;t put it back on the charger everyday, only about once a week and it&#x27;s always ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it&#x27;s a hefty sum to pay up front, but I expect my next cleaning at the dentist to last no-time.  This is a terrific product with great features and I would definitely recommend this purchase to anyone who cares about their oral hygiene!</li>
            <li> On the advice of my dental hygienist and my dentist, I purchased the flexcare plus HX6972/10 rechargeable toothbrush.  Yep- I was skeptical, and not too happy about the price...but, I love my teeth, and wanted my gums and whole mouth to be clean and healthy.  I love it! It is so easy to use, has many choices as to how you brush, easy to travel with, long charge, and my entire  family now wants their own! My teeth are less sensitive due to using this brush as opposed to my old battery operated brush. It&#x27;s a different motion and very pressure sensitive too. A great investment for my smile. My teeth are happy and so am I!</li>
            <li> This is the best Philips Sonicare I have used. I have had the older models that were more bulky.I would definitely recommend this model to anybody that would want a quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about six months ago and as other reviews note, it works very well.  I was quite happy with the purchase until one day, while sitting on the travel charge stand, the toothbrush fell over.  I had accicently bumped the stand (gently).  After that the brush no longer vibrated properly. I called Philips and they said that the brush falling off its own stand onto the counter is like my dropping it.  The warranty was of course voided. The product is not very robust and I am loath to spend another $150 with a company that cares so little for its customer.  If only REI sold this product....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched back and forth between Sonicare and Oral-B over the years. I like the fact that Sonicare is now using lithium-ion batteries, and that they offer a compact head. They seem to do a better job cleaning my teeth, which is probably why my dentist recommends them. Overall, this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.    I prefer this Flexcare Plus model because:  - The battery lasts twice as long as Flexcare models  - You can turn it on or off with just one press of the power button (the HealthyWhite models use the same button for power and mode changes)  - It doesn&#x27;t change brushing mode if I accidentally press the mode button while brushing my teeth, the way the Flexcare does  - It comes with a decent hard travel case, where the Flexcare comes with a minimal soft case  - The mode display is invisible when it&#x27;s off, which looks nice    I don&#x27;t think the UV sanitizer is needed or desirable, so I don&#x27;t use it. This model comes with a separate travel charger, but unlike the Flexcare, it doesn&#x27;t have a cord wrap.</li>
            <li> Yes, get this one cause it solved the spit-drip-down-into-the-mechanism issue.  This one works good like the others but will last longer cause spit/water won&#x27;t get inside it like the other models.    Dave Powers</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and works great even after more than six months of use.  The UV sanitizer is a nice feature since we can clean our brush heads thoroughly if we get a cold virus (of course, you can just boil the brush heads, too - but then you wouldn&#x27;t get to see the cool blue light when the sanitizer is working).  I have to say I was always skeptical of \\&quot;useless\\&quot; electronics such as juicers and electronic toothbrushes, but this Sonicare has completely changed my mind.  Even after the very first use, your teeth feel so much cleaner.  After using it for awhile, when you go back to using a regular toothbrush you will notice how different it feels, too.  And of course, my dentist is happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find that the vibration is bothersome - it&#x27;s ticklish at first and then you get used to it.  And I&#x27;m always sure to put it in my mouth before I turn it on, so that the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t go flying.</li>
            <li> Works great!The price is fair. My dentist recommended it and He was right. I have no complaints. Try it! It&#x27;s very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> It works. Started using it after dental cleaning, and continued with tea/coffee. Usually I would have stains again 5 months later but my teeth are still nice and clean.</li>
            <li> We were advised by our dentist to buy this super toothbrush. Confirmed with current owners and found that this product really does live up to the hype. It cleans almost as good as the dentist! I have sensitive gums and thought it would irritate but it feels great and gums are becoming healthy.</li>
            <li> First of all its a great brush!    My handle stopped working about 8 months after I bought it. I was nervous because I had no reciept from the purchase but called the 1-800 number and they were awesome all they needed was the serial number on the bottom and saw that I was still under warranty (2 years!) and they processed the warranty claim in about 3 minutes. They are sending me a new handle and a prepaid box to sent my old one back, for free! Thanks Phillips Sonicare. Would purchase again if it breaks after my warranty expires in another year awesome customer service!</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews of products I purchase (probably out of indifference) but in this instance, I feel compelled to state my experiences with a woeful dental product. Sonicare is touted to be the King of Brushes, but its anything but. I have had two SonicCare toothbrushes - in a bit of irony, one was given to me by a friend who was a dentist - and both broke down within a year. Whats more is that to repair these, they were going to charge me as much as it would have been to purchase a new one! (I had gone back to the store after the warranty period so I had to resort to asking about out-of-pocket costs). Whats more is that if you leave them standing near or on water, the rubber material grows mildew very quickly. Word to the wise, stay away from Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> I owned a Sonicare Elite, and it gave me many years of great service, but it was time to replace it.  I&#x27;ve had the new Sonicare FlexCare Plus for about a month now, and it&#x27;s great too.  If you want to improve your dental and overall health, then regular use of this toothbrush will help you accomplish this.  I highly recommend the Sonicare FlexCare Plus toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife over a year ago (she&#x27;s a dental assistant); she seems to like it and is still using it. No issues so far and she speaks well of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a different brand of electric toothbrush that is much cheaper and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, but don&#x27;t know how it measures up against this. This one has the UV sanitizer, which is a nice feature... something I occasionally commandeer for my own brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who once thought that electric toothbrushes were a gimmick and were not worth the money.  I really didn&#x27;t want to pay over $100 for a TOOTHBRUSH. This toothbrush was recommended to me by my Dental Hygienist.  She showed me the power the Sonicare has and stated it would really help me with the inflammation of my gums.  I researched for several months as I still wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth over $100.  I decided to buy a much cheaper rechargable electric toothbrush first to see if I liked it.  I noticed immediately that the other toothbrush wasn&#x27;t as powerful as the Sonicare model the hygienist showed me. I then decided it was time to invest in this brush.  I have to say, it&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.  My mouth feels so clean, just like after a cleaning at the dentist.  I love the &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; mode on this model. I really liked the sanitizer as well as I&#x27;ve also been one of those people concerned about germs on my toothbrush.  If you&#x27;ve been debating on whether to buy this toothbrush or not, I would definitely recommend purchasing it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> And I feel like after just one brush I was just at the dentist.  I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone so long with a manual toothbrush!  This thing is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I should have my head examined buying a $140 toothbrush. This thing is amazing.  I have no regrets. Expensive, yes, but your can&#x27;t put a price on healthy gums and teeth. It&#x27;s a little weird at first to get used to, but you will in time and fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good!</li>
            <li> This brush is totally worth the price. I especially like the timer that ensure I brush in each area for the required amount of time. If you&#x27;re looking for an electric toothbrush I would highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> The answer: maybe not.  If you have excellent brushing habits as is, then this product is going to make things better and potentially could make things worse.  I recommend this product if you are a poor or even average brusher.  It will help make up for your deficiencies.  If you are a good or excellent brusher (i.e. you brush rigorously and thoroughly multiple times a day), then I do NOT recommend you buy this product.  Just stick with your already good brushing habit.  If it ain&#x27;t broke, why fix it?  Especially if you have to pay a lot of money! ;-)</li>
            <li> This is a good upgrade over the previous model. The brush is easier to keep clean and to clean when necessary.  The charge lasts longer and the charging station is much better.  It does take up a bit more counter space but all in all it is worth it.  Solid product</li>
            <li> This is the first Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve purchased.  SO MUCH BETTER than Oral B electric that I had!  Toothbrush is easy to use and multiple settings allow u to customize brush mode to needed cleaning level.  Comes with a travel charger and a great travel hard case which protects your brush and keeps it all organized.  Teeth feel and look so clean that it feels like I&#x27;ve gone to the dentist every time I brush my teeth!  UV sanitizer is a great little bonus when you really want to clean your brush.  Light is not that bright and only takes about 10 minutes to run through sanitizing cycle.  New design of brush head stays clean and no more gunk build up!  Wonderful product!!  Very pleased with this and have already recommended to a friend who compared it to his older Sonicare which was hard to keep clean.  Why did I wait so long to upgrade my electric toothbrush!  Only con is the toothbrush came with a warranty card that lists a website where u can register your product and get an extended warranty for free but the website has never worked so I haven&#x27;t been able to activate my warranty.  I&#x27;m sure that if I have a problem though that Philips will take care of it!</li>
            <li> Used this product and like it so far, however the build quality is too bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after 9 months, it stopped working, at first it gave a strange noise...gradually it did not charge, it did not vibrate, it became a heavy piece of junk  :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;frankly speaking, the best feature is the timer, most people don&#x27;t spend enough time to brush their teeth...by having a timer, people usu. are more willing to spend more time, that&#x27;s why mostly people can see the difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, the BUILD quality is just simply too BAD to justify the price, i am SAD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[UPDATE] I finally decided to call Sonicare directly since it&#x27;s still within the warranty. And the lady on the line was so nice that it did not take long for me to receive a replacement handle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it two years later :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service from Sonicare!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
            <li> I have owned Sonicare products in the past but for some reason or another went back to a manual brush for a couple of years. After purchasing this toothbrush I was left wondering why I didn&#x27;t stay with Sonicare. My teeth feel so clean after using it. I never thought that I would say I enjoy brushing my teeth, however, this toothbrush makes it a real pleasure. I also purchased one for my wife, which is her first, and she loves it. My teeth feel like a dentist&#x27;s cleaning after every brushing!</li>
            <li> Although I have only been using the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Plus for about a week I absolutely love it. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth first thing in the morning and last thing at night. :-)It is really worth every penny. Its lightweight and easy to use. It actually does give you that after the dentist clean feeling. The only thing I wish it had would have to be a Braces Mode. The current modes only run for a top time of 3 minutes which doubles for anybody with braces. Other than that it is an amazing toothbrush. Keep up the good work Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Purchased this in May 2010 and it worked perfectly for three years.  One day it randomly started making very loud, annoying noises.  I tried charging it, replacing brush heads, switching modes and nothing worked.  I contacted customer service and they told me that, because it was out of warranty, I would have to buy a new one.  Their assistance (if you could call it that) was disappointing and frustrating.  I realize the product is out of warranty, but they made not attempt to try to help me other than to tell me to buy a new one.  I&#x27;ll have to get a new toothbrush, but after that experience, I&#x27;ll have to go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush as an upgrade from my oral-b and have been nothing but impressed with it. I have been using oral-b toothbrushes for over 10 years, and finally decided to give sonicare a try and all I can say is WOW!  This blows my oral-b out of the water.  The adjustable modes are very handy but for my purposes I only use the &#x27;Clean&#x27; and &#x27;Gum Care&#x27; settings.  I was skeptical at first, since I have never purchased a sonicare toothbrush before, but after using this product I&#x27;m a believer.  I get a extremely fresh clean feeling after every brush, its like going to the dentist everyday :D</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for over a decade and love the product. Every time I clean my teeth I feel like I have just gone to the dentist. My old handset was due for a replacement head and the battery was starting to goso I figured I would upgrade to a new brush that my significant other and I could share.     The new brush is fantastic. The build quality is very nice, I like the different options for tooth brushing (although there seem to be a few options that aren&#x27;t really necessary). I mostly use the clean and gum care settings. It cleans my teeth a little better than mu old brush and is less bulky to hold. The UV sanitizer is a bonus but I would have preferred a second handset as I travel a lot and this is a shared brush.     The travel case is really nice because I can pack this thing up, throw it in my bad, and not worry about it turning on or getting damaged while traveling. The battery life is also a lot better than older models (mine was really old so I guess that is to be expected).     Overall I highly recommend the purchase for anyone who wants to take really good care of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for 2 weeks, and can see the tooth turn brighter. I like it very much and will suggest my whole family to use it !</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for your family works really well Dentists recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> This is our first electric toothbrush and I wish I bought one years ago.  I researched the different brands to find the best one for the money and the Philips Sonicare FlexCare always came in above the rest.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, clean and it does a fantastic job of cleaning teeth -- it was noticable after the first use!  I tried buying this product from the Philips company direct, but they were actually out of stock.  I found it at Amazon.com and it was not only in stock, but at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Solid product, but not substantially better than other models or makes. Uses a special lamp that contains mercury and requires special disposal. Overall - overpriced!</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about spending $150 on an Electric Tooth Brush.  My previous was an Oral B I had paid $60 for online, and it lasted me 5 years. It was  a good toothbrush, but I really noticed the difference when I bought this Sonicare.  This is a great product with great features(mine is the 2 minute timer), and it is a good investment for oral healthcare.  The quality is definitely an upgrade from cheaper electric toothbrushes, and I highly recommend this product after having now used it personally for a month.  Great Buy !</li>
            <li> This brush does a good job cleaning teeth. The charge on the battery last for almost two months as this is well built as compare to the older models. Went to dentist to have my teeth cleaned and was told that I don&#x27;t have any build up on my teeth as that this toothbrush is very good.</li>
            <li> You can get a Sonicare for much less than this.  And if all you need is a great electric toothbrush, I say \\&quot;go ahead.\\&quot;  The low-end models that cost a quarter of this one have all the features my original Sonicare had.  So why buy this one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some problems with my gums.  The original Sonicare helped greatly with that.  But this model even comes with a \\&quot;gums\\&quot; setting that gives you some extra time with gentle brushing to work on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old Sonicare was a pain to keep clean.  This one has its own sanitizer/autoclave for the brush so I can stop worrying about what might be growing in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sonicare comes with a nifty travel kit--a holder for the base and both brushes, and a separate, smaller \\&quot;travel charger\\&quot; (without the sanitizer unit).  Nice feature, if you travel even occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, that made it worth the extra money.  And if those features matter to you, I am sure you will agree.  But if not, choose the unit that meets your needs.  They are all great.</li>
            <li> Had the sonicare elite but it broke after 5 years which was my own fault. Somehow I managed to tear the rubber on the green start button so water seaped in. Switched to regular toothbrush for a few months but couldn&#x27;t do it. My gum health was deteriorating and I could feel that my teeth weren&#x27;t as clean. I decided to pay a little extra thinking $12.50 a month for better oral health would be worth it. Bought the flexcare plus with sanitizer. Loving it every day since the day I started using it.    Don&#x27;t care what anyone says about oral b or other electronic toothbruch products. I will always stick to sonicare!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure other reviewers have covered how great this toothbrush is.  I was extremely disappointed when the handle broke after 1 year of use.  It still seemed to be vibrating but it seemed like something mechanical was \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; inside - the hum was higher pitched and the actual metal stick that the toothbrush goes on was not really moving anymore.  Because I like the brush so much I was prepared to buy a new one, but first I called customer service to check if there was something I could do to fix it, and they offered to send me a new handle free, and a pre-paid shipping label to send back the broken one.  This was just after 1 year... I have no idea what the warranty was for...    Some reviewers had similar problems and reported less success with customer service, rating the brush poorly.  I just wanted to offset those reports with my own experience.  If your brush breaks be sure to contact customer service!</li>
            <li> I could have two of them with more attachments for less money at Costco, than I what I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The FlexCare Plus was one of my wife&#x27;s Christmas presents since she had been hinting. I research most products and the reviews were right on target. She likes everything about the Plus (and doesn&#x27;t mind saying otherwise, by the way).     It has the features, the look, the feel, and the healthcare aspect. I think you&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Flexcare+ is all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be and more. A little pricey, but worth every cent. It&#x27;s a good feeling to know that your toothbrush is germ-free every time you brush. The UV function is definitely a plus. I would recommend to anyone who takes pride in their smile!</li>
            <li> I have been brushing like a caveman before I used this. A week or so for your teeth and gums to get used to vibration. AMAZINGLY CLEAN feeling after brushing with this brush. This is one of those purchases that you WILL NOT regret and worth every penny.  UPDATE:  5 years and 2 month later toothbrush is still going strong! Sanitizing station died a long time ago</li>
            <li> I bought this model to replace my Sonicare Elite that had started to stop working after 3+ years.    I was excited to receive this model which is supposed to be the latest and greatest. However, I was very disappointed to find out that unlike the Elite, handle on the FlexCare is not dishwasher safe. You replace the brush heads every few months but the handle to supposed to last for years. If you&#x27;re going to be touching something every day for years and putting it in or near your mouth, you want to know that it will stay clean. Running something through the dishwasher is one of the best ways to make sure that it&#x27;s clean.    Functionally, I&#x27;m happy with the new design. The new brush heads are less likely to accumulate grim. Still, I worry about how clean the handle it self will be a year from now since I won&#x27;t be able to put it in the dishwasher to clean it.    I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s still one of the best tooth brushes that I&#x27;ve ever used and it has some advantages over the previous model. However, I hate it when the new and supposedly improved model drops important features and I consider a dishwasher safe handle to be a very important feature. (I would have given 5 stars if they had kept this feature.)</li>
            <li> Great product. Lasted about a year before the power weakened</li>
            <li> I recently switched form Oral B when my toothbrush stopped charging. I guess I used that OralB brush for about 6 years (therefore I&#x27;m quite pleased with its reliability) following my dentist recommendation. I liked the toothbrush and my gums were kept in a healthy shape throughout all these years (helped by a general dentist cleaning every 6-8 months)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I recently switched to this Philips version and I&#x27;m surprised to see, after each brush, my teeth felling smoother and cleaner. The old OralB did a good job, no doubt, but my recent FlexCare+ experience makes me wonder why did I wait for so long before switching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral B gives 1 signal to switch to the next quarter of your brushing and 3 signals once your brushing is over. Sonicare stops suddenly making you wonder if the brush is really over or if you accidentally pressed the on-off button. But this is nothing major, I can adapt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no opinion about the UV cleaner, I take their word that it actually helps. I just want to mention that, straight out of the box, the UV bulb didn&#x27;t work. I had to press it down it in its support for a better contact and I have to do it rather frequently to keep it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additional mini-charger is nice to have, I remember having difficulties packing the big OralB charger while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I cannot say much about the system reliability, obviously. Not yet. I&#x27;ll review the review if anything happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: my unit stopped working after little more than 1 year, while still under warranty. The customer service sent me a replacement without any hassle. I changed my rating from 5 down to 4 stars but I&#x27;m still pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I don&#x27;t feel my teeth are clean unless I use this toothbrush. It is worth the investment!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  I was a longtime Oral-B user, wore that brush out, and bought Philips based on its product rating.  My teeth were noticeably cleaner and whiter after only 1 week of use.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I did quite a bit of research on the toothbrushes by both Philips &amp; Oral B.  The Sonicare is exactly what I wanted.  However, I do wish that it came with 2 handles.</li>
            <li> Does a GREAT job, highly recommend!  The vibration takes a little getting used to, but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> My second order of this electric brush just died again - a bit after 1 year - like the previous one - initially I thought it was bad luck but 2 in a row... That brush was used only by me and carefully but the part that vibrates eventually gets lose and starts to make horrible noises and it gets worse from here... I&#x27;m extremely disappointed...</li>
            <li> Ordered this to replace the same unit we received as a wedding gift in 2008.  That unit finally broke down after 2 years of regular use and 2 moves.  This new model is a lot better noise wise.  I can actually hear my wife talk to me while brushing my teeth.  The magnet keeping the door close is better than the latch of the previous model also.</li>
            <li> This product exceeds my expectation.  I had an original model that lasted forever I was very sad when it died.  This was a great replacement.  They fixed all the issues that existed with the original.  It should come with both a compact &amp; a standard brush head.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended it, and I was reluctant to spend so much money on a toothbrush.  We have used it for nearly one month, and really like it. It feels as though we are getting good cleanings, and we are using various cleaning cycles.  Most commonly we use the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; cycle.  Sometimes I add the \\&quot;gum care\\&quot; cycle for an added minute of cleaning.  My husband has found that the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; cycle is good for his bottom teeth. He uses the regular proflex brush head, and I use the compact.  A new habit seems to be developing between us: when either finishes brushing in the morning or before bed, we have been returning our brush to the sanitizer and installing the appropriate brush head for the other so that it is ready for immediate use. Sort of like helping each other out.  Looks like brushing our teeth is becoming a \\&quot;shared family experience\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I wanted to renew my  Phillips sonicare toothbrush and I was looking everywhere for the best price or a special and i finally found it at amazon... I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and I will definitely will use amazon for all of my needs.&lt;br /&gt;The sonicare toothbrush is an alternative to spending money to dentist. I used this product for years and I cannot go back to the regular toothbrush anymore...</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the ProSeries Sonicare toothbrush after a few years of using a conventional toothbrush. Before that, I had owned and loved a Sonicare that had been discontinued and I couldn&#x27;t find the replacement brushheads any longer so I ended up throwing it away. I knew I wanted to go back to Sonicare and am so happy I finally did! The first brushing gave me amazing improvement in the overall cleanliness of my teeth and now after a month of use,I have noticed improved health in my gums as well. I love all the little features like the different modes to use and I love having the UV Sanitizer. At first I thought it was a little silly, but now I am confident in knowing my toothbrush is clean! I love my Sonicare! If anyone is having concerns or doubts and are not sure what to buy, just go with this one! Splurge a little and get the extra features and UV Sanitzer. It is worth the money to have a healthy and clean mouth!</li>
            <li> I had been using another less expensive electric toothbrush for a number of years. Last dentist visit it was suggested I get the Sonicare toothbrush. I have been using it for a month now &amp; actually can feel a difference. Pricey , but would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is really a great toothbrush. I can&#x27;t wait for my next trip to my dentist! They have been telling me to buy a higher quality brush for years, well this is it.</li>
            <li> ive never had a better tooth brush in my life, it makes my whole mouth feel clean like id been to the dentist without the pain!</li>
            <li> This is the best looking Sonicare to date, with &#x27;improvements&#x27; over previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having owned the previous model of this toothbrush, heres the dirt: It has one additional setting, slightly better looks, a hard case, and bristles that fade with use. (I dont think my last one had that.)Personally I never use more than one or two settings, and I can tell when I need to change my bristles, and well good looks never hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard case is easily the only useful improvement (for me). And its a sorta of a bittersweet improvement. These toothbrushes are fragile around the neck. One drop onto hard tile, too much pressure applied the wrong way in your luggage and bam. I&#x27;ve lost two, one in each of those ways, but I keep replacing them, so take that for whatever its worth. Also I cant figure out how to fit the charger into the hard case but there must be a way. But at the same time I wish they found a way to make the design more robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+good looks... for a toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;+multiple settings that, while I imagine most people wont switch between, allows you to fine tune it to your mouths sensitivity&lt;br /&gt;+superior cleaning to a manual toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;+smallish head fits everywhere in your mouth!&lt;br /&gt;+UV cleaner to kill bacteria&lt;br /&gt;+bristles fade when it needs to be changed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; included hard case for travel.. to compensate for weak point in the neck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-same fragile neck as previous flexcares (when someone in my office saw me get it, he commented his last one broke from falling in the bathroom too)&lt;br /&gt;-large base, if bathroom counter space is at a premium, you will end up ditching the uv base and using the smaller travel base, negating one of the best features</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for ages, this is my third.     This is definitely worth the money, my dentist visits are always quick and never much plaque.    Perfect purchase for someone who wants to keep their teeth.</li>
            <li> please know you are getting a toothbrush that is having problems. the toothbrush vibration system comes loose and stops the vibration action after a few months. you can call philips and they will send you a new one after you give them your product number on the bottom of the unit. these new toothbrushes do not hold up as well as the older ones which last forever, although they do vibrate faster and more powerful at the beginning.</li>
            <li> have used this product for over 3 months now.  Went to Dentist for scheduled cleaning.  Was out of the office in less than 20 minutes!!  Now that in itself is great!  Who really wants to spend more time sitting in that dental chair?    No plaque or tarter build up on any teeth.  Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus has great easy to use features.  Progressively builds in speed and pressure to allow your gums to to adjust to the vibration and pressure resulting in little to no gum bleeding.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve LOVED every generation of sonicare, and i&#x27;ve had them all.  when the new flexcare came in, i was ecstatic.  it seemed to correct all of the things that bugged me about the previous generations.    HOWEVER, here i sit with yet another broken handle, my FOURTH replacement in a year, and my warranty has expired.  i received this fourth replacement one month ago, so presumably it&#x27;s from the latest run manufactured.  sonicare refuses to extend my warranty even though the customer service reps admit that they had recurring manufacturing defects with this generation.      out of my five flexcares:    -  three suffered from a broken shaft where you could still hear the unit buzz, but the shaft/toothbrush itself no longer vibrate.  -  two suffered from a defective battery where the unit would never achieve full charge and would need to be recharged after just a day of use, even from new.    i don&#x27;t abuse the toothbrushes or use them for anything weird.  i&#x27;ve used the previous generations until i literally got bored and bought a newer generation or the rubber on/off button was so old it cracked.    PLEASE don&#x27;t buy a flexcare until sonicare fixes this generation and takes responsibility for its poorly designed/manufactured products by offering a refund and/or extended warranty!!!</li>
            <li> For dental cleaning without fuss&lt;br /&gt;Buy this handy FlexCare +&lt;br /&gt;Brush 2 minutes, twice a day&lt;br /&gt;To keep those pesky germs at bay&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll take no longer than the time&lt;br /&gt;It took to write this little rhyme&lt;br /&gt;So, make yourself a pledge this year&lt;br /&gt;To brush your teeth with Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips has for some time established itself as the leader in toothbrush technology, to the extent that dentists recommend it by name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is no exception, with all the standard features of other models, but in a sleek new design that cuts down on some of the flashy lights, but not on the features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. 5 brushing modes - clean, gum care, refresh, sensitive and massage.&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy start feature for newbies to gradually introduce the Sonicare experience (can be deactivated if not needed)&lt;br /&gt;3. Quadpacer timer to alert you when it&#x27;s time to change from top teeth to bottom teeth, and from inside to outside areas.&lt;br /&gt;4. Helpful little details like color-coded rings for multiple users, cord wraps to eliminate cord snarls, travel charger and travel case, 2 sizes of brushing head and an intelligible instruction manual.&lt;br /&gt;5. UV sanitizer for cleaning your brush head(s) that&#x27;s also easy for you to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It costs quite a bit more than a regular toothbrush (but it&#x27;s worth it).&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s kinda noisy (but you get used to it)&lt;br /&gt;3. You can only set the brushing mode before you start to brush, so no changing your mind in mid-brush (no biggie)&lt;br /&gt;4. Everyone in your family will want one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For excellent tooth care, you just can&#x27;t beat Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards, January 3, 2010</li>
            <li> it worth every penny. I feel like my teeth are in excellent condition. And my dentist and prove that. I had minimal to non existant plague and tarter. My teeth feel clean everytime i use it. The gum care option on this toothbrush is really cool. Its like a massage for your gums. It feels sooo good. At first i have to admit, it was intimidating because of how my teeth and gums reacted to the toothbrush. It felt like the toothbrush was way to brutal on my teeth. But it was just cuz my teeth had to get used to the \\&quot;electric toothbrush\\&quot; part. It had been a while since i&#x27;ve used one. But when you first get the toothbrush, the toothbrush automatically knows that your teeth can&#x27;t quite handle it and it provides a progressivly gradual increase of vibrations to your teeth. That way you get used to it. It only takes a week or two till you forget about the inconvienance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:: 2yrs and 2 months later... I love it still... Although the brush heads can be expensive, its worth it. Costco has a pack of 7 for way cheaper than if you buy the 1-2 packs alone. Its still going like it was new. No hardware issues at all.</li>
            <li> Received item on Jan 13th. Fully charged it and used for full clean once a day which is two minutes a day and battery lasted until feb 7th. Also to note is battery was not dead at this date, it was on it&#x27;s last bar. So I bet it would have lasted even longer. Took only one week to get use to the new tough cleaning style of the brush. Overall best tooth brush on the market. Plus the sanitizer insures clean brush heads everytime which honestly is the only reason why I initially bought this.</li>
            <li> I received my Airfloss a week before Christmas 2011. Here it is March of 2012 and the unit no longer takes a charge. Not even 3 Months!!. Come on Phillips, this was not ready for prime time. Save your money. I no longer have the box, so I cannot return it now. Listen to the reviewers avoid this like the plague!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Very easy to keep clean and with the sanitizer don&#x27;t have to worry about bathroom germs.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest SpinBrush for the past couple of years and just switched to the Sonicare FlexCare+ with UV sanitizer. This is simply short of amazing. It cleans like nothing else on the market. I no longer have stains and my teeth feel noticeably \\&quot;slick\\&quot; after using the FlexCare+. The ultrasonic vibration really massages the gums really well. It is an amazing feeling. I like to say it is like \\&quot;sex for my mouth.\\&quot; I am much more motivated to brush my teeth twice a day now. Thanks Sonicare for an outstanding product!</li>
            <li> I really like this new toothbrush and its different options, plus the sanitizer is a nice add on.  My one complaint is that the brush heads that came with it are very small, like half the side of my last Sonicare heads. I sometime feel like brushing a little longer just to make sure each tooth got clean enough.</li>
            <li> About a month back I was looking around for an electric toothbrush. I was using an Oral B one, but it was only okay when it came down to it. And after about 3 days the power kind of died down significantly. Not with this Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus!    While searching for an electric toothbrush, I thought that, if I was going to dip myself $100 in for a good brush, might as well aim as high as I and the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus Toothbrush was what I found. When I first got the thing, boy oh boy, it was POWERFUL! They don&#x27;t lie when they say it takes some getting used to. There was a huge difference between the Sonicare and my Oral B electric toothbrushes. After about the first week, I think I got used to it and now I brush pretty comfortably. My teeth have never felt cleaner and more smooth before I started using this toothbrush. Definitely a good investment if you want clean teeth!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my old Sonicare that the battery was dying on.  This replacement is an excellent improvement in everyway.  I&#x27;m very happy and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is our fourth Sonicare and we are very happy with the results of our oral health since we started using the Sonicare line. This particular mode, with the UV Disinfectant Station is new to us, but it appears to work as advertised. As usual Amazon comes through with what they promised.</li>
            <li> It worked great when I first got it. My teeth never felt cleaner. The UV light didn&#x27;t last that long though, only about 4 months. That&#x27;s fine though, as it was more a gimmicky feature for me anyway. What made me sad though was that the toothbrush is very prone to breaking. The first time it broke, it slipped and fell into the sink. Not that far a drop, but enough to break the delicate metal inside. I sent it off to get it fixed, and it came back just fine. The next time it broke, I just missed the stand and it fell onto the shelf right next to the charger. That was enough to break that piece again. Figured it was probably going to be done for good, I opted this time to just buy a whole new one. Of course, that one has died as well. I normally wouldn&#x27;t dock any stars for my own clumsiness, but this is a piece of equipment that is used multiple times daily, and is subject to wet and slippery conditions. I know I&#x27;m not the only person in the world to drop their toothbrush. It just sucks when it costs $30+ every time you do to get it fixed.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.  Includes travel case and charger which is handy.  I can already notice an improvement in my teeth compared to my older oral-b.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!! Great price and great service!! I bought my husband one too!! Very easy to use and made very well.</li>
            <li> great item. my fiance and i both use it daily. works best in the shower as it continues to vibrate and will cause a bit of toothpaste splatter.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush came sooner than I expected and was fully charged!  I love this toothbrush so far and haven&#x27;t had any issues a month in.</li>
            <li> Does not clean between teeth.  Waste of money.  Oral B is much cheaper and does a better job.  Even Gum message is useless.  Will try to send it back!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is absolutely awesome. It&#x27;s well worth the money... the price was the lowest I found anywhere. By it for yourself and/or your family. Everyone deserves one of these.</li>
            <li> You only thought you had brushed your teeth clean until you use a Phillips Sonicare Plus.  It feels like you just had your teeth polished by your dentist.  It takes a few uses to get use to how it works but I guess that is why it has the 14 uses building up to full power.  Unlike other power brushes this one will last at least 5 days without being recharged.  My only suggestion would be to make the pause between cycles more distinct; if you are not paying attention you can miss the change.  My son also has one and after 2 months of use the stains from smoking are gone.  Great investment.  Cleaner, healthier teeth and gums plus you use a lot less toothpaste.  It is expensive for a toothbrush but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product due to my sensitivity and receding gums.  I must brush my teeth too hard, so this helps me not do that.  My teeth also feel nice and clean when I&#x27;m done and I can feel the pieces of food dislodging themselves as the brush \\&quot;shakes\\&quot; them loose.  I love the ultraviolet cleaner because it makes me feel like I&#x27;m not putting any bacteria back in my mouth, especially after I&#x27;ve been sick or had a cold.  I also love the fact that the brush gives you a signal when it&#x27;s time to switch to the next section.  This helps me not spend to little or too much time on any one area and keeps me focused when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare Flexcare+, along with a new Sonicare Airfloss for about two weeks now. The combination seems to be working great. I had gotten a bit lazy with brushing and flossing, and I started to notice some significant gum problems. Using the two Sonicare products has already caused noticeable improvement. I really don&#x27;t know if the Sonicare Airfloss and a regular brush would have done the same thing, but I will say that this is a lot more pleasant.  Because it is almost fun, I tend to brush and floss at least once every day.   HOWEVER, with that said, look around for a better price than Amazon.com. I am a person that buys from Amazon without checking other sources because I feel that Amazon&#x27;s price is generally pretty competitive. Not so with the Sonicare products. Both of these products are available on-line with a 20% discount (shipping included), a total savings of around $46!!   Update 12/9/11:  I just changed my rating to one star.  The Flexcare Plus is dead and I am about to contact Philips for a replacement.  The Powerfloss has already been replaced, and the new unit works, but makes loud crunching sounds.  I don&#x27;t expect that it will last much longer.  These products both work well on your teeth, but the build quality seems to be so low that they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> good base products but the bells and whistles bring no value; the &#x27;clean&#x27; function works very well, but the UV chamber, &#x27;massage&#x27; option, etc... are all of no practical use.  Buy the least expensive bottle that has only the clean function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor complaint is that the heads that attach to the toothbrush are grotesquely overpriced; i end up making them last for many months before changing them, and although not perfect at that point, they do still fairly well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product about three weeks, but so far so great. A friend recommended it years ago, saying she felt like she&#x27;d been to the dentist every time she brushed; I feel similarly. I feel I&#x27;m able to ward off tartar before it really sets in. It&#x27;s a bit more of a maintenance issue than I prefer, but hopefully it&#x27;ll pay off in the long run, especially in the dentist&#x27;s chair. I&#x27;ve even talked a couple friends into buying one too.</li>
            <li> Have had the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus H6972/10 Rechargeable Toothbrush for the past month.  Love the extra features..more time for gums if needed and the refresh mode for brushing after meals.  My 2nd Sonicar and getting great checkups.  Ms. Cory</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, it cleans, and the battery life is still excellent after more than one year of usage (about one week using it 2-3 times a day)&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that compared with the Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 I had before, it does not clean as well. I don&#x27;t even think that is available anymore, but their system is way more efficient. It must be a reason why the dentists&#x27; cleaning tools have the same circular move, and not the oscillating one the Philips uses.&lt;br /&gt;A thought this comparison might be useful, since I used the Oral-B for about three years before the battery died completely, and I am using the Philips for more than a year already.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is wonderful.  Your teeth feel clean the entire day.  My dentist asked me what I was using because when I went in for my cleaning, there was very little for them to clean.</li>
            <li> I have natural small gaps on my bottom teeth and can tell when plaque builds up because the gaps starts to close. After getting my teeth cleaned, I bought the FlexCare. Well worth every cent with the five modes. Even after studying for one week and falling asleep at my desk w/o brushing that night, the toothbrush makes me feel like I just got my teeth cleaned! Well recommended!</li>
            <li> **I&#x27;ve upped my rating from 1 to 3 stars, as Philips customer service quickly honored the warranty with no-fuss and very good service. So far the replacement handle is working just fine**    *Probably would have given this brush 4 stars, but since the motorized brush head stopped working after a month I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s much better than a $3 toothbrush.*    - Brush worked great and left the clean feeling that an electric toothbrush gives, and the vibration signaling when to switch to a different part of your teeth was a nice touch.     - The UV cleaner is a nice addition and makes you feel a little better about using the brush head more than a couple weeks.    - Compared to the Oral B Professional series brush I had, this was definitely an upgrade... but again, when the motor stops working 1 month after purchase, it&#x27;s hard to say a fancy toothbrush with lights is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a toothbrush that vibrates really could be that much of a difference. But let me tell you, me and my husband both feel the difference on our teeth. It feels like we are coming from the dentist each and every day! Thanks Philips!</li>
            <li> Read through all the one-star reviews before you buy. So many people have had the same problem as me: their toothbrush dying after 2 years, just outside the warranty. Yeah, it works great, but is that the kind of investment you want to make, close to $100 a year on a toothbrush?    Most people write reviews after the first few months of having a product. Much less come back to say the thing broke after two years. Reviews are inherently biased that way.    My experience, like so many others, was that one night, about two years after I purchased this item, it started turning on and off by itself. By the morning the brush was no longer working. I contacted Philips about this, both online and via phone, and they refused to replace it.    When I talked about this with a friend, she said the same thing happened to her. Then I looked up the reviews, and saw many people talking about the same or similar problems.    For only two years of reliable use, this brush is not worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and the tooth brush I was using ULTREO went out of biz.  I love my new Sonic.</li>
            <li> This is the best model in the Sonicare line. The UV sanitizer is cool, but probably useless. Sanitizers most likely do not help, but they can&#x27;t be bad either. This toothbrush is different from the old style sonicares. A piece of metal sticks up into the head to move it. The old versions used magnets to vibrate the head. The heads are now cheaper though. The battery lasts for a long time. This also comes with a travel case and a smaller travel charger which does not have the sanitizer. This is useful for packing easily. The case protects the toothbrush nicely. I put it in my luggage and the toothbrush arrived perfectly in the case.    It has many different modes such as a gum care mode which is the standard brushing with a one minute period of gentle gum care massage. There is also a quick 30 sec mode and 1 minute mode. The feel of the toothbrush is comfortable and the brush does a great job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this new toothbrush. My teeth feel polished. It has two heads so we both use it. I travel without the cord and the battery lasts. So far no issues....:) i think i may have already worn out the brush i use so my advice would be to buy extras with it just in case. I think the early wear is because i have a few crowns and vaneers where my husbands doesn&#x27;t  (we have been using it the same amount) .....very happy I bought this :)</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean.  Still need to floss!  Takes a bit to get used to.  We&#x27;ll really see at the next visit to the dentist.  Could be 5 stars, jury is still out.</li>
            <li> This is the best tooth brush I have ever had. It has very high cleansing power. Bought two units for my family. It is hard to use other tooth brushes once you get used to the cleanness Philips Sonicare provides. Although it is good to have, I find myself seldom use the UV function. Next upgrade will probably be the tooth brush solely.     Although I give this product 5 stars because of its outstanding performance, but there are few things need improvement.      1. The UV light in one of the 2 units I bought was not working. Solved by adjusting the UV bulb position. It could have came loose during shipping, but my parents initially thought the product was broken.     2. This unit came with 2 types of brush head: standard and compact. The connection joint of the compact brush head became very loose after about 2 days of use and could not stay tightly on the tooth brush. I figured Amazon would ask me to send the whole unit back so I contacted Philips directly. Contacted Philips online help and received a new one for replacement, except they shipped a standard size brush head instead of a compact one. Philips custom rep. told me the replacement was an exception as brush head should be consumable and should not be part of the warranty. However, to me it was a defected compartment at arrival.     3. The color rings for distinguishing different brush heads are similar and limited. I believe they only have 3 colors (grey, dark blue, light blue). Wish they can very more and better color selections, for example, red, yellow, and green.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Sonicare products over the years and this is the first one that died (after 9 months).  With minimal hassle, the manufacturer of this product agreed to send me another unit.  What I really appreciate is that they are sending me new unit before I send back the old one (they will include a label).</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush based on the claims and the negative to positive review ratio.  It has been great, up until today when it died.  It still sounds like it&#x27;s running and i can feel the handle vibrate, but the brush itself does nothing.  I had a feeling something was going to happen because the past few days it had been extra-loud when i turned it on.  Another reviewer stated that they dislike how it changes modes when you&#x27;re holding it... This is a huge problem for me too, it&#x27;s incredibly sensitive and turns off or changes modes when i&#x27;m holding it like i would a manual toothbrush.  This is a 1 star product.  If you pay $140 for something, it has to last more than 4 months.  I&#x27;m 7 days away from 4 months to the day of owning this product.  My girlfriend owns a $25 AA powered toothbrush and that thing has lasted over 4 years now, and still going.  WTF?  UPDATE: Not even 5 hours after writing this review, it no longer turns on however it still lights up and everything else...</li>
            <li> This product comes with a traveling kit, a cleaning solution, and a pacing solution.  The pacer allows you to have reproducible clean teeth. A standard cleaning session consists of 30 seconds on your front top teeth, 30 seconds on front behind teeth, 30 seconds of front bottom teeth, 30 seconds of bottom behind teeth. You are notified by a stop of small pause in vibration to tell you to move on to the next area. The vibrations are very strong which allow for a superior cleaning session. There are of course other specialized cleaning including with the brush such as gum care, message, and sensitive clean.  The cleaning solution is a UV disinfect. You simply place the brush head into the cleaning unit, hit the clean button and it will automatically shutoff when complete. You are able to clean 2 brushes at a time. This addition adds peace of mind for germaphobes.  I have yet to use the traveling kit, but looking at it, it&#x27;s a hard plastic shell that can hold your tooth brush as well as a travel charger.  Overall this is one of my favorite purchases and get excited to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I just got this toothbrush yesterday from my dentist. The first time I used it, it tickled a lot but I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how to use it. My dentist told me not to brush and let the brush do it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;It took a couple of times for me to get the hang of using it but I&#x27;m absolutely in love! My mouth feels so clean after brushing and I swear that since yesterday, my teeth are already noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually brushed my teeth with my old toothbrush as I normally would and then I brushed with the Sonicare brush afterwards. While I was spitting and rinsing after brushing the 2nd time with the Sonicare, I was surprised at how many food particles that my old brush missed! Eww!&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush actually shoots water/(spit, too?)/toothpaste in between your teeth instead of just spinning to clean the surface. This brush is gentle enough to where my gums don&#x27;t bleed but are adequately cleaned. I adore the different settings and how the brush is on a timer and cuts off. It also gives warning beeps when you are brushing to notify you every 30 seconds (which can be deactivated). My teeth feel so clean that I now use the refresh mode after every meal as I can&#x27;t stand the sensation of having little particles in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the UV sanitizer yet but it sounds like it would be a good idea to disinfect at least weekly, if not several times a week. I love that the box came with an additional charger and also a travel case. The colored rings are a nice touch so you don&#x27;t use someone else&#x27;s brush head if you share with family members.</li>
            <li> Ok, this toothbrush is just amazing, works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Let me start with the cons, as they are fewer:&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1- It&#x27;s expensive&lt;br /&gt;2- Additional brushes are quite expensive&lt;br /&gt;3- the brush goes so fast, that any toothpaste just flies off the brush! Best thing I did was put some toothpaste on the brush, manually spread it around the teeth before turning on the device!&lt;br /&gt;Once a layer of the paste is evenly distributed over the teeth, start using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans very well&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a toothbrush case, with a bacteria killing UV bulb in it&lt;br /&gt;- Does not hurt&lt;br /&gt;- Looks cool!&lt;br /&gt;- Works much better than any battery powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, and much much better than any manual brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me personally, I think it&#x27;s the future for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just indescribable how much better it is than my previous brushes.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it brushes so fast that you don&#x27;t need to be spending long time brushing the teeth at all!&lt;br /&gt;Second, it reaches between the teeth, something my circular (rotating brush) toothbrush had difficulty with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush gives off a tone of 500Hz, meaning it moves at about 500 brushes per second, and feels like a massage device, only vibrating much faster!&lt;br /&gt;Using it tickles the gum a bit (comparable to when your arm or leg is asleep (due to lack of blood flow) comparable to the &#x27;pins and needles&#x27; feeling, only much softer, with the difference that the feeling goes away as soon as one stops brushing the gum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only 1 minute of brushing with this toothbrush, by teeth felt cleaner than 4 minutes cleaning with my battery powered toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that a new brush always works better in the beginning. But still, I was more surprised with this brush than any other I had before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I believe it&#x27;s a great improvement on personal hygiene, I&#x27;d recommend to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;Especially young people in their 20&#x27;s; as they still have a chance to save their teeth, and this tool is so much better than a regular brush!their 20&#x27;s; as they still have a chance to save their teeth, and this tool is so much better than a regular brush!</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare system is an excellent system for oral care.  It is gentle yet effective in cleaning and massaging the gums.  The carrying case and portable charger are very convenient.  I would recommend this system for anyone.</li>
            <li> This is our second set of this product: Sonicare Plus Sanitizer Flexcare toothbrushs. We chose these as the brush heads wouldn&#x27;t be sitting out collecting germs and other stiff.</li>
            <li> EDIT: SCAM ALERT SONICARE HAS POSTED MAIL IN REBATE FORM FOR THIS BRUSH AND ALL OTHER MODELS AND WHEN I FILLED OUT AND ASK FOR THE REBATE ,THEY DIDNT HONOR IT !SAYING NO SUCH REBATES EXISTS NOW! STAY AWAY FROM SCAMMERS AND SONICARE REBATES !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am myself medical professional and i keep on collecting plaque and cavities myself , every time i visit dentist she says you are not doing your job,which i tried my level best,but failed for years.this brush is my first one and i am so amazed to see that in first use it removes the yellow ting from my teeth ,its amazing ,i couldn&#x27;t believe  if i were not using it meself.it so powerfull that it performs 30,000 strokes per min i cant do that many strokes in six months frankly.and thats the reason my teeth get yellow,i dont smoke but tea two times regularly! and brushes twice. i will write more in few weeks after my teeth will show some change! this is expensive piece of equipment ,very expensive but it give you 2.5 yrs of warranty if you register it online ,if it broke than it will be replaced ,peace of mind ! i wish i could buy this before and wont keep my teeth yellow and distroyed !for this price its all worth it for 2.5 yrs .</li>
            <li> Very nice especially the hygiene unit</li>
            <li> We have used Philips Sonicare rechargeable toothbrushes for years. They have served us well. This one was a different style than we have used before. I have been very pleased with it. I particularly like the sanitizing bay.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say besides all the added benefits stated in the other reviews - if you are new to a system like this it just makes brushing easier and more enjoyable, meaning you will do it more. Got one unit for my wife and myself and it is great. We love the brush cover with the UV light - no more fecal matter from flushed toilets onto my toothbrush. Strange to say but the short modes make me brush more often between meals. Highly recommended if you have the coin.</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE 1 year later: The toothbrush itself is working fantastic, and there have definitely been positive changes - no more cavities, and the gum damage that was going on has been completely resolved. It can&#x27;t fix my one tooth that is badly cracked and will probably need a root canal, unfortunately. But other than that, it&#x27;s been a wonder worker. HOWEVER. Just today (almost exactly a year since I got it) the UV sanitizer stopped working, something that I recall seeing other reviewers comment about. The UV bulb should last 5 years, according to the Philips website. I just finished an online chat with one of their reps and they are sending out a new bulb to me for free. When I then asked what I should do if the new bulb does not work either at first they said that the warranty did not cover \\&quot;parts and accessories\\&quot;, but when I pushed the issue a little the rep then told me that if the bulb does not work to contact them again and they would send a new sanitizer. So - we shall see what happens... I will try to remember to update here again with a resolution.&lt;br /&gt;***************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of struggling with horrid teeth problems and poor discipline in proper hygiene since it didn&#x27;t seem to matter what I did anyway, I started going to a new dentist and hygienist. At my second visit they both suggested I should look into getting a Sonicare, any model but in particular one that had the gum care settings. They both told me that they each used one daily and had seen other patients improve drastically and that even though it seemed expensive, they really thought that it would improve my teeth/gums enough to basically pay for itself. I was skeptical, I mean, $100+ for a toothbrush? Not to mention the refill brushhead costs... But I figured after 30 years of pain and agony maybe I should bite the bullet and try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. The thing is all it says and more; I can&#x27;t imagine not having it now. The many other reviews that say the same thing were what finallyconvinced me to take the leap, and so now let me add this review to theirs to help convince you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly seems like it is a doing a far better job on my teeth than any toothbrush did before, none of that midday \\&quot;film\\&quot; that I used to get. It feels great both on my teeth and on my gums, I actually WANT to brush my teeth twice a day. And because I am better at brushing my teeth, it has been a lot easier to get disciplined about flossing and mouthwashing properly. All told, the difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t is so drastic that I will take the time to brush my teeth even if I overslept and am late to work, no excuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smaller brushheads - I have a smaller mouth, even so the small brushhead seemed too small at first. But, once I got used to it I realized that even though it looks like a kid&#x27;s brush it really is far better for my mouth than the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; large brushhead. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try the small one too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted that I haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist yet since getting it, I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I will try to remember to come back and report if there is any positive changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just based on what I&#x27;ve experienced so far though, I wish I would have invested in one of these long ago. Go for it!</li>
            <li> I love these things, but I purchased mine at the end of June 2012 and just this month it completely stopped working. A couple of weeks ago the lights indicating the charge level started to go out and now it won&#x27;t even charge. Completely dead. This is an expensive item to stop working in just 14 months, especially something this simple. Perhaps it&#x27;s a defective battery, I don&#x27;t know. But still, at this price I&#x27;d expect something much better.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush with some skepticism, but had some good reviews from friends who own it.  I don&#x27;t regret buying it.  It makes my teeth and gums feel great and I am starting to notice a difference in whiteness on my teeth. The UV cleaner is awesome because everytime you use it it feels like you&#x27;re using a brand new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because my dentist told me it would help. I believe this product will pay for itself in the long run. I purchased it when it was on sale at $109 dollars, so if its too expensive wait for price drop.     Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush that I&#x27;ve ever owned! I have purchased other Sonicare models but the 5 brush-speed  settings are great to have at your disposal. Additionally, having the UV sanitizer and the charger unit all on the same platform is much more convenient and a great space saver. I highly recommend this product to anyone thinking of purchasing it and cannot over emphasize its value for the cost.    Sincerely,   One Satisfied Customer!</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush, and so far, it&#x27;s the highest quality Sonicare I&#x27;ve tried.    I previously used the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush, and like many reviewers, I had a problem with buildup at the bottom of the brush head.  I&#x27;ve been using the FlexCare Plus two to three times daily for about a month now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any buildup so far.    Just like the previous units, setup is simple.  If you&#x27;ve already used a Sonicare, you can skip the ramp-up process and start the brush at full power.  I&#x27;m not sure if the brush is actually more powerful than previous ones, or if the battery on my old one had slowly faded, but I thought the FlexCare Plus was more powerful off the bat.  In addition, it seems to be quieter.    Usage is the same as previous models--in the basic mode, it will give you a signal every 30 seconds so you can change \\&quot;quads\\&quot; in your mouth.  The modes on the new FlexCare Plus are Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive, and Massage.  Personally, I prefer these modes to the previous model&#x27;s Clean, Sensitive, Massage, Go Care, and Max Care.  Switching between modes is easy and intuitive.  I tend to use Clean twice a day, and Gum Care once.  When you start the brush, it will assume you want to use the setting you last used.    I also like having the UV Sanitizer on board.  In the past, if I had a cold, I always felt the need to change my brush head so I didn&#x27;t continue to give myself the same germs.  Now, I just put the brush head in the UV Sanitizer after every use.  It only takes about 10 minutes.    The travel case is a big improvement over the previous case, but I do have one pet peeve--you can&#x27;t fit the travel charger in the travel case.  This isn&#x27;t a big deal unless you&#x27;ll be traveling for more than two weeks, but I do frequently go on extended trips, and I&#x27;d rather have a case that holds everything I need.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great, we had the older style, and crud used to build up inside the nadle and the brush heads. This one is so easy to clean, and the brush and sanitizer are both on the same base, only one outlet is needed now! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> this product was a gift for my girlfriend; her old sonicare which was proabaly the basic one broke and so i got it for her. well comparing just of the quality, you can see a difference. based off of her comment she loves it. i will probably get one soon also.</li>
            <li> Love the tooth brushes. They do a noticeably better job of cleaning, and are easier than regular toothbrushes. Got one on the recommendation of my dentist some years ago. Unfortunately, they just don&#x27;t seem that well made, and the support is problematic.     The first model I got failed after a few years, and after warranty, when the rubber over the button cracked. As a replacement, I bought this model.    After less than a year this one has failed too. The motor comes on but it no longer vibrates. It takes about 25 minutes to go through their chat support to get to the part where they agree it is broken and offer to send a new one. New one sent Feb. 15, and now it is March 2 and I still don&#x27;t have it. Somehow the suite was not included in my address, and UPS wouldn&#x27;t deliver even though the name of my company is on the building and would be exceptionally easy to figure out.     Now I have to wait for that to be shipped back to the warranty warehouse so they can send it back again. When I talked to customer service they said there was nothing they could do. No one attempted to reach me, from Philips or UPS, to get a suite number, although my phone number was correct.    Maybe in another 2 weeks I can get back to brushing my teeth they way I like, at least until it breaks again.    Update: It is now March 28, and I still have nothing but my broken toothbrush. I reporting the defective handle Feb. 13. Just called and they don&#x27;t have any record of the agent telling me that they had to accept the return before sending another, and they sure haven&#x27;t sent one. The agent this time promised an expedited shipment will be going out soon. A month and a half is way too long. I had been unlikely to consider a competing brand based on my original high regard for the Sonicare line, but I would have to think very carefully about purchasing from them again after this extremely frustrating experience.</li>
            <li> I bought the Phillips Sonicare for myself a year ago.  I am so pleased with it, I ordered this one for a gift.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I paid &gt;$100 for the Sonicare FlexCare Plus toothbrush, which burned out after only a couple of months.  I spent a large amount of time trying to contact customer service on the phone.  Wait times were excessively long (eg, at least 5 mins per attempt).  When I did connect, the company said it was a clearly covered case, and would send a new unit.  However, after a number of weeks, they sent me an empty mailing tube in the mail.  So, I had to chase them again via phone and \\&quot;chat\\&quot; customer service.  Because I have to work for a living, I couldn&#x27;t spend huge amounts of time chasing them around.  I did get through to the \\&quot;chat\\&quot; representatives, who assured me they have no power over such matters, and are not allowed to talk with their colleagues at Philips who have such power.  A complete waste of my time.  In the end, the product was very poor and the customer service was too...</li>
            <li> The unit works well.  Difficult to keep toothpaste and salave from running down your chin.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought a cheaper version Sonicare unit.  The price is not justified.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much better than brushing manually.  Leaves ones mouth with a feeling of freshness.  It&#x27;s a very intense cleaning action (vibrates gums) and takes a little time to adjust to.  Once you go Sonicare you&#x27;ll never go back to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m a little worried that this is going to break on me after a few months after some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read.  But for now it&#x27;s love!  Love love love love looooooooooooooooove! My teeth feel amazing!  Straight out of the dentist amazing. What was I doing before?  I am not sure!    I will update this review as I get used to the product.     For now it&#x27;s a five star review!</li>
            <li> I bought this Sonicare over the Oral-B at first based on the number of reviews on the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]], and thought this model is a step up so it has to be even better. That was not the case, and long story short, I now use an [[ASIN:B002HWS9GG Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]].     The Sonicare beats the Oral-B in most aspects except for the function in my opinion. It has a higher quality, more pleasing design than the Oral-B, which looks like a toy in comparison. All parts of the Sonicare are sealed and it can basically be submerged in water without having to worry about water getting into the handle, unlike the Oral-B. This isn&#x27;t really a big deal, as I don&#x27;t plan on using it while scuba diving, but it is a nice touch.     The Sonicare also has a nicer display on the handle which actually shows the setting you select and the battery indicator is more modern, compared to the old-fashioned calculator type black LCD on the Oral-B. The Oral-B 5000 also lacks any display that shows which mode you have selected, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal since you can easily tell by the different types of vibrations.     The Sonicare has a lithium ion battery, and the Oral-B has a Ni-MH battery so the Sonicare wins in the battery department. The Sonicare can hold a charge for much longer than the Oral-B.     The UV lamp was a big selling point for me at first, but after I bought it, I thought it was overkill, and probably not necessary as I have been doing fine for over a quarter of a century without a germicidal lamp for my toothbrushes.    Most importantly, I felt that the Sonicare wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth very well and I was just not satisfied with it. I even turned off the easy start mode and tried it at full power, and it still wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth well enough. It also felt awkward. Perhaps I should have given it more time, but I just felt it wasn&#x27;t working for me. The Oral-B&#x27;s circular brush heads seem to work better in cleaning and I am happy with my Oral-B, even though it seems like Oral-B needs to scout some people from Sonicare&#x27;s design team. The Oral-B handles and brush heads are cheaper and there are more varieties of brush heads as well so that is another plus for the Oral-B.    I know this is supposed to be a review for the Sonicare, but I just wanted to be helpful to the people who are trying to decide between Sonicare and Oral-B like I did.</li>
            <li> First one broke within 2 days.  Amazon sent a new one next-day.  Nice of them.  They replaced it with the HX6910/HX6160, which is now discontinued according to Philips.  I went on vacation, and when I returned home, the UV sanitizer was no longer working.  Correction.  It would work once every 20-30 times I pressed the button.  Contacted Amazon, and since it was past 30 days since my purchase, they referred me to Philips.  I chatted with them for about an hour.  They said, \\&quot;This product is discontinued\\&quot;.  I asked them how they were going to resolve my defective product.  They are shipping me a new base unit.  I like the toothbrush, and the sanitizer seems like a good idea.  Now if only it would work.  This has been very frustrating.  I would avoid this model.</li>
            <li> I want to let people know about the poor company Philips is. I mailied the compay rebate paperwork on the 10th of Feburary, 2011 to get a $15 rebate from them. It was to take from 8-10 weeks to process and after that to get the rebate check. Their has been delay after delay on Philips part. 1. Was told I needed to wait until after the 10th week before Phillips would look into were my paperwork was. 2. They got my email address wrong, I missed a number of emails sent to the wrong address and can not get them sent back to me again with the right email address now. 3. Then the company has a six week issue were they process the checks and are just now telling me about this issue. Because their customer care people were not allowed to inform anyone they had the issue. The issue happened from the 23rd of March until the 9th of May 2011. Now they say they sent my rebate check out on the 9th of May. So, my main issue is not with Amazon; they did their  job in getting me the Sonicare FlexCare Pus in two days. It is with all the delay&#x27;s from Philips in processing the rebate check, that who know if it is truly in the mail at all. So these are words of WARNING ABOUT PHILIPS in how they process their rebate paperwork.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended that I get an electric toothbrush (not this one specifically), but I saw this product and read the reviews and found it much less expensive on Amazon than other places so I bought it. The toothbrush is awesome and it has really helped me brush better and I am brushing more often. However, the U/V sanitizer only worked the first time I used it and after that would not work at all, which was disappointing given the cost of this product. I did not want to give up the toothbrush by sending the product back to Amazon just because the U/V sanitizer didn&#x27;t work (the charger still worked), so I simply called Philips customer support and they sent me out a replacement charger/sanitizer with prepaid shipping to send the original charger/sanitizer back to them. That was great customer service and the new U/V sanitizer has been working just fine. I love the toothbrush and the various settings, as well as the built in timers. I used to view brushing as more of a chore and typically brushed too hard and too long. This toothbrush takes all of the guesswork out of it and does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> I did some research on the Sonicare web site to try and determine which model to buy. Wow, they have too many models!    I ended up getting this model to get the toothbrush head UV cleaner, the hard travel case, and the gum cleaning mode, but I have to confess I have only used the gum cleaning mode once.  All the gum cleaning mode does is add an additional minute at the end for gum cleaning.    I do like the size of the handle, and the battery lasts many days, even if using 2-3 times per day.    My only major complaint is how quickly the handle gets dirty with gunk.  I need an old toothbrush to clean the Sonicare handle!  This is not really the Sonicare&#x27;s fault but is still gross.    Another small complaint is that the head is a bit more difficult to remove than prior models I have owned where you screw them off.  This one has to be pulled straight off, and I feel like I am going to break it.    I am happy with this model and recommend it, even though it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!  My previous rechargable toothbrush from another company doesn&#x27;t come close to this Sonicare.  Everyday my teeth feel like I just had them professionally cleaned.  You can store and clean the brush head in a small compartment next to the recharging handle.  It comes with a travel power cord and a travel case for the toothbrush. Documentation says it actually holds a charge for 21 days but I haven&#x27;t put it to the test yet.  It may cost a bit more but I truly believe it will save a lot of money at the the dentist&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several toothbrushes in the past and none of them have cleaned my teeth like this Sonicare has.  A couple of things to keep in mind:  Make sure you use it for the recommended 2 minutes - don&#x27;t cut that time short.  Also, flossing and mouthwash should also continue to be used.  However, if all three are done correctly, your dentist visits will be quick and easy.    The only negative thing about this product -- the UV bulb sometimes won&#x27;t come on, so I have to take it out and rotate it around in the device until it activates.  This is a bit annoying.  Other than this, great product!</li>
            <li> This is the best - I put it on the Re-fresh mode and works better then any tooth brushing. My dentist says my gums are improved and this has improved them. Works better then a brushing and faster. Just work slow on the under-side of teeth not to hit teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have had this toothbrush (with two heads, of course) for about a month.  So far, it is working wonderfully.  We replaced an old Sonicare model, and this one is easier to use, easier to store, probably much easier to take traveling.  We have not used the sanitizer yet, but assume that will work well, too.  Even though we use pretty basic features, this product seems very well made and we&#x27;re very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using my new tooth brush for only 2 weeks now but I can already say it&#x27;s an excellent product! Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least in my case, I could quickly notice the difference in the quality of my dental hygiene. I can really feel as my teeth are cleaner. And I&#x27;m also pretty sure that it&#x27;s even making my teeth whiter as it&#x27;s removing some of the stains and most of the plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feature that gives me a quick beep+pause every 30 secs is quite useful and the UV sterilizer is awesome too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already subscribed to replacement brush heads pack from Amazon every 3 months since I intend to use this beauty for a long time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of days now and what a difference between my old Oral-B and this one. My teeth feel very clean. It does its job well. Not too convinced with the UV de-sanitizer but the handle and brush quality is pretty high. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Product is very useful, easy to use and helps in keeping us out of dental problems. Especially it saves time and provides enthusiasm for kids to do brushing every time they do it.    I recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush is excellent in every way.  I like the 30 second timer, so I can get full and equal coverage.  Selecting between modes is quite easy.  The travel case is convenient, battery life appears good although I&#x27;ve not stressed it yet.  But what I&#x27;m most pleased about is the bacteria -killing compartment:  after each use I put the brush part inside the door, close it, press the top button, and voila.  Maybe this isn&#x27;t an issue, but I figure why not have a completely clean brush after each use?  It is easy enough to do.</li>
            <li> still rocking it years later</li>
            <li> Got the product, took a day getting used to, but now I love the thing. My teeth look sweet now.     Anyway, the UV thing didn&#x27;t work when I got it, but Amazon sent a replacement in no time. Awesome customer service.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush - you must get a version with a timer, don&#x27;t even have to think about if you&#x27;re brushing long enough. Seems like an eternity at first though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl who grew up using technology from a very young age. While some people are technophobes, I am quite the opposite-- a gadget geek. So after years of finally debating whether or not it was worth it to make the switch from an old-fashioned toothbrush to an electric, I decided it was time to go for it-- and time to go for one of the best.  After carefully comparing brands, costs, model features, and durability, I knew I wanted a Sonicare brush. Although they tend to be the most expensive brushes, they have longevity which stands out, much like the Kitchenaid of stand mixers.  I decided to go for this model because it wasn&#x27;t the highest model, yet it still had all the features I really needed. The gum care mode seemed great for me because I tended to bleed in my gums from brushing too hard. I would pretty much bleed every time I brushed my teeth-- that was what finally convinced me. Also, the UV cleaning part seems really awesome. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually works, but I put my brush head in for a cleaning after every use. At the very least, it&#x27;s a placebo that makes me feel like it&#x27;s becoming clean and I don&#x27;t have to become some crazy germophobe.  Beyond that, I was concerned about the fact that the brushes didn&#x27;t rotate. But after reading all the reviews, I was convinced that this was the brush I had to have.  I eagerly waited for my new gadget. I paid Amazon Prime for the overnight shipping, I was so excited. I tore the box open and plugged everything in. It should be noted that the toothbrush came ready-to-use with 2/3 bars of battery life.  Brushing with this toothbrush feels like scrubbing your body after a long summer day. Incredibly refreshing, and you just don&#x27;t realize how many unpleasant things are on your teeth until you use this toothbrush. I actually enjoy brushing my teeth because I love the feeling of them becoming clean. Yes, you can actually feel your teeth becoming cleaner while it works. I originally turned off the setting that allowed thebrush to beep every 30 seconds, indicating you should move onto another quarter of your mouth, I actually turned it back on, because I found if it wasn&#x27;t on I wouldn&#x27;t manage my tooth-brushing as accurately as I should have.  Not only that, but unlike a normal tooth brush, you don&#x27;t have to move your arm around. It&#x27;s great for people with arthritis or carpal tunnel in your hands, because it has a wide handle that is easy to maneuver. It remembers your settings every time you use it.  Apparently, it also has a setting that for the first few uses, it slowly increases its pressure so you can get accustomed to it-- a feature which was ingeniously awesome for people like me, switching from a normal toothbrush.  The best part is that my gums haven&#x27;t bled since I started using this, because now I don&#x27;t have to apply lots of pressure to feel like my teeth are getting clean. I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth are getting whiter. And I actually enjoy brushing my teeth.  How can you beat that?</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve bought. First one broke within 1-2 years. There&#x27;s no way to repair it. So I bought a second one, broke down around the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old Sonicare toothbrushes used to last much longer. Looks like the company is pumping up its profits by making them in a way that consistently breaks down shortly after the warranty expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, it works well, but replacing broken toothbrushes and buying new brush heads will run you around $200+ per year. Wish someone had told me this 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this toothbrush upon my first use.  I purchased after routine dental cleaning and everytime I use it I get that professional cleaning feel.  It has included portable charger but it hold charges well so I did not need to charge it for week long trip.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased a power toothbrush until my dentist gave me a hard time during my last appointment. I read a ton of reviews on which one to purchase before settling on this brush. It&#x27;s been a few months, and it has been great.    Pros:  -I LOVE the UV sterilization of the brushes  -There&#x27;s a 2 week \\&quot;training\\&quot; period when just start using the brush to get you adjusted  -The battery life is great, I&#x27;ve kept it off the base for about a month and it&#x27;s still charged  -The pause system letting you know when to switch sections of your mouth  -Instructions are very easy  -5 different settings depending on what you want to do   -Comes with multiple colored bands so you can share the wand and switch the heads    Cons:  -When you just get started it feels really odd and almost tickles. I&#x27;ve adjusted since, but the sensation was very awkward the first few times.</li>
            <li> This thing really humms. I can&#x27;t feel the tarter on my teeth at the gumline anymore. I used the old brush the other day, boy what a waste of time that was. I especially like the 4 different cleaning times for each quadrant of your teeth. The unit stops for a microsecond and then you get on to another section 4 times and it cuts off. The infrared brush cleaner is also cool especially if you are a germ-a-fobic. They have models without that option and battery powered as well. I recommend rechargable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product so far.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that spending $200 on a toothbrush would get you something that would last beyond the first six weeks - you&#x27;d be wrong, at least in this case. Although the brush itself continues to function, the built-in UV sanitizing port (which sanitizes the brush head in a ten minute light cycle), started acting erratically after three weeks, requiring you to push the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button repeatedly - sometimes more than seven or eight times - and now, this morning, has quit altogether.  Since the purchase was over 30 days ago, the Amazon vendor won&#x27;t take it back.  I now have to go directly to the manufacturer, box the damn thing up, and wait weeks for a replacement unit (assuming they honor the warranty).  Nice.</li>
            <li> This is the best investment in personal care that I&#x27;ve made in a long time! I love how it makes my teeth feel like I just left the dentist, but without the dentist price! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I never get great reviews at the dentist&#x27;s office. I&#x27;m not the most reliable flosser, to say the least. BUT- at my last appointment, he told me that my gums had improved dramatically and my teeth look great! I told him I bought this brush and guess what? He uses the FlexCare Plus, too!  The brush hold its charge for about two weeks, it seems. It has many different settings and is easy to use. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an older sonicare model.  It&#x27;s easier to clean after use.  The only problem I have is accidentally changing the setting from clean to another of the settings- so I&#x27;ve got to watch it.  Otherwise, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and throw this out there: I&#x27;m gross. I don&#x27;t like brushing my teeth. I&#x27;m fine with it in the morning since nobody likes a stank-mouth and I do want to keep my teeth from rotting out of my head, but I&#x27;ve never really been a night brusher. Unless I&#x27;ve had something particularly offensive for dinner, I usually just fall into bed, plaque and all. This toothbrush has transformed me.    I had a lot of cavities as a kid (as I&#x27;m sure you can imagine), and now that I&#x27;m an adult, those old fillings have started to go. As such, I recently had to have seven of them replaced (thankfully, no new cavities!). They also did a periodontal exam (which I hadn&#x27;t had in a couple years), and I was shocked by how bad the results were. The dentist didn&#x27;t freak out and tell me my gums were about to rot, but I did have much worse scores than I expected, considering I am a generally well-kept 25-year-old woman. I figured maybe it&#x27;s time for something new in my routine.    I am an engineer/total tech geek, so of course when I saw \\&quot;UV chamber!\\&quot; I immediately had to have this product. I mean, come on. Super cool. Plus it looks like a space toothbrush, and who doesn&#x27;t love space? If sonic technology is good enough for Doctor Who, it&#x27;s certainly good enough for me.    Yeah, it&#x27;s a pricey toothbrush, but so is getting fillings or being treated for gum disease. I&#x27;ve spent this much money on much more useless things. (Automatic electronic vacuum cleaner collecting dust in the corner, for example.)    So, I ordered this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve used electric tootbrushes in the past. I can&#x27;t recall which brand, but I know it wasn&#x27;t a Sonicare. They worked better than a manual toothbrush, which is what I expected from this, but other than that I had no real expectations.    After dutifully doing the 24-hour battery charge, I was very excited to brush my teeth. I turned on the Sonicare, and frankly, was immediately turned off. I thought my brain was going to rattle out of my head. Two lessons learned: This takes some getting used to, and a light touch is key.    Holy clean mouth, Batman.    I have never, never experienced this level of clean with a manual toothbrush. While I may not have LIKED brushing my teeth before, I would always be extremely thorough when I brushed. Too thorough, actually - my dentist saw some gum recession where I&#x27;d been brushing too hard. I can even get a really good clean back on my molars and wisdom teeth. Sure, they&#x27;re coming out soon, but I&#x27;d still prefer they didn&#x27;t rot before that happens.    To attempt to not make an already-long review even longer, I am now obsessed with brushing my teeth. I&#x27;ve even been flossing at night and using mouthwash morning and night. I expect these other good habits to taper off as time goes on, but at least I&#x27;ll still have my toothbrush. I actually wish I could brush my teeth MORE often - I can&#x27;t get over how awesomely clean my teeth feel, and I want them to feel that way all the time. I have no doubt that my next dental exam will be very different.    ----    The main takeaway: This is an excellent toothbrush.  It&#x27;s pricey, but you will never find a toothbrush that leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than this one, and personally I find it hard to put a price tag on excellent hygiene. And, if you are a gross person like me who usually doesn&#x27;t like brushing, it will change your outlook. Particularly if you are the nerd variety and enjoy fun new gadgets, and being able to tell people that your new space toothbrush has a UV sanitation chamber.</li>
            <li> I received this Sonicare as a gift.  I always wanted one but the price kept me away.  I LOVE this so much that I have decided to purchase one for each of my children. IT is the best ever!!!  My teeth felt so clean after brushing them and the next morning they still felt clean! I am sure that the money that I spend purchasing these for my children will be well spent as I am sure that when I take them to the dentist, the savings will really show by way of less cavities. This is more than a power brush, this is an investment in your health!</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus is simply the BEST electric toothbrush on the market. I had always used a manual toothbrush until my dentist recommend the Sonicare FlexCare Plus and I will never go back. Both me and my dentist have noticed significant improvement in my oral and dental health. I highly recommend the Sonicare FlexCare Plus to anyone thinking of purchasing it; you will not be disappointed. It also includes a convenient and protective hard-shell travel case. Look nowhere else, Amazon offers the best price on this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Light, easy to keep clean, smart shape!  Don&#x27;t need to worry about the space to place it!  I guess the next model should be wireless.</li>
            <li> We had one of these last us 2 years and our dentist gave us one and it lasted 6 months.  I love this toothbrush but I am totally disapointed in how long they last.</li>
            <li> First let me begin by telling you that I did not care much about brushing my teeth daily.&lt;br /&gt;I only did it when I remember or when I had time.&lt;br /&gt;Everything changed when I bought this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;Now I am addicted to using it! It CLEANS MY TEETH so perfectly! They are so clean that I want to clean them every hour because I feel they get are dirty!&lt;br /&gt;Never had my teeth so clean. NEVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely Easy to use, and charging it is a breeze! (no need to plug in cables or anything, its charged by induction!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low noise, I remember hearing my brothers old sonic care version, and hated the noise it made, on this one you don&#x27;t notice it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These toothbrush is just amazing! It boosts your self-esteem! Seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey, but if you are the lazy person that does not like to brush their teeth this will make you change your mind, once you learn what clean really means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck, I even feel like brushing my teeth again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this feels like its also flossing your teeth, I might be wrong though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative thing I can say about is that, when you put in the toothpaste, MAKE SURE ITS INSIDE YOUR MOUTH! Otherwise it will fall from the toothbrush. Trust me! This thing is one powerful toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it! You wont regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This was my first expensive battery toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for over 6 months and it has done an amazing job on my teeth.  I love the different cleaning settings and the sanitizing cycle.  The charge lasts a really long time.  A minor problem is that sometimes when brushing, my hand hits the off button.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Sonicare toothbrush about 10 years ago and it is one of the best products that I have ever used. It recently broke in Aug 2011 so I bought me this model and once again I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. If you have never used a Sonicsre toothbrush it might take about a week to get use to it. Once you have adapted to it you will never buy another brand again. The one I bought was a Dental Office Only model so I was hesitant at first but it had all the parts I needed for travel and home. If your shopping around I would recommend the Sonicare name as the Rolls Royce of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Great product! After only a few uses my whole mouth felt much cleaner. My dentist recommended this particular model and I can&#x27;t thank her enough. Also aids in gum health. With continued use I believe I will maintain optimal oral health!</li>
            <li> I have  been using the Flexcare + for about a month now.  It seems to be doing the job of my now defunct, 10 year old Sonicare.  I like the antibacterial chamber especially now that cold and flu season are approaching.  However,  the shape of the brush is disappointing.  It has too steep of an arc so the center of the brush doesn&#x27;t come in contact with my teeth properly.  That means I have to move the brush around more than I am used to with my old Sonicare.  The charging capability is fantastic.  This toothbrush stays charged way longer than my last.  Glad to see that technology has improved. The small travel charger is great.  Overall, Sonicare is an excellent product.  I hope this rechargable toothbrush lasts as long as my last one.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is amazing. my teeth feel as if i had just left the dentist everyday. it also helps whiten my teeth. the bacteria killer is a great feature. this was a great buy</li>
            <li> As of writing this review I have been using this toothbrush for 2 years. This is the second Philips sonic toothbrush I have owned. The first was an older type I used for about 2 years, but they discontinued it and no longer made the replacement heads so I bought this model. The first one did excellent and the several times I went to the dentist for a checkup after buying it I had practically no plaque on my teeth (and no cavities, but that was normal anyway). Usually I would have a little plaque in those hard to reach places, but now it was practically all gone. In fact, one time the dentist asked if I had just had my teeth clean recently, but I had not since my checkup about a year before.  This toothbrush has had the same results as the previous one so I&#x27;m very happy with it. Also, the addition of the UV light to sterilize the heads is very nice. It also comes with a travel charger that is nice and compact so you don&#x27;t have to stuff the entire base unit in your suitcase to go on vacation. That being said, I have used it for a week before without charge so short trips will not even require a recharge.  Overall, I think this is a great toothbrush and I would recommend it, especially considering how important it is to take care of your teeth.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer bulb burns out.  Finding a replacement is very difficult.  I had to spend several hours before I was able to do so.  Be wary of the product for this reason.  Philips doesn&#x27;t appear to care very much about customer service.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush about a month ago to replace a 6 year old rechargeable toothbrush. I primarily use the \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; setting which gives 2 minutes of brushing with a 30 second interval reminder tone to move to the next quadrant. I find this feature very useful. The brushing cycles per second are much greater than my older unit and this does a great job in removing any residue on the teeth after flossing. This product comes with two brushing heads. I prefer the smaller head as I find it easier to maneuver into and brush confined areas. I occasionally use the UV sanitizing feature but really have no way of telling if it is of any benefit and will probably discontinue it&#x27;s use.   The end results of a 2 minute \\&quot; Clean\\&quot; cycle is a much cleaner feel than the older sonic technology.</li>
            <li> I am going to start off and say this was the best tooth cleaning product ever.  That is, until it died 4 months later. I foolishly bought another right away, and it last only 5 months. What a poorly made product if it can&#x27;t withstand brushing twice a day. The replacement heads are a joke too. They only lasted a month a piece instead of 3 months. I then got a 8 dollar spin brush. Works fine and is not costing me a fortune!</li>
            <li> I am one that uses these reviews in researching important purchases.  Dental care is definitely important and something I wish I had taken more seriously in my younger days...  The Sonicare FlexCare Plus is everything it advertises. I put very little weight on the UV Sanitize feature, however I came down with flu virus shortly after I began using this brush and what a relief to have that available!    This is a definite upgrade from previous models; lighter, longer battery life, and more controlled cleaning.  I honestly do not believe you can go wrong with this product and you will be hard pressed to find something better.  (and Amazon is the only place to purchase!)</li>
            <li> My hygentist really wanted me to get this model. I had a previous sonicare which was good but this one stays much cleaner and all the weird gunk does not acumulate on the device. I just took it on a 7 day trip with the portable charging unit but never had to charge it during the trip. I will see how the results are when I visit the dentist again in a few months.</li>
            <li> My boss bought a Philips Sonicare toothbrush about 5 years ago, raved about hers and told me I should get one.  I didn&#x27;t buy one at that time (I should have)and have recently purchased a Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus because of gum erosion due to my brushing my teeth too hard (and because my boss recommended hers).  Let me tell you I am so impressed with the functions of this toothbrush and how user friendly it is.  There are several brushing settings so, if you have sensitive teeth, there is a setting for that.  If you have gum issues or a head cold, you just put the toothbrush head in the sanitizer for 10 minutes and it is clean for the next time.  My mouth and teeth feel so fresh.  It&#x27;s like I have just come from the dentist.  I would highly recommend this product.  It arrived on time, and I am well pleased.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> There are plenty of reviews here with the pros and cons, etc. I&#x27;ll keep it short and simple. I read a lot of the reviews here and finally decided to buy it after the overwhelming amount of positive reviews. This being my first ever electric toothbrush, I can say that my mouth/teeth have never felt so clean. Definitely worth it. Wish it came with more brush heads though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** 6 Month Update***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken two stars away from this product due to the fact the replacement heads do not last the 3 months as advertised by the manufacturer. These replacement heads (3-pack) range from $20-26 depending on what day you catch it on. That&#x27;s expensive considering they don&#x27;t last that long. The blue strip will turn white and the bristles aren&#x27;t as firm in a matter of weeks, not months. It&#x27;s starting to feel a lot like Gillette now...</li>
            <li> The cleaning apparatus kept going out; just did not work.&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle wore out in 1.5 years!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty expensive for the time it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;Brush replacements are rediculously expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve owned if for about 5 years now, and it still works great. Holds a charge well too. I&#x27;ve used the UV cleaner on it. I don&#x27;t know what it really does. Mostly, I just enjoy this toothbrush. Also, it has several settings and it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out. I saw these for sell all over town in dental offices (I work in a dental lab), and wanted one. They were charging full price for their&#x27;s. I got mine here a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> The handle still works, but the prong that holds the toothbrush into the handle came off when I was pulling a toothbrush off. Can&#x27;t stick it back in. This product is defective and should not be bought without a major redesign. The metal prong is just press fit into plastic, yet it is the main vibrating part. It will just come off in time. Poor design AND poor manufacturing.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush!  I checked all over the web and found the best price (by far) on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I never used a elec. brush in the past. This thing is great! my teeth seem whiter and the brushing time is cut in half.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it works great! I can hardly wait to go to the dentist and see what he thinks of my clean teeth!</li>
            <li> I ordered this about 3 weeks ago. Still haven&#x27;t received it. I wrote to them several times and never got a response. Give me my money back!</li>
            <li> I like the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus a lot. The battery life before recharging is long and it is comfortable   to use it. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love the Sonicare toothbrushes and this one is awesome. I love the sleek new design. I also like the way it charges giving you many hours of use.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I really like the clean feeling that the Sonicare leaves and my gums feel much healthier. However, I have only&lt;br /&gt;had my Philips Sonicare for only a couple of weeks so time will tell if it has actually improved the health of my gums.</li>
            <li> The cleaning features are ok and pretty typical but the bells and whistles are bogus.  The UV cleaning feature failed after less than 6 months and their desire to get you to buy brushes after a relatively short usage strikes me as strictly an attempt to generate money.  Get a cheap version - they work fine and you don&#x27;t need the other stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using oral b electric for many years, then switched to soniccare based on my hygenist recommendation. What a great clean feeling from soniccare. Just like getting a cleaning from the dentist.</li>
            <li> We used a Sonicare for 8 years and if the on/off rubber switch hadn&#x27;t finally disintegrated, might have used it for 8 more.  The older screw-on brush model is still available but this one is slimmer with more bells and whistles.  Yeah, right, we needed more bells and whistles to brush our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing out of the box you find one regular adult brush.  The second one is a small round baby brush?  If you want an additional adult brush for the spouse, you have to buy it separately.  Amazon&#x27;s writeup is frankly deceptive! We decided we would just use it till it wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used this Phillips model for about 6 weeks and neither of us would recommend it!  As a matter of fact, my wife insisted I write this review she is so unhappy.  Why?  It is almost impossible to take the brush off the shaft.  I can&#x27;t grip the shaft or even the brush at the base of the bristles where it is wider and pull it off with thumb and forefinger, it takes the whole hand!  No wonder it comes with an ultraviolet light to disinfect it.  This is beyond ridiculous!  I can see how the shaft might have come off in some of the other reviews, the pull required to remove the brush is enormous.  My wife can&#x27;t remove her brush at all, I have to.  And she is definitely not enamored with my gripping the whole brush to pull it off.  Someone with arthritis would find it impossible.  I wish I had stayed with the older screw on brush model and I recommend anyone considering this model do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it does as good a job cleaning the teeth as the old model we wore out.  And we don&#x27;t use the other features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;A year on I&#x27;m more generous with my review.  The tooth brushes are still not easily removed, my wife has to use a metal gizmo to pry hers off, but they are a bit easier to remove for me. Cleaning is superb. The only other nit I have  is the ease of hitting the selection button for all the other speeds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sonicare user for many years and this new model is the best by far. worth the price. [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older model of the Sonicare toothbrush for the past two years and I love it. My teeth are really clean and my dentist approves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FlexCare Plus is even better. The features have been improved and they&#x27;ve added a gum massage function that&#x27;s terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one problem I had with the older model was that when you selected what function you wanted - sensitive, regular or quick brush - you couldn&#x27;t tell for sure that you had selected correctly.  They fixed that in this new one. You can now easily select what mode you want and it stays highlighted on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve loved my older Sonicare and this one is even better. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Since no one else is writing a review.. or a long one that is.. here it is.    I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good electric toothbrush and I&#x27;ve heard many bad things about the older models of sonicare such as mold build up/gunk build up/stale water (which is why i ultimately settled on this model, newest and no nooks &amp; crannies to clean). So I did some research on Sonicare models and I found out this is the latest and most improved model and looks great.     If you&#x27;re wondering how it cleans, it&#x27;s pretty much a vibrating toothbrush that you go back and forth at a angle towards your teeth (with some pressure applied for maximum clean) at a forward and back motion. You clean the front side of your top portion of your teeth&#x27;s, then the inside, then switch to the bottom front, then the innards of your front teeth and finally you clean the enamels of your teeth&#x27;s for the top side and bottom side for a complete clean.     Travel case, UV sanitizer, Travel Charger all seem sturdy, but has a plastic feel to it, travel case is pretty hard so thats good.     Also comes with two brush heads, one of them is smaller (no clue why).    Pros:  1. Looks great, nice and slim  2. Very easy to use, one button for on and off and another to switch modes  3. Very easy to attach and detach brush heads. There will be a light space between the brush head and unit when you fully attach it.  4. Very easy to clean the brush head and the unit itself, run it thru warm water and UV sanitizer for additional cleaning  5. Long battery life (3 weeks)  6. Comes with travel case + charger for those that needs to take this on trips but you&#x27;ll have to buy your own adapter to charge in other countries.    a. I don&#x27;t know if this is a con or pro but the unit is slightly loud, but not to the point where you&#x27;ll wake up your whole family, just a normal whirling sound.    Con:  1. very uncomfortable initial use but you&#x27;ll get use to it (mainly because of how it vibrates and it can irritate your gum, again, it all about getting use to it, and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure towards your teeth or it will hurt, a little bit will do).  2. High price   3. Expensive brush heads compared to Oral b.    4. \\&quot;Stuff\\&quot; will come flying out, so it is a bit messy when you use this.    Thats about it for cons, when I have more problems with the unit I will edit.      TIPS:  1. Charge it the second you get it for 24 hours for a full charge (last three weeks, maybe longer)  2. Buy more brush heads to share with family members, very easy to detach and clean.    Conclusion:   It&#x27;s a great investment if you&#x27;re a &#x27;lazy&#x27; brusher and just want machine to do all the work for you (since good manual brushing can produce good results as well, at least comparable).  If you have the money +  you&#x27;re a little lazy + you don&#x27;t mind replacing brush heads that are a tad more expensive than Oral B&#x27;s and your manual toothbrushes then... this is a great buy!!     I recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the last version of this Sonicare FlexCare for 2 years now.  This was my first experience using an electric toothbrush, so I did not know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has a Gum Care mode, which previously with the electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had is Max Care, which is 2 minutes of Clean, and 1 minute of Massage, so the options are changed alittle by name.  The layout of your options is alittle different too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this new one.  They are all in line.  I love the idea of having different options.  Most times I use just the Clean Mode, and sometimes I will run it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like knowing I have brushed my teeth the recommended amount of time.  It is alot less strain on your hand and arm using an electric toothbrush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I ran the Sensitive mode, just to see how hard it would be on my teeth,or how hard it would be to get used to.  The first few times I used it, it did kind of tickle, but it takes very little time to adjust to using this.  In fact, I look forward to using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most dramatic thing happened tho.  I had this dark spot on one of my upper teeth,in the upper right hand corner, near the gum line. Soon after using the Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush the spot disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was always self conscious about the spot, so this certainly has made me feel more confident when I smile.  I think your smile is one of the first things, if not the first thing people will notice when they look at you, so to have that added confidence is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do change the brush heads every 3 months like they recommend.  They are alittle pricey, but I do notice the difference when Iam using a new brush head, or closer to when I first have changed it, to when it&#x27;s closer to the 3 month change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, it&#x27;s worth the expense of replacing the brush heads, because what would be the point of using this electric toothbrush, if Iam not going to use it correctly?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush has made my teeth alot whiter, given my smile confidence, which in turn has given me confidence.  I can&#x27;t afford dental insurance, so to me, this Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush is my dental insurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I will never go back to using a manual toothbrush again!  You think a manual toothbrush is doing a good job of cleaning your teeth, but it takes using this Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush to see that it wasn&#x27;t. I know I never had such dramatic results ever using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just leave my unit plugged in, so that I know it&#x27;s always read to go.  Everytime I use my toothbrush, after I have cleaned my teeth, I take the brushhead off, rinse it, then I put it into the small area where the UV Sanitizer is, press that button, which turns on the blue light to sanitize the brush head.  I just leave it in there til the next time I brush my teeth.  That way, I always know my brush head has been sanitized.  I love having the UV Sanitizer.  Who wants a germy brush head, that will then go into your mouth to clean your teeth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with stickers to remind you to change your brush head, but I just put in in my planner every 3 months, to remind me to change my brush head.  When Iam on my last brush head, I order or buy new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush is well worth the price.  My dad who recently turned 82, just had all his teeth pulled in May, 2009, to get dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hearing about his ordeal, and seeing his difficulty in eating with dentures, I know I want to keep my teeth as healthy as possible, to possibly avert having to go through the same thing.  I want to keep my own teeth as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely do not want to have to go through what he went through!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my dentist recommended it to me. I was skeptical because I have never owned a electric brush I liked and always went back to the manual type. Also it seemed expensive for a toothbrush. I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality and performance. I would recommend this and as far as the $ goes if it saves me time in \\&quot;THE CHAIR\\&quot; it will be worth every cent. The only downside it the way overpriced replacement heads. Hope this helped;-)</li>
            <li> This really works n you see a big differences it helps your teeth to be healthy gums buy it you will be happy with sonicare</li>
            <li> I have been MORE than satisfied with this purchase....the unit functions perfectly and Amazon&#x27;s service was excellent, but more important is the fact that I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist EVERY morning and evening after using it....my teeth feel completely smooth and I can&#x27;t feel any residual plaque build up!  I definately recommend using this product.      I prefer the compact brush.  It makes it much less awkward when moving the brush along your teeth...because the standard brush is longer it makes it more difficult to reach the inside contours of your teeth!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to update my old Sonicare. This model was recommended by my dentist. I began using it a couple of weeks after having my teeth cleaned. I have noticed after 6 weeks that the plague build-up between my teeth is not only reduced but my teeth are overall whiter. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. I had used an Oral-B for years and didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing. Far superior quality and more gentle on the gums. Take it from someone who has overbrushed!I like th 30-second timer to keep me focused on a quadrant before moving on. Don&#x27;t know hoe effective the \\&quot;sanitizer\\&quot; is but it looks cool anyway. Nice travel container for brush and brush-heads as well.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Philips Sonicare FlexCare plus, Rechargeable toothbruth with the sanitizer to help keep my teeth, gums, filings, and crowns clean in order to make them last longer and stay healthy.  I really like the way my teeth have that fresh feeling after using this toothbrush that is like just leaving the dentist office.  I feel like this was a worthwhile purchase and I got a good deal by buying it on Amazon.com.  I&#x27;ve sent in [...] Sonicare from the dentist and hope to receive it soon which makes a good deal even better.</li>
            <li> This brush fixes previous design flaws of the Sonicare electric toothbrushes.  My E-series brush (which used a NiCad battery and had the screw-on brush head) recently went out on me.  So I decided to purchase a new Sonicare brush.  Let me talk about the reasons this brush is the best on the market for oral health:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The textured bristles along with the 31,000 vibrations per minute not only remove plaque on the surface of the teeth, but effectively penetrate several millimeters below the gumline to break up plaque and kill bacteria.  The only thing that effectively delivers a plaque-reducing and bacteria-killing mechanism even deeper into the gumline is an oral irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) It uses a lithium-ion battery.  Lithium-ion batteries are more powerful and don&#x27;t have a charge memory like older batteries do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) It comes with an enclosed case for the brush head.  Let&#x27;s be realistic, bathrooms are filthy places.  Flushing the toilet with the lid up can spray fecal particulate in a 6 foot radius.  With the enclosure for the brush heads, they are not only protected from this, but they may also be sanitized by the UV light that comes with the unit.  I don&#x27;t suggest using the UV light every time you brush, as that may (read: WILL) prematurely age the bristles.  Once every 3 days is a better suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The brush head simply snaps on.  On the older E-series Sonicare brushes, the screw on heads would become absolutely filthy and black with toothpaste residue and who knows what else.  Who want&#x27;s to maintain a toothbrush like they would a car engine?  The new brush heads snap on, have no place for debris to be trapped, and are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5) Automatic timer- The manual shows how to segregate your mouth into quadrants.  The brush has a timer for each quadrant (outside diameter of top teeth, inside diameter of top teeth, outside diameter for bottom teeth, and inside diameter for bottom teeth).  On the &amp;#34;Gum Care&amp;#34; setting, it gives you the timer for these quadrants, along with an additional minute for other areas of the mouth that need attention (definitely the tongue, cheeks, and chewing surfaces of the teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in review, this is the most powerful brush Sonicare currently makes (The Diamond series isn&#x27;t any more powerful).  Its incredibly hygienic due to the snap on head, brush enclosure, and UV light.  It also promotes proper brush time due to it&#x27;s timers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I estimate this product to last two to three years based on brushing twice daily.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used for my teeth.  It also makes brushing fun for me as well.  When I was finished brushing I felt like I just left the dentist and I could not stop rubbing my tongue against my teeth it was like I just got my braces off because of the fact of how smooth my teeth were.  Yea its kinda expensive but if you think about the going rate for a cavity  its worth it in the end.  If you have the money then buy this because its really like no other as far as taking care of your teeth.</li>
            <li> This brush has met all the hype and then some.  I have stain problems on my teeth, my dentist recommended this one and it has been great.  the gum massage feature is also wonderful and gives your mouth a whole new feel.  For those who have not been use to an electric brush, it will break you in slowly so your gums will not be sore.  That is also a nice feature, because most don&#x27;t think of that when they start with this type of brush.  It&#x27;s a go for me</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having just used a regular brush all my life, I was amazed at the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;options&amp;#34;  like clean, gum care, etc. etc., most seemed the same, like the pitch or vibration did not change.  but this is insignificant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying these as gifts (hoping that they don&#x27;t take it the wrong way) and recommend this product to anyone who wants their teeth and gums to feel really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy the diamond brush heads, I should note.  I have not tried the ones that come with the flexCare plus yet, I went with the &#x27;upgrade&#x27; ones for my first try.</li>
            <li> It was great while it worked. I was having excellent results and my dentist was very pleased. Until it died exactly one year after I bought it. The warranty is for two years so it was still good. I called their customer service care and they were very helpful. But the whole thing was a comedy of errors. First, they sent me a new toothbrush replacement. I put it in my old charger and it wouldn&#x27;t charge. Then they decided that it was probably the charger. So, they sent me a new charger. The new toothbrush still wouldn&#x27;t charge. Then they decided to try another new toothbrush. This time it worked. The whole rigmarole took 4 months. So, to sum it up, they sent me a defective model to replace the dead one and ended going through 2 toothbrushes. I am expecting it to die after one year, by then, the warranty will have expired. I will have a cheaper model next time.</li>
            <li> This broke after little over a year.  Very disappointing. I have extra heads and now no power unit. I will not get this again.</li>
            <li> Has made a difference in oral care. Removed surface stains, hygienist was impressed with my results.  Recommend to all changing brushes.</li>
            <li> This product is of poor quality! The motor has very low power. After 3 months of use, it finally stopped working. It&#x27;s totally a waste of money ($50/month) for a toothbrush like this.</li>
            <li> One of the BEST toothbrush we&#x27;ve ever tried.  Cleans teeth just like a dentist office!  Can&#x27;t say enough possitive statements regarding this item!</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush. After the first use (and all others) I felt like I had just been to the dentist for a teeth cleaning. I like the timer to tell you when to change quadrants and that it turns off automatically. I like knowing that my toothbrush is clean of germs and bacteria after each use. Next week I will try out the travel accessories and see how I like those.</li>
            <li> Purchased August 24th, 2011 &amp; I enjoyed it while it lasted, but it broke on Feb 17th, 2012.  What a waste of $150!  Negative 10000 stars....</li>
            <li> I bought this after recommendation from Dentist.  This product is great, it will keep your gums clean and make your trips to the dentist more pleasant. This is the most effective prevention of gum disease available. use it on your gum lines too!</li>
            <li> It was as described&lt;br /&gt;got different heads (diamond clean) because i didn&#x27;t like the feel&lt;br /&gt;but&lt;br /&gt;all the parts were there, travel case and base and extra head&lt;br /&gt;been using it for a year i think and it still charges perfect battery lasts&lt;br /&gt;and the uv rays for the tooth head is really nice&lt;br /&gt;kills germs whiny our sick&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> Mine stopped working after 2 years. This toothbrush is made to break after the warranty so you can buy their new model.</li>
            <li> I wish my dentist had shared about the toothbrush.  Instead I just had to investigate for myself.  I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as an &#x27;upgrade&#x27;  from my Braun brush (not a sonic unit). Unfortunately, this unit completely failed (mechanically-seems the motor just &#x27;gave out&#x27;)-after aprox 3yrs. The Braun however, is still going strong after 13 yrs (I gave it to my mother). W/o the original purchase info Phillips cust support could not verify any warranty info-which is fair. And they could only offer discount on new item. Cust support was nice enough-but no, I&#x27;ll get another Braun.</li>
            <li> The Philips SoniCare tooth brush was everything that was advertized:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Attractive case;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy to use;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Very ergometric;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy to understand and read intructions;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. And it does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> been using it for a year. very easy to grab and control. i take 3-4 minutes to brush my teeth so i have to restart the toothbrush when it automatically stops after two minutes. Works well with DiamondClean toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works extremely well, but after nine months the shaft broke free of the motor. According to Phillips this is a known problem, to me it&#x27;s $140 wasted. In contrast, my wife has the comparable Oral B model and it has performed flawlessly for four years.  In summary, a good toothbrush, but plan on replacing it after less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This problem doesn&#x27;t come up in Amazon reviews which are usually written right after purchase and give little hint as to reliability. A web search provides a more problematic assessment of the long-term value this purchase.</li>
            <li> After owning this for 6 months now it has been a very solid purchase. I&#x27;m glad I went with this model with the UV sanitizer and all of the other accessories. Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush for two montsh.  I went to the dentist for my yearly cleaning.  the technican who was cleaning my teeth told me that my teeth were cleaned.  he didn&#x27;t had to do much cleaning compare to most of his clients.  he asked me what kind of toothbrush I use.  I told him that it is the flexcare plus.  and the battery last for a long time too.  I brought this toothbrush with me out in the field for three weeks without charging it.  by the time I get back from the field there was still some juice left in the battery.  highly recomended.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for $135 in August 31, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything worked great until November 2013, one day, once I started the toothbrush... it stayed on for like 5 seconds and stopped for 5 seconds and restarted ... then stopped and then started until the entire 2 minute brushing session is done. (was in the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later, my brush doesn&#x27;t charge anymore; and it&#x27;s dead completely.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a brush worth of $135 to work for only so short of time; so I&#x27;ve stocked up my brush heads. But now, I&#x27;m debating on if I should buy another Philips so I can use the rest of the brush heads, or just give up and try something else. Sighhhhhhh...</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this tooth brush. I&#x27;ve been using this tooth brush for about 3 years and love it as much today as I did 3 years ago. Prior to being a proud Sonicare owner, I used the Oral-B electric tooth brush. I went looking for a new brush for two reasons: one, the Oral-B brush heads always accumulated a gross slime inside of them, that really grossed me out. Who wants to put slime in their mouth when they are trying to CLEAN their teeth? Not I. The second reason I went looking for a new toothbrush, is that I really wanted a UV sanitizer for the toothbrush heads. Again, going back to not wanting to put something gross and loaded with germs in my mouth with the intention of cleaning. I solved both of these issues with this Sonicare, and much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, there is no gross slime getting stuck in these heads, and the UV sanitizer is amazing. I have read some other reviews that mentioned that daily use of the UV sanitizer can be cumbersome. I don&#x27;t find this to be an issue at all. It does take a full 10 minutes to complete a full sanitization session, but I just turn on the sanitation while I am showering and/or flossing- my regular morning routine, and by the time I am ready to brush, my heads are nice and sanitized &#x3D;). Other reviewers have also mentioned that the brush heads need to be perfectly aligned in the sanitizer for the door to close, but I have never had an issue of them not being \\&quot;aligned\\&quot; correctly. I just plop um on the peg, facing any direction and they fit perfectly! The brush heads come in 2 sizes, small and large, and one of each is included in the package, and I use the large ones and have still never had any issue with them fitting in the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Successfully meeting my 2 requirements for being happy with my new tooth brush, the Sonicare went above and beyond when it comes to the actual brushing. It truly is a revolutionary sort of \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; vibration. The Oral-B brush I used before just vibrated, this tooth brush seems to be a much more precise and advanced movement that vibrates with purpose. Its nearly impossible to explain the sensation of the Sonicare, but it truly cannot compare it to my old Oral-B. After using the this Sonicare for awhile, I went on vacation and grabbed my old Oral-B. When it came time to use it, I felt like the Oral-B didn&#x27;t clean my teeth at all! If felt clunky inside my mouth, and the vibrating felt almost useless. The Sonicare really leaves my teeth CLEAN; like just after a dental cleaning clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the different brushing mode options. &#x27;Refresh&#x27; is the 1 minute option, perfect for when I am in a rush. &#x27;Clean&#x27; is the 2 minute option, that I use most often. &#x27;GumCare&#x27; takes 3 minutes, the first 2 minutes of this mode are just like clean, and the last minute is more of the &#x27;massage&#x27; feature, which is a bit softer and is meant to use for brushing your gums. I use the &#x27;GumCare&#x27; option at night when I have the time. Then there is the just &#x27;massage&#x27; feature. All of these options have an amazing slight pause every 30 seconds, that you use to make sure you are spending equal time in each quadrant of your mouth. I know other reviewers have mentioned that the programming of the brush modes can be annoying, but honestly it is just pushing one button next to the name of the program you wish to use at that time. I know some people might want to set it for the one they like and have it always use that option, but me personally, I like to use different modes at different times, so it would annoy me more if it was set to one and I couldn&#x27;t change it as easily as I can now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another really cool thing about this brush is that it comes with 2 different chargers! One has the sanitizer attached to it, and the other one it for travel and does not come with a sanitizer. This toothbrush also comes with a travel case, and brush head covers, which is really cool. Also, the heads have a little plastic circle on it that comes in a few different colors, which is great for couples who share the toothbrush- each with a different color head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit confused about the difference between the NiCad battery and the Li-ion battery. The newer models have the Li-ion which is supposed to mean that the brush will run longer on a single charge, and won&#x27;t develop a memory by leaving it on the charging stand. However, I had the older model first and noticed that the newer one doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long. However, I had to purchase this newer one because my other battery eventually died, so hopefully this one will have a longer shelf-life, even if that means more charges in-between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this toothbrush VERY much, and strongly recommend it to everyone. One more thing I have to mention, ever since I began using this brush, my dentist tells me at every cleaning that I am plaque and tarter free! I really believe that I have this tooth brush to thank for that. &#x3D;)ferent colors, which is great for couples who share the toothbrush- each with a different color head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit confused about the difference between the NiCad battery and the Li-ion battery.

            <li> DISAPPOINTED, we have had Sonicare for years. Bought this for my husband 6 months ago &amp; it died. Started going off randomly then just died. He had his previous Sonicare for over 7 years. He loved it until is turned into a lemon.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing that has happened to my teeth.  Had to get used to the vibration, and now that I have I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this product, even though my dentist recommended it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush! I love the way it times your brushing and lets you know when to move on to the next quadrant &#x3D;O) I also love the ultraviolet light \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; for getting the brush head bacteria free. It tickled at first on my upper inside gums, but you quickly get used to it and it helps you with the 14 day period that it gradually gets up to full power. My mouth has never felt cleaner!![[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush is so much better than the Sonicare Elite (and all other E Series) model. No more having to clean out the gunk on the toothbrush. With the Flexcare toothbrush, the brush heads snap on and off, no twisting and no open space for gunk and mold to grow. The brush heads for this latest model are also a lot cheaper than with their previous models. Since I have braces, I need to replace brush heads sooner than most people, so saving money on these brush heads is a plus.    The battery life of this toothbrush is a lot longer than the older toothbrush models, which is a plus if you are traveling or don&#x27;t want the hassle of always having to charge your toothbrush.     I like the many different modes on this toothbrush, and the toothbrush itself is lighter and sleeker than the previous models. This model comes with a UV sanitizer, which seems to work fairly well. Overall, a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping! I had an old sonicare and I realized how clunky it was compared to this. I have gum issues and this is so gentle but thorough. I love the fact that it comes with a sanitizer too. Very cool. And the price is great!      I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not much to say except it&#x27;s brilliant.  My teeth and gums feel noticeably cleaner and healthier than they did with normal brushing. The multiple setting are nice but I only use the normal cleaning setting.  I do wish there was an option to change the type of notification it gives to change brushing quadrants (would prefer something audible) but it&#x27;s perfectly fine.    The charging/sanitizing base is stable and hassle free to use.  I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I have no idea just how well the sanitizer works verses normal rinsing but given how easy it is to use I use it after every brushing.</li>
            <li> The advance features are not that effective to spend about 2 times more of price of a ordinary electric brush...for mine the 30 sec timer did not worked properly.</li>
            <li> The handle suddenly felt less powerful after 8 months of use. A few days later, the handle became worse and simply gave a faint buzzing sound. The brush just sits on the handle without getting any power from the handle.     Bottomline: I paid $170 for this unit and it lasted me 8 months!! Not worth it!! Apparently, many other people have found this problem too. Philips should acknowledge that these handles are defective and do the right thing by recalling. Sure, I called them and they said they would ship me a new handle for free but if this unit had lasted me just 2 months more, the warranty would have expired and there would have been no free replacement!</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for more years than I can remember.  My original Sonicare unit, not made by Philips, finally died.  I replaced it a year ago with the Flexcare Plus.  Like other commentators I have found the construction of this unit to be of very poor quality.  It quit working in less than a year.  I called Philips Customer Service to get it replaced and after holding on the line for an extended time period and extensive questioning, I was told to expect a replacement unit in ten days.  That remains to be seen.  In any case, Philips has taken a very high quality product and, frankly, ruined it.  The new version is no where near the quality of the original Sonicare and that is a shame.  It is highly unlikely I would ever buy a Philips brand Sonicare ever again.  I definitely would not recommend purchasing it.  For the price, it is of extremely poor quality!!  Take my advice and do not buy!  Save yourself the trouble of having to deal with Philips customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 24, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting a little over a month, in late January 2011, Philips sent me a replacement for the unit I described above.  It is now May 2012, roughly 15 months after receiving the replacement, and it has now quit working.  I&#x27;m replacing it with their Easy Clean model, but I expect that it will probably quit working in a year.  I have learned my lesson--not spend a lot of money on Sonicare.  Get the cheapest unit that does the job you want and expect it to fail within a year.  That seems to be Philips&#x27; product life cycle.  I&#x27;m told the Oral-B is not much better in quality, so I&#x27;m stuck with Sonicare until I can find a better product.  If you buy it, be forewarned that it will fail.</li>
            <li> This product lasted 1 year .  I have been a good customer of amazon but not any more.  I paid $122.00 for this product and it lasted 1 year and I am told that I can not return.  Not right.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  This is a very good, precision tool.  I am very happy with the toothbrush.  The UV light bulb burned out two days after I received it.  And it is virtually impossible to replace!  I have looked everywhere online and can&#x27;t find it.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ll use hydrogen peroxide to sanitize my brush heads.  Otherwise, very happy with the brush.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  After going with the $20 cheap-o \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrushes, I finally upgraded to the real thing.  Let me tell you, those $20 brushes are NOT sonic.  This thing took a little while to get used to, but with all the settings on it, I was able to gradually work up to the full \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it cleans, it feels like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist every time I use it.  And my teeth are much whiter while not changing any other dental habits!</li>
            <li> This item was shared by my husband and I, used at most 4 times a day.  It worked GREAT for about 6 weeks.  Then began to make a weird noise and two weeks later stopped working altogether.  I can&#x27;t imagine spending this kind of money on an appliance and have it work for less than 60 days.  In this economy, who can afford to spend $150 on a disposable toothbrush - not me!  I was so hopeful with the great reviews I read about it.  I do hope it was just a dud.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus, Rechargeable Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So I gave Philips another chance because as long as it was working, I really like how well it cleans my teeth.  The second brush didn&#x27;t even last 4 weeks.  It&#x27;s been returned and I&#x27;m moving onto a different brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare Flex Care Plus for over a month now and my mouth feels cleaner than it ever has.  I use the quad pacer feature in the Gum Care mode and it gives me four 30 second intervals followed by four 15 second intervals.  It came with all kinds of stuff so I put away the case and the travel charger.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll bust them out when we go out of town!  I can&#x27;t imagine being without my Sonicare for even one night.  I use the brush sanitizer regularly and it gives me a feeling of confidence that my brush is clean to the point of germ free when I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this one on May 2011. It stopped charging on Jun 2012. Got a free replacement handle by Philips. The new handle also die on Sep 2013.</li>
            <li> So far this has proved to be a better and more advanced product. The biggest negative as is my issue with all Philips toothbrush products is that the replacement brushes are \\&quot;extremely\\&quot; high in price. The cost to make a replacement is most likely less than $.25 in material and $1-1.50 total cost and the cheapest I have found my particular replacement is $9.00 if i purchase three at a time. This is ridiculous and almost criminal.</li>
            <li> This toothcare was considered a higher end electric toothbrush, and came highly recommended. I don&#x27;t know  I just got a lemon  or what. The cleaning compartment  bulb that sanitizes just stopped working in less than a month. Waiting to hear what warranty says, as this was not a cheap investment.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  It is much easier to keep clean than the older sonicare toothbrush.  The UV light stopped working 3 weeks after I started using it.  I called customer service and they are sending me a replacement light.  I definitely recomend the toothbrush, but not sure if there is a problem with the UV light or I just got a lemmon.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  It offers several different settings, and it is much easier to keep clean than older models.  The sonic cleaner is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B many years ago and hardly used it because I never felt like it did as good a job as my manual toothbrush. On a recent visit to the dentist with my 8 year old son, the hygienist recommended he use a Sonicare as he wasn&#x27;t getting the job done. She said we could save money and buy the kids version but we decided to get this model and then the whole family would use it. So glad we did, as the four of us love it, even the little kids. We bought packs of extra brushes and the kids use the little brush heads. After the very first use, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it was really doing. But now after a couple weeks of twice a day use, I can really see and feel the difference it has been making. It really leaves your teeth feeling like something effective has been done, and with such little effort. I&#x27;m really looking forward to going back to the dentist in November and hearing what the hygienest has to say about the state of my teeth. I think that will be a telltale sign of how this thing has done. I drink espresso and eat tomatoes daily, and drink wine often, so I figured this would be a good investment to help keep my teeth in as good of shape as possible. It definitely does take some getting used to, especially learning how to NOT have spit/toothpaste sputter out of your mouth, but it doesn&#x27;t take long. So far, I think this is a very beneficial product.</li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare for 12 years-it finally died. As a quick replacement I got a battery operated Sonicare which also worked well, but I saw this one on line and thought I would really like it because of the choice of settings, especially the gum care. My daughter bought it for me for Mother&#x27;s Day. What a great gift! I love it! It is much lighter weight and easier to handle than the old one I had and seems to have somewhat better brushing action. I do like the gum care setting as well as the \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; setting for a quick brush in between regular brushings. I have not used the sanitizer yet although I think that is a pretty neat feature.I also like the quad pacer feature-my old one had this and the battery operated one does not.I have not had any problems with this toothbrush and can only hope it lasts as long as the old one did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few Sonic electronic toothbrushes years ago.  The last one only lasted 2 months so I&#x27;ve hesitated getting another one.  Since then I&#x27;ve just manually brushed my teeth and my dental hygenist said I really needed to get back to electric.  This is the first one I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon and I&#x27;m really happy with the device.  I have had it about 3 weeks and also needed to take it on a trip and was pleased at how long the charge lasts.  I highly recommend this item.  My teeth feel so clean!!</li>
            <li> This brush comes with two heads; one small to reach back in there and inside the teeth and one wide for front and normal sides. This brush serioulsy outputs some RPMs and vibration. It is so intense that it is very very ticklish at first. Sometimes almost unbearable. With repeated use; one gets used to that uncomfortable feeling. I will continue use this brush and update my review as time progresses. Currently, I am very happy and impressed by the product.</li>
            <li> This cleans your teeth better than a regular tooth brush, but it&#x27;s very expensive.  After one year of using this brush it stopped charging.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this toothbrush.  It seems so expensive for a toothbrush, and I was hesitant to spend so much, but now that I have it I know it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine had a defective UV light unfortunately, but a quick call to Philips, and a replacement is on the way.  It just had a bad bulb in it, but they are sending me a whole new base unit to swap out, free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself works great of course, and my mouth has never felt as clean as it has these past few days since I got it.  You want to buy this brush, for real.  Buy it, buy it now.  You will thank me.  Your mouth with thank you.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling after brushing with this product... however i doubt the reliability of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using electric toothbrush about 4 years ago, first started with Sonicare Crest Intelliclean. After that I&#x27;m hooked to it.......however the brush lasted about 1.5 years. Then I switch Flexcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought the FlexCare toothbrush two times.... each lasted just about a year! I would expect something sold at this price would lasted for at least 3 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all three cases, the item was unable to power on, and no response to the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I still like the product........however i switching to another leading brand.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old toothbrush and new I had to get another sonic.  This one does not dissapoint.  Many differemnt cleaning power/levels.</li>
            <li> Purchased two of these thinking it was a wonderful deal from such a reputable company with a superior brand of sonic toothbrushes.  At first they worked very  good, performed as advertised. However, the first one broke the day after we got it. Called the Customer Service Rep and another one was sent out. Today, the second one broke as well, same problem as the first one: doesn&#x27;t vibrate thus now it&#x27;s an expensive manual toothbrush.  Called the Customer Service Rep, and a replacement will be sent out as well. Hope I won&#x27;t have to do this throughout the duration of the 2 1/2yr. limited warranty. Especially when it&#x27;s too late to get a full refund and my money back.</li>
            <li> I had an Braun that was older than I want to admit.  Decided it was time to treat the teeth to a new experience!  I read and googled as many reviews as I could find and this was the toothbrush that was getting all the rave reviews. I have been using it for several months and I actually look forward to brushing my teeth.  I love clean teeth...you know, that feeling you get after you leave the dentist office from a cleaning and I swear that is almost what I have every time I brush with this.  I read some of the reviews that said it was \\&quot;expensive\\&quot;....REALLY!  You have to be kidding....do you know how much you pay for filling, caps, dentures, etc. and considering these machines last for so long how can you even think this is an expensive piece of equipment...honestly!  Divide the number of uses into what you paid and see what you get, not to mention the beautiful smile and lovely breath that everyone gets to enjoy.... SMILE ON!!!</li>
            <li> Have had this toothbrush for a month and really like it.  Does a very good job of cleaning and freshening.  A bit pricey, but gets under the gum line nicely.</li>
            <li> Sonic Care tooth brush is worth the money I paid for it.  The first few times using it takes some getting use to it.  Your teeth feel like you just came from the dentist and had them cleaned.  They also seem to stay clean longer thru out the day, even after you eat.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine several years ago and have had no quality control issues.  The basic unit works very well for my needs. Five Stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been attempting to replace the UV sanitizer bulb for several months now with no success.  Phillips webpage shows \\&quot;Out of Stock\\&quot;, estimated availability \\&quot;Unknown\\&quot; and has for quite some time.  I called Phillips Customer Service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It&#x27;s out of stock\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;When do you think it&#x27;ll be in stock?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;I don&#x27;t know -- they don&#x27;t tell us that kind of thing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I can&#x27;t find a replacement from another source from the number printed on the bulb.  Can you give me information so I can find a suitable substitute?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I doubt anyone else has them in stock either.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So paying extra for a sanitizer that is useless after the bulb burns out is just wasted money.  Customer \\&quot;Service\\&quot;: One Star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Average: Three Stars</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom for Christmas 2009 and it stopped working almost right away!  I am not quite sure exactly when and my mom is too nice and did not tell me it broke until last year (2013!), so it was definitely too late for Sonicare to rectify the situation.  Regardless, what kind of quality control do they have, or not, when such an expensive item breaks down so soon, or even at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why am I just writing this review now?  My Sonicare just died yesterday!  It is definitely less than 2 years old, not this model exactly, but I was checking my order history to see if I bought it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My very first Sonicare lasted 4 or 5 years and I think I replaced it only because I was excited about the newer models, not because it died...I am not the ranting type at all and this is actually my first Amazon review, ever, despite being a customer for over 10 years.  I am definitely not anti-big business, but I have to echo the general complaints of companies taking advantage of their customers.  They rush to add and over hype so-called &amp;#34;big improvements&amp;#34; to their products to keep prices high while sacrificing true quality.  Between all these sonicare toothbrushes and replacement heads (I even bought my mom a new model this last Christmas), I&#x27;ve stupidly spent hundreds of dollars on extraneous dental care.  First world problems.  I should have just paid out of pocket for extra cleanings at the dentist each year.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase.  My wife and I have have shared this brush but using our own brush heads for a few years now.  Works like a charm, and the battery lasts quite a long time when traveling.  Really encourages you to brush your teeth to the right amount of time and WAY better than a manual brush.  Won&#x27;t go back to manual again.</li>
            <li> We upgraded from an older Sonicare system and really like the increased power and longer battery life of this model.&lt;br /&gt;This model was recommended and sold by our dentist but Amazon was less expensive. We received it two days after we ordered.</li>
            <li> I bought this after it was recommended by my sister.  I felt a little guilty about spending $$$ on a toothbrush, but I figured it would be a good investment.  I also decided to buy extra brushes so that my fiancee and I could share (after all, there are colored bands to distinguish them and two slots in the cleaning area).  I expected to like it, but...  my fiancee likes it too!  He really didn&#x27;t even want to try it, but I insisted that he give it a week.  Last week, he went on a trip (I didn&#x27;t let him take it) and he said when he got back that he prefers the electric one over the manual brush (I was shocked).  He said it cleans better (I agree, but I never though he would give in).    Anyway, worth the investment (cheaper than cavities!).</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I use it almost solely.  I don&#x27;t keep the dock in my bathroom, as it&#x27;s quite large.  There is a smaller &#x27;travel&#x27; dock that you can keep if you have a tight space.  However, this isn&#x27;t an issue and can go for about a week before needing charges (if used 2-3 times a day).  It has oscillating and back-and-forth movement to work well at disturbing biofilm in the mouth.  Not a substitute for flossing, but it&#x27;s nice that it has the 2-minute timer so that you have a set time for brushing.  If anything, I used to brush too long as part of my oral hygiene routine, especially at night, so this does a thorough job in a set amount of time, and I&#x27;m done.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this toothbrush to me so I ordered one for myself as a Mother&#x27;s day present.  There is no comparison to manual brushing.  The Sonicare simply does a much better job!  I have been using it for about a month, and I just had a dentist vist, it went very well.  My dentist could tell the difference already since I did have a bit of a problem with tartar build up.  She also commented that I had a \\&quot;very clean mouth.\\&quot;  I love the timing devise on this.  It lets me know every 30 seconds to move to another group of teeth.  The price on Amazon was the best I could find.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I purchase this toothbrush in order to take better care of my all around dental health. The brushes he offered at his office were discounted, but they didn&#x27;t compare to the Amazon price! It was delivered to my house in a flash, and I now can brush my teeth and leave them feeling like I just left the dentist. I especially am pleased with teh UV sanitizer. It keeps my brushes clean, and it is also a handy docking station. The travel kit and docking station are wonderful too. They are easy to tote, and don&#x27;t take up much space. Plus I know I can always use my good toothbrush instead of one of those $2 ones that don&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> For the price of this unit, we fully expected it to last more than 3 years.  The base unit no longer charges. Very disappointing.  Our next electric toothbrush will not be a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> got this brush about a month ago and wow what a diffrence its made my teeth are more white then ever, my gums feel great my whole mouth just feels healthy dentist was very impressed and is now advertising this brush with pamplets def would say get this brush once you see how good your teeth feel, after just one use you will never want to go back to a reguler brush, again.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after my dentist recommended me to use an electric toothbrush. My dentist said that using an electric toothbrush is better for the teeth and gums. The quality and the performance of this toothbrush is great. It makes my teeth bright and smooth. The price is a little high, but it is well worth it. The UV sanitize plus. It gives me the confidence of cleanliness. I hard many good things about sonic care products. After using it, I totally agree on what I hear about this product.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get used to the VERY strong sonic power of this brush (even though I came from a basic electronic brush) It even allows you to brush a few times and it slowly gets stronger to allow you to adjust. But now I can&#x27;t imagine brushing with anythign else! I LOVE the way my teeth feel afterwards. Out of the dentist clean smooth. Hoping that it lasts a long time. Also, the battery stays charged for a really long time. Great to know if I want to go on a vacation and not want ot take a charger (although it does come with a small travel case and small portable charger)</li>
            <li> My wife uses this for a while now, but I never was motivated enough to get one for myself.  After a couple of expensive trips to the dentist for cleaning, I decided to buy it.  I should have done this long back.  I am using this for over a month now.  It is really nice and my teeth feels like I just had the cleaning done yesterday.  I am happy with the purchase and would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with this toothbrush.  I have had a Braun for over 5 years without complaints but needed a second one for traveling. After looking into a lot of reviews and recommendations, I decided on this one. Simple to use, more options than probably necessary, it is a toothbrush not a car. Comes with two heads, charges quickly and comes with a UV cleaner.  Philips did a great job on the FlexCare Plus and added a hard plastic travel case that holds the base unit and two brush heads. They also include a travel charger, which is nice, but you would only need this for an extended trip away from home with the increased battery life. My last trip was three weeks, brushing twice a day for the entire time and I still had a charge left. Totally amazing battery life. The price may seem high for some, but this will last for a long time and is essential if you want to protect your teeth. This is a GREAT investment in your dental hygiene; dentist bills are a lot more expensive. Can&#x27;t make a better recommendation.</li>
            <li> very good, reviewes previously helped understand how it worked and works wonders. definately better than brushing with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> This sonicare is just what the doctor ordered.  It helps my gums and cleans my teeth just as well as going to the dentist.  My beef is the manner it is shipped.  One must actually sign for the package so if one is not home the package ends up at the post office.  That involves a trip to the PO, stand in line, present your ID and finally get it and go back home.  One hour wasted when it could have simply been shipped with a delivery confirmation.  I will look closely as to whom and from where my future purchases are made.  If not for the lousy shipping method the brush gets 5 stars</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested this toothbrush. After using it for the first time, my teeth felt just as clean and smooth as when I leave for a cleaning. I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my teeth feel. The best part is that there is a compartment that sterilizes the brush.  I leave it in there to keep all the germs and unwanted bathroom bacteria away from my brush! One of the best purchases I have made!</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush. It is my first electric toothbrush and it&#x27;s great. The travel case is so cute. My teeth feel extra clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> Was a great toothbrush until it died within a year! It did clean my teeth great and I would never go back to a regular toothbrush, but I went with oral-b for my second electric toothbrush, to see if this one dies within a year. Only time will tell :)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fabulous!  My first electric toothbrush and I did a lot of research before purchasing this particular model.  It comes with a regular-sized brush head and also a small brush head; I purchased additional brush heads, as I did not care for the smaller one and both my husband and I are using this model.  It is easy to use and has several other (four more, I think) settings for additional mouth care...especially like the refresher one which gives you a quick one-minute go-over.  My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist!!  Such a good feeling!!  I love the sanitizer that cleans your brush heads when you are done using them for the day.  You simply pop them onto the pegs, making sure that the brush head is facing the center, close the door and push the green button...the ultra-blue light lets you know that the cleaning has begun and it takes all of ten minutes!  So simple and nice to know that your brush is clean for the next day.  It also is equipped with a 30-second tone to let you know when to move on with the cleaning from one area of your mouth to another.  The booklet gives you an example of how to clean your teeth using different quadrants, but however you decide to do it, the whole idea is to use 4 30-second quadrants to clean your entire mouth in a 2 minute period.  The brush head and holder are easy to clean and the item seems to hold a charge for quite some time before recharging.  A recharging unit is also included with the total package...toothbrush holder w/sanitizer built in, two brush heads and a charger.  Takes up very little space at all.  The reason for the four stars instead of five is a small matter but I feel it would be nice if Phillips could correct this somehow - the tone that is used for reminding that the 30 seconds are up is quite soft and gentle...I have no problem hearing it but for someone who has hearing that is not quite that keen anymore, it is truly difficult to hear the beep.  It would be nice if it were a bit louder is all that I&#x27;m saying.  I&#x27;m find that the brush head is wearing fast, also, but it still seems to be doing a good job.  It&#x27;s easy to buy replacement heads at Amazon or Walmart for this particular model.  My husband and I are very pleased with the results that this model provides and it&#x27;s very easy to take care of.  Would definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I think that is good, but I find there are some stuff I do not have when I look the instruction. Maybe the it dose not for this product. Anyway, it is good</li>
            <li> This product might work well at the beginning but the handle unit has a problem that the company will not stand behind nor fix.... I had one unit go out in 13 months, they did replace it but when the replacement unit went out in 18 months then they said it was out of warranty and could not replace it... For the price of these units they should last longer that 18 months...</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner does not work. However the toothbrush is amazing, definitely worth the money.  Makes your mouth feel so clean I actually find it fun to brush my teeth using this.</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes the best electric toothbrush.  We own several.  The have improved our dental checkups 100%.  Will not use another brand or go back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I have been to the dentist for a cleaning! My gums feel so refreshed! I brush the full 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. My dentist had recommended this brand to my brother, so I got one too. I really like it, and 14 months later, I have no complaints. I can actually clean my back teeth without activating my gag reflex, because the head is smaller (than my old regular brush) and I don&#x27;t have to saw back and forth, as the electric brush does the scrubbing for me.    The \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; cycle is the only one I use, twice at a time, because it just seems too short. That&#x27;s probably because I was apparently brutalizing my teeth and gums with my old manual.    Nice clean molars and no more bloody gums. I&#x27;m a fan.    Update: In 11/2013, I purchased a new handle (here on Amazon- yay!) because the original broke somewhere between the head and the... actuator? It ran, but the vibration was almost undetectable. Anyhoo, I was probably being unnecessarily hard on the thing, having a \\&quot;brutal\\&quot; history with toothbrushes. The base still works fine, and I&#x27;m still a fan.</li>
            <li> i purchase this sonicare to improve my gums and teeth..per my dentist my gums,plaque and everything are so much improved  they could not believe it!!i would recommend this to anyone...[[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10, Rechargeable Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great 30 sec warning is awesome !! Ordering new heads will be a good idea !! I don&#x27;t know how it disinfects the toothbrush but it looks cool. My dentist recommends it and also get the waterpik.</li>
            <li> I had not owned a nice electronic dental care brush in the past but this is an amazing first experience.  I have used the brush for one week and am very impressed.  My teeth felt amazing after the first brushing.  One of the biggest benefits to me: the tone that lets me know when to sway to another surface!  I know how that sounds but not only is it a great cleaning experience but it made me more aware of the time I spend brushing the backs of my teeth.  The multiple settings are helpful also.  I had been brushing too hard and pushing my gum line away from my teeth when my dentist recommended looking at rechargeable options to slow the damage I was doing.  There may be other products that are better but it would be hard to imagine.  I appreciate the concept of UV exposure to the brush head for cleaning.  Almost every part is replaceable and it is extremely easy to clean.  I am a proud owner and would definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this from an Essence after it finally stopped holding a decent charge.  What a huge improvement.    The smaller profile is much easier to handle and the improvements in the brush head design are amazing.  I no longer have to fight all of the build up under the brush head that was a problem with the Essence.    The price is not an easy thing to get over, but it is truly the best tooth brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush needs design improvements. While you&#x27;re brushing your teeth it is way too easy to accidentally touch the on-off switch or the settings and either turn off the brush or move into a different level of cleaning. I also don&#x27;t like the extreme vibrations of the sonic-care system.  I&#x27;ve used the oral b system for years and believe it is a far superior system. Sorry I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I had it for 8 month. After 4 month, the charge with the UV light sanitizer didn&#x27;t work. The set contained a travel charge so I used that for a few more month. Then the battery was totally down. It wouldn&#x27;t be charged or work at all.  For something I spent 150 buck, I hope it works for longer than that!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my Sonicare Toothbrush and like the added feature of being able to sterilize my brush.  This is my second purchase of this brush as my dentist recommended I get one because I have gingivitis gum disease and it helps keep it under control.  In my opinion it is worth the money to spend on oneself to also help keep your body healthy.  I recommend this product highly.  The only negative comment is that my first brush only lasted 2 yrs.  I&#x27;m hoping they improved the longevity of this brush with this newer model.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is good and does it job very well. But the quality of the battery is really bad.&lt;br /&gt;The first time, it broken because it cannot be recharged. At that time, it was still in warranty. i called philips service and got a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it broken again... it cannot be recharged and sometimes started by itself. It&#x27;s out of warranty, i have to think about to buy a new one. For this price and short lifetime, it only worth 1 star.</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric toothbrush more than a year ago. It definitely cleans my teeth better than a manual toothbrush. For a couple of years before purchasing this toothbrush, I had an older generation Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush (I don&#x27;t recall the specific model, but it was an E-series). I was disgusted when I found mold growing on the inside of the handle; despite cleaning, the mold kept coming back. Phillips obviously realized the problem, because the newer models, like this one, do not have the open space in the handle that enables mold to grow.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I like:&lt;br /&gt;My dental checkups have gone much better since I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush. In fact, I can see a clear difference in the tarter buildup (or lack of) while using this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth also feel much cleaner even using less toothpaste than I normally would.&lt;br /&gt;I like the UV sanitizer. It&#x27;s easy to use and it makes me feel better about the cleanliness of my toothbrush. Toothpaste is not anti-bacterial, so who knows what grows on a toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;I love the options on the toothbrush and for different types of cleanings. The quadrant timer is also very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;After a year of use, it now takes almost 48 hours to get the toothbrush fully charged. The charge lasts a long time and I only charge once a week, but it the charging time has lengthened since I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed mold growing on the bottom of the toothbrush, but it wiped off easily.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would definitely buy again and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Had used the Sonicare ProResults for years and were pleased with it. When it wore out, replaced it with two Philips E Series and are very disappointed. The brush head screws onto the brush base, and allows water and tooth paste to gather in the space. It is necessary to remove the head and dry the space every time the brush is used. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in April,2013 and registered the warranty through on line. It worked fine until early November 2013. I called  the Sonicare customer Service on 11/18/13 to report that both the tooth brush and the charger base unit with UV sanitizezer are malfunctioning that needs to replaced.  The representaative told me that a full set replacement unit would be delivered  to me within 7-10 day By Fedex. I called Customer Service again on 12/5/13 for never a ship delivered and the representative told me that a shipment was delivered by Fedex on 11/22/13.  Therefore they could not schedule another replacement but only make an Presidential Escalation for onward process.  She said someone from the Presidential Escalation Dept. would call me on the following week for further INVESTIGATION and properly would send me another set. After one full week, no one call me back so I call them again on 12/12/13 for enquiry and another Rep told me that she needed to escalate again and I need to wait for another call on the following week. I felt upset and asked to speak with a supervior  who finally promised to send me replacement by the folowing week but I need to call back on 12/16/13 (Monday) for a Fedex tracking number. I called as instructed on Monday but they said could not located my record then I asked for supervisor again then talked with Kay who found that my name was wrongly spelt as Tolson instead of Thompson and she was not able to find the Fedex tracking number because system down. But she promised to call me back next day with the tracking number. I got her call back at 8:34am with the tracking information and I got the replacement at 3pm same day but what I found in the box is Only the brushhandle without the charge base unit with UV Sanitizer. So I call them again for the charger unit and the Rep told me that Warranty Policy only covers brush but not the base charger which I should call retailer namely Amazon.com for replacement then hung up on me. I thinkthis is the most worse Customer Service I ever experienced. Besides I would like to say the product is not durable at all even I use cautiously everyday. I will not buy Philips product anymore.</li>
            <li> excellent cleaning. confort of use and handle a bit akward. the stand and brush cleaner good but could be more fitting for the bathroom enviroment. alround a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I was apprehensive about buying it because of the cost, but now that I&#x27;ve used it I don&#x27;t regret my purchase. My teeth have never felt so clean. I like the different cleaning cycles with the quadrant timer.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product!</li>
            <li> My dentist got me started on the Philips Sonicare a number of years ago and the one I had needed replacement.  I didn&#x27;t know which one to purchase, so I went for the best.  Although it&#x27;s pricey, it&#x27;s well worth it!  Every time I brush my teeth, it feels like I&#x27;ve just had a cleaning from the dentist.  There are 5 different settings which work just fine.  I am one hundred and ten percent satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had an old Sonicare Elite that died, and I decided to go up a couple models for this one.  On the first use, I was horrified I hadn&#x27;t updated sooner.  This thing is the best brushing experience I&#x27;ve had.  If you are considering the base model, just don&#x27;t bother.  Get the Flexcare!!!</li>
            <li> This is our third Sonicare--our 2nd one was still alive when we sent it to the farm because it wouldn&#x27;t hold the charge on long trips. And it had served us well for 12 years. We were somewhat surprised to find this new FlexCare so great! I love that there is a sensitive stage for my teeth, and it&#x27;s no big deal for my husband or me to change it back to regular clean or vice-versa. I notice that food never gets stuck in the brush--it&#x27;s magic. And our teeth always feel so clean. I was happy to get a travel charger with this model as well. One problem we both have--the on/off button is in a place where we frequently hit it by accident which is annoying. Having said that, it wouldn&#x27;t stop me from buying it in the future (12 years from now-Ha!) But it would be nice if the company saw this complaint--I&#x27;m sure there are others, and fixed it! I guess I should write them, too.</li>
            <li> your mouth is the source of bacteria, not the toothbrush head. These bacteria are what make human bites so infection prone. just dry off the bristles on a towel, nothing more is needed.</li>
            <li> It has been the perfect replacement for our old Sonicare! My teeth feel so much cleaner! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> We have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for about 9 years.  My wife&#x27;s finally died and we replaced it with unit.  She is happy with it and likes the UV sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has been about 8 months since we purchased this toothbrush.  It is used at least once a day and is still going strong.  No problems.</li>
            <li> I had this for 3 years.  It works great until it stopped working.  One day the vibration got so weak it&#x27;s useless.  Contacted Philips and because it&#x27;s beyond the 2 year warranty, they&#x27;re not willing to do anything.  $50 a year for a toothbrush is ridiculous if you ask me.  I&#x27;m going back to my good old manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have had a previous model of Sonicare for well over 5 years and absolutely loved it, so I was pretty excited to upgrade to the Flexcare+. The Flexcare+, however, suffers from manufacturing defects that seems to give each toothbrush an effective shelf life of at most 4-5 months. I am now awaiting my 3rd replacement toothbrush after the previous two would no longer charge (using either the standard charger or the travel charger), and I expect this to by my last as it will die shortly after my warranty is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that the Flexcare+ has a serious design defect that leads to this early failure. It&#x27;s a great toothbrush for the duration of the few months that it is operational, but a 4-5 month replacement cycle is pretty unacceptable.</li>
            <li> We like this sonic brush. It&#x27;s cool with the two brushes so my husband and I can both use it. I really like that it hesitates so you know when when to brush to the next section and you get two minutes of brushing in!</li>
            <li> Much cleaner than previous Soniccare models and entire motor and unit feels much stronger and robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gap between the head and the body allows for ease of cleaning. Previous models would fill up with disgusting junk, while this one stays clean longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The extra modes on this toothbrush are gimmicky and not very useful to me (gum massage? Really?) but overall it&#x27;s a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Dont question the purchase, its like I got my braces off. I can&#x27;t believe i&#x27;ve been brushing with some oral b hand brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased model HX6972/10 about six weeks ago. I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for more than fifteen years and have had pretty good dental checkups during that time.  I contribute a lot of this to Sonicare.  They have been well made.  The battery life is very good. My last one still works but I replaced it because after about three years, the charge no longer lasts very long.  I like this model because of the brush head sanitizing feature.  When it is time to replace this one, I expect history will repeat itself and I&#x27;ll buy another Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product. Great design and features and fantastic results. Every time I brush I am left with the feeling of just leaving the dentist. My teeth as sparkling white and started looking better after just a few uses. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new brush. I know I spent hours trying to filter through all the different brands. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brush.  It stopped working 2 years and 8-9 months after I purchased it. Surprise surprise - the warranty is only for 2 years!  We were extremely careful with this brush (it&#x27;s almost $200 after all!), but it still broke.  When I contacted Sonicare, they explained that there is a known issue where the brush stops vibrating after a while.  They explained that there was no way to repair the brush, and they wouldn&#x27;t replace it since the warranty was only for two years.  I missed the warranty by about 9 months. They then offered me a pathetic 15% off coupon (only works with their store) and were frankly rather rude.  Think about it - the average cost of a toothbrush is $1-2.  That means if you change your brush every 3 months as recommended by dentists, you&#x27;re spending between $4-8 a year.  Since this toothbrush only lasted about 33 months for us, we spent nearly $200 in that period (including brush heads - they&#x27;re not cheap).  Had we used traditional toothbrushes, we would have spent between $11-22 during that period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do the math and think about it - for a toothbrush that WILL break, it&#x27;s just not worth it.  Let me also mention that even though I cleaned the brush religiously, the bottom of it became coated with mold.  It&#x27;s just gross after a while.  I would NOT purchase this brush again.  Also, feel free to do a web search - lots of people have this problem.  This is just not worth it for a brush that will break.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush in terms of what it does to my teeth, but I&#x27;ve had problems with charging: I&#x27;ll start getting a series of \\&quot;beeps,\\&quot; and then the unit stops working, or works erratically. Purchased originally in August 2012, had the first problem in April 2013 (got a replacement handle from Sonicare), and now having the same problem again. I&#x27;m guessing Sonicare will replace it again (either the handle or the charger, or both), but it&#x27;s still a hassle having the product only go 7-8 months without a problem. Possibly a charger issue (they only replaced handle last time), but even then, the charger is still less than 2 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11-19-13: Sonicare sending a replacement handle and a return label for the old handle. Customer service has been great, but this will be my third handle in less than 2 years. Checked the old handle on both chargers (wall and travel) and got the same results: Two beeps, pause, third beep, with charging light on handle going from green to orange and toothbrush starting and stopping erratically, so problem seems to be the handle.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these and love them. I still like my old rotary Oral-B, but these are much quicker and self-sanitizing with a great travel case.</li>
            <li> No need to go to the dentist with this product. In fact everytime I go in for my appointment to the dentist, he says &amp;#34;keep on using the Philips Sonicare, you&#x27;re doing a great job. It&#x27;s the best money spent. My teeth feel a million dollars all day every day!</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare electric toothbrush for over 18 years. I love it. My dentist recommends and displays both the Sonicare and the Oral B.  I bought an Oral B a few months ago, strictly for my travel and rarely use it, but it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I went into CVS to buy replacement heads for the Sonicare.  Do NOT buy the CVS brand replacement heads.  They are horrible.  Anyway, for $35 - $36 I used to be able to get 2 replacement heads.  Now for $36 I only got 1 replacement head.  I asked the clerk about it and she said, \\&quot;Oh yeh.  The price has really gone up.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a brand new Oral B only costs $35 so I bought that instead.  I prefer the Sonicare slightly more but I can&#x27;t justify paying the difference in price.  I&#x27;ll buy a brand new Oral B ever 3 months, have a nice clean handle, rather than buy a head for Sonicare only to put it on top of my nasty ole Sonicare handle.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  Maybe they are testing the market but for me, until the price drops, I&#x27;m out of there.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son.  He smokes and drinks drinks that discolor his teeth.  He is very pleased with the way his teeth look after using this toothbrush.  He has been able to get his teeth to a respectable whitened level even though he still smokes and drinks the drinks that discolor his teeth.  He has had this toothbrush for almost two years at the writing of this review and it is still working great.  He travels frequently for work and the sanitizer and travel accessories are very helpful.  He sometimes has to share a hotel room with another male employee which is why I got the model with the sanitizer.  He likes this toothbrush very much.</li>
            <li> After only 16 months the brush quit brushing.  I was disappointed that my previous Sonicare brush lasted only three years, but $220 for an electronic tooth brush that lasts barely longer than one year is ridiculous.  As a toothcleaning device, it works great.</li>
            <li> The beauty is, even if it fails you can return to the manufacturer for a replacements.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years now with no issues what so ever.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush will no longer charge and has started turning on by itself. Of course it is no longer under warranty as well. I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush at the recommendation of my dentist.  My teeth look great and my checkups are better than ever so I guess this is working the magic.</li>
            <li> I like the actual tooth brush and wand, but the unit was very difficult to clean. After a year the wand just made a whirring noise with no actual vibration. I bought a smaller charger without the brush cleaning thing, it&#x27;s much simpler and easier. The charger and wand still work after 6 months.</li>
            <li> after buying my first electric toothbrush, I regret all the years passed without having it, I don&#x27;t think with a regular tooth brush I was doing any good for my teeth except gum recession which is horrible, high quality if you can afford get it it will save you even cleaning your teeth at the dentist</li>
            <li> We loved these while they worked, but both my husband&#x27;s and mine died after a year and half! All my other electric toothbrushes have lived for years and years.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush stopped working a little after the 2 year warranty period so I am out a little over $150 on this terrible toothbrush.  Very disappointed - don&#x27;t buy this model.</li>
            <li> This is a sophisticated mouth care system! The handle has a display that lights up when you touch it. So that you can choose from five different settings from massage to clean! You can choose different brush head stiffnesses and even share the handle by using the color coded bands on the brushes.</li>
            <li> Purchased it back in 2011 from Amazon. After a few months of use, I started experiencing problems with charging the unit through the main charger, so I switched to the travel charger, which worked better. After about 1.5 years of use it would not work anymore. Started acting up gradually by not holding the charge and skipping when pressure is applied. Finally, died completely. It did its job nicely while it was working, but you&#x27;d think that a $200 unit would last a bit longer than 1.5 years. The warranty is only for one year. Very well calculated.</li>
            <li> I bought a Philips Sonicare FlexCare PlusToothbrush for my wife, loved it so much I had to buy me one too.  It keep its charge for several weeks at a time.  Easy to use.  Cleans teeth so well that I never want to go back to my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush Ive purchased yet.  Easy to clean.  It has a very tolerant rechargeable battery that will forgive you for neglecting or compulsively overcharging it.</li>
            <li> Forget all the nit picking about models, in design alone, this is by far the best &amp;#34;SYSTEM&amp;#34; you can get simply because it&#x27;s super easy to clean, and the head protector / UV sanitizer keeps the part you stick in your mouth clean, and germ free.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*(have a cold? the UV light keeps you from re giving it back to yourself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever question why you&#x27;d want to keep the bristles covered in the bathroom, take a look at the Myth Busters segment on how clean (or dirty) the is bathroom.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Everything that floats in the air eventually lands on uncovered bristles, including what goes in the toilet and gets aerosolized when you flush...  (YUCK!)</li>
            <li> Wow, once you get used to this thing it keeps your teeth polished-clean!  ...After initially bypassing the &amp;#34;acclimation period&amp;#34; I ended up re-enabling it, as the vibration did take a little getting used to...  However, it quickly became negligible, and I now never notice anything but how clean it keeps my teeth.  ...And thumbs-up from my oral hygienist!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own a sonic care you are missing out on one of the greatest inventions of whenever it was invented.  If you want to have that dentist clean feeling get this, if you hate that feeling keep brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years and it works really really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I moved from the USA to the UK, the brush actually broke somehow, but as it was (at the time) still under warranty I contacted Philips, expecting them to say something like &amp;#34;USA is USA, UK is UK, buy a new brush&amp;#34;. But happily they did not - they replaced the malfunctioning brush (the charger/UV light thing was fine) for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this, my teeth are clean and you *can* feel a difference if all you&#x27;re used previously is a manual brush. Your teeth just... feel cleaner, I cannot express it any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year I&#x27;d say, and it&#x27;s already falling apart. A couple months in I could feel the tip where the brush attaches becoming loose. The inside began making an awful rattle, and it&#x27;s getting to the point that I feel like using it off instead of on. Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> This is a quality toothbrush.  It arrives with more than one brush, which allows my husband and I to both use the toothbrush.  It also includes a sanitizer feature, which I really like.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now - and using Sonicare for even longer.  It works so well.  It&#x27;s easy.  It&#x27;s sleek.  And it makes the dentist happy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the sanitizer thing so much.  The toothbrush stays clean enough, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just use the normal &#x27;clean&#x27; function - but it&#x27;s nice that it has the other options too.</li>
            <li> I had this product for two years and it worked reasonably well.  Then, it simply stopped.  Yellow charge light flashes and the brush is now a deadweight.  While some may feel that after two years, products stop -- this was an expensive toothbrush and average cost was $80 year based upon two year run-rate.  That is a lot of toothbrushes that could have been bought.  Something like this should have a far longer warranty.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the recommendation of a friend and I regret it.  I have sensitive teeth and gums and this was way too rough for me.  I tried various heads, using various speeds, etc. and it was downright painful for me.  I ended up giving the toothbrush away rather than continue to torture myself on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush about 3 years and it just died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well they just don&#x27;t make the new Sonicare as well as the original. I actually still have my original Sonicare and that toothbrush dates back to 1999 (still works). The Philips Sonicare HX6972 has all the bells and whistles a UV light to kill bacteria between brushings,different modes (really don&#x27;t do anything), and a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to clean the base of this toothbrush. If you put the brush on the base even a little wet you get scum that builds up.</li>
            <li> Improved total oral health.  Multiple settings. Long lasting battery life. Convenient travel case. Ultra violet light is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with sensitive teeth and softening of the enamel on my teeth due to dry mouth.  Since I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare I have stoppen having cavities and with a flouride toothpaste the enamel on my teeth is harder and my gums are much better.  The toothbrush is a lot cheaper than even one filling at the dentist!  I love brushing my teeth now!  It was recommended to me by my daughter, she loves hers&#x27; too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SLA</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for awhile now.  It is my third Sonicare.  I would not buy another brand.  These brushes are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for decades but this one is different. It felt as if my brain would be scrambled at first. Seriously, this is one powerful unit. I recommend using the smaller brush on the sensitive setting to get used to it. I love the sanitizer unit. You just pop the brush head off the unit, rinse and dry and put it inside the sanitizer, press on, and voila...clean and ready for the next round. The travel case is perfect and very useful.&lt;br /&gt;While definitely overpriced, your teeth are worth every penny invested in their maintenance and care. The price is the reason I gave the unit only 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful sonicare user for almost 15 years. All their products are stellar but the flexcare plus outdoes anything they have produced before or since. It is light, easy to handle, with a tip that fits in any mouth without a problem. This thing cleans teeth, prevents gingivitis and does everything but wash your dishes. I have troubled gums that get inflamed, red and painful if neglected even for one day. This toothbrush, used every twelve hours, keeps all gum problems at bay. It even helps rebuild receding gums, if you spend more time consistently on the troubled areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: they have these new sensitive tips which consist of soft bristles that work perfectly for vulnerable gums that bleed easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the uv cleaning chamber is the perfect companion that keeps the tip from growing bacteria. However, it needs a water drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t any negatives to the toothbrush itself except that it is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My setup: sonicare flexcare plus on gum setting, with Colgate sensitive smart foam and listerine 6 in 1. For gum disease this is all you need.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product again. Sometimes I have to brush my teeth twice because it did not clean very well.</li>
            <li> My son had been telling me about the Sonic toothbrush for years and I finally bought one. I have a history of terrible problems with my teeth and this has helped tremendously. Well worth the money. A great item to have.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is made real well and is easy to figure ,it does a good job cleaning your teeth and has multiple switches to clean you teeth in different way,well worth the money ,I give it good point for being versitle and easy to use for anyboby that wants a good electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush but It barely lasted me over a year. The problem was I kept pulling off the top piece and putting it away in it&#x27;s case every night and the constant wear and tear of that broke the piece that vibrates to clean your teeth. I&#x27;m sure it would have lasted me longer if I just kept the same toothbrush head on until I had to replace it. It&#x27;s billed as a toothbrush that you can share by having different interchangeable toothbrush attachments, but I don&#x27;t recommend that as it will drastically shorten the use you will get out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get your teeth super clean though, went to the dentist after a year instead of six months while using this guy.... No plaque</li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted. The UV Brush Head Sanitizer stopped working after probably a year, and the toothbrush stopped working at 2 years and 4 months (warranty is 2 years). The toothbrush is good enough that I&#x27;ll be buying another Sonicare, just not this model since it&#x27;s older and I had one bust on me. Regarding the different modes, and whether or not this is better than the base model, I honestly only ever used the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting, and I don&#x27;t think many other users would stray too far from that setting either.</li>
            <li> I only got my FlexCare+ for about a week but i like it very much. It feels so clean after each brushing. There are 5 brushing modes but i use &#x27;gum care&#x27; most of the times which is 3 mins in total. I&#x27;ve never owned any power toothbrush. One of the reasons i picked this one is its charger. It works between 100 - 240V. It is a good feature if u travel a lot. It comes with two brush heads which is pretty nice. U get a chance to try both and decide which fits you best. The standard one is probably about my manual toothbrush size. It fits but it doesn&#x27;t manuver as good as the compact one. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> It Did.  The Sonicare Flexcare Plus is a step better than the Healthy White Sonicare I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found that the Amazon Vine program was offering the newest Sonicare toothbrush, I grabbed one, and it is a great find.  Here&#x27;s what I think about the newest version of Sonicare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The FlexCare Plus appears to be gentler than the previous model, but my teeth still get that dentist-clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The brush&#x27;s \\&quot;engine\\&quot; slows after two minutes for a single minute of gum massage that feels great. Philips says that water is pulsed during cleaning to provide better cleaning between teeth, and that may account for the clean feeling after gum massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  There are brief pauses, as with previous versions, to alert you when you&#x27;ve cleaned a quadrant and need to move to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The UV brush sterilizer is built into the brush&#x27;s base rather than being an independent unit.  Thus, I no longer have two units that need plugging in, but only a single.  I now do not have to remove a plug to be able to plug in a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  The battery may last longer than previous models.  Certainly you get more brushes from a single charge, so you can take the brush traveling without worrying about having to recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, this is nit-picking, but I miss the tabs that allowed me to open the base to roll the cord for storage.  I had to roll the cord by pushing it into the storage area . . . a bit more difficult than on the model that opened up completely but certainly not worth subtracting a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my fourth Philips sonicare, and, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s the best yet.  I highly recommend the FlexCare Plus.</li>
            <li> I have owned a  Sonicare  toothbrush (for about two years and found very easy to use, absolutely reliable, and very thorough in its brushing (i.e., my dentist compliments me on my teeth and gums).  This model is an update to an earlier model and in most cases, changes  are minor - a good product is made somewhat better.  The features I like are still there, namely it signals you every 30 seconds when it is time to move to another part of your mouth and the model also includes a separate base you can use while traveling.  Like its predecessor, the toothbrush seems to hold a charge well, though I think you would have to  go a couple of weeks using the brush two-three times a day to wear it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one completely new feature  here is the UV Sanitizer, which is easy to use (basically put brush inside, close a door, and hit a button).  I have no idea how well this actually works to sanitize a brush and whether it really is necessary to protect yourself from putting germs back into your mouth that you may have put onto your own brush a few hours before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a good product that does what it is designed to -- i.e., thoroughly clean teeth and massage gums in the process.  It is well worth having, though I wouldn&#x27;t mind having the option of buying the unit without the sanitizer so as to make the unit smaller.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  My teeth feel so clean.  It is almost as good as going to the dentist.  I love the sanitizer unit.  The toothbrushes are kept clean and free of bacteria and viruses.  I like the way it beeps to let me know I should move to the next quarter of my mouth.  This cleans so well it seems to do most of the work of flossing; it even cleans between teeth.  I like the hard case that comes with the unit too.  You use that when you want to travel and take the toothbrush with you.  Another plus is the battery life; it is supposed to last twice as long as the previous model.    This is a great unit for anyone who wants clean teeth, or anyone who wants to keep their teeth.  When I was younger I neglected my teeth and ended up needing a root canal, costing over $1000.  Hopefully with this toothbrush you will avoid that.  The price of this toothbrush is small compared to what you&#x27;d pay in dental bills later.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I can not really explain how clean your teeth will feel and the gum massage setting is great for your overall gum health.Im so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> The best version Sonicare as put on the market with a travel hard case.  Thorough cleaning plus the brush heads are able to be sanitized.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush. Make you feel like u just left the dentist</li>
            <li> My husband and I ordered this about a month ago and we love it! The only thing I was annoyed about, was the smaller brush it comes with. I had to buy another large one for myself and then just leave the small one in a drawer somewhere to never be used. :(</li>
            <li> I liked this, but it broke.  For the price it should have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, it makes my mouth feel very clean. I will never go back to using a regular brush.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Sonic Care toothbrush over the past 13 years.  This is best yet.  I left my Elite Series charger in a hotel room and figured I&#x27;d upgrade to the Flex Care Plus. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> What can I say? The parts all feel like a high-quality product- everything is solid, parts fit together well, and the materials are sturdy.    The little cleaner booth may or may not be useful, I don&#x27;t know- I&#x27;ve never had much of a problem with microorganisms on my toothbrush in the past.    Ultimately what matters though is the job the brush does, and let me say it is fantastic! I thought I had found a winner with my previous Oral-B brush; I got lazy and mostly stopped brushing for 5 months, and started again in the last month with that brush. I went in to get a dentist checkup, and my teeth were reasonably O.K. which I figured was pretty good catch-up after so much slacking.    But now... this brush blows the old one away. My teeth are so clean it feels almost like I just walked out of the dentist after I finish brushing (except a little slimier). It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> After going thru 2 toothbrushes in 2 years, I decided not to invest in Sonicare anymore.  It is too expensive to last only a year!  They should figure out their product better.  My sister had the same problem: the toothbrush started acting out and she finally had to get rid of it as it became useless.  I was looking for an older version, however, was not able to find it, as such--I am going with Braun.  Hopefully, it won&#x27;t dissapoint me.</li>
            <li> I had a plan to buy a new ipod this summer but instead i got braces. Before and increasingly after i got braces i kept getting talks about the benefits of an electric toothbrush compared to a manual and out of those electric toothbrushes the name Sonicare kept coming up. This toothbrush is very expensive so i read as many reviews as possible before spending any money. Some reviews were by new comers to the electric toothbrush world and others who weren&#x27;t. Most ,if not all, reviews were pretty good so i bought it. Ive had the toothbrush for about two weeks now and am very pleased with my state of the art oral hygiene product. My teeth whitened up fast and areas where i&#x27;m used to staining are all clean now (from what i can see in my mirror). The different modes on the toothbrush (clean, gum care, refresh, massage...etc) are more fun than something i see as i couldn&#x27;t do without. However the two-minute timer in the clean mode is cool (ya i said it) but with a new \\&quot;toy\\&quot; like this the two minutes don&#x27;t seem long enough. The uv sanitizer is also neat, obviously didn&#x27;t take that much care in sanitizing my toothbrush head before but now that i have something to do that...WHY NOT? ALL IN ALL id say its worth it...as i read in customer reviews by previous sonicare owners the toothbrush lasts about 5 years and its nice they give you a year long warranty.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Sonic care toothbrush (it lasted 6 years) this one is even better!  LED lights, different settings, charges and has an uv cleaning cycle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the new model for a short time now, about 3 weeks.  Absolutely love it.  Amazing design, waterproof, great contact-free charging base, simple to use included UV head cleaner, etc. etc.    It had been a while since I used an electric toothbrush like this, so it was nice to have the low power mode where it slowly ramps up to full power over time, to get you used to the feel of an ultra-sonic toothbrush.    The 30-second reminders are also a good addition, makes it much easier to time your brushing, although I&#x27;m not sure why they only work with the outside/inside of the teeth, and consider the \\&quot;bite edge\\&quot; of the molars as something to be done afterwards?  Unless it&#x27;s just not needed once you&#x27;ve done both sides?  Weird.    Anyway, these are highly recommended for good reason.  It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, and is obviously the result of several years of updates and refinement.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after my dentist told me I had prematurely receding gums.  I have been very happy with the product and feel it is more gentle than the non-electric Oral-B toothbrushes I had been using for years.</li>
            <li> This brush cleans teeth well. However, the attached UV light is unnecessary. I&#x27;d buy the brush without the UV light.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit on March 19, 2013, just slightly over a year and the unit will not turn on at all. I&#x27;m really surprised as I have had sonicare toothbrushes for as long as I can remember with years and years of trouble free operation. This unit was a little more but I spang for it after my previous ones. This one was a little more finicky - I attribute it to the controls being at a natural holding place. I just did not expect to pay this price for a one year toothbrush. Using as a manual toothbrush until I figure it out. I miss my long working sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost three years now and it still is running and working.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had a bad dentist visit since I purchased!</li>
            <li> everybody needs one of these</li>
            <li> I bought this because I brush too hard for my gums.  I thought it worked fine for about 2 years with normal use.  Then, the handle started shutting off mid-brush and turning on on its own (including in the middle of the night).  I called Philips and they said the warranty had expired.  It died approximately 2 months after the expiration of the warranty.  You cannot buy any replacement parts or have it fixed (unless you know of a small appliance repair store).  For almost $200 for a toothbrush, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Get better dentist reports.  Good for preventing plaque and conditioning gums.  Much better than those little ones you can purchase at Wal Mart, etc.  Definitely in a different category.  Love the fact you can place brush in the blue light cleaning compartment after each brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  If you&#x27;re trying to decide between all the bells and whistles and a simpler model, I would suggest going with the simpler model.  I honestly don&#x27;t use the various functions even though I got this because my dentist said my gums were beginning to recede, and I also had a cavity at the same appointment.  I bought this toothbrush as soon as I got home.  I obviously can&#x27;t say what my check-ups would have been like sans sonicare, but I will say that I&#x27;ve had no cavities and no mention of my gums for two years since the last check-up.  In fact, the assistant commented on how white my teeth looked.  The reason I&#x27;m really writing this review is because my toothbrush started turning on and off sporadically this week.  I checked the date I purchased and was still under warranty until next month - pheww! - timing....hmmmm - but ANYWAY - I called and within 5 minutes, Mike was sending me a new handle via fed ex with pre-paid labels to send the old one.  I&#x27;m smiling a pearly and healthy smile about a great product and no questions asked warranty.  Hooray!!</li>
            <li> This really helps whiten teeth and also the gum care option is really nice.  The replacement heads could be a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> my dentist and hygienist recommended this a year ago. now they say i&#x27;m brushing much better. less gum receding and improved plaque and stain removal! stays charged forever. I leave charger under the sink until it vibrates and tells me to charge it. never have to take charger on trips because it lasts at least three weeks. i use the sensitive heads with it.</li>
            <li> Never have my teeth felt fresher and cleaner. they would squeak if I rub my finder over them. I am currently wearing braces and am very happy I have this toothbrush, gives me the comfort of knowing I effortlessly reach all the corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my toothbrush would break tomorrow, I would order the same one again without thinking twice!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are more expensive than I prefer, but after a root canal I opted for this and I believe it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The newest Sonicare is just as wonderful and effective as the others with a few new features.  In addition to the regular clean, sensitive, and massage modes, there are now \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Refresh\\&quot;  modes.  These are all just slightly different speeds and durations but everyone can choose their favorite.  In all cases, the motor is very quiet and the slim handle is easy to hold.  The Plus model has a sleeker appearance with the various speeds not showing until you press the \\&quot;mode\\&quot; button to light up the choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my teeth feel after using the Sonicare and I brush longer than I used to with a manual toothbrush.  My dentists says my gums are really healthy, too.  The battery stays charged for three weeks making it very handy to take on trips, plus there is a nifty carrying case.  The toothbrush comes with one regular and one small brush head.  You also get a sanitizing unit that cleans your brush head in only ten minutes.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this toothbrush last week from Amazon/Drugstore.com and it&#x27;s great.  My dentist recommend this toothbrush after my old one which was an Oral B went kaput.  This Sonicare Flexcare Plus is a big improvement over my old Oral B.  My teeth are super slick when I rub my tongue over them and shiny.  I love the compact tooth head.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I had the right toothbrush as I didn&#x27;t see the 5 brushing mode display not knowing that the text will appear after the toothbrush is fully charge and when I hit the select button.  The text will disappear a couple of seconds after the toothbrush is turn off and reappear after you hit the select button to select one of the brushing mode.  It was confusing when the picture on the box shows the 5 brushing mode but after you open up the box you see this nice silver finsih with no text.  This is a fancy little gizmo, a BIG upgrade from my 5 or 6 years old Oral B Braun power toothbrush.  I can&#x27;t wait to go in for my next dental checkup to see how well this toothbrush remove the plaque from my teeth.  This is a big keeper.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.  Try to buy this toothbrush when it&#x27;s on sale if you can.</li>
            <li> This is my first battery operated toothbrush. I think that this model is great. It works very well, is comfortable to use, and has a timer to help me keep track of how long to brush. The ultimate test result will be when I go in for my next dental cleaning. I would not hesitate to recommend it.    Update: I went for my semi-annual dental cleaning last month. Great news to report - my dentist was amazed at how well my gums have improved. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve owned the Elite and Intelliclean and other brands of sonic toothbrushes and I must say, the Flexcare Plus is the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, I see that the handle is slimmer than the others, sleeker and much more attractive; and the cleaning modes are displayed on the handle.  It&#x27;s easy to switch modes and there&#x27;s no need to guess which mode the unit is in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean.  Not all Sonicare brushes are.  Some sport messy toothpaste dispensers (Intelliclean) or difficult to reach pit (Elite).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I encounter is the brush head must fit on the handle in a certain direction -- you have to fit it on a rod, which is flat on one side.  The Elite screws on, which is easy for the kids.  This one takes a little more precision, which isn&#x27;t difficult, but maybe not something for younger kids, those with poor eyesight or shaky hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***ACCESSORIES***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my.  So many accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOUR COLORED RINGS, to distinguish the toothbrush heads -- choose one for you and one for your spouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWO BRUSH HEADS with sanitary covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A NICE, HARD PLASTIC TRAVEL CASE which holds the handle and two brush heads -- the most attractive I&#x27;ve seen with the Sonicare toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWO CHARGERS: a small travel charger and a full size charger that is attached to a UV sanitizer.  My other Sonicare brushes did not come with extra travel chargers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***CLEANING MODES***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flexcare has Quadpacer technology, which means it beeps every 30 seconds to remind us to move to another quadrant.  That feature may be disabled, but I find it most useful.  Intellicare includes Quadpacer technology.  I believe some Elite models have Quadpacer, but mine did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are four different cleaning modes included.  Intellicare has two modes and Elite has one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING mode: 2 minutes of normal cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GUM CARE mode: 2 minutes of normal cleaning plus 1 additional minute to concentrate on the gums (Quadpacer beeps every 15 seconds for the gum care minute).  The gum cleaning is more gentle.  This is my preferred mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REFRESH mode: 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SENSITIVE mode: 2 minutes.  More gentle cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MASSAGE mode: 2 minutes.  I can feel larger, slower circular vibrations than in any other mode.  Feels like a back massage in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UV SANITIZER***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UV sanitizer can sanitize two brush heads at the same time.  Turn it on and it sanitizes for 10 minutes then  automatically turns off.  I thought maybe my toothbrush would be all wet inside, but it dries out my toothbrush for me.  This the only Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned with a UV cleaning feature and I think it&#x27;s a wonderful addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ comes with two brush heads and colored rings&lt;br /&gt;+ nice travel case (best I&#x27;ve seen for Sonicare)&lt;br /&gt;+ comes with small travel charger in addition to standard charger&lt;br /&gt;+ standard charger has a UV sanitizer for two brush heads&lt;br /&gt;+ Quadpacer technology to pace your cleaning&lt;br /&gt;+ four separate modes -- easy to read and set&lt;br /&gt;+ slimmer, sleek handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t dispense toothpaste (Intelliclean does, but I honestly didn&#x27;t care for that feature.  It&#x27;s really not a con for me, but perhaps it is for some people.)&lt;br /&gt;- brush head isn&#x27;t easy for young children or those with disabilities to attach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***SUMMARY***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare cleans teeth so much better than regular brushing alone.  My dentist and my children&#x27;s dentists always marvel at how clean our teeth are.  It&#x27;s really the toothbrush, because when we don&#x27;t use Sonicare, the dentists notice.  The question is which Sonicare to choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For young kids, I&#x27;d go with the Elite.  It&#x27;s easier for them to change brush heads, and it&#x27;s simpler and less expensive.  They don&#x27;t understand the concept of the Quadpacer technology (at least my kids didn&#x27;t); and rather than using the appropriate mode, they just play with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For adults, Flexcare Plus is the way to go.  Sleek, easy to clean, a variety of modes, UV sanitizer -- it is my favorite sonic toothbrush of all time.nic toothbrush of all time.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000TRQWBU Sonicare FlexCare Power Toothbrush with UV Sanitizer]]    The product, purchased through Amazon, provides and excellent and entertaining way to brush your teeth and stimulate your gums in an amazingly short 2 minutes.  There is also an UV Sanitizer to ensure your product is germ free after each application.  The price is a little high, but is well worth it as I find its use to be more entertaining than a chore and look forward both morning and night to using it.  The #1 recommended toothbrush by dentists should alleviate any concerns you may have about its safety and ability to provide a thorough cleaning.  It is very easy to use - open the box, read the instructions, plug it in and after charging, it is ready to use!  It is that simple.  Buy yours today and get ready for a new and delightful experience.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare Toothbrushes for years and this one is pretty similar to the last one that I had with the exception of the extra gum care setting and the fact that the indicators are not visible unless you are using it which gives a sleeker look as compared to the older versions.  I have not had a single cavity since I started using Sonicares and I have a great checkup every 6 months even though I only actually brush once a day.  The timer helps you make sure you brush the right amount of time, the different settings give you lots of options, and the technology helps keep your teeth clean and fresh.  If there is any down side it would be that the replacement heads are not cheap, but I only replace mine once a year or so and it seems to be just fine, so that is not too big of a deal.</li>
            <li> If you want a toothbrush that really gets your teeth squeaky clean a Philips Sonicare is the toothbrush for you.  My first Sonicare toothbrush was a more basic model, the [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare R710 HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush]] and it did an excellent job.  This one is a lot fancier and has a great \\&quot;high tech\\&quot; look with the UV Brush Head Sanitizer that lights up with a spacey blue color when it&#x27;s being used.  The brush handle itself also lights up showing the different settings such as Clean, Gum Care, Refresh, Sensitive and Massage.  Each is a little different speed although some are so close it&#x27;s difficult to feel a lot of difference with the toothbrush in your mouth.  The only thing that I wish was different is that you have to turn the toothbrush off to change the settings.  It would have been nice to be able to change while the brush was running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning your teeth, you just can&#x27;t beat a Sonicare. I&#x27;ve had Braun and Oral-B toothbrushes in the past and they just don&#x27;t come close to the Sonicare in the way they clean my teeth.  You know that feeling after you come out of the dentist&#x27;s office for a cleaning where your teeth have that polished, smooth feeling when you run your tongue over them?  Even after the first time using this one my teeth felt that way.  Another nice thing was that my gums don&#x27;t bleed when I use this toothbrush. For as long as I can remember my gums have bled after brushing my teeth, even when brushing by hand.  I thought with the way this brush moves so fast that it would cause bleeding too but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush comes with 2 ProResults brush heads, the UV Brush Head Sanitizer, 1 travel charger, 2 hygienic travel caps, and 1 hard travel case.  I&#x27;ve never taken an electric toothbrush along when I traveled before, I just used the old basic hand toothbrush, but I&#x27;ve become so spoiled and the travel charger takes up so little room that I take this one along.  The replacement brushes aren&#x27;t cheap, but the way this toothbrush cleans my teeth makes them worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to try this toothbrush through the Amazon Vine program or I probably would have gone on using my Philips Sonicare R710 HealthyWhite Power model. (Which another family member was happy to get.) It works just fine and does just as good a job of cleaning my teeth.  But this one is really attractive and I love having all the different settings and choices of speeds.  The UV cleaner is a nice touch.  With the previous model I had to soak the brushes in hydrogen peroxide to sanitize them.  And if you&#x27;re into aesthetics, this one looks really nice on the bathroom counter.  Two thumbs up for Sonicare!t brushes aren&#x27;t cheap, but the way this toothbrush cleans my teeth makes them worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to try this toothbrush through the Amazon Vine program or I probably would have gone on using my Philips Sonicare R710 HealthyWhite Power model.

Two thumbs up for Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist and they told me I needed a deep cleaning, which costs around $250. I decided to try this toothbrush instead. I used it for two weeks while flossing every night and went back to the dentist. They said all I need know is a normal cleaning. Thank you, Sonicare!</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus, rechargeable toothbrush is a very effective instrument for cleaning teeth and gums. Plaque accumulation is reduced and the gums are stimulated and less prone to disease as well as prevent cavity.    I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I switch from a manual toothbrush to the Sonicare.  After about three months, I can tell a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonicare does a better job at removing stains and giving a good \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feel. The only downside is that it takes some getting used to.  It feels like a small earthquake in my mouth and really vibrates hard.  If you buy this toothbrush, be prepared to give a good week or two to get used to the vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushheads don&#x27;t seem to last very long.  I went through one in less than three months, and the second one is already starting to wear.  So you have to be prepared for a pretty big investment in brush heads after purchasing this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is less than diligent with flossing, or if you have problems with staining in between dentist appointments.  Just be prepared for a vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve always used the traditional toothbrushes I buy in a bulk pack from Costco.  I have sensitive gums so every time I brush, the sink is full of blood.  My father talked me into purchasing the Sonicare and I must say it is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.  Not only is it gentle on my gums, I can instantly feel the difference, especially in the \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; areas in the back of the mouth.  After two weeks of using the Sonicare, my gums stopped bleeding entirely.  There is a \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; setting on the brush for people with sensitive gums.  The UV sanitizer is useless to me because I don&#x27;t believe anyone shares their toothbrushes these days.  Just pop in a different brush...  It&#x27;s nice if you think it actually makes your toothbrush cleaner but I don&#x27;t believe it is necessary.  However, I do use the sanitizer once a week.  What the heck, I paid for the darn thing!  My only regret is that I should&#x27;ve purchased a Sonicare toothbrush a long time ago.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush will have you feeling like you went to the dentist for a cleaning everyday. and the battery life is great</li>
            <li> Excellent product in every way. Charger excellent and every time I use brush I put in germ killer spot. Brush gives great action to clean teeth including behind teeth. Brush size is perfect and lasts a long time.Also comes with a great travel case for brush unit, hard plastic with brush covers.</li>
            <li> Aside from vibrating quite loudly, I really liked this toothbrush. I liked the sonic vibration and UV cleaning light. I chose this one because I thought it would work a little better than my Oral-B with the rotating head.     Unfortunately this was a gift for my husband and days after his first use, his mouth broke out in canker sores. I have no idea if this was a coincidence, or truly a nasty side-affect for folks who suffer from canker sores. Needless to say, he was not willing to try it again to find out, so I had to send it back.    If, however, you are not sensitive to the vibrations of this device. I do recommend.</li>
            <li> I have periodontal disease that has progressed to a little gum receding and deep pockets in the back teeth. I bought this on recommendation from my dentist and it has been the best purchase for my oral hygiene. I use the gum care mode all the time. I can say now that I have healthy pink gums that no longer bleed when I floss or brush.</li>
            <li> The UV stand on mine stopped working after 6 months, but it honestly makes very little sense anyway. The smaller normal stand is also included, which is what I now use. I would recommend the simpler Sonicare sets.</li>
            <li> I did a bit of research when I bought this and I feel that I made the right decision. There are many settings to use, typically I&#x27;ll use the normal or normal with gum massage cycles, but sometimes I&#x27;ll do a quick clean cycle just to freshen up. I&#x27;ve been using this non stop since I purchased it and I&#x27;ve not had a single issue with it. I really appreciate the travel case which was included since I do a fair bit of that. The charge on the batter lasts for about a week and I am careful not to leave it on the charger continuously, which I think helps.</li>
            <li> I love sonicare toothbrushes, and this one has not disappointed me.  Great toothbrush.  It cleans everything I want it to.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first, but the charger quit working after about 8 months.  I never used the sanitizing portion.</li>
            <li> Best Electric Toothbrush Ever!!! I did lots of research before making this purchase and it paid off. I was a bit hesitant about spending so much for a toothbrush but it is worth ever penny. My teeth have never felt cleaner. Give yourself one week to get used to the feeling of it before you decide that you do not like it. I hated it the first day but loved it by the fifth. My teeth were sore day 2-4 but that stopped by day 5. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used electric toothbrushes before, but this was my first model that utilized \\&quot;sonic technology.\\&quot; I must say that I am highly impressed. Every time I use this model I walk out of my bathroom feeling as if I just left the dentist. The varying brush modes are a convenient way maximizing your experience, however, you don&#x27;t have to use them if you do not want to. The charging base is very compact and will sit nicely on the corner of a vanity sink or a small shelf. A feature that is not advertised, but should be, is the fact that you can keep the toothbrush on the charging base so that it constantly has a full charge without adversely effecting the battery. Even without keeping it on the charging base, the battery life is very long, lasting around 3 weeks with moderate (twice a day) usage.     The only qualm I have with this product is that it must be plugged into an electrical outlet if you want to use the UV brush sanitizer. I feel as though a battery powered option would have been nice seeing as electrical outlets are typically not very abundant in bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It only took 2-3 days before I was acclamated to it.  Brushing is like getting a professional cleaning at the dentist.  Fot the price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I just set it on \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and it stays there each time I use it. I love the UV sensor because it assures me a clean toothbrush each use.</li>
            <li> My last toothbrush was a Sonicare Elite and that lasted me a good 5.5 years. Unfortunately, I had to toss it out (via e-waste disposer) because of the mold on the handle and the low battery life.    Pros:  1) New toothbrush design reduces mold build-up at the base of the brush stem (part where it connects to the handle). The old screw-on type traps water and toothpaste residue and requires me to regular take off the collar to rinse it out properly. 2) The standard ProResults toothbrush head is smaller than the standard one for the Sonicare Elite. It&#x27;s just slightly bigger than the Elite compact version, which I like. If go for the ProResults compact version, it&#x27;s even tinier than the Elite compact version, which allows for more focused brushing. 3) Replacement brushes are cheaper for the ProResults toothbrushes. 4) Travel charger is nice and compact. 4) Handle now comes with a battery state of charge indicator. Good for me to have since I take frequent short business trips and rather avoid taking along the travel charger even if it&#x27;s quite small.    Cons:  1) Flexcare handle is much longer than the Elite handle, which results in a larger case. 2) The \\&quot;ProResults\\&quot; label rubs off on my toothbrush after I pull the toothbrush on and off a few dozen times. Not a big deal, but it&#x27;s the same type of premature failure as the blue colored section of the bristles. I&#x27;ve seen the same thing happen with so many manual toothbrushes that I don&#x27;t even look at the blue colored section of my ProResults brush and rely on a calendar. Aside: I do the same with my Brita faucet filter because the LED light is flaky.    Notes:  1) This version comes with the hard case instead of the strange soft case Flexcare originally shipped with. That&#x27;s good because I don&#x27;t think the soft case can properly protect the metal stem sticking out of the handle. Not a pro because this should&#x27;ve been standard. 2) UV sanitizer is probably more gimmick than of real use. This has been discussed by reviewers manytimes already, but to sum it up, it&#x27;s not really needed because of the germ fighting agents in your toothpaste and it may do more harm than good if bacteria mutate to become more UV resistant. I only bought it because this kit cost me the same as the no-frills one at the time of purchase. 3) Battery for the Flexcare+ seems to last about a week longer (3.5 weeks) than my Elite when it was new. Hope this means that the battery lasts longer too. The Elite was still good for about 2-3 days around the end of the 5.5 year.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  This new brush is thinner, lighter and has nowhere for the wetness from brushing to accumulate! as compared to my elite toothbrush.  I also like the smaller brush head. I would definately recommend this toothbrush even though it is a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush for about 5 years.  My teeth are whiter, cleaner and feel so much better than with a regular toothbrush.  It&#x27;s the only way to brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare Elite for the last 6 years or so.  When the battery stopped holding a charge on the Elite, I looked around for the new model and settled on the FlexCare+.  I picked the UV sanitizer model primarily due to curiosity.    Pros:  - Much better design for attaching the brush head.  The Elite had that cavity that used to get nasty.  Glad that&#x27;s gone.  - More compact carrying case  - Slimmer design  - 2nd charger (w/o UV sanitizer) is small and convenient  - Cleans better than the Elite.  I used to use a reg toothbrush sometimes since the Elite had some blind spots.  No longer.    Cons:  - I regularly hit the \\&quot;modes\\&quot; button on accident and end up changing the brushing program.  You can barely feel that button even when you are paying attention.  - They swapped the flat part that prevents the brush from rolling from the top to the bottom with this model.  Couldn&#x27;t they put one both places?    All in all, another great toothbrush from Philips.  I&#x27;m a happy repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever! I purchased this as a gift for myself and I have not been disappointed- my teeth have never felt so clean</li>
            <li> Last week my teeth hurt, now they don&#x27;t.  After each brush, my teeth and gums feel more clean and fresh than ever before.  I can&#x27;t comment on the UV sanitizer, as I have yet to use it, but the brush itself is amazing.  I slowly went up to a cheap Oral B electric toothbrush, and it seemed to do a better job than a manual toothbrush.  I then upgraded to an arm and hammer rechargeable sonicare brush, which was better than the Oral B.    This is clearly the final step.  I never thought I would spend this much on a toothbrush, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  I personally only use the gumcare and clean settings, but after just one week my teeth and gums feel so much better.  The carrying case allows for travel, and it comes with a travel size charger.  Plus, with 42 brushes between charges, you can bring it anywhere in the world on vacation and not worry about having to find a 240/120 voltage regulator.    I&#x27;ve also been advised by dentists that I brush too hard, but with this brush my teeth feel clean without pressing hard, so no more destroyed brushes and bloody gums.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever owned. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure i was going to like it. It actually tickled my top inside gums to the point i had to move from that area but after a few days that sensation passed. After five days i noticed less bleeding from my gums, this has to be a good thing. the thirty second timer for each quadrant helps you get equal brushing time on each section. The charge lasts about two weeks. the UV sanitizer compartment is easy to clean as the brush holder slides easily in and out for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 years later. Toothbrush died, switch is defective, 6 months after warranty expired, guess Phillips knows how long to make their products last. :-(</li>
            <li> I could go into detail about this but I&#x27;ll spare you. This rechargeable toothbrush is one of the best purchases I have ever made. My teeth feel like I walked out of the dentist&#x27;s every single day. I wish I purchased one of these years ago. It&#x27;s so easy to operate and keep clean. I am simply amazed by the difference in my teeth. I never had a cavity my whole life until the last two trips to the dentist. I decided to try this out and I&#x27;m so happy I did. It&#x27;s a little pricey but your teeth will be glad you bought one. I will always have an electric toothbrush from this point on. I&#x27;ll never go back to manual! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As much as I loved this toothbrush, I would never buy a sonicare again. It broke 1 year and 1 day after I purchased it. When I called sonicare, they would do nothing for me. They said the warranty was no longer in effect. I didn&#x27;t even want a new one, maybe a coupon or something. 1 day over the warranty and they would do nothing. So guess what? Oral B has my business now, and I am perfectly happy with them. Rating changed to 2 stars!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product. It is easy to use, does what it says it will do and relieves the anguish of not being clean and sterilized.</li>
            <li> Just what they had said in the product description, works exactly what they said. I can recommend this to anyone that in need of this.</li>
            <li> Took over a month for it to arrive from JAPAN! In the meantime I bought a different Sonicare model at Target which we like. Cost me $80 to return the unit I ordered to Japan. One star is for the service. I didn&#x27;t open the box when it arrived so I can rate the unit.</li>
            <li> HAVE HAD PRODUCT BEFORE THIS REPLACED ONE THAT HAD WORN OUT OVER SEVERAL YEARS SERVICE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WHO WANT GREAT DENTAL HEALTH.</li>
            <li> In six months of using this miracle machine, my tissue quality went up from good to great! Really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a really sensitive (ticklish) upper lip, so at first this thing was AWFUL difficult to use because of the tickling, but after a couple weeks I got over it and now I don&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the increased tissue health it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful toothbrush.  Now that I own this brand, I would never consider another brand.&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygienest recommended this to me.</li>
            <li> I paid 140 for this toothbrush and it lasted 2.5 years. Loved it while it worked. Hate it now that I have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush ever.  My family now owns three.</li>
            <li> Update 8-20-2014: Edited my review score to 4-stars from 1-star. The reason is when I called Philips, a nice CS rep named Sarah hooked me up with a new base and three brand new brush heads. Even though my unit was out of warranty (though the closeness of the expiration date had a lot to do with it, I&#x27;m sure). This is another lesson as to why when you get in touch with a company, be friendly, be patient, and 9/10 times, they&#x27;ll do right by you because they value you as a customer. Big props to Philips for standing behind this product. A week with a real toothbrush has just about killed me (my teeth hate me, my wife hates me, my wife&#x27;s teeth hate me... who would have thought a toothbrush could take away so much hate? heh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a lot of others leaving negative reviews, I&#x27;m a long-time Sonicare user. The model I bought from my dentist almost a decade ago worked for seven years before the metal rod that vibrates the head finally vibrated the rubber seals right off. I wasn&#x27;t upset, as if I can get a $200 toothbrush to work for seven years (keep in mind, my wife and I use it, twice daily each at a minimum), it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought the new one on July 13, 2012. As of August 16, 2012, the toothbrush no longer charges. No matter what. I&#x27;ve even tried using the travel base and the old toothbrush&#x27;s base. Nothing. For an hour or two there was a few small flashes of light, but now it&#x27;s completely dead. Philips usually has a decent warranty, so I came back to look at my order and find out if it&#x27;s still covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the toothbrush died three days after the two year warranty period expires. I&#x27;m very upset about this, not just because it&#x27;s an inconvenience (for anyone who is used to one of these, going back to a manual toothbrush is not pleasant at all), but because as I&#x27;m looking through these reviews to see if I&#x27;m the only unlucky one, I&#x27;m seeing a lot of customers in my situation. Too many, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll bug Philips first, but if they don&#x27;t offer to help me, I&#x27;ll find another brand, or get used to a manual toothbrush again (yeah, I know, first-world problems). Heck, I&#x27;ll even agree to pay $50 or something reasonable to get the base unit&#x27;s battery replaced, but I&#x27;m not paying full price for another one that might only last until days after the warranty expires.fer to help me, I&#x27;ll find another brand, or get used to a manual toothbrush again (yeah, I know, first-world problems).

            <li> my brushing experience has been enriched and made easier with this product-dental check ups a breeze!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, but stopped working completely within one year of purchase.</li>
            <li> This is our second Philips Sonicare and we are very pleased. We like the updated sanitizing feature. Otherwise it is much like the one we owned before.</li>
            <li> Replaced my very old sonicare with this one and we love it.  Wish I had gotten a year ago. Great!</li>
            <li> I have been using my Sonicare toothbrush for almost 2 years and couldn&#x27;t be happier. This thing is awesome and the price/ easy returns policy with Amazon was a no brainier.  It took me a little while to get used to the feel of the bristles/ vibration but after a week or two I didn&#x27;t notice anymore. My teeth feel 100X cleaner than using a standard toothbrush. Both myself and my dentist have noticed a change in my teeth and gums. My gums used to bleed a lot but they never do now. Besides having numerous settings with timers so you don&#x27;t over or under brush, this comes with 2 chargers- one with an easy to use sanitizer and another travel charger. I take this with me everywhere. I would highly recommend this to anyone and without a doubt would purchase another if needed.</li>
            <li> Just after the 2-year warranty expired, the toothbrush broke. The little pin that holds the brush head now wiggles back and forth. As a result, the brush head is not held firmly and the whole handle vibrates. Until the model broke, it worked fine. I now intend to purchase another, simpler model.</li>
            <li> This is a great device, actually it&#x27;s a little too great.  I&#x27;ve never used the extra settings.  Only the &#x27;Clean&#x27; setting.  Be aware that the replacement heads are rather expensive.  Don&#x27;t be shocked.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  My dentist has one on her table and I asked if she recommended it since I am now on my third.  She said that it is one of the best toothbrushes on the market.  I have very good check-ups and this toothbrush makes my teeth feel sooooooo clean.  This may be a little on the expensive side but you won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> THIS IS OUR SECOND PURCHASE OF THIS TOOTHBRUSH. MY HUSBAND PUSHES PRETTY HARD ON IT , SO I GUESS THATS WHY IT ONLY LASTED A YEAR. WHITENS AND CLEANS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER WE HAVE PURCHASED. I HAD GUM SURGERY AND THE DR. SUGGESTED I BUY A SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH, I DID AND IM COMPLETELY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> The FlexCare 900 series we purchased didn&#x27;t even last a year before the gears in the handle went. And try just buying the handle. You can get parts for everything else, liek the UV sanitizer / charger, UV bulb, etc., but not the handle. We had an other model and gave it up for the 900 series because of the UV sanitizer. I am wondering now if that was a good choice.</li>
            <li> This really works well.  I was skeptical that a tooth brush could make such a difference, but thing thing is in a word AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I bought this month ago and really like it.  Easy to clean between teeth.  My gum has been getting better condition and no bleeding any more.  It&#x27;s expensive but if you want to take care of your teeth, it is NOT expensive.</li>
            <li> I had been using an older model for three years and it was time to upgrade. I love going to the dentist and having the hygienist say \\&quot;well you didn&#x27;t leave much for me to do.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare FlexCare Plus for about two months and I am very pleased with how clean it keeps my teeth.  I had my teeth cleaned right before using and they have stayed clean.  Coming from a manual toothbrush, it took a week or so to get used to this brush but I can use it my sleep now.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the UV feature and the selection of all the different cleaning modes on this model. Does a great cleaning job. This is the third sonicare toothbrush I have purchased in the past 8 or 9 years. The first sonicare I purchased, I used a couple of years but there were rough edges around the toothbrush(bad design). So I upgraded to the elite which I loved but after several years the battery finally gave out. (bad thing about the elite was inside the handle where inserted the toothbrush, mildew would build up and was very hard to bleach and keep clean.) Love the fact that this new flexcare plus model has a closed handle and the toothbrush goes onto a metal rod so easy to clean. All the sonicare toothbrushes I have used leave your teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally as a Christmas gift, but once I saw all the features and how it worked I wanted one for myself.  I finally got this in January and haven&#x27;t missed my old toothbrush at all.  After every brushing, I feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the dentist.  I would recommend this to anyone/everyone.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a top of the line Sonicare toothbrush at $50 less than retail. The UV sanitizer is a very good feature. Multiple cleaning options on the toothbrush. If you&#x27;ve used a sonic type toothbrush before that wasn&#x27;t a Sonicare, you haven&#x27;t truly experienced the same as what this brush can do. The dentist clean feeling every morning and evening is wonderful. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electronic tooth brush for years, but now that I have tried sonic technology I would NEVER go back!  My teeth feel straight-from-the-dentist clean!  I now find much less plaque when I floss and I think it is making my teeth whiter!  I LOVE MY TOOTHBRUSH!!!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is my first mechanical toothbrush. I purchased it after reading several scholarly research articles on the benefits of \\&quot;true\\&quot; sonic action in toothbrushes over manual brushing. I have very good dental health overall, but I&#x27;m terrible at making myself floss, and a sonic toothbrush can mitigate some of that neglect.    I have been using it for a few weeks now and I can already tell a HUGE difference in my gum health, and several people have remarked that my teeth seem whiter. Though the toothbrush gently increases intensity through the first 10 or so times you use it, my gums bled slightly the first few times I used it - my hygenist said that was actually a good sign at first as long as it didn&#x27;t continue (it didn&#x27;t) - it means pockets in your gums that were previously undisturbed are being cleaned. I use the timed brush function, which vibrates distinctively every 30 seconds to tell you to move to the next section of your mouth. It is a bit awkward the first few times because you don&#x27;t actually \\&quot;brush\\&quot; with the sonicare - you move it evenly across your teeth and gums and the vibration \\&quot;brushes\\&quot; for you, but it quickly becomes easy.    The unit is well constructed and very, very simple to use. It took rather a long time to charge up before the first use, but it has had excellent battery life since then. Construction is of very high quality and cleaning is simple. The included instructions are clear. You may want to check what is included in your package before you purchase additional brush heads - my package came with both a generous coupon and an offer related to registering for warranty.</li>
            <li> You get two wands with this package. Expect both to break within or close to the warranty period. I have owned these sonicare brushes since they first came out and I have generally been very satisfied but the new design is really weak. Better save your receipt and pray they break within the warranty period or you will be out of luck! And you cannot buy replacement wands only so you will be forced to buy a whole new set. What a ripoff.</li>
            <li> Have used various electric teeth cleaning systems for over a decade with mixed success.  Brought a earlier version of the Philips Sonic a few years ago.  It was the best results of any system.  I believe it was due to the lateral (sideways) motion of the head being able to better clean the curved surfaces and between the teeth.    The rechargeable failed after about three years and Philips ceased making a 240 voltage version.  Forced to revert back to the rotating head style item which produced much poorer results and required more extensive flossing and a combination of nonelectric hand brushing.    Sourced the new multi-voltage Philips Sonicare.  After a very short period of adjusting the results are excellent.  Teeth and gums feel much healthier and need for flossing is reduced.  Brought the version with bells and whistles - probably not necessary.  Also brush longer than the built in timer - probably not necessary.  New head design considerable improvement.  Different head size brushes are a useful personal option    Tip - let the brush do the work with light pressure and slow movement around the mouth.    It is enjoyable to use a tool that produces very good results.    Dentist is not happy - no funds to put kids through collage</li>
            <li> As a son of a dentist I figured myself for a pretty good caretaker of my teeth but after having neglected my dental checkups for about 3 years, I finally went in and found out I needed some fairly serious work done.  I was told I needed to take better care of my teeth which woke me up.  Just simply brushing my teeth a couple times/day with an occasional flossing wasn&#x27;t enough.  I did some research online for one of the new electric toothbrushes.  After visiting some blogs about them (yes people are actually obsessive about dental care) I chose the Philips Sonicare flexcare plus kit based on the high marks all around from every site I researched.  It wasn&#x27;t cheap but I figured it would last me for years and if it would help keep my teeth then it would be worth it.      The sonicare action of the toothbrush took a little getting used to.  It vibrates the brush head quickly and pressing gently against the teeth at the gumline makes for a slightly sensitive strange experience at first.  I got used to it quickly though and the results are so much better than I expected.  My teeth feel truly cleaned after I use the Sonicare brush and it has even whitened my teeth a bit having removed some of the tartar build up discoloration.  It&#x27;s also much more effortless than a traditional manual toothbrush since you simply put the Sonicare brush against the teeth at the gumline and slowly move it across the fronts and backs of the teeth.  Much simpler than brushing back and forth at different angles.      It also came with a UV light unit that kills bacteria for the brush heads which I find useful and a nice extra with the kit.  The brush came with a travel kit that includes a storage container for the brush and heads and portable power charger.  That was a great addition and on a recent overseas trip with my wife came in very handy.      Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone who can afford to spend a bit more for better regulardental care.</li>
            <li> Sensação de limpeza total, os vários modos de escovação são perfeitos e o temporizador te da o tempo necessario que precisa ao escovar</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth clean. I mostly use it for cleaning my teeth. Actually, that&#x27;s about all I use it for.</li>
            <li> It really cleans better than anything I used before. The battery has enough power to last for at least four days. I do not find very useful the programs it has, I use only a normal one for two minutes.</li>
            <li> Had a Sonicare for about 4/5 years before it died, by the second day knew I had to replace it.  Had my doubts that there would be any difference........I was WRONG great \\&quot;tool\\&quot; to clean your teeth.  The sanitizer is comforting but I have made it this long without one.    Good stuff.</li>
            <li> My Phillips sonic care plus toothbrush is a amazing product I would recommend it to any one I find amazon is a good company with great service and getting there products to my front door thanx muchley amazon shane otoole</li>
            <li> It took longer than I thought it should have to be delivered.  Once I got it I do like it.  It has an adjustment period built in the toothbrush so it is easy to get use to.  I like that it also has a two minute timer on brushing your teeth.  I haven&#x27;t had it for very long but so far I would reccomend it.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but your chompers are worth it, and going through gum surgery (so I am told) is no picnic at the beach. The FlexCare does it all, does it well, except clean the bathroom mirror when you&#x27;re finished. So keep your mouth shut while using this fine product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth feel after using the Sonicare! Well worth the money, and it came highly recommended from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. Was recommended by my dentist. Easy to use and happy with results. Would recommend for kids too.</li>
            <li> my dentist was the one to recommend this device (not necessarily the \\&quot;plus\\&quot;). i&#x27;ve had it about a month and i am very impressed with how long you can go between charging it - even though the logical place to store the hand held unit is on the vertical charging stand. Additionally impressive are the choice in settings - i use \\&quot;clean\\&quot; 80% of the time - it&#x27;s your typical use setting with a 2 min shut off timer.  i took off one star for the directions - it showed an image of a different travel charger that comes with another unit - no biggie, but wanted to send a message ;)  this is a first electric brush for me - so i don&#x27;t have a true basis for comparison - other than subsequent dentist visits whereby the hygienists were impressed with my gum improvements.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It does wonders. I had problems with plaque build-up around the gumline while using regular toothbrushes, but since I switch I have not had the same problem.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare and they FINALLY got the head design right.  Older models were notoriously hard to clean and would collect water and get mildew.  Sonicare has adopted a design similar to Oral-B (the way the brush head attaches to the handle).  This model is MUCH easier to keep clean and also has a much smaller diameter handle (probably half the size of the first Sonicare I had).  Also comes with a smaller travel charger (though you can make it at least 2 weeks on a full charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that the 5 modes are a bit overkill and I somehow often accidentally change out of the normal mode.  Otherwise, this is an all around great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two years now and absolutely love it! With this brush, you get that fresh from the dentist feeling everyday, and how can you beat that? The UV sanitizer is amazing too; you wouldn&#x27;t believe how many germs sit on the average toothbrush left in a bathroom. It kills the germs and also just makes a great place to keep the brush heads between brushings to reduce the amount of germs that ever touch them in the first place. The other great thing about this brush is that it has three different settings depending on how much time you have, and I love the massage setting for your gums! Another nice feature is the ability to change out the colored rings at the bottom of the toothbrush heads, allowing you to keep track of which head is yours, so more than one person can use the unit. I think Philips thought of just about everything with this brush, and it definitely holds up to its guarantee of better dental checkups. :)</li>
            <li> We have tried many other styles and brands.  The hx6972/10 works the best and well worth the extra money.   This product makes your teeth feel like the dentist cleaned them every day you use it. Makes you want to smile more!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these, one for me and one for my husband. I ordered this because my dentist kept insisting that I get one. I ordered from Amazon because it was cheaper. I must say that this is a VERY good toothbrush but I have to get use to the feeling that I have when I brush my teeth with it. It has a lot of power behind each brush, but that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> This is the best dental care product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The UV light cleaner thing might be more of a gimmick than anything else, but it looks cool. Note that the brushes and actual operation of this model are almost the same as the cheaper [[ASIN:B004M1BO3U Philips Sonicare Hx6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush, White]]. The difference is that this model has a slightly more powerful motor (I think - the vibrations are more vigorous), and has the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; option which means the amplitude of the vibration is larger (moves more from side to side) and the frequency lower (vibrates slower, but still very fast). This thing removes coffee/tea stains and removes residue from the gumline better than any other toothbrush/electric I&#x27;ve owned, and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> When I purchased it and used for two weeks I absolutely loved it. Now it stopped working after 9 months.   141 dollars down the drain</li>
            <li> This is a very impressive product. It works, as advertised, and leaves you with a very exhilarating tooth brushing experience. You can&#x27;t believe how rapidly it vibrates. Quite an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> My family and I loved this product and had looked forward to using it.  We really enjoyed it but after only two weeks it simply stopped.  I plan to purchase another one once the refund for the defective one goes through.  Hopefully, this defective one is just a few fluke.</li>
            <li> Broke in under a year. Not the battery but maybe a bearing in the inside and it just rattles and doesn&#x27;t actually brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Great brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Price&lt;br /&gt;- Broke in under a year.</li>
            <li> Not as good as it should be for the price. Broke after 10 months of use. Avoid</li>
            <li> LOVE this! Why did it take me so many years to try the Sonicare????&lt;br /&gt;Manual toothbrushing cannot come close to the level of &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and thorough had from brushing with a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  I have been using an electric toothbrush for years.  This one seems to leave my teeth much cleaner.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I switched from a 5 year old Oral B to this toothbrush at my dentist&#x27;s recommendations, and I&#x27;m happy I did.  It&#x27;s must more gentle on my gums, feels like it cleans better, and is a pleasure to use.  Isn&#x27;t too noisy and the quadrant sensor is integrated well.  The travel case is nice, although it&#x27;s a little bulkier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to upgrade to this brush from an electronic Oral B one but I am so glad that I did. My teeth feel that much cleaner and I love the various settings.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Easy to use.  Large range of levels of intensity. UV sanitizer included.  I am very satisfied and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent electric toothbrush. We have used  PHILLIPS SONICARE ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHS for several years and have upgraded this last time. Very easy to adjust the settings for example: clean, sensitive, massage etc. Easy to purchase the replacement brush heads. They can be found at CVS and various other retail stores and online.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived as stated and very quickly. Thanks</li>
            <li> This was suggested to me by a co-worker, she owned one herself. I ordered this from Amazon and love, love, love...&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare cleans my teeth SO clean! I am planning on buying this for Christmas presants this year! Thanks for selling this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adrienne&lt;br /&gt;Louisiana</li>
            <li> I recomend this device for everybody. Battery - good, cleaning - excellent, uasbitily - good. this toothbrush is not becoming as dirty as others. Very useful traveller holder which i using in my trips. The only question - do i really need this ultraviolet device that disinfecting brush? I&#x27;ve puted it on shelf...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about a month. The brush itself is great - my teeth &amp; mouth feel clean and smooth after using it. I&#x27;d give it 5/5 stars, except the UV sanitizer bulb burned out after less than a month of use. And I can&#x27;t find a replacement for it (that I know will work) anywhere, not on Amazon, not even on Philips&#x27; own site (it&#x27;s out of stock, leading me to believe that lots of people have had to replace them).</li>
            <li> This lasted exactly 2.5 years and the battery died. I took it traveling for a total of 3 times during these 2.5 years. Contacted customer support and the warrantee is good for exactly:: 2 years. (or 2.5 years if you register online). Unsurprisingly, they weren&#x27;t interested in replacing the device outside of warrantee. I&#x27;d recommend contacting customer service AS SOON as the battery life shortens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is the standard among all Sonicare brushes. Dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is great.  I love it. It works wonders. I will refer this toothbrush to several of my friends</li>
            <li> i was always using manual tooth brush, but was always told that electric cleans so much better. So now, i got flexcare as a gift, i am extremely happy. First, design is very cool. Second, sanitizer has space to store 2 brush heads, and while sanitezer does its job, there is a space right next to it to charge toothbrush. Third, 5 functions: clean, sensitive, massage (gum care), go care (2 min), max care (3 min, combines all clean &amp; massage). Forth, set include 2 brush hears: standard and compact (for hard to reach areas). Overall, my teeth never felt cleaner!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush from Amazon.com a couple of years ago and have been using it ever since.  This toothbrush comes with a couple of different modes and settings such as gum brushing but to be honest I only use one of them for brushing my teeth.  This toothbrush has a few helpful features that I do use.  One of the helpful features is the UV cleaner.  I have to charge my toothbrush about once a week so whenever I do, I take off the brush and put it in the UV cleaner and let that run through to ensure any bacteria is removed from the brush.  I also enjoy the timed alerts that tell you after 30 seconds have passed when you are brushing your teeth so that you can move to a different section of your mouth to brush.  While the toothbrush vibrates it&#x27;s just a little sound it makes that tells you 30 seconds have passed and the setting I use it does this 4 times.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have had was about a year and a half after having it, the battery stopped charging or holding a charge.  I contacted Sonicare and because the brush was within the 2 year warranty they immediately shipped me out a new toothbrush that I received in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a good quality electric toothbrush. I have had it over 2 years and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush in August 2012.  On January 7, 2015 It stopped working.  I realize we are a consume based society but when I pay over $100 for a toothbrush I expect value.  The Sonicare is not worth the money.  There are numerous design flaws including:  The base unit door will stop working.  As in you will close the door, press the UV button (which is cute but probably useless) and nothing will happen.  I originally thought this was a button problem and Philips replaced the base under warranty.  When the 2nd unit started to experience the same issue a few month later is investigated more thoroughly.  Turned out to be a cheaply designed mechanical door switch contact  Some tinfoil fix it.  The toothbrush mode button is positioned to be extremely easy to hit accidentally and you&#x27;ll be unable to see that the mode has changed while brushing.  The OEM attachments are very expensive and usually of poor quality.  I&#x27;ve had much better performance and longevity from the generic heads at a 1/3 the price.  Finally the toothbrush, base, every inch of the thing quickly fills every crack with dirt and grime.  Not that I expect my toothbrush to be a work of art but it should at least not be disgusting.  This is a bad product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this brush for over a month now ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Excellent reach, cleaning action &amp; ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Indian buyers beware that with duties the brush would cost you over INR 10,000/- &amp; it does not ship with spare brush heads.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a very good job of cleaning your teeth and gums.  It is very powerful and leaves your teeth squeaky clean. The brushes look like they are durable too and don&#x27;t show signs of wear as other brands do soon after you start using them. As said in other reviews, it takes a little getting adjusted to the tickle feeling when brushing certain areas of your mouth.  The one drawback is that the brush cycle is set up to break up brushing into 30 second intervals so that you divide up your brushing into 4 areas.  However, you have 6 areas to brush if take into account that you still have the flat surface areas of your teeth. That said, you need more time to brush than 2 minutes. The brush completely stops after 2 minutes and you need to restart the cycle again to brush the flat surface areas.</li>
            <li> Bought this unit from Amazon in June 2010. The unit has been working wonderfully. I noticed that my teeth are much cleaner and smoother. The battery holds the charge for at least a week so it has been to several vacations with me. The provided case works well. Overall, I am very satisfied with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until yesterday (Oct 20, 2012), the unit made a loud noise and the brush stopped moving. I was not sure what went wrong. Today, I had an online chat session with their customer support who determined that the unit was faulty. Although the warranty period has passed (2 years), they will replace the unit for free. I am impressed with their service. Will be getting the new unit in about a week. I hope this new unit will last for about the same time or longer. I was hoping to get at least 5 years out of the handle. If things change, I will update my review. At this point, I would like to give it 4 of 5 stars for quality.</li>
            <li> Love it and it does a fantastic job. My teeth have never felt so clean. I would not hesitate to recommend this to friends!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is obviously defective, based on the numerous people with the same problem my brush had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Made it 1 year (to the day) from the date of order, and decided to start making strange noises.  The handle still also makes noise, but the brush does not vibrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a brush this expensive, you would expect it to, at least, be reliable.  Philips should recall, and REFUND!</li>
            <li> Used this item for about one year - twice a day, the only user. Few weeks ago handle first started running weaker than usual, then started making odd buzzing noises and finally died few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed - this product is way too expensive to be replaced every year. Switching to a different brand.</li>
            <li> This unit has spent most of its life in the box. It was given to be by someone who had no use for it. The internal components snapped like a twig. the only thing I did was remove the brush head and the drive shaft severed into 2 pieces. I spend some time online with a chat agent who told me since I did not register the device, I was out of luck and she could give me 15% off of a new 150 dollar toothbrush. After being told I was out of warranty and the unit was junk, I took it apart to confirm that yes, the main piece inside had separated and is made of cheap Chinese components. It worked great until I had to change a brush head which is the only way that could have broke, despite the fact that I only applied the level of force necessary to remove it and no more. The reliability of this product is laughable. Do not waste your money on this junk just to be told that there is nothing they can do after it breaks 3 months into usage. Oh, and thanks for recommending that I spend another 20 bucks on new brush heads to try to correct the issue. I really have a use for them now with my $150 toothbrush paperweight. I would give 0 Stars for this product.</li>
            <li> I had done tons of research to find the best battery toothbrush. This Philips Sonicare is by far the best I have ever used. I went to the dentist after using it a short time and even he noticed the difference. I am thrilled with this purchase. Its more than worth the money.</li>
            <li> My wife and I shared an Oral B electric toothbrush for many years now.  After a recent semi-annual dental visit, my hygienist said that my gums are receding and asked \\&quot;Do you brush hard?\\&quot;.  She recommended not to use Oral B because the circular rotation motion was pushing my gums back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this product for a week so far, and it has been light on my gums and feels even cleaner and smoother than the Oral B did.  Also, it has taken out some debris between my teeth that I have never seen the Oral B ever did.  I should have bought this years ago !!</li>
            <li> This is my first sonic toothbrush but now I don&#x27;t know how I lived without one. I&#x27;ve tried regular toothbrushes of course &amp; those cheap electric rotary toothbrushes that pretend to be sonic. I thought they were fine until I picked up one of these. When I brushed my teeth for the first time with this yeah it felt kind of odd &amp; took some getting use to, but when I was done my mouth felt so clean! Dentist office clean even. I use to have issues where no matter how often I brushed and flossed my gums they were still not healthy. They were starting to recede slightly and they would often be sensitive and bleed when brushed. My dentist kept suggesting a sonic toothbrush because of my sensitive gums which I finally decided to fork out the money for one. Now after months of using this toothbrush my gums are noticeably healthier! The receding reversed, the bleeding has stopped, and my teeth just keep getting healthier &amp; whiter! I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the UV thing nice I tend to swap heads keeping 2 in there clean and ready to go. I like the UV light because having my toothbrush on the counter charging in the bathroom with the germs that live in bathrooms kind of creeps me out. Being able to UV the heads and toss on a nice sterile one is a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I didn&#x27;t buy it off Amazon even though I came here to check the reviews before selecting this model. I got mine on sale at Target. It wasn&#x27;t as cheap as buying it here, but I was able to get a 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty &amp; considering how many people seem to have had trouble with motors or batteries failing I felt having a warranty where I can just drive down the street and swap it out if something goes wrong more convenient.</li>
            <li> I absoulutly love this tooth brush.  It works great to clean all areas of the teeth.  I have noticed a huge difference in how I brush my teeth different and it takes no time at all.  I also love how you can remove the tips and have them cleaned in the machines that they send with it.  Works great!  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> When my old Sonicare toothbrush died a few months ago I did a lot of research on electric toothbrushes.  I read reviews on Amazon as well as other websites.&lt;br /&gt;After much research I decided to get this one.  I have owned this brush for about 6 months!  I love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;I love the different settings, especially the gum cleaning setting.  It gets my teeth and gums so clean!  When I went to the dentist they said my teeth looked cleaner than ever before!  I was so pleased.  When I told them the toothbrush I had they all agreed that Sonicare was one of the best brushes out on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I use the head cleaner every few weeks.  It works great!&lt;br /&gt;The brush stays charged for just over 2 weeks brushing once a day and about a week if you brush twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with this excellent brush!</li>
            <li> I never liked electric toothbrushes, but I sure do like the ultrasonic one.  My teeth feel more polished, almost like a dental hygienist cleaned them, and coffee stains are removed much more thoroughly. Highly recommended, even to doubters.</li>
            <li> I have had this since May 2011 and I loved it when I first got it.  Feels great to brush with.  After about 8 months of use the internal timers for the regular brush cycle were starting to get shorter and shorter, sometimes they would be longer than normal, sometimes they would be about the right time length.  Now all the sudden my tooth brush doesn&#x27;t work at all, I have had to resort to  primitive brushing techniques with this 140$ toothbrush.  Never did I think the day would come that I would spend 140$ on a toothbrush that I have to manually brush with.  My father has a cheaper model(not sure which one) of the Sonicare and he has been using it for 5 years and has had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips replaced my broken tooth brush with a refurbished one or new one.  After about a year of use the tooth brush has started turning itself on.  At first I said to myself \\&quot;Better call the Ghostbusters\\&quot; but then I realized my tooth brush had just broken again.  The toothbrush won&#x27;t charge anymore and it just keeps turning itself on and it won&#x27;t turn off at all.  The only reason I can think of as to why this tooth brush breaks so often/easily is because the vibration is too strong for whatever cheap parts they use inside the tooth brush.  If anyone reads both parts of my review, my father still has the same tooth brush and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have long been wary of electric toothbrushes. I figured I can make do with a traditional toothbrush just fine, and not spend a lot of money on something that would provide minimal benefit. I even brushed off my dentist when they were trying to peddle an electric toothbrush on me, despite minutes earlier applauding my technique. However, I [obviously] changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was considering either the Oral-B 5000 or the Sonicare. I did plenty of research on models and specs, and in the end decided on Sonicare. While I have had a friend years ago recommend one, I have tended to prefer Oral-B manual toothbrushes for years, so they were at the top of my list. For Sonicare, I liked how the brush head was more closely related to a traditional toothbrush, rather than a circular shape of Oral-B. Some of the reviews for Oral-B indicated a minor irritation when the toothbrush would stop in the middle of brushing, telling you to move to the next &amp;#34;section.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I decided to go with Sonicare, despite the cost difference. I have loved the experience since I bought the brush a few months ago! Every time I brush, I feel like I just had a professional cleaning...no joke. I currently am unable to think of any real downsides to the brush. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a VAST improvement over the old non-hygienic original model. I have both and this new one if FAR better and FAR more powerful and effective. AND it is easy to keep clean and hygienic.  One issue I&#x27;ve had: the UV sanitizing light pooped out and the replacement bulb&#x27;s price it preposterous. Even so, I bought one and it pooped out again way too soon. So now, the UV sanitizer is history and I clean it the old school way.  I still love it. My wish: Lose the short-lived UV gizmo and reduce the price by $30!</li>
            <li> Bought this unit thinking it would be good as I have used sonic tooth brush for over 10 years now.&lt;br /&gt;This was the most disappointing product I purchase from Philips. It turned out to be unreliable. After several months of usage, the unit would&lt;br /&gt;turn on by itself in the middle on the night and I have to wake up to turn it off. Customer service didn&#x27;t want&lt;br /&gt;to believe me and reluctantly shipped a replacement that took almost 2 weeks to arrive. In the mean time  the&lt;br /&gt;toothbrush would keep turning it self on until I get the battery drain completely. Now the replacement unit has died completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering how bad and slow customer service was last time. I&#x27;m not going to bother and just go looking for a new brand.</li>
            <li> After using this tooth brash for 3+ years I can say that it does great job cleaning my teeth, but I have run into some problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I had to buy brush heads almost every 6 month because they get worn out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2. After using &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode for more than a year I get a gum recession and had to switch to a &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; mode and be careful around those areas.&lt;br /&gt;3. One morning all of a sudden this tooth brash stopped working after 3 years and a month of careful using only at home. Now I have to buy a new one or something similar. Quite expensive if you consider the fact that I have payed almost $150 for something slightly more than 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after 3 years of using it I can see that I was paying around $100 a year.</li>
            <li> These things are gret they really hold pu even over several years.  I reicntly bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to over brush with my manual toothbrush and that is not good since sometimes it cause sore gum on certain tooth.  However, with this brush, it&#x27;s amazing how much cleaner and fresh my mouth feels only after two minutes of brushing.  I will never go back to a manual toothbrush ever again.  I wish I discovered this years ago.  My teeth are whiter and healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> Had a sonicare before, this one is even better, multiple speed options and the cleaning container is great not only for cleaning but keeping it contained from dust/dirt in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric tooth brush I have ever used. I&#x27;ve only had it two weeks but already wish I had purchased one years ago. I purchased this brand and model primarily due to the high revues of others. In two minutes of use, it feels like your teeth and mouth are as clean as if you spent four minutes with a manual tooth brush. It is so easy to use, due to it&#x27;s ergonomic design, that thoroughly cleaning your teeth and mouth is effortless. When done just pull the brush from the handle,rinse it off, and pop it into the hygenic cleaner and your ready for the next cleaning. I am realy sold on this tooth brush!</li>
            <li> your teeth feel a lot cleaner using the sonicare. Initially, I was hesistant buying this product since it was expensive...I can tell you the first time I used this bad boy i would say I would never go back. Plus, it has different settings so if you are lazy you can just set it to refresh.. The refresh setting I would say is by far more superior than using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> this is the first sonic toothbrush I ever had and I wouldn&#x27;t want to be&lt;br /&gt;without it--I wish everyone could have one--it does such a perfect job&lt;br /&gt;of cleaning and even took away a dark area on a recessed tooth.</li>
            <li> The timer is very helpful, and I really do find myself with a cleaner mouth (or so I feel it).  My Dentist asked if I changed any habits, and I told him I have been using this for 2 months and he noticed a difference.  The UV cleaner is nice too, just a little extra security for a clean mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads last about 2-3 months, so purchase extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought 4 units in October 2010, three for gifts for my close relatives and one for myself. It is a great unit and I loved it. After about 9 months, the unit developed problem, turning on by itself and would not charge properly. I called the customer service and they sent me a replacement unit in a couple of weeks. The replacement unit worked fine for about 6 more months and developed the same problem again. Called the customer service and they sent me another unit. That worked for about 9 months, and then the brush head would not vibrate, I could hear the motor running but it was not making the brush head vibrate. The 24 month warranty just expired and I thought that was it. But just to give it a try, I called the customer service AGAIN, and they did not say anything about the warranty expiration and send me another unit. So this is the 3rd replacement for me. Some of the reviewers here mentioned similar problems like mine but they were happy with the Philips customer service. But I wonder how Philips could say that there are no known problems. They are full of crap, don&#x27;t want to admit the problem with the unit. But the strange thing is, the other 3 units I gifted are still working without any problem. Looks like the problem is not with all the units but with some random ones. Now I don&#x27;t know how long this unit is going to last and if it breaks down, whether Philips would send me another one or not. Only time can tell. Also I wonder if Philips is sending reconditioned units (defective units)  as replacements but we would never know about that, would we?</li>
            <li> Had a problem, and needed scaling from Dentist. They suggested the Phillips sonic care!  I used it after my scaling and 4 months later went for a checkup.  The dentist commented on the improvement.  They saw no plaque! Or tartar buildup!  Which will save me money long term.  I like the smaller brush size, floss daily, and started using mouthwash.  Very pleased with results</li>
            <li> Love!! You will notice how much cleaner your teeth feel right away. No cavities!!</li>
            <li> I have owned various electric toothbrushes through the years, but this has been by far my best purchase. Using this toothbrush leaves you with the feeling that you just left the dentists office (in a good way, a clean teeth way, not a just had a root canal way)!</li>
            <li> Wow!  I love this toothbrush.  Words I never thought I would say together, but the clean feeling you get/keep with this toothbrush is incredible.  It takes a little time to figure out the new toothbrushing routine, but once you&#x27;ve figured it out it is easy.  Less brushing, more timing, hitting specific dental \\&quot;regions\\&quot; and the built in timer reminds you when it&#x27;s time to switch.  The UV sanitizer is great as well.  I probably should start using it more often, but this is a purchase that I am continually pleased I made.  The real test of the results will be when I go to the dentist next, but I think they will be happy.  You still have to floss, don&#x27;t forget!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is awsome period.  I like all the different modes it has.  I dont have dental insurance so this brush could save me some money.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with the loose shaft that others are reporting,and fixed it.The problem is with a screw that comes loose where the shaft attaches to the inner body.Here&#x27;s how to fix it.First run the battery down by continuously restarting when it times out.Even after it has run down it will still buzz for a second when turned on.This took me a good 25 minutes.When battery has run down down take a wide bladed flathead screwdiver to the bottom of the handle.Insert the screwdriver so that the blade fits into the slots and with force,turn the bottom counter-clockwise 1/4 turn.With the toothbrush off push down on the shaft until it pushes out the bottom.Carefully pull out the inside body.Do this over a newspaper or a table as the loose parts may fall out.If you look where the shaft attaches to the handle,there is a small screw holding a 1/4 square bracket to the lower part of the shaft.It will be very loose or not attached at all.Take the screw and the bracket off.Use either loctite or nailpolish and lightly coat the threads of the screw.Insert the screw so that the head is on the flat side of the bracket,and the the threads come through the side with the cylindrical cutout.Using a pair of tweezers set the assembly (rounded side pointing towards the top,flat side towards the bottom.)into the gap where it goes.Using a small philips head screwdriver,(a jewelers screwdiver works great)tighten well.Take the inside (the part you just worked on)and line up the button contacts with the buttons on the outer housing.Slowly push in until it clicks into place.Voil&#x60;a ! Your done.Let dry overnight.Now better than new.</li>
            <li> A user of the previous model [[ASIN:B005G1GZKC Philips Sonicare Flexcare Plus Rechargable Sonic Toothbrush - DENTAL PROFESSIONAL MODEL HX 6992/03]] (mine had a UV sanitizer as well), and the Oral-B Triumph [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]], I would rate this Philips as the top of the list for premier automatic/electric toothbrushes.  The UV sanitizer really is effective for killing microorganisms; the debate is whether this is clinically significant.  I look at it like the \\&quot;chicken soup\\&quot; argument - couldn&#x27;t hurt.  The literature is really sparse on whether a sterile toothbrush has significant health effects, but there is a growing body of research that implicates dental bacteria in a variety of systemic diseases and disorders, so a sterile toothbrush is certainly not a negative.  The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action of this brush is superior (in my opinion) for cleaning over the reciprocal action of the Oral-B, and less likely to damage gums and cause sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For brushing effectiveness it works great; the various timer modes really are useful, particularly the \\&quot;Refresh\\&quot; mode for a quick brush, and they stay set after you use them, so you don&#x27;t need to continually select your preferred mode when starting.  Brush heads seem to last a long time and are easy to swap out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;update\\&quot; from the previous FlexCare model is slight, but real.  The different cycles on the handle are easier to understand and set, it comes with a hard, more protective case (previous was soft), and I think the battery lasts longer (time will tell).  It also has a sleeker, less cluttered look on the outside (probably easier to clean/rinse as well).  The rubber on the handle is colored differently, and I suspect will show stains less after long use than the pale green of the earlier FlexCare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;minuses\\&quot; to the new model are that the sterilizer no longer indicates if the brushes have been sterilized at the end of the cycle (previously there was a steady green light):  you have to remember \\&quot;did I turn it on?\\&quot;  The cord is a little more difficult to wind up in the unit to shorten it.  The brush heads appear to be almost identical, except the \\&quot;new\\&quot; heads have a very pale blue set of \\&quot;reminder\\&quot; bristles that are supposed to show generally when they need changing, but are hard to tell apart from the pale green \\&quot;normal\\&quot; bristles (on the standard heads) so I suspect are useless for that purpose; just change the brush when the head looks worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Not really a toothbrush review, but the Philips packaging for this product is horrible - eight spot-welded plastic plugs, at least three or four of which must be cut, and if you use a sharp instrument (knife, scissors) to open it, which you must, you stand a pretty good chance of lacerating either your skin, the family pet or the furniture.  Definitely a worthy candidate for the Oyster Award (given annually by Consumer Reports for difficult-to-open-packages).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a recommended upgrade.  Haven&#x27;t compared it to the Philips DiamondClean [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 Diamondclean Rechargeable Toothbrush]], but the added convenience of the sterilizer (and cheaper price) makes the FlexCare Plus worth considering over the \\&quot;newer\\&quot; Philips, and reading some of the reviews on the design of the Diamondclean I suspect this one is superior.:  you have to remember \\&quot;did I turn it on?\\&quot;  The cord is a little more difficult to wind up in the unit to shorten it.

            <li> For years was using the Braun version of this, but from the first use of the Sonicare, I knew I had been missing out! My teeth feel so much cleaner, the width of the toothbrush head is much smaller and more comfortable. Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush based on reviews and after a week, I&#x27;m definitely glad I followed the advice of my fellow Amazonians. This toothbrush feels incredible - I&#x27;m predisposed to perio issues (thanks mom &amp; dad) but this toothbrush can only make things better - Sonicare has a great rep for a reason. We&#x27;ll see what the dentist says but I&#x27;ve got faith that this toothbrush will make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a Sonicare toothbrush, but they just weren&#x27;t made as good 20 years ago. I was skeptical about ordering this one, when I could have bought a different version for a much lower price here in stores. I saw this one &amp; read all the reviews &amp; like that it has a UV sterilizer &amp; is for people with gum problems like me. The version here in town doesn&#x27;t have the sensitive gum feature. Well, I&#x27;m no longer a skeptic. I love this toothbrush &amp; it is worth the price. The travel case is really nice &amp; I am very happy with the 2 different brush sizes. This is a great toothbrush, gentle on the gums &amp; the massage feels incredible! My gums feel great, no bleeding &amp; my teeth are shining! I will never go back to manual brushing again. December 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update** April 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my toothbrush since the end of 2011 and it still works like the day I first tried it.&lt;br /&gt;My gums no longer bleed &amp; I am still happy using this brush every day. The brush heads are a small enough size to maneuver around inside my mouth &amp; get all the hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;On average I charge this brush once a week for a couple hours and it is good to go. If I don&#x27;t charge once a week I can go at least 2 weeks with just one light on the battery going off.&lt;br /&gt;The UV brush sanitizer unit still works &amp; I use it daily after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t do it leave the brush on the charging base. I put it in the bathroom cabinet and only use the charging unit when the battery is low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great brush &amp; I am still very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product is in a beta phase at best and that is being complimentary. It constantly loses its charge, even when left on the charger. I was told to contact the manufacturer when I first purchased it because it immediately developed problems. I did. Now less than 18 months later, and several handles later as well, Philips are refusing to replace it again. Please do not waste your money. Philips have done a very good marketing job, but that is all it is. The less expensive Sonicare models are just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am interested to know if anyone has found other better electronic tooth brushes. The Philips models are good, but if something is wrong the customer service response is variable depending on who picks up the telephone.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is okay~ I like electric toothbrushes, and it&#x27;s nice that it has a brush cleaner. However, after just 1 year of use, the unit has completely stopped working!! What a rip off!! After spending over $130 on a toothbrush, this is simply unacceptable. I have used Oral B models that lasted for years. I will NOT purchase this again. Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have never felt such a clean after using this product. Very nice! The UV cleaner is a nice touch too!</li>
            <li> I love my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush! My teeth are noticeably whiter and cleaner. My dental hygienist told me she hardly had to do any cleaning because my teeth were in great shape.</li>
            <li> Expensive but very good - I&#x27;d say top notch - at cleaning your teeth!  Long life out of the battery and I like the ultraviolet germ killing treatment.</li>
            <li> We upgraded from some older electric toothbrushes and we were quite surprised with how much better they have gotten. So far we both love the Sonicare, and the addition of the UV sanitizer is nice.   We used to have two brushes, but we are coping with just this one now. The only time it becomes an issue is if someone travels away from the other. In that case we just revert to the old brushes we have.  I do recommend that you dump the stock heads and get these instead, though: [[ASIN:B0052JN8QM Philips Sonicare HX6063/60 Diamondclean Standard Brush Heads, 3 Count]]  They are SO much better.</li>
            <li> BEST TOOTHBRUSH I&#x27;VE EVER OWNED!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great Quality and Great service! Would use them again, and recommend them to all of my friends. Just great overall experience!!!</li>
            <li> I already had been using sonicare prior to this purchase for a few years. The stem was getting loose so I though it was finished. I checked the internet for ratings of another product and found a posting on how to repair this issue after I ordered a new replacement. The repair was right on! Now I keep one in the vacation house instead of bringing it. Good product. Would buy another.</li>
            <li> After having a lower level Sonicare Electric toohbrush for several years and pleased with its performance, I purchased a much more expensive FlexCare model as it was recommended for people with gum issues. Although I liked it initially, after an unacceptablly short amount of time, it started making an unusually loud noise and the wand quit vibrating the bristles. Since the warranty was for only a year and it quit working the month after it expired I assume I am out of luck. I will contact customer service, but am not overly optomistic.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t believe it for my self until i tried it, this sonicare flexcare plus is amazing, this brush have your teeth feeling squeaky clean and have your mouth fresh and wonderful. I automatically bought the whole family sonicare toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It brings in a whole new dimension to brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love electric toothbrushes; this one is great because it comes with a travel case and UV to kill germs. Also, love the timer. Be careful not to touch the ring where the device attaches to the head while you brush or you will get burned, it gets hot. Not hot enough to blister, enough to jolt you though.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I have used. I liked it a lot but to be honest I gave it up since I travel so much. I got tired of lugging all the stuff around and I am a big fan of saving space so just a plain tooth brush works the best for me on the go.</li>
            <li> THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A $20 COUPON FOR THIS PRODUCT. CANNOT FIND HOW TO ACCESS IT .COULD HAVE BOUGHT  THIS IN WALLGREENS FOR THE SAME PRICE. OTHERWISE THE PRODUCT IS FINE</li>
            <li> I had one 20 years ago....and loved it.  technology has came a long ways...Love this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;going to purchase one for my husband and kids too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a previous version of this product and truly enjoyed it, the only discourse I have, it fail prematurely. Other than that this is only product I will ever use because of this consistent results.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an older model of the same brand.  The improvement was quite apparent. The unit worked as advertized and was,in fact, better than I expected. The addition of a way to sanitize the tooth brush after each use was  excellent.  I recommend this Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare tooth brush system.</li>
            <li> Long time owner of this brand and product type.  This flexcare plus brush is a HUGE improvement over earlir models in ease of use, feel, maneurverability, Very satisfied with product.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Love the sonicare toothbrush, this is my first electric toothbrush and it truly is a great product for getting your teeth clean!!</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I have used an electric toothbrush. Unlike spinning around in circles or squirting a squirt gun in your mouth this one does the job. It makes your teeth feel like the difference of washing your car or washing and WAXING your car. I was afraid I would not be able to hear the beeping signal at the time to change, however, It seems it tends to hiccup at the intervals that need to rotate your location and shut down when time is up. No bleeding to sensitive gums. The higher vibration takes some adjustment but it will tickle you pink, at the results. Highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> After almost 3 years of use my toothbrush is dead and out of warranty. I love this toothbrush and my gums have never been better. However, once they die you can&#x27;t fix them. So expect to pay $50-$100 per year to brush your teeth. Not sure if it is worth it to buy another one.</li>
            <li> This product does what my dentist said it should.  It is a bit bulky making it hard to handle sometimes.  If you don&#x27;t brush in the proper direction, your gums can become sore.  However, when used correctly, my mouth feels like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> My dental tech complained about my tea stained teeth during my 2X a year cleanings, even tho I brushed 2X a day and felt I was being pretty thorough.  After using this, albeit irregularly, for a month, she commented on the amazing difference.  Still switch back and forth between this and hand brushing (when I&#x27;m in a hurry), but will never go back to hand brushing alone.  And it holds a charge for months.  Didn&#x27;t need the separate charger.  Just use the charger base with the UV disinfecting module.</li>
            <li> I have owned the Sonicare HX6972 for a couple years now.  I LOVE the way it makes my teeth feel, it&#x27;s 100X better than a manual toothbrush and significantly better than the old Sonicare design with the screw on replacement heads.  I typically only use the clean cycle, and it&#x27;s nice that it beeps at you to remind you which section you&#x27;re supposed to be brushing but I usually end up ignoring that and doing my own thing.  I would definitely recommend buying it. 5 stars on how it brushes and Panasonic Customer Service, 1 star removed because of reliability issues and the design that allows gunk to collect between the brush head and the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Keeps teeth significantly cleaner than manual brushing (I&#x27;ve been brushing with a manual brush - see cons - for a couple months and had a 6th month cleaning in which the hygienist commented on some extra scale build up, usually they&#x27;re in and out of there in no time with no complaints when I&#x27;ve been brushing with the Sonicare and flossing occasionally)&lt;br /&gt;+ Also seems to keep gums less irritated, I noticed a significant increase in irritation when going back to the manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;+ Has the sanitizing option for the toothbrush head - big improvement over previous versions&lt;br /&gt;+ Has lots of neat features for different brushing modes so if you&#x27;re obsessed with oral hygiene you can get your fix in multiple ways&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with a small base for when you&#x27;re traveling, that way you can take your toothbrush on all your travels without packing the huge base with the sanitizer in it, worked great without a current converter when I took it to Australia.&lt;br /&gt;+ Panasonic customer service is top notch. I recently had to get my handle replaced (see the cons) and they sent me a new one, no questions asked that arrived within a week of me sending them my receipt.  The customer service was really polite on the phone, I got an email response confirming they had received my receipt within 5 minutes of me emailing it to them and they didn&#x27;t make me send back the defective unit before replacing it.  They also included a shipping label to send back the defective unit on their dime for proper recycling (gold star for being green friendly assuming they actually recycle it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The unit stopped working after about 20 months.  It had the ghost behavior that some of the other reviewers have described, meaning that it would turn itself on while on the charger at random times.  The malfunctions started out as the unit turning off prior to the full 2 minute brush cycle, and beeping at intervals other than 30s.  Then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all unless it was on the charger, in which case it wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  Not great.  So I eventually called customer service and had the fantastic experience I mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;- There is a small gap between the brush head and the base that gets a lot of gross gunk in it.  You have to take off the brush head and rinse daily to make sure that this doesn&#x27;t turn into something nasty (worst case: mold) inside your toothbrush.  Probably isn&#x27;t a problem if you&#x27;re sanitizing the head once a day but if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t pull the head off for a week or so (see the light comments below) be prepared for some pretty gnarly stuff in there.  Still better than the old design which had a giant well under the brush head and two small holes leading into that well so that the well collected all sorts of grossness in it.&lt;br /&gt;- The light, oh the light.  This unit has a pulsing blue light when the sanitizer is on which can light up an entire room at night.  If your bathroom is like mine and has any opening into your bedroom you are going to hate this sanitizer.  It&#x27;s bright enough to be a night light and more (I think you could probably use it for a lighthouse light to guide ships to your bathroom on a foggy night).  Even the green bars that show the charge level are pretty bright.  I usually leave mine off the charger unless the battery is dead and do any charging/sanitizing during the day when I&#x27;m not trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush.  It lasted 3 years and 8 months.  The rubber ring that seals the top has apparently deteriorated over time and allowed water to enter the inside of the unit. It still charges, just won&#x27;t turn on anymore despite the buttons and lights working (vibes for a split second and quits).  It worked really well until now. While it lasted quite a while, I&#x27;m not sure I would buy again.  I was expecting to get 5 years out of it, otherwise it&#x27;s pretty expensive to be replacing more often.</li>
            <li> It was a good brush while it worked, but entirely too expensive. I understand it&#x27;s important to take care of our teeth, but this brush lasted 2 1/2 yrs. and cost about $400. (original unit, plus replacement heads). I&#x27;m now looking at powered brushes for under $20. that can be tossed when they eventually fail. I figure at that price I can get 20+ yrs. out of them for $400.</li>
            <li> Works well on its own, but I received my set with foreign wall plugs, and one foreign to US travel plug (or whatever it is called). Works the way it should, except for the electricity plug.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is absolutely fantastic and definitely goes along with the mission of encouraging people to brush their teeth. For those suffering from brushing too hard, this toothbrush is sincerely a must-have.</li>
            <li> I never liked electric toothbrushes because my teeth never felt clean afterward. That isn&#x27;t a problem with this toothbrush. Always smooth as glass. The only minor quibble I guess might be the location of the power button. I inadvertently pressed it a couple of times while brushing until I got used to it. I researched quite a bit before deciding on this model. Excellent quality and got an extra six months on the warranty for free by registering online. A wonderful product. Just buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. leaves your teeth feeling very clean! If you want clean and whiter teeth, try this.</li>
            <li> Philips as always is a great product and the features of this model are worth the extra money over the base model.  Lots of benefits and works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy from K Wave (the seller) again.  This product was made for the KOREAN market with labeling in both Korean and English.  What really irks me is that this outfit puts two plug adapters into the box to make it compatible with US outlets!  The price was $10 less than the Amazon easy open package.  K Wave should have noted that this was a Korean Market version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely spend the extra $10 to get a US model and hassle free packaging.  It was a fight to get the until out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I admit, it took me years to finally break down and buy one of these. I could never bring myself to spend so much on a toothbrush. Now that I have this, I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! My teeth feel extremely clean after each session as if I just had them professionally done. The 2 minute timer is a plus cause you know each set of teeth are getting equal amount of brushing. Since using this, I hardly notice any food coming out when I floss because it removes most of it for you already.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works fantastic. I had a different type of battery operated toothbrush but I hardly ever used it. It didn&#x27;t work well and was just not the same quality as this one. This Sonicare toothbrush looks and works extremely well. I also use a waterpik (can&#x27;t think of the brand at the moment) along with the Sonicare and it had really done a great job at keeping my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush went kaput just over 2 years which makes it ineligible for the warranty. I would expect a $140 toothbrush to last longer. I got no help from customer service except for an offer of 15% off my next purchase. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> This product has already made a big difference in my teeth and gum care.  The ultrasound speed is amazing, yet gentle.  a real winner!</li>
            <li> Purchased to place a very old original version of the Sonicare.  New one is really nice, works well and especially like the built in head clear. Hoping this new one not only helps keep teeth cleaner, but helps us stay healthier by keeping the brush heads cleaner.</li>
            <li> Great product. No problems, works wonderfully. Teeth feel much cleaner than manual toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use the cleaning device much, but still nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Product was purchased to help with brushing time and efficiency.  Dentist likes the result.  Brushing longer with better results.  Would purchase again or recommend.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that this product has made some improvements with a bunch of Cleaning modes to use.  It comes with a sanitizer with a UV light bulb that you can sanitize the brush heads inside this little door.  It comes with a sturdy compact case for travel.</li>
            <li> I like the UV brush head Sanitizer. I only use the UV light once a week to clean the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last forever. I only charge it once every two week. I am not sure if I should let it sit on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I tried to use the brush to massage my gum and tongue... Feels funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a dying agent from my dentist (I forgot what it&#x27;s dying....plaque maybe?) before and after the brushing my teeth. I am surprised this tooth brush did a decent job on removing all the plaque or color or dye... whatever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the same experiment on the original toothbrush.... Well... I end up use this toothbrush to clean my teeth up after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it pricey? Well... Your teeth are supposed to follow you for life... This toothbrush will give you a decent check mark when you see your dentist next time. The bottom line... You will fine it worth every penny that you spend on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the sonicare tooth brush. No complaints at all. However, beware that the 2 year warranty does not cover the charger, which in my case broke down just 10 days before the end of the warranty. The heads are replaceable, so what is the point of the warranty? Real customer service glitch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already returned this toothbrush twice because it has lost power. At the high cost of the toothbrush itself and the expensive replacement heads...I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
            <li> There are very few products that I can say I actually love, but this is a product I truly love. This is the third Flexcare Sonicare toothbrush I have had. I fully expect to purchase another one when this eventually wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that have never used a Sonicare toothbrush before, it does take a little getting used to. But once you get used to it, there really isn&#x27;t anything better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare model, is the one I like best and for a person that travels, it&#x27;s really great.  This particular model, is the Flaxcare+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UV Sanitizer: I cannot give a clinical evaluation of the sanitizer, however I can say ever since I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush with the sanitizer I haven&#x27;t been sick nearly as often. This may not truly mean much, but I do take comfort in the fact that I have the option of killing germs off if I want to sanitize the toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my first flex care, I would remove the head and sanitize it every night. My rough handling of the toothbrush when doing this, may have caused some problems and it eventually stopped working. With this model, I tend to remove the brush head once every couple of nights. I am a bit more careful when pulling it off, as you do have to tug it firmly, and it seems to be doing quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel Case: I travel, and when I do I bring this toothbrush with me. Previously, Phillips provided a soft case with the brush. This one comes with a hard case, which I really really appreciate. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting banged up in my suitcase or travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Life: In terms of battery life, the previous models would last approximately 2 weeks. I still find, that this one lasts around two weeks as well (maybe a bit longer). It says it can last up to three weeks, however my case I&#x27;m using the standard cleaning mode versus the other modes the brush collapse. I believe you might get better battery life using some of the other modes the brush possesses, so Phillipsis not misleading anyone with battery life claims. As always, your mileage may vary based on your use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that being able to travel without having to bring a power cord is great.  I went to Europe twice with this brush and not having to worry about bringing a charger and dealing with odd international outlets was a huge plus.  It lasted the 2 weeks I was there without issue.  Aside from that, the worst case scenario, if you do drain the battery fully, is that it becomes \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; vs. a \\&quot;Sonicare Toothbrush\\&quot;, until charged again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Options: There are a couple different brush head types that you can use with this particular model, I tend to use the standard longer brushes. Some may like to use the short brush heads that they offer, but I find it doesn&#x27;t make sense to use the smaller heads unless you have a specific need for them. This brush also offers a few brushing modes so that you can select what suits you best. As I&#x27;ve said, I use the clean mode almost all the time. The sensitive mode is okay, even though I consider myself to have sensitive teeth, I didn&#x27;t find it necessary to use that particular mode. Once I got used to the brush, the cleaning mode was absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What My Dentist Says: Excellent. That&#x27;s the word I hear. I get regular checkups, and I&#x27;ve had no degradation in my teeth or any of the work that I&#x27;ve had previously done since I began using this product. I have traditionally been a firm brusher, putting a bit more pressure on the brush than necessary, but I don&#x27;t find myself being that way with this brush.  I feel it is doing the work for me so I treat my teeth a bit better, and unconsciously so. It&#x27;s a truly great product.</li>
            <li> This replaced our old Sonicare and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;No more mold collecting in the base in this new design.</li>
            <li> I had gum issues and this toothbrush not only helps me get to the hard to get places, but also messages my gums...</li>
            <li> This was definitely a great buy.  The &amp;#34;Cadillac&amp;#34; of electric tooth brushes.  The brush heads are typically the same price as an online purchase so replacements can quickly be picked up when necessary.</li>
            <li> This has a nice timer that gets me to brush longer. Went for my dental checkup and the dental girl worker scraped my teeth less than I ever had.  In my estimation, this equates to a successful product.  I really don&#x27;t care about any of the &#x27;modes&#x27;.  All I need it to do is vibrate for two minutes. (surprisingly that&#x27;s the second time I&#x27;ve used that sentence today.)</li>
            <li> This is the best sonicare brush that I have owned. The technology has come a long way since i purchased my original brush 10 years ago. I like the Ultra violet cleaning. I use all of the settings. The brushes seem to wear out more quickly so I recommend purchasing extra heads.</li>
            <li> Honest to goodness the BEST toothbrush on the market today. I don&#x27;t care if you have dental problems or just want to prevent caries...BUY IT! Expensive as hell, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> works awesome! purchased this to help with gum quality. doing its job so far. the brush heads are a bit pricey, but the quality of the brush outweighs the cost of replacement heads!</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth very smooth and clean; keeps my gums healthy. The toothbrush stays charged a long time and I&#x27;ve been able to use it for a full week before on a trip when I&#x27;ve forgotten to pack the travel charger. I like the hard travel case, too, and the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this toothbrush takes care of all areas in my mouth without much effort.  Love the fact that it has a travel charger that I can use on the go.</li>
            <li> This is my third Phillips Sonicare.  Each one I&#x27;ve had has been an &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; over the last.  Am very pleased with it.  Will always use the Sonicar brand.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t LOVE it is because of the cost of those replacement heads.  They are really expensive, and I never, ever see any special deals on them, which would be nice.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush everyone should use this. I also like the idea of being able to sanitize your brush!</li>
            <li> I should have got the platinum.  I read some reviews on Amazon that led me to buy this one.  The Platinum didn&#x27;t have the UV thing for putting the brush heads in to kill bacteria and I guess the glass cup it sits in can get dirty.  That being said, I rarely use the UV thing and the charger can get wiped off.  I do like the platinum brush heads better and they fit on this toothbrush too so that is good.  I never use the extra settings either.  If I were to purchase again I&#x27;d either go for the platinum or down a model to one that still used the same brush heads but doesn&#x27;t have the features that you probably will use once.  Still, I I like the Sonicare line and have been using them for about 5 or more years now. I highly recommend one model or the other.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these Philips and both times has failed sooner than I would like.  For this kind of money, I wish could get at least five years of service of it.  Both times, the motor seemed have the issue of not stopping and pressing the power button having no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I get this again, I&#x27;ll probably get a much cheaper, disposable model.</li>
            <li> I used to have an older model of Sonicare tooth brush and LOVED it.  It also lasted for a long time.  BUT - despite all the negative reviews on this new model, I wanted to have the latest and the greatest, so I ignored the input and purchased this unit.  IT&#x27;s now nearly a year post purchase and the tooth brush stopped working.  You click the button, it makes a small noise and that&#x27;s it.  The issue occurred all of a sudden as last night I went to brush my teeth. A waste of ~$150 bucks...  Would not recommend purchasing, especially if you are under the same impression as I was that Sonicare is everlasting (given older products).</li>
            <li> I never realized you could get that dentist level of clean at home until I tried the Philips Sonicare. This is a terrific tool to have for daily use. It has a 30 second timer for each section of your teeth for a full two minutes of cleaning. This toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling super clean and your breath fresher. The different levels for your gums is terrific. My dentist will be very happy to see me next go round. I can&#x27;t see me ever going back to manual brushing!</li>
            <li> good product, does what it is designed to do. i like the different settings. i have very sensitive teeth and gums and it took some getting used to but now i like it very much</li>
            <li> Once I had a sonicare toothbrush I cannot go back to a regular toohbrush also since my dentist has seen better results since using.  My new one is even better than the first one and it pays off in the long run.</li>
            <li> It does seem to clean teeth more thoroughly. My mouth feels clean after using both the sensitive and massage options- a total of 4 min. I am waiting to see my hygienist in February to see if she feels my hygiene has improved.</li>
            <li> Best purchase ever.  For the first time, my dentist didn&#x27;t find any cavities.  I brushed and flossed excatly like I should but somehow I could never avoid needing something fixed until I got this brush.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever, i highly recommend it, cleans well and is very powerful with a lot of features. it cleans excellently and the UV cleaner is a nice added feature</li>
            <li> This item broke under normal use. Maybe I brush my teeth too hard? It did seem to work well at first, but can no longer use.</li>
            <li> For the actual toothbrush I would give it 5 stars for ease of use, features, and ability to clean teeth.  I have been using various Sonicare models since 2003 and this is definitely the best designed in terms of looks, features, and slim design.  I love that it has a built in UV brush head sanitizer and I like that the toothbrush can last up to 2 weeks on a single, full charge.  Now, the one big complaint with resulted in the 4 stars.  This is actually the 2nd FlexCare model I have had.  The first one broke after about a year, similar to another person&#x27;s review.  The tip (where the brush heads connect to the toothbrush) came loose and started to make a loud noise and rattling around.  This seems to be a slight design flaw with this model.  There is a newer Sonicare Toothbrush available (The DiamondClean) and it is possible they fixed the issue in that model.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush. Aside from the technical jargon and scientific proof i can say that this makes brushing fun. And if its fun your more likely to do it. Also the UV light is a pretty cool gimmick.</li>
            <li> After having the product for around a year, the toothbrush part of the unit started turning itself on. It was under warranty so I called the company about the problem. The gentleman I spoke to in customer service was wonderful and the exchange process was very easy. I missed using the toothbrush for the short time it took to receive the new one. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Worth the price.  If you think this might be what you&#x27;re looking for today, give it a try.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing! A little on the expensive side but it definitely makes up for it by lasting long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for well over a year now and everything is working perfectly. (I even dropped it a few time on tile floor) If you are looking for a long term toothbrush that you can share with other people, look no further!</li>
            <li> What can i say about this but it is the best electric toothbrush that i have ever tried.  I have tried my friends toothbrush and&lt;br /&gt;my sister&#x27;s.  Also my brother&#x27;s girlfriend.  But their&#x27;s did not make my teeth feel as clean as this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;It is so nice not to have to sneak in a good brush while at the neighbor&#x27;s house.  I love having my own!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after my last Sonicare died.  That Sonicare was wonderful - long lasting, thorough.  A wonderful device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Flex Care 2.  Looked good, seemed to work. A $140 dollar winner  But then, after less that one month post purchase, we went on vacation for a month, leaving the base unit behind, taking only the travel charger with us.  When we returned home, the base unit, with Sanitizer, would not turn on.  The push button \\&quot;switch\\&quot; only worked intermittently and would not stay on for a full sanitizing cycle, let alone a recharge.  We contacted the Phillips customer service and they walked us through the tier one fixes; check the bulb, check the switch - the whole deal, and nothing helped.  This was on February 28, 2012.  They were very kind and helpful and allowed that they would ship a new unit along with a return shipping label (for the broken unit) immediately.  We should watch out Email for a confirmation, upon shipping, within two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later, we called back and they advised the product is on back order but would be shipped within two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later, no product, no contact, so we called back.  New customer service agent who sadly announced, the product is on back order, but would be in and shipped ... in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later, we called again - no product available, but it would be in and shipped ... in two weeks.  At this point, we requested our money back and were informed that isn&#x27;t possible.  The agent said that this time, for sure, the new unit would be available and shipped by April 23.  We said we didn&#x27;t believe it and just wanted our money ($148) back.  The agent said he was sorry, but there was nothing more he could do and severed the connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now stuck with a piece of junk toothbrush and no apparent chance of collecting on the guarantee.  There is no way to get it repaired (the company says no - they will only replace it).  The item has been discontinued and the warranty is being ignored.  We are out $148 and have a minimally useful toothbrush system.  And have no indication that things will get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our third and final Phillips Sonicare System.  I don&#x27;t know what has happened, but it is no longer the product it used to be.  There its no customer support and no recourse.  We are stuck with junk and cannot get it fixed.  Our only hope is that we can warn you folks, before you make the same costly blunder we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4-13-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, we received a new (or refurbished) \\&quot;sanitizing unit\\&quot; and recharger for our defective Sonicare Flexcare+  Also enclosed was a prepaid return FedEx address label, to return the defective unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, this ends our saga.  We still won&#x27;t be purchasing another anytime in the future, but it is somewhat reassuring to have actually had the guarantee fulfilled.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush while it lasted. 7 months after purchase the settings button fell out, allowing water into the case. It died a noisy death last night, randomly turning on in the middle of the night and disturbing family and pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend buying a low-end model that has fewer functions for this reason - fewer things to break. You will never use all the advanced features, most likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - the quad timer function stopped working about 1 month after purchase. Attempts to turn it back on per the doc failed.</li>
            <li> enjoy the sanitation uv light. I went on a trip and brought along my travel charger just in case but never used it for 17 days.</li>
            <li> Rarely get cavities during Dental visit, still lovin this product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dentist - happy with the many choices you have to brush your teeth.  It was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had this electric toothbrush for about 6 months, then it broke. Something came loose inside the handle, and it would make a lot of noise, but not do it&#x27;s thing anymore. My friend had an extra one she got at Costco (Costco sells them in pairs), so she gave me her brand new extra one. That one lasted about 6 months before it did the same thing. The brushes seem to last just fine, but theres something in the body of that mechanism that breaks a bit too easily. It was nice while it lasted though, so I won&#x27;t rate it a 1. If it lasted like it should, say a minimum of 2 years, I&#x27;d give it 4-5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not obsessive about oral hygiene.  I brush my teeth twice a day, and try to avoid going to the dentist as long as humanly possible.  But when my Oral B electric toothbrush started to get old, I asked around about what other people used.  Hands-down the recommendation was the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this version.  And a package of the Diamond brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really IS awesome.  FAR better than my old Oral B. My teeth feel FAR cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a small thing, what electric toothbrush to get.  But, if you&#x27;re going to get one, you might as well get a good one, right?  This one works great, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I look forward to brushing with this thing. My teeth are noticeably whiter and my gums are incredibly healthier. I&#x27;ve owned this toothbrush for a couple of months and am super impressed with it. I can&#x27;t wait to see my dentist next week. He is going to be surprised. The timing feature where it vibrates to tell you to move to the next quadrant is a great feature. I&#x27;m brushing longer because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it with me on my vacation for a week and didn&#x27;t bring the charger. It lasted just fine and looked like it would have gone another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the disinfecting UV station with it. The inside mount for the brushes pops in and out easily so it can be washed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A downside is that the brushes are stupidly expensive. I bought some generic ones cheaper, but plan to pick up some of the name brand to really see if there is a difference.</li>
            <li> Bought 10/20/10 . . . died 03/10/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result is the head flaking out, vibrating out of sync.  The metal head came out of the base . . . just wasn&#x27;t usable anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just &#x27;next day&#x27; bought another one from Amazon, hoping the best . . . what is it that they say about &amp;#34;insanity&amp;#34; . . . it&#x27;s the process of doing the same thing over and over again, expecting something different . . . when the next one dies, I&#x27;ll update . . .</li>
            <li> I actually had a cleaning yesterday.  I have only been using the FlexCare+ for 6 weeks and have not changed anything else, e.g. daily flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist was speechless and asked me what changes had happened in my routine.  I told her about the only change, she brought the dentist in, and we all marveled about my gum health, decreased sensitivity, lack of plaque, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recommendation was from this skeptical hygienist, and I was reluctant to spend the money.  This is SO worth every penny paid!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the happiest product review that I have ever had the pleasure to write.</li>
            <li> No complaints about this quality product.</li>
            <li> 5 years later, and still going strong.  We bought this in December 2009.  It still works great!  My husband and I both use it, we each have our own head (he uses the grey band, I always get dark blue).  On the few trips we have had to take away from home, it holds a charge for a nice long time.  The travel case that comes with it is great too, and I love the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Nice replacement for my 10 year old sonic care. I love it. My mouth feels extra clean after using this and I love the self cleaning feature</li>
            <li> We bought ours around March 2011. In January the UltraViolet light quit working.  I checked the bulb and it was fine. I called Phillips warranty service and they had me do all the things I had already done to test it, but being in IT I went ahead and did them again. Warranty repair said that they did not have any base units in stock but would send me one in 4 to 5 weeks. Sure enough about a month later we got a package. It was the handle, not the base unit with the UltraViolet light and it wasn&#x27;t even the right model of toothbrush handle.  I called warranty service again. They apologized and gave me a return address to send the toothbrush handle back and explained that they were currently out of stock on the base unit. After another month we got the base unit and it worked fine for about 2 months.  The UltraViolet light stopped working again!  By now, it is out of warranty.  I looked at the door and in the upper left there is a tab that sticks out.  The tab goes into a slot on the base which activates a micro switch. I stuck the end of the lever for some nail clippers into the opening and heard a click. The light now works.</li>
            <li> This item was sent to me via Amazon AFTER the first one was stolen on delivery. Amazon sent it again to me FREE OF CHARGE! IMPRESSIVE!  The tooth brush is totally AWESOME! Expensive but you get what you pay for. Its like a toothbrush for Darth Vader. Very techy but easy to operate and feels good on the gums and teeth which is the most important thing. I also  like that each setting (settings for gum and teeth) is roughly a two minute brush by default. I recommend this sonicare if you want to spend the money. I have been told it should last for a few years. My dentist also sells them at his office which tells me its a reputable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied customer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IA</li>
            <li> Stopped charging within a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have had good results unplugging the chargers for a period of time to reset them. I did this for a while, but even that stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worked with electronics quite a bit (a hobby), and I understand inductive charging systems. I have no idea how an issue like this could arise from a company that has been using inductive chargers for a long time. If this is the level of engineering I can expect from Philips, I don&#x27;t foresee buying any products from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the quality of the batteries being used (NiMH), I have to wonder if failure is part of their business model.</li>
            <li> This is my second experience with the Sonicare line and I&#x27;m even more pleases with the Flex Care Plus.  I had an earlier model (Essence, I think) that would get really gross after a while (deposits under the screw-on portion).  But this line satisfies my neat-freakness and does a great job cleaning, as usual.  One bothersome thing is that the UV sanitizer does not also dry the brush(es) so your brush head(s) stays wet for quite some time in a closed environment.  It would be great if the door could pop open after the sanitizing was done to allow the brushes to dry naturally. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush to replace my Sonicare Elite. This has far more options than the previous model I owned. The battery seems to be good at this point.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr. old has received an EXCELLENT bill of dental health since I purchased this toothbrush January 22, 2011.  He is at a stage where I have to force him to do anything concerning hygiene.  With this toothbrush I only had to demand that he \\&quot;Use it until it turns off\\&quot; which, to him takes FOREVER.  This alone is enough for it to earn five stars from me.  I have personally noticed how clean my teeth get.  There used to be a commercial where the woman would lick her teeth and they were so clean they would squeak.  I do not remember what it was for but that is how clean my teeth felt.  I did attempt it, but I did not hear anything :P.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What prompted me to write this review is the warranty.  As I said before I purchased it January 2011.  Yesterday morning it would not turn on.  Only the first charging bar would blink, normally the first two are lit up while the third one flashes.  I was not sure if it lost charge from being left off the base the night before.  We normally put it back after every use and I had picked it up from the base but someone else could have noticed it was off the base and replaced it.  Anyway, I figured I would leave it on the base and it would be charged by the time I got home, it was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was preparing to order a new unit today when I thought to check the Sonicare website to see it the warranty was still active.  After registering the unit, I found out that the warranty was valid until 8/2013.  I called the number for customer service and got a friendly rep.  What really surprised me at how hassle free the process was.  I told her my issue, gave her my serial number, and an order for a new unit was place free of charge.  I was fully prepared to replace the unit at cost.  I had figured that a year and a half was the lifespan of the product, it does receive daily use from three people.  Philips gets five stars for service and quality.</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended a Sonicare toothbrush for my past two routine visits.  The cost had always been a deterrent as I couldn&#x27;t believe it would make that big a difference vs manual brushing.  After a month of use, I am a believer.  I have a problem with plaque buildup and this toothbrush does a great job of plaque removal.  This toothbrush has a gum massage and tooth/gum feature that I am using regularly.  I am eager to see if my gums improve at my next routine visit. I plan to post a review after my next dental visit with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. After using it a week, I noticed my teeth got whiter! Great purchase, I love it. I still have a hard time using it and not drooling like an idiot, but I&#x27;ll get the hang of it soon, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I have use the Philips Sonicare brushes for several years now but when the previous older model began to have battery issues I decided to purchase this one.  WOW what a difference!  My dental hygenist recommended this newer model and it has made such a difference.  I have used all the features and each one does what it is advertised to do.  The sanitizer is great for when you want and bacteria free brush, which should be used at least once a week. I love the really clean feeling I get after brushing.  If you are looking for a really great toothbrush and sanitizing features, then this is the model you want and need.  Thanks Philips for a Super product! Thanks to Amazon for getting it shipped so quickly.</li>
            <li> Sonicare always has really good electric toothbrushes! I really enjoyed this toothbrush, which I use daily. The sanitizer is great and allows me and my husband to sanitize both our toothbrushes as the same time. I also like that it has a variety of settings to allow me to clean my tongue and massage my gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d given up on electric toothbrushes for awhile but I&#x27;m glad I desided to try them again. I really like how it cleans itself.</li>
            <li> Really like this tooth brush and the sanitizer feature is a real plus.  I have used Sonicare tooth brushes for years and this is the best model so far.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the timer. It helps me remember to brush for at least two minutes.  The replacement heads are very expensive though.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my daughter. She really like it and says it work very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.  I like that it has a short timer and a 2 minute times.  It has really improved my teeth.  This is my third brush.  I guess I&#x27;m hard on them.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with this item.  My teeth feel much, much cleaner than they were when I used a manual toothbrush.  I had used an earlier version of the Sonicare years ago, and was pleased with it, but stopped using it due to sensitivity.  I have been using this new FlexCare Plus for a month, and have no problems with sensitivity.  Also, I love the UV cleaning chamber.</li>
            <li> This product gives your mouth a real fresh feeling. I like the variety of settings to choose from. The positive reviews made me choose this brand and model over competitors.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with this purchase and purchase experience! Cary</li>
            <li> [For full disclosure, I am actually evaluating the \\&quot;PROFESSIONAL\\&quot; HX6992/10, obtained from my dentist.  It appears that the main difference between the units is about $57.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used my unit for a couple of years and from the very beginning, my checkups have shown definite improvements.  However, during that same time, I have had to obtain three new handles, all for the same reason:  the metal pin holding the brush on came out. Fortunately, each time the handle was replaced under warranty, but just for the inconvenience, I had to deduct a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work-around solution is simple: put the brush on carefully, lubricating with water if it seems a little too tight, and making sure not to try to push it all the way to the top of the handle (there is supposed to be a small gap).  Then, DON&#x27;T REMOVE THE BRUSH until you plan to replace it with a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone else in your household needs to use the brush?  Buy a second unit, or at least another handle.  The battery charge is ample enough to rotate several handles on one charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to sanitize the brush?  Run the brush a few seconds in a half-cap of antiseptic mouthwash.  I have not seen any data on the effectiveness of the ultraviolet light on germs on the brushes, especially at the base of the bristles where they would likely to grow, but I am pretty sure that any intensity strong enough to kill germs aren&#x27;t doing anything to help to the longevity of the nylon brushes.  Besides, we have used \\&quot;unsanitized\\&quot; toothbrushes for generations, and I don&#x27;t recall any pandemics blamed on the practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afraid of other contamination or damage in the bathroom environment?  Keep the bristles covered with the plastic cap that came with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, now that we have resolved the issue of a weak handle, as well as uv bulb burn-out issues others have reported, one may ask \\&quot;if we are not going to use the sanitizer, why pay for it?  Why not go to a cheaper system? \\&quot; And those are valid questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this brush as more modes than most, but are they really necessary?  Gum Care is actually an extended Clean.  How tough is it to just push the button again at the end of the two minute Clean cycle?  Refresh is a shortened Clean.  I guess you can figure how to handle that...  The bottom line is that most of these modes are just modifications of others, much like all those \\&quot;cycles\\&quot; found on most washing machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, other systems are available with a much smaller base with toothbrushes whose Clean cycle works just as well.  However, if you find that your dentist or hygienist can sell you this unit for a hundred bucks, you might find it hard to beat that price a smaller unit.d those are valid questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this brush as more modes than most, but are they really necessary?

            <li> This is one of the best electric toothbrushes out there, but the product quality is not so good anymore. It works great for the first few months and then begins to lose its mojo. Without fail for the past three years I&#x27;ve had to replace this after a year.  I&#x27;ve read reviews of people who had theirs for 10-11 years before replacing..well they don&#x27;t make them like they used to. Philips needs to work on the internal quality of their brushes and stop being so cheap about it. But when the time comes I do replace it, because when it woks it works really well (and I love the UV sanitizer, won&#x27;t buy a model that doesn&#x27;t have this feature). My dental hygienist raves on the good job I am doing.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for your teeth! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is the best.  The only thing I see that is happening over time is the full charge is lasting less than a week.  The only con is that the brush heads are expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> It gives a very good clean feeling after every clean. I also really like the sanitizer function for the heads.</li>
            <li> Much better than Oral B version that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  I bought it after reading rave reviews on a Japanese consumer products review magazine - that Philips beats Oral B hands down....and it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this I bought the Diamond Care version to for travel - love the travel case on that one....</li>
            <li> I have used Braun for years and my dentist has always been impressed with my oral health.  But getting older I decided to really kick it up a notch and went for the Sonicare.  After 6 months of use I could tell that my teeth just felt cleaner.  But when my hygienist saw the results she said she had almost no work to do to clean my teeth.  A believer!</li>
            <li> the best tooth brush i have ever used i wouldnt trade it in for another one and would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Better than anticipated! It&#x27;s like having a live-in dentist.&lt;br /&gt;We would totally recommend it - now need to get one for the kid.</li>
            <li> Has anyone else noticed this company has reduced the size of replacement heads by half.The last batch of heads I purchased from Costco, I returned immediately,due to loose bristles that actually came off with the FIRST use! Costco replaced the package with a new batch, I think there&#x27;s 5 to a package. I got down to the 3rd brush and the same thing happened.I called the company and they sent 2 replacement heads half the size of the previous brushes.Okay so they tried to put things right but That just means these new heads will get twice the workout. This company seems intent on increasing their profit anyway they can. I have used this product since it came on the market. It&#x27;s always been the pricier way to dental hygiene, but now the consumer is getting  inferior manufacturing and half the size of the original product,and still paying the original higher cost.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic.  After using this toothbrush, I felt like I just walked out of the dentist&#x27;s office. My teeth were significantly whiter in 2 minutes than they were in 10 minutes with a manual toothbrush. Coffee stains are no match for the Sonicare.   This was a luxury purchase when I bought it while in school. It was, and continue to be, one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for myself.    UPDATE [1/27/13]: Still going strong!! Everything is still working great!!  UPDATE [1/1/17]: I am amazed that it has held up for this long. Still great, very reliable.</li>
            <li> Has anyone found a good supplier for the bulbs that fit into the UV compartment? That is the most frustrating part of this device. You would think that these bulbs would be available at a local store such as Target or Walmart, but no. In fact, I don&#x27;t think Phillips sells them.</li>
            <li> My wife has used Philips Sonicare in the past and had encouraged me to give it a try. I eventually did and I think it works extremely well. Thoroughly brushes your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the price is too high and probably limiting access to more people; it was one of the main objections to me purchasing it earlier.</li>
            <li> I used the Flexcare for 3 years before the seals broke on it and it died due to water in the case. The Flexcare plus is somewhat better designed than the Flexcare so I feel like I updated a little bit but nothing major. The case looks a little better and the sanitzer door no longer has a button to open the door which is one less thing to get dirty you just pull to open now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare and Flexcare plus both do a great job cleaning so I don&#x27;t see any difference in that area. I would recommend either model.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush as a replacement for single toothbrush without UV.  I love it!!!  Encouraged hubby to try it but he can&#x27;t conform.  I am too an aggressive brusher to not use it.  IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I hate dentists and will do anything to improve my dental health. It took some time to get used to using it without making a spit mess and it tickled my behind teeth. I love the timer that tells you when to change positions and I like the cleaner. I hate the whole idea but my mouth does feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for three years. Its a good brush and has performed perfectly until about a few weeks ago. It started to decrease in its brushing power, and after trying a new brush head and determining that it wasn&#x27;t the problem, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that its the actual brush that is having these problems and that its simply on its last legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m well outside the 2 year warranty so I&#x27;ll be re-buying a Sonicare instead of dealing with getting it repaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this model, however I found that I didn&#x27;t really use the extra modes all that much, and seeing as I have all the accessories still from this set (hard case, sanitizer, multiple chargers), I&#x27;ve \\&quot;downgraded\\&quot; to a HealthyWhite 710 which is similar to this model but has pared-down modes that I will actually use, and is half the price (albeit doesn&#x27;t have as \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; a brush handle!)</li>
            <li> We realllllly loved this sonic care toothbrush! It was almost one of the first things we bought together after we got married. Sadly, less than a year, I mean months short of being a year, this thing started acting crazy buggy. It would go off by itself when it sat on the base, it wouldn&#x27;t brush when we needed it to, and it just all around became a huge nuisance. We read some reviews and forums regarding this problem and tried almost everything; letting it completely drain, not use it for a wile, keep it unplugged, etc., but nothing worked. Sadly it has been cast aside and now resides somewhere under our sink for the past few years. No idea why we didn&#x27;t warranty it, just didn&#x27;t cross our minds. But on a brighter note, for those months we had it, it was fantastic! Our teeth really did feel much cleaner. There was no way I could brush as fast and consistently as that lil guy did. We have since been using a boring regular toothbrush. Our mornings and nights have never been the same.</li>
            <li> The quality is out of this world!!! The amount of Power this Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush is out of this world!!! I love this Toothbrush!!! I highly recommend this Tooth brush!!!</li>
            <li> It cleans much better than a standard toothbrush, my mouth actually feels refreshed. I also like knowing that my brush gets cleaned once a day.</li>
            <li> After less than a year &amp; 5 months, it quit working. This has been true of the last 3 Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes I&#x27;ve purchased. This is suppose to be the MB of toothbrushes &amp; at one time, it was. It lasted 5-6 years but Sonicare got greedy. The brushes were reasonable then as well. I really feel something of this price should last more than 1 1/2 years. I hope the competition gets the message that Sonicare is going down hill fast. I&#x27;ll be saving over $200 a year by going back to a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> ...so you end up changing mode mid-brush.  Horrible product design!  The UV light clean option also doesn&#x27;t reliably turn on.  I&#x27;ve had a hard time making it work.  I previously had another (older) Sonicare and liked that cheaper more basic design much better.  This newer one has more features that are poorly implemented.</li>
            <li> I wanted to submit a review I recently submitted to Phillips. They asked me to rate the product. My review was rejected as not meeting their guidelines. Here are their guidelines: (if anyone can see where I was remiss, please point it out to me. I think they don&#x27;t want to publish something that points out such a big problem with their units.

The only one that still works is the oldest one. After 7 years, it is still working. Possibly it was superior to the current models. The 2nd model I purchased, with multiple options, had two problems. First, the head began wobbling shortly after purchase (from my dentist). I was told by the receptionist that was a common complaint from the patients who purchased it. Sonicare replaced it. Shortly after that, the handle stopped working. The timer or electronics quit. I was told by a Sonicare customer service rep that the internal batteries only last 1 to 5 years. I could understand 3 to 5 years, but ONE? For $129 dollars plus tax?Even at the $100 plus tax my dentist charged with discount, TOO MUCH! The warranty lasts for 2 years, and with the current model, you&#x27;ll probably use it. The 3rd unit I purchased (while my 2nd replacement was still working) has had to be replaced twice as well. I think it may still be under warranty, but if I sent it in again, that would be 4 units in one year. The newest one had the same problem with the electronics or timer. It begins by buzzing off and one while in the charging base. The different options might light up or not, the unit may or may not come on. In order to stop the relentless buzzing off and on, the base must be unplugged. The unit, removed, has started all by itself out of nowhere. Shortly after this, death is eminent, and the handle will not turn on at all. My daughters each used the brush twice a day, so it was not getting overcharged. I have also changed the base and plugged it into different outlets. I used the troubleshooting method the first customer service rep had me do. No good on anything. While Sonicare was ready to replace the units, I personally have reached my limit on aggravation, disappointment, and loss of confidence in Sonicare&#x27;s overall performance. What was once worth $100 plus dollars to me is now not worth replacing. I have two new heads that will not get used, at $18 for the pair. I am looking into alternate toothbrushes, and have found their main competitor to have good reviews, and will give them a try. I went to some consumer rating sites, and found that my problem was one expressed by literally hundreds of other customers. That is when I new this was a Sonicare problem, not a periodically faulty problem. And if I can find this information easily, I would think Sonicare should know about it. Either the design of the newer handles is faulty, or the product is no longer made with the same care as the older models were. Possibly the electronics need to go the way of the dodo bird and Sonicare should stick with what worked so well in the past. Sonicare is a fine instrument...when it is working. However, a spinbrush for $4 plus batteries is better than a non working Sonicare that cost $129, plus tax, and an additional $80 in replacement brush heads every over the course of a year. Sonicare. in my opinion, has ceased to be worth the price they charge. It is a hassle to have to keep having the handles replaced. I want a product that works. Sonicare sends a new handle, so if you have a broken one, under warranty, contact them. I have never had a problem that way. I have returned the broken ones as they request (they send a return label so it is free), but haven&#x27;t returned the last one that broke. Fedex is 20 minutes away for me, and not worth the gasoline to return it yet again. Sonicare, when your newer units work as well as your older units, I may be back. For now, I will be going with your competitor.</li>
            <li> Been using sonicares for almost 12 years and this is the third model I&#x27;ve had.  The first two each lasted about 5 years.  The first one was still working when I went to the second; I only did it because the brush heads were getting very hard to find.  The second model did stop working (gradually got weaker and weaker until it wasn&#x27;t really doing much more than a regular toothbrush) but that was after 4+ years.  So I&#x27;ve come to expect quality for the $$ investment I&#x27;m making.  However this one, the hx6892/10, has very poor quality.  Mine worked great out of the box.  But after 13 months it started randomly turning on all on it&#x27;s own.  It would do this on the charger and off the charger. It would wake us up in the middle of the night.  I took to hiding it in a pile of sweaters in my closet and closing the door each night so I wouldn&#x27;t hear it.  Then it stopped keeping a charge for long.  Then, at 14 months it stopped taking a charge at all and won&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I looked up my issue I found that MANY people have had the same issue.  So this is clearly a product quality issue with the handle. It&#x27;s disappointing - for the $$ the brush handle should last at least a few years, not one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted Philips and they were very nice and say they are sending me a new handle.  I&#x27;d feel better about that, except that I&#x27;ve read that the replacement ones are of no better quality (this isn&#x27;t a one off bad handle, this is a product quality issue).  So I&#x27;m just crossing my fingers that it lasts me either 9 months (so that I can get another replacement under the two year warranty) or 2 years (so that I feel like I got my $$ worth).</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush.  It is wonderful.  My dentist loves it also.  There are several settings and one is for cleanings which is what I usually use, but I also used the one for gums.  It is a wonderful toothbrush, better than any of them I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> IT WAS A PRESENT, BUT USE ONE MYSELF AND I\\&quot;M VERY PLEASED WITH IT, AND IT FEELS CLEAN AND HAVE HEALTHY GUMS</li>
            <li> I paid $140 for a toothbrush that lasted one year.  A seal must have broken - water drops showed in the charging bar and it stopped working .. can I return this item?? Probably not. It worked well and I liked it - but not if it&#x27;s going to break so quickly and easily.  It&#x27;s a toothbrush ... I can&#x27;t get it wet??  It needs better care instructions if that&#x27;s the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: However ... I just got off chat with phillips and they are sending out a replacement!!  So, that&#x27;s awesome.  My review has been changed for the BETTER.  : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare FlexCare Plus for several weeks now.  My Oral Hygenist recommended use of the Sonicare at my last visit.  I can&#x27;t believe how clean this makes my teeth feel.  I&#x27;m really impressed.  Hope it means a better checkup next time.  No gingivitis yet, and the &#x27;pockets&#x27; are still within normal range but at 63, I want to keep them that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with my purchase.  The brush functions as expected.  Holds a charge well.  (I only recharge about once per week.)  The gradual increase in strength when you first start using it was a welcome feature.  I have used the UV sanitizer several times, but, as a microbiologist, I&#x27;m not sure it is doing anything amazing.  Yes, UV light kills germs.  But, I&#x27;ve never been concerned about germ &#x27;buildup&#x27; on a normal toothbrush, so this feature is something I&#x27;ll use, but didn&#x27;t really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel pack is a nice addition.  With the way the unit holds a charge, it can be easily taken on a long weekend trip without having to recharge.  One less cord for electronics that I have to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the price was right.  With free shipping, it was the best price on the internet.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last a year.  Sure, maybe I&#x27;ll get a new one instead of some refurb as a replacement.  But maybe not.  Save your time and money. Buy an oralb made in Germany rather than this Chinese made piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sonicare several years ago and when it quit on me, I didn&#x27;t buy another one for a few years. I finally decided to get a new electric toothbrush and did some research and Sonicare seemed to be the way to go. I actually called up Sonicare to find out what some of the differences were between the different models and they were very helpful. When I received it, it was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is the second sonicare tooth brush I have owned. The first (Elite model) was amazing and worked for several years. I have peridontal issues when using a manual brush and my first sonicare turned my dental visits around to a completely positive experience. I bought the Flexcare 1 year ago because I thought it was time to upgrade. I am sorry to say that my dental visits have been only downhill since then. There is something wrong with this design and the handle just doesn&#x27;t vibrate the brush head consistently. First I got 2 cavities in my back molars and then today my hygenist asked me what I was doing different as she is starting to see ginivitis. I finally confessed I had gotten a different brush but was trying to make it work because of how much I paid for it. To top it off the UV light in the base stopped working within a couple of months of use. Guess I should have returned this a long time ago. My dental health is too important to mess around with any longer and I am ordering an Oral B brush to replace this dud. If I could give it 0 stars I would.</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended this, and since I have been using it I have had much less plaque when I go for my annual visit.</li>
            <li> my mouth feels clean.  Still going strong</li>
            <li> Amazing results and easy to use.</li>
            <li> i really do love this all around no complaints and the battery holds every well in between charges.&lt;br /&gt;Only bummer that im kicking my self is that a month later i found this WAY cheaper at Costco :( ughhhhh&lt;br /&gt;i should have waited a bit longer.. other than that its a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is my second one-------The dentist noticed the improved gum line on the fist checkup and cleaning after I started using this.</li>
            <li> Plusses:  this toothbrush got my teeth very clean, and in fact seemed to work better than my old Oral-B electric toothbrush (not to mention that my dentist recommended the SoniCare over the Oral-B).  I also like the disinfecting feature, as well as the travel charger.  My problem is that the battery on the toothbrush itself stopped holding a charge after less than three months of use.  It now holds zero charge.  None.</li>
            <li> Like many others, we loved the toothbrush for its cleaning effectiveness - works great.  Then after 1 year, it quit working on the primary charger.  The secondary one was not far behind.  It&#x27;s truly disappointing that it has zero long term reliability.  Will be returning in hopes that we can get some type of credit or exchange towards a different product.  But for now, buy something else and don&#x27;t waste your money on this item until they fix the quality &amp; reliability issues.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is outstanding!  The last few years I had become a sole caregiver for my ill mother and had neglected my own health terribly.  After failing to visit the dentist for over three years, I was afraid to finally go in for my checkup and x-rays.  I bought this toothbrush a few weeks prior to the dental visit and used the brush diligently. Much to my surprise and the surprise of my dentist, I had a perfect checkup with an easy cleaning.  I am a true believer in the power of this toothbrush.  It is almost a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> i have been using it for a couple of months and feel satisfied. This is my first expensive toothbrush, and it really shows its difference from previous ones. it would be even better if price could be a little lower and the body of brush can be made less bulky.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is incredible. Previously, I had an Oral B electric toothbrush. It worked better than a manual toothbrush, but I was still getting quite a bit of staining on my front teeth from coffee (only one cup a day) and my teeth never felt completely clean after brushings. Obviously, I&#x27;m saying this after the fact since I didn&#x27;t notice it at the time. The Sonicare is incredible. It&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that my teeth feel as clean as leaving the dentist office after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different modes are nice, but I usually just stay on the same setting. I rarely change it. The travel charger is nice, and I actually use it daily instead of the larger base with the sanitizer. The UV sanitizer is a nice addition, but it&#x27;s not something that is absolutely needed. Lastly, the toothbrush is incredibly easy to keep clean. I&#x27;ve owned multiple electric toothbrushes over the years, and I&#x27;ve had problems keeping them clean. There are two ways that this brush is superior in this regard. 1. The brush heads are sealed. This is not the case for all brands, and if they are not sealed it&#x27;s very easy for water to get inside and start growing nasty things. 2. The joint where the head meats the base is flat. There are no spaces for water to get trapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if this brush worked only as well as a competitor, I would pick it for its ease of keeping clean.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t know for sure how this toothbrush is working until my next dental appointment, but after a month my teeth are feeling cleaner and look slightly whiter. I love the quad pacer function, 30 seconds on each part and then you are done in 2 minutes. Battery life is great so far. I love the UV cleaner if for nothing else to protect the toothbrush from creepy crawly things. Only drawback is the recommended weekly cleaning of the device, but small price to pay for a clean brushhead.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say. What clean power this has. I am so impressed with this brush it has so many features. The clean feeling I get is astonishing. With the different modes on this brush and different power levels u can&#x27;t go wrong. Timer cuts power on brush for a second to let you know to switch to next quarter of your mouth. Excellent design easily held with no akward positions. Charge lasts a long time. I could not have made a better decision unless I&lt;br /&gt;Lived with a professional dentist. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The Sonic toothbrush is all it is advertised to be and confirmed by numerous professionals reviews who advised that \\&quot;if you can afford it by all means go for this one as it is far and away superior to any other electric toothbrush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased to replace an electric toothbrudh that I had been using for 10 years! The vibrations on that toothbrush were coarse, and the toothbrush so loud that I worried about waking other family members who were still sleeping! As I read in other reviiews, the sonic vibrations on this toothbrush took some time to get used to.  The feeling was an unpleasant tickling feeling, but after about one week, it no longer bothered me.  The UV light is great,  I also like that I can put the brush heads in the case and close it to keep the brushes clean.  The travel case and charger are very handy, but for a one week trip I didn&#x27;t even need to charge the toothbrush; even with both my husband and myself using the toothbrush.  Speaking of two people using the brush, it arrives with two different brush heads, so my husband uses the larger head, and I use the smaller.  Last, but not least; speaking to the real reason for using an electric toothbrush....my teeth and gums are clean and healthy!  I can&#x27;t wait to see my dental hygienist again, to see what she says!</li>
            <li> It took a week to get used to brushing my teeth with the sonicare because it tickles and then I&#x27;d spill toothpaste all over my shirt. I really love the settings as they adjust either the timing or the pulsations. My teeth feel straight from the dentist clean minus the bleeding gums. I believe the UV light is bogus- that part broke after 2 months anyways.</li>
            <li> OMGOSH! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE TO BRUSH MY TEETH WITH MY NEW PHILLIPS SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH! It is amazing! I brush my teeth like 4 times a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different types of brush styles makes it even better</li>
            <li> My wife and I had many problems with a prior model with bleeding gums, etc. - even with new bristles. Our dentist recommended this and I can tell you that all the problems disappeared within a month of using this! Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love the various cycles that you can choose from, and my hygienist is very impressed with how well it controls tartar.  Just don&#x27;t waste your money on the sanitizer.  Mine quit working after two months.  Bulbs are not readily available, and there&#x27;s no guarantee that the bulb was the problem since the filament appears to be intact.  Rinsing the brush in hot water still works.</li>
            <li> This thing is still going strong after almost three years.  Still holds a decent charge and the sterilizer still works.  Replacement heads are way to expensive.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a hack to get around using Phillips heads though.</li>
            <li> I took this with me when I worked overseas, and it seemed alright for a couple of months, when i crapped out on me. I suggest you get a cheaper model, unless you really need all these settings for your teeth, and don&#x27;t mind if it does you wrong quickly.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement (and upgrade) for a Sonicare brush I had that finally died after about 10 years. It&#x27;s a great brush! I usually use the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting, but having the timed &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; quick-brush has come in handy several times and the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; setting is nice too. This is a well-made brush - my mom got a more basic model to replace hers and it seems much cheaper and plasticy. Plus, the UV cleaning option is a nice perk!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush, dentist feeling clean every day! The UV sanitizer is easy to use and keeps your brush heads lasting longer.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned Sonicare toothbrushes and recently bought these.  They are amazing and so gentle on your gums.  My dentist said he definitely saw a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric tooth brush for my husband for Christmas. I was concerned at the price, but when I googled it other online stores were selling it for $200+ and I bought it for $139! It is a great toothbrush with the UV cleaner, extra head replacements, and it is rechargeable. It is fairly quiet and my husband seems to love it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Sonicare for over a year, still works great. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hygienist says that my home dental care is excellent and e cleanings are much quicker and less painful. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great, Got this for my girlfriend and she is very picky about her teeth and she loves this brush</li>
            <li> Very high quality.  Great performance.  I would highly recommend this product.  Good value.  We did not know what to expect when we ordered and are very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is my third replacement--over many years--of my Phillips Sonicare, a product I have been using since it was first introduced.  I did not order a replacement because my old one died, I just thought it didn&#x27;t have the ooomph of its former self. Since the unit had served me well for over eight years (with brushhead replacements every quarter), I thought it time for an updated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT decision!  This one does have more power, does hold a charge longer (two+ weeks), does offer more brushing options, and is sleek, modern, beautiful.  The brushhead sanitizer assures the cleanliness of the brush at every use.  I have used the travel case frequently.  It is well-designed, works as intended, and now I never have to be without my Phillips!  My teeth, my mouth, and my dentist are all Phillips fans!</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for my mother about 3 months ago. She uses it twice a day and it seems to be holding up just fine. The cleaning/charging station is a nice touch also.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last year and absolutely love it.  It gets my teeth very clean.  However I have had a problem with the button to turn on the infrared lamp.  I called customer service and ended up speaking to someone in a foreign country.  The rep had no idea what I was talking about and insisted I give the serial number from the handle as well as the charging unit.  Next thing I know, I have 2 extra handles in the mail.  That is not what I needed at all.  Interestingly enough, one of the handles is the correct one and the other is for a completely different model.  I still have the problem with the button, so I will try customer service again...</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is awesome! I used to just manually brush my teeth but this toothbrush was recommended by my dentist and since i am obsessed with my teeth i got this! Well worth the money spent! Have not had any problems!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace an older Sonicare toothbrush... I like this model even better, hopefully this one will last as long as the previous one!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare HX9672 to replace an older model Sonicare toothbrush that seemed to be a favorable home for mold where the brush head connected to the handle.  The design of this toothbrush is excellent.  The brush head is minimalist and attaches quickly and easily.  The handle, while thinner than the old model, is very comfortable to hold.  The handle has nubs on the bottom that prevent the toothbrush from rolling off the counter while I apply toothpaste to the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided on this particular model because it has the extra Gum Care mode that the lower models do not.  You can choose to use the one-minute Massage mode on its own or tack on the end of the normal brushing mode for a three-minute session (Gum Care).  The Refresh mode is a nice one-minute version of the normal (Clean) mode.  I haven&#x27;t use Sensitive mode yet, as I just haven&#x27;t needed it.  The brush goes through a 14-use ramp up period to get your mouth used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only feature I wish it had would be the pressure sensor that the Oral B brushes have.  However, what tipped me to choose the Philips over the Oral B was the quadpacer internal timer.  The brush hesitates every 30 seconds indicating that it is time to move to another area of your mouth.  I love not having to watch the clock anymore!  Philips suggested quartering of the mouth didn&#x27;t work for me, so I figured out a brushing pattern that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in the box are two heads (one regular, one compact), a countertop charger with UV sanitizer (can sanitize two heads at once), a portable charger, and a travel case (holds one handle and two heads).  This kit is certainly designed to be shared between cohabitants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not really expect was that my mouth actually feels cleaner than it did with my old model.  We will see what the dentist says, but my mouth feels almost fresh-from-the-dentist clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is not cheap, but it does all I want from a toothbrush.  The DiamondClean seems like more money simply for a cool design but no more function over the FlexCare+.  I&#x27;m very happy with this choice.othbrush.  The DiamondClean seems like more money simply for a cool design but no more function over the FlexCare+.  I&#x27;m very happy with this choice.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  My teeth have never felt so clean.  This was a great buy!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a sonicare toothbrush since I&#x27;m a scrubber when I brush my teeth. The sonicare is perfect if you have issues with brushing too hard. I tried cheaper electronic tooth brushes but my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean, and my gums were still irritated. I haven&#x27;t had that issue with the sonicare. I still use a regular toothbrush to clean my tongue, but the sonicare can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - I had an issue with the sterilizer starting or staying on. With a little trouble shooting it was only a loose bulb.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric toothbrushes for a few years now. I started out with Crest battery operated, tried some other brand I can&#x27;t remember and then this. Regardless of the brand or model you choose, I definitely think that electric brushes are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great, exactly as described, for me anyway. Obviously, some people have had some issues, hopefully I won&#x27;t become one of them. I think if you&#x27;re going to spend money on an expensive toothbrush like this, you might as well go all the way. The major selling point for me was the UV sanitizer. I am a neat freak so having that was very important. I like that it comes with two different brush heads that allow you to reach different areas. Multiple cleaning mode also help with this. My favorite mode is massage because it helps really get the gum line without being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that every product of any company produces some duds of even their best quality product. That&#x27;s unfortunate, but with that being said, I think whether or not this is a good product depends solely on that. I have had mine for about 9 months (i think) and have had no issues at all. I recommend it, I hope you get a working model.</li>
            <li> Never realized my older toothbrush wasso  inferior until using the Sonicare Flex Care Plus.  Feel SO clean &amp; polished. And love the massage functions for gums.  Long charge, very slim and especially easy for travel with its smaller secondary charger plug.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this electric toothbrush. Does everything I expect from it and more. My gums have improved greatly and so has my smile.</li>
            <li> I first bought this for my hubby as a birthday gift. I did A LOT of research and finally decided on this one. WOW! This brush is really really good! My hubby said he never had a brush that cleaned so thoroughly. Two days later, I bought one for myself. I l absolutely love the timer on this thing. My old brush didn&#x27;t have a timer and based on what my dentist used to tell me, I obviously was not brushing long enough. Ever since I started using this brush, even my dentist started complimenting me. :) She said I didn&#x27;t have any new cavities (I usually  get new cavities every time I see her), my gum is healthier, and my teeth are whiter! YIPPPPY! Only reason I didn&#x27;t get it a 5 star was because of this price. It is pretty pricey, BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY. :)</li>
            <li> Simply the best one in the market I would say.&lt;br /&gt;working fine, the way i wanted, and good design!&lt;br /&gt;I thank my friend who recommened this to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using an Oral B for a while and perhaps it was because it was 4 years old it wasn&#x27;t very effective.  My teeth never felt or looked clean afer using a 2 minute cycle, and the brush head after time kept moving around -- I knew it was time for a new toothbrush.  I read reviews and decided to splurge on this product and I&#x27;m glad I did. Since the first time using this Sonicare brush, my teeth finally feel clean -- and definitely look and feel better.  I love the sanitizing unit and the overall look of the unit.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have bought this toothbrush 2 times and had it replaced once due to it breaking during the warranty period.  This toothbrush is wonderful which is why I got it 3 times.  However, I no longer will be buying another one as the last one I bought only lasted 6 months.  I called Phillips after the one they sent me to replace my original one lasted less then a year.  They stated that they will only replace once.  Still I bought another one on my own because I loved it.  It has been less than 6 mos and the motor has gone on this one now too.  I am going to give Oral B a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Sonicare toothbrushes and have used them twice a day for YEARS without a single problem. They have all kept running until the buttons start cracking and I decide to replace it for a newer one. This toothbrush is completely dead after 1 1/2 years of very basic use by only myself. The lights behind the different modes started to fade and eventually die, then when I pressed the power button on morning the toothbrush was just dead. I placed it on it&#x27;s charger all day with no luck. It is of course completely out of warranty. I was very disappointed. Compared to the older models it just doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does clean very well and I have been otherwise happy with it, but I do not think I will purchase another from this brand.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to help with bleeding gums... After two weeks and beyond, I&#x27;m glad to say it worked, and my mouth feels terrific. The product times out your brushes on each part of your mouth so that you get it good and clean... It starts off real gentle the first few days and increases in intensity..  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am horrible when it comes to brushing my teeth for more than 20 seconds, this toothbrush vibrates through each phase of brushing, which is awesome and makes me brush longer.  Also, LOVE the fact it has the UV Sanitizer.  I put my brush in there after every use and after going on long trips to make sure my brush is always clean.  Great product to keep your teeth healthy and help brush for the right amount of time.  Battery lasts a while too, I&#x27;ve used it on vacation several times and it always keeps a charge.  Great great great great.</li>
            <li> The FlexCare Plus met my needs because I have dental implants and I have to be very careful in brushing these areas affected. The options provided to me by the FlexCarePlus e.g. sensitive, gum care massage were of great help to me. Gum care has become very importent to me and this brush has been and will be of great help to me besides my periodontist highly recommended this for me. I am very pleased and satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Philips Sonicare toothbrushes.  Each have last 3 - 5 years and they leave my teeth feeling clean, fresh and just as nice as when I leave the dentists office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the UV light to kill germs on the brush head but I purchased it because it&#x27;s great for cold and flu season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used all the setting, gum massage etc... but they weren&#x27;t the reason for me to purchase this device (my old one stopped holding a charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these toothbrushes!  They&#x27;re the best thing next to having your teeth cleaned professionally.  I highly recommend them, you simply may not need all the bells and whistles (I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever use anything other than the cleaning mode).</li>
            <li> I love using this tooth brush, I look forward to brushing my teeth every morning now. This provides that clean feeling and whitens your teet as promised. I recommend to anyone who is looking at this item to just buy if you thinking to get a great electric tooth brush. The feeling in your mouth is like a tooth brush massage. :)</li>
            <li> Worked well for two years, and we took excellent care of it. We loved it, easily the best toothbrush we&#x27;ve had. Then one day all it did was \\&quot;hum\\&quot;. I took it apart and discovered there&#x27;s a shaft inside which fractured, rendering the device useless. Other people have posted online about this problem. Philips doesn&#x27;t sell a part, and there is no aftermarket support - which is too bad because I could replace the part if I could buy it. And so, our $150 toothbrush ends with a 50 cent broken piece of metal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit about three years ago. The unit failed within the first year but was replaced by the manufacturer. Unfortunately it just failed again and is out of warranty.  Phillips will not replace or repair the product. They state that the product is only expected to last 3-5 years.&lt;br /&gt;This unit had only ONE user .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit I had previously lasted over a decade was repaired only once a a reasonable cost. So as far as I can determine not only has Phillips quality control deteriorated but they are not environmentally  friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either purchase the cheapest model you can or another vendor&#x27;s product. [[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> I loved the job this did on my teeth but now it will only run 15 seconds then stops and only goes in 1 second bursts.  Seems like a common problem now.  I only had it 3 months but seems to be out of warranty.</li>
            <li> I want to quantify my 3 star review of the Sonicare by saying I love this toothbrush and the sonicare brand of toothbrushes.  Having used these for years, I can say they are the best toothbrushes going, however, my one complaint is that you cant replace the battery after it dies.  Come on Philips, get with the program and make these things were you can change out the batteries, we fill up the landfills enough with stuff like this and that goes for your Razors too.</li>
            <li> I purchased the flexcare plus because of a recommendation from my dentist. I have been using it for 2 months now since my checkup/cleaning and my teeth feel just as clean now as the day of my dentist visit. This toothbrush is well worth the investment.  My wife and I share it, we just use different brush heads. The sanitizer really makes the brushes seem fresh after every use. I cannot say how glad I am that I purchased this toothbrush.  Great job Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fabulous.  There are five options for tooth and gum care, zone timing for brushing, a long lasting charge, and a UV brush sanitizer.  The traveling case is sleek and easy to pack.&lt;br /&gt;All surfaces of my teeth feel super clean.  Love that!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 9 months ago and today it just seized up and died! My previous Sonicare lasted 11 years and I only got rid of it then because I didn&#x27;t like how it got black mold in the toothbrush base. Since this one has a different design with no open space dome at the base I thought I should upgrade since black mold is bad. $140 to only get 9 months use? Terrible!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner with this sonic brush and my gums no longer bleed.  I have had problems with the sanitizer not working, and had to be coached by sonicare on taking the bulb out and cleaning the contact with rubbing alcohol.  That fixes the issue, but the issue keeps coming back on mine.  My spouse&#x27;s does not have that issue.  However, she cannot use this brush every day, as it irritates one of her sensitive teeth, so if that is an issue, hand brushing might be better.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested that I schedule only annual or 18 month dental cleanings.  She commented on fact that she has never suggested this to a patient before.  Thank you, Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I gave this four stars is because of the cost, and difficulty finding, the right replacement heads. The first replacement heads were soft and gentle; the heads were hard and uncomfortable in the second order I received. Still love the toothbrush; so much so that I purchased this one for my son.</li>
            <li> Broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on Consumer Reports and Amazon, I am confused about replacing my old e series Sonicare.  It has been pooping out lately and when I changed the brush head this morning, it failed to work.  Even when I switched back to the old brush head.  So I was checking out replacements online, bothered though that I still have two brand new brush heads for the e series.  After reading all the back and forth, I pulled out my old brush and gave it a careful cleaning underneath the brush head--and it now works!  I&#x27;m going to keep it until it fails or I&#x27;ve used up my brush heads and then see if there is more clarity about what kind to replace it with.  Thanks everyone for all the info.  The 4 stars is for my old Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> I have had a sonicare for the past 4 years and this is my first upgrade and I am extremely satisfied wit the choice of my product. I love the UV cleaner it seems to give my brushes that extra clean that they need to help keep my breath fresher longer.</li>
            <li> Nice product. My wife uses it daily &amp; nightly...Nicely made, UV sterilizer light is brighter than I would like at night, but does go off by itself.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product so far, I especially like the timer, for changing to the different areas in your mouth</li>
            <li> The first tooth brush I have used that truly gets your teeth squeeky clean AND massages your gums and sanitizes!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product for me because I have an issue with receding gums because I brush too hard. I went with the FlexCare Plus instead of the newer model because this is cheaper, it has the UV sanitation light (which works great), and the handle itself is no different from the newer models. They both function the same way. The brush is noticeably gentler on my teeth and gums and my gums in particular look a lot healthier now. Even though it&#x27;s still expensive for a toothbrush, I&#x27;m hoping this will last me a while. It charges fairly quick and usually lasts me about 1-2 weeks on a single charge. I&#x27;m happy with the product and it&#x27;s doing exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> makes mouth feel clean and fresh.  Dental reports are great.  Very pleased with purchase.  highly recommend looks nice on counter.</li>
            <li> You know the feeling when you brush your teeth with a regular toothbrush and they still don&#x27;t feel clean? Well, this guy takes care of that problem. Very good for teeth and gums and is highly recommended by my dentist and oral hygienist.</li>
            <li> Our family will not be buying this product any longer.  We have bought two and each would not recharge after about a year.  It&#x27;s expensive to replace and so are the brushes of which now I have extra that I can not use.</li>
            <li> Purchased this power tooth brush for my wife, she uses it every day and loves it. If she is happy, so am I.</li>
            <li> Works quite well but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a difference4 between any of the settings.  I purchased it for the brush head cleaning, but different settings that showed a difference would have been nice.</li>
            <li> love it, love it, LOVE IT! best toothbrush I have ever used. My mouth fells so clean and breath is so fresh!</li>
            <li> This dental care tool was recommended by my dentist. It vibrates many times faster than the battery powered brushes one can buy at the grocery store. Among many desirable features, it has an automatic timer that lets you know when the recommended 2 minutes has expired. My teeth feel polished each time I brush!</li>
            <li> To ber perfectly honest, this item is a bit of a luxury: it doesn&#x27;t need multiple vibration settings. However, I love that geeky little detail, because I am a stereotypical consumer that needs to push extra buttons and feel in control. The brush pauses if you press too hard, and hence, helps avoid ruining the enamel on your teeth. Being able to clean the brush head is a major plus as well. The product is well designed and feels worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  I bought it when my previous one lost the ability to take a charge to the battery.  I like that it has two different size heads and the sanitizing option too.  Would definitely buy again but having owned these for years at a time without having to replace I anticipate I will not need a new one for years to come.  Another nice feature is that replacement heads are easy to find and not too pricey.</li>
            <li> very good product! you can chose different functions and just use it by following the instructions. it is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after visiting my dentist. I have an old Sonicare that is still working 7 years later. I thought it was about time I take care of my gums, since I will be getting my braces off in the next few months. If this Sonicare takes care of the gums as promised, it will be a great product.</li>
            <li> Item as described and arrived in a timely manner. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been with Sonicare for quite some time, primarily because my dentist has recommended it.  I have  teeth that are relatively close together and it is hard to get them real clean with a manual toothbrush.  The only concerns I see is it is not real important to buy the model with numerous settings such as this one as often when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth, the settings change.  Three settings are more than sufficient.  Also, the base is rather small and you need to place it in a manner where you will not continue knocking the brush off the base.  However, I do like the capability of sanitizing the brushes and I definitely see a difference with the color of my teeth and the clean feeling after brushing.  Would I recommend this model, probably not, but I would definitely recommend a model with less settings and a larger base.  I will continue to stay with Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Just recieved my sonicare toothbrush the other day, and so far I love it and I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on a quality product. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I love it....battery lasts longer than the other model I had, love the added travel case and charger.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I can&#x27;t believe how much cleaner my mouth is since I&#x27;ve been using it. My dental tech is very impressed as well. I use it over my whole mouth and tongue after I brush my teeth with it-I just rinse the toothpaste off first. Incidentally, when I use it on the roof of my mouth, it helps clear my sinuses during allergy season. Makes sense I guess with the vibration and all.</li>
            <li> The SonicCare Toothbrush may brush your teeth well (it doesn&#x27;t seem that much different than any other electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had).  What I hate is the fact that when you use it watered-down toothpaste splatters all over the mirror, my face and glasses, and my clothes.  I try to keep my mouth closed as much as possible,  but you really have to keep your mouth open to brush your teeth properly.  The on-off switch is placed so I&#x27;m constantly turning it off accidently.  Everybody says it only lasts a year, so I&#x27;m looking forward to that so I can get an Oral-B electric toothbrush.  I paid a packet for this on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and I really regret it.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great.  Maybe all the different cleaning cycles isn&#x27;t really needed.  Wish it came with a small travel charger because the base is too big to travel with.</li>
            <li> The unit is light and the brush is like a little cleaning vibrating beast.  They cover your individual teeth and you can feel it. Add in the pauses to remind you to change area and the auto shut off. It&#x27;s really neat. There is also some sort of uv cleaning dome which is neat.  I owned a sonicare about 8 years ago. And I have been using regular vibrating 5 dollar brushes for a few years now.  Basically I am happy with this purchase wow. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the difference while using this toothbrush. My dentist notices also. I love not having to do the brushing because this toothbrush does it for ya. Grab it and don&#x27;t second guess it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, my teeth feel like new every time I brush them. After about a year, however, the UV sanitize part stopped working.</li>
            <li> The brush is great, but I am reducing the review by 1 star because of the cost of the replacement brush heads.  Like any device that requires consumables (think water filters in refrigerators with ice makers), the supplies are expensive and you have little choice but to buy from the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is that the brush heads wear out after 90 days.  Each new one costs about $10 each - and you buy them in packs of multiples, like 6 or 7.  So you could see that after a time, the amount spent on replacement heads would exceed the price spent on the original toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy any product that requires replace consumables (like toothbrushes, printers, etc.), price the cost of the consumables too, and figure that in to your cost of ownership.</li>
            <li> After using many times, I have noticed that my gum doesn&#x27;t hurts anymore. My teeth feels clean than ever! highly recommended to everyone.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: No word back from the seller regarding how to resolve the issue that this thing is not working nine months later. From what I understand, older Sonicare devices are great, but from reading the reviews, it looks like their QA has gone into the toilet. Do not recommend buying this and seller is unresponsive.     Stopped working after 9 months. Waiting to hear from manufacturer if they will exchange or fix. It was great when it worked, but I&#x27;m not willing to pay $150 for a toothbrush every nine months.</li>
            <li> Have really liked using sonicare toothbrush in the past.  However, when I realized how disgustingly filthy they get after when taking it apart I just about puked.  Black mildew and juck inside the brush part, all soaking wet even though I carefully washed and dried the toothbrush off after each use.  I&#x27;m very surprised they have not remedied this defect yet.  I think the brush does a very good job of cleaning teeth but the brush itself gets disgustingly gross if it&#x27;s not taken apart and cleaned inside out every 2 or3 days.</li>
            <li> Very good product happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product for maintaining dental health if used as directed.  It has many wonderful features and  is easy to use</li>
            <li> I had to get rid of my first sonicare, which was fine for a couple of years, then the motor would simply stop. Replaced it with a new one which experienced the same problem within a month. what an expensive piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has been wonderful.  I never have an tartar on my teeth when they are professionally cleaned and I&#x27;ve never had any gum disease.  Definately promotes gum and tooth health</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several electric toothbrushes but many are too harsh for my sensitive teeth. This one has a sensitive setting and it feels good on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush exactly 2 years - it is a few days out of warranty.  I have contacted Phillips but don&#x27;t know if they will cover it or not.  If so I would rate this 5 stars.  If not then my complaint is that the handle should have lasted longer than barely out of warranty.  It is a good toothbrush when it is working but the shaft has started to wobble loose and the lightweight seal around it has broken - don&#x27;t know if it broke because of the extreme wobble or what.  I have had good dental reviews but if this brush isn&#x27;t covered by Phillips then it is way overpriced for 2 years of use.  UPDATE: Although my toothbrush was a week out of warranty customer service sent me a replacement toothbrush handle and sent a postage paid label to return my old one.  (Hopefully so they can figure out why these things break so quickly.)  I updated to 5 stars based on the excellent customer service I received.  I hope this new handle lasts more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  I formerly used the old bulky Sonicare and cleaning it was a pain.  I also used an Oral-B model and it didn&#x27;t clean my teeth very well.  I have used this for over 8 months now in addition to a Waterpik.  2 months ago, I had my 6 month dentist visit.  The dental hygienist was amazed at how clean my teeth were after using this toothbrush for 6 months.  There was hardly anything at all for her to clean.  My unit has worked flawlessly.  I love the built-in UV light for disinfection as well.  I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in buying the ultimate toothbrush at any price.  The proof for me was in my visit to the dentist after using this for 6 months.  You really can&#x27;t buy a better toothbrush than this one!</li>
            <li> Buyer beware! This is a review of RETAIL packaging toothbrush item model hx6972/10. The sanitizer does not work.  When I push the button, absolutley nothing happens.  The product is NOT made in the USA as advertised; the box reads \\&quot;Developed in U.S.A./Made by Phillips in China.  The serial number is stamped on and not engraved on the bottom of the handle.  The battery does not fully charge the toothbrush; it only charges to the second light after 24hrs and it&#x27;s supposed to be fully charged at the third light.  I am not satisfied and will contact amazon and phillips in attempt to get what I paid for and not this malfunctioning stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Thank you Amazon for your excellent customer service!  I now have a new toothbrush and it appears to be working just fine.  I am vey happy with the fact that amazon provided me with prompt and expedient  service in providing me with a replacement.  I think this toothbrush is amazing and though I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of days, I am very happy with the way it cleans my teeth and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> A must to keep your teeth clean. Easy to use and your teeth feel very clean afterwards. I had an improved dental visit after using for several months.</li>
            <li> Ive never used a better toothbrush. I had other powered tooth brushes but none even compare. Our teeth feel a lot cleaner already and weve only had this thing for a short time. We use the diamond clean heads on the advice of other reviewers and i would recommend the same. Note: the first few times we used this thing it tickled so bad it was hard to use but y o u get ued to it really quickly. It no longer bothers us.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars, but because of high cost I gave 4 stars. It really reduces gum problems as claimed and tooth decay. It is highly recommended to preserve not only teeth, but also to minimize heart problems that may result due to bad teeth.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Buying and perfect attendance. All they offer fulfilled. I bought on a trip to New York and everything has been perfect. It was bought as proof of service and has been easy, the only thing is that you should carry the code of the last email received accerder to the collection in the Staples store where I went.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. They arrived very quickly and the sonicare toothbrush is super easy to use. My teeth feel really clean now!</li>
            <li> Has Philips purposely engineered this product so they are replaced every two years? I replaced my older model with the flexcare because Costco was not always carrying the older brush heads.  Now in the last 4 years I have had to buy a new flexcare toothbrush 3 times!  Not what I expect after making that kind of investment in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  Love the gum option for stimulating the gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second Philips Sonicare, and while I&#x27;ve had no problems with operation, for practical use it&#x27;s a pain. Humans don&#x27;t as yet have three arms, which makes applying toothpaste the way it&#x27;s normally done (with two hands - especially if you&#x27;re a woman) problematic, because when you lay the Sonicare down it rolls over. Hey, fellas, its ROUND! Go figure! Which also makes it slip around and around in your hand while brushing your teeth, resulting in the hard plastic side of the brush \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; my $27,000 porcelain caps. C&#x27;mon guys. Give us a flat side. I&#x27;ve gone back to my Oral-B tooth brush. I&#x27;ll be back when they figure it out.</li>
            <li> We bought this on recommendation from whirlpool, but these toothbrushes were not available in Australia. Fortunately Amazon has a much better range. Finally the Australian importers decided to import them, but they are still much more expensive here than Amazon. These have US plugs, but work perfectly on 240 volts.</li>
            <li> i was a skeptic but it&#x27;s really worth the money.  these things really clean better and more efficiently.  it&#x27;s a must have if you&#x27;re too lazy to go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I recently had braces and after they were taken off my gums would bleed every time I brushed with a manual toothbrush.  I bought the Sonicare because of the fact it was proven to increase gum health.  This product works. My gums no longer bleed.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Very powerful and leaves teeth feeling shiny.  I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.  The first time I used it my lips felt a little tingly with the vibration but even the second time of use I was used to it and now is a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this item I didn&#x27;t realize it was being shipped from South Korea.  I was a little nervous that I&#x27;d have a long wait for delivery, but was very happy when it arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li> Yes, it looks fancy, but it won&#x27;t do you any good if it doesn&#x27;t work. Mines barely made the 9 months mark (the sanitizer broke in less than 3 months). :(&lt;br /&gt;I have since switched to the Philips Easy Clean (the last one lasted almost twice as long as this one). The good thing is that the Easy Clean uses the same brush heads as this model, and seems way more durable.</li>
            <li> my wife and I use this daily, swapping out the heads.  great battery life, never an issue, even a few days on vacation.  It lost power after a year, but customer service is so good that after a few minutes of resetting the device, they simply replaced the defective brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric toothbrushes for years, but this one is in a league by itself!  Once you use it, you&#x27;ll never go back to anything else and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Works great for cleaning teeth. The brush shaft became loose after 22 months of use. Seems to be a common problem according to other reviews. Fortunately the warranty is 24 months, so I called Philips and they quickly sent me a new handle of the same model for free.</li>
            <li> There is simply nothing bad to be said about this brush. It makes me wonder how regular tooth brushes are even legal. I&#x27;ve never tried the Oral B but I can say first hand that after owning this for almost a year now I am blown away by the quality, and the technology. I use the smaller head on my daughter and I&#x27;ve been using it on her on the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; setting for over a year and it makes her teeth sparkle! You can share it among family members - just pick up a few extra heads and you can even change the colored bands so everyone knows who&#x27;s brush is who&#x27;s. Get it!</li>
            <li> third one to just stop working</li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare toothbrushes for years.  I love the fact that I am now able to sanitize my brush regularly.  Now, when I use the toothbrush I feel secure in the knowledge that I am not introducing germs into my mouth.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought a Sonicare HX6970 about 1.5 years ago for my son. Naturally, he broke it, probably from too much pressure. When I called Sonicare Customer Service the reply they gave me is what is the receipt number and store. I told them that with 2 kids, hundreds of purchases in a year we didn&#x27;t keep a running file of tootbrush receipts but I did manage to register the product on their site. Not good enough--they couldn&#x27;t keep the date and store but expected me to keep this little slip of paper. The customer service rep then had the brillant idea for me to call CVS or Bed Bath and  Beyond to get them to find the receipt. He admitted that he had never tried this. Final outcome--I&#x27;m going to buy an Oral B. The spec&#x27;s are all about the same so why pay 2X for a Sonicare and then have to put up with lame, rude customer service?</li>
            <li> I ordered this item in January 2012 and in May 2013 I picked it up to brush my teeth this morning when I was shocked to see that the toothbrush had melted just to the right of the power button. I have never had any problems before so I am shocked that this happened out of nowhere. I am just glad that it did not burn the house down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept it on the charger when not in use so maybe this was the problem? It worked that way for a year and a half so I didn&#x27;t think it was an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Great toothbrush until it has an internal short and melts apart.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product, it works well and gives me the great smile and healthy mouth I want.</li>
            <li> I have had many Sonicare brushes, but I think Philips finally got it right with this one. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because after a certain time, the battery seems to die... However, I must say the customer service offered by Philips Sonicare is superb! They normally cover the battery and will replace it for you. Now back to the toothbrush! It has 5 different settings which is particularly nice if you&#x27;ve just had a cleaning or feel a little sensitive (sensitive setting). It has a cleaning setting which truly massages your gums and I like that. The sterilizing option is also nice since it takes no time at all to run and I feel like it truly works.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I had (only updated). The base on my old one quit but the handle still works so I am still using it....</li>
            <li> This is a sleek, shiny toothbrush that works well. That is, when it&#x27;s actually working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this electric toothbrush because I had an older model Philips rechargeable toothbrush that worked great and lasted for many years. About a month after I bought this toothbrush, the &amp;#34;gum care&amp;#34; light stopped working. This didn&#x27;t bother me because it still worked just fine. After another month, the &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; light stopped working. Although this was a bit concerning, I was still ok with it because it worked fine. For several months there were no problems, but then the toothbrush suddenly became very loud. I was a bit annoyed at this point, but it still worked. A few weeks later, the toothbrush made a loud &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; noise and died. Now it won&#x27;t turn on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What upsets me is that the newer models are of a lower quality compared to the older Philips models. I never dropped this toothbrush and don&#x27;t understand why it stopped working. It just goes to show, just because something is new, shiny and lights up, doesn&#x27;t mean its better than the older models that didn&#x27;t break down randomly.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have bought. I researched and read a lot of reviews to come to this decision. I like the portability as I travel and the case is very well designed. It holds a charge for about two weeks with two people using it. I did purchase separately another brush for my wife to use. It truly does feel as though you have been to the dentist for cleaning after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using SonoCare for years and my old one finally wore out.  This is a much advanced product with several additional settings.  I like the sanitizer built into the charger and the hard traveling case that comes with it.  I never liked the soft case that came with the previous SonoCare.  Highly recommend it even though a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and each time I brush my teeth it feels great.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It does a great job and my teeth really feel clean.  Dental cleanings since using have been great.</li>
            <li> Actually, I used the 30 second smile tooth brush system before using this one......This one does not clean teeth or gums as well as the 30 second smile.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible. my teeth feel so clean after each use and it is worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li> have been wanting the Philips Sonicare for longtime. I like knowing the uv cleaner is there if I want to use it. Absolutely love the head and handle--the older models allow water to drip down inside the handle compartment and nasty, slimey film starts growing and the smell is horrible--this one does not have this problem. Like all the different modes-I brush longer than 2 minutes. I travel back and forth from my house to my sons and the travel case and charger are so nice to have. My only problem is that mine came from Korea and I have to use a voltage converter (which was included), but I have this black plug extending from my wall plug in. Besides that, the sonicare is exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The battery life wasn&#x27;t quite as long as expected from other reviews but everything else was as advertised.  I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I have a similar version, which I love. Purchased this for my traveling daughter. She has told me how much she likes her new Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I had one of the original Sonicare toothbrushes and it served me every day for over five years.  It was still working when I decided to upgrade!  I purchased this new top of the line model from Amazon about  a year ago.  The new model does a great job cleaning your teeth and stimulating ones gums, but the push button that controls the various features is located in a position that is just too easy to bump while holding the toothbrush.  Same goes for the on/off switch - it is in the area you grip whilst holding the instrument.  Those inconveniences would cause me to give the product a 4-star rating, but the fact that my instrument simply died after 14 months of ownership really bothers me.  Is the new model is built more cheaply that the original design?  I don&#x27;t know...but for a nearly $200 investment, it failed far too early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good News:  I contacted Phillips customer service after writing this review and they are sending me a replacement product under warranty.  So - I appreciate their support...it was hassle free.  They were very easy to work with.  I hope the replacement lasts a few years!</li>
            <li> Pretty good toothbrush.  It took some getting used to as I had been using an Oral B which rotates and this one goes up and down.  It seems like it will last, but I only use it once a month! (Just kidding)</li>
            <li> I liked this tooth brush a lot. It does an outstanding job cleaning your teeth, and is built sturdy. I brush my teeth in the morning while taking a shower, prior brushes I owned (earlier Oral B models) would malfunction after a few months. However the Sonicare HX6970 has lasted for 20 months (having just recently died).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Philips to process a warranty replacement, and they are sending me a new unit under the two year warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush kit for 4 years and have had to replace the toothbrush handle 6 times total by calling Philips support. I live alone and gently use this product without any form of abuse so there&#x27;s really no reason for the issues I&#x27;ve had with longevity. The various types of handle failure include: no longer accepting a charge, randomly turn on by itself, and will no longer oscillate due to internal mechanism breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely leave product reviews, but had to for this particular one so others are aware of the lack of quality within this Philips product - and potentially all Sonicare products . I simply will not ever buy another Philips Sonicare, and will be selling the replacement handle once it&#x27;s received from warranty support.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush, and I really like the disinfecting feature of this model.  How many times have you brushed your teeth during an illness &amp; wondered if you were simply re-infecting yourself with whatever bug laid you up in the first place?!  With this Sonicare model, you need not worry about such things ever again.  Other terrific features? It comes with a travel case &amp; charger, so you never have to leave home without it.  A typical Sonicare will last several days on a charge anyway, but for those longer trips out of town, you now have the ability to keep your traditional, manual toothbrush at home.  Yea!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, Sonicare toothbrushes guarantee me a quick cleaning &amp; a perfect report of health at the dentist office every 6 months, and the dentist/hygienist alway comments on how great my teeth look.  I will never use any other toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I was not convinced the other reviews were really accurate when they said it felt like they had just been to the dentist. I will say it is certainly the next best thing and pretty close. My teeth have not felt so smooth since my last dentist appt. It takes a little to get adjusted to it. It tickles the inside of my mouth a little, but not so much that I fall on the ground laughing and can&#x27;t finish brushing :)</li>
            <li> I did not realize how much the design had changed in the past couple of years.  My new toothbrush seems very futuristic and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have had a handful of 20-30 dollar electic toothbrushes, but this is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever had!  So so Amazing! My teeth feel so clean even hours after brushing. My teeth are whiter. And I have not changed anything other than my toothbrush. I love it!!  I&#x27;ll never be able to go back to a normal toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it comes with a traveling case! Who can ask for more! This is the best!</li>
            <li> This device is used by 2 people in the household on a daily basis. The only similar product I have used is a manual toothbrush and I now prefer this one. The way the device charges is great and it does not have to be plugged in ALL the time, the charge lasts a good long time. I like the whole sonic approach to teeth cleaning and this product does a great job. A couple minor things I do not like are the brush color designators they give you in the form of little rubber rings. The rings are 3 drab colors that aren&#x27;t that much different from each other. I&#x27;d think they should be bright blue, red, yellow, green, orange. What you get is dull blue, blue/grey and white (whiskey tango foxtrot?)  The second minor thing is the cost of the replacement brushes, insane. The final thing I dislike is the sanitizer. It is a UV light, that I just read not too long ago, contains mercury. There is a warning label on the product, and my bad during research, if I had caught that before hand I would not have bought this particular model. I could live without the sanitizer. I did just fine without one for the last 4 decades. I guess it&#x27;s no worse than the newer light bulbs. Can&#x27;t we get away from household mercury? geezus, ok I digress on with the review. The quality is very good and after more than half a year I&#x27;m still pleased with the purchase. So it only get 4 stars because of the 3 negatives I mentioned. I would still recommend a Sonicare toothbrush minus the mercury.</li>
            <li> Worked ok for about a year. The prong that holds the brush head became detached so will need to replace  unit.</li>
            <li> Tooth brush died last christmas.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is really great.  It has a UV cleaner and storage space for two heads, so it works well for a couple.  It comes with a handy travel case with brush head covers.  Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are, the brush heads refills are pricey, and I&#x27;ve found the storage space gets a little gunky and needs to be scrubbed out every week or so, despite the UV disinfecting cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, I would definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Updated as it&#x27;s still working fine since I reviewed the original toothbrush. Works great. Refill brushes are easy to find at Costco. Teeth feel cleaner than cleaning with a regular toothbrush. I like it has two chargers. I don&#x27;t use the sanitizer so I use the travel charger. Takes up less space on the bathroom counter. I like the travel case too. It holds the toothbrush and two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I had my toothbrush a little over a year. Last week I was woken up in the middle of the night by a loud buzzing sound. My toothbrush had turned on and it would not turn off. The button didn&#x27;t work! It would stay on for two minutes, turn off for a few minutes and then start up again. It finally turned off so I went back to bed. About an hour later it turned on by itself. I had to put it in another room under some clothes so I could go back to sleep. It was weird and very frustrating. In a quiet house this thing sounds loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked fine for a couple of days. Today it started up again and it would stop for a few seconds, but then restart again. I contacted Phillips by chat. The CSR said because it is under the 2-year warranty they will send me another handle with a postage-paid box to send back the defective one. I asked him if this was just a bad batch of toothbrushes and did the current ones have this problem. He replied that all of them are like this when the bottom area gets moisture. I told him that I don&#x27;t get the bottom wet. I always put the toothbrush back on the charger and it sits on top of my decorative tissue box. There is no way the bottom can get wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year I would have rated this five stars. I like using the toothbrush, but it seems a big price to pay if it is only expected to last two years. The CSR said that even if I have a brand new handle from them, the original warranty date stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched online today and it seems other people have had this same problem. Very frustrating. Scary too when I&#x27;m sleeping and all of a sudden the toothbrush starts buzzing and there is no way to turn it off.starts buzzing and there is no way to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist to reduce plaque and improve gum health, I have been very satisfied that this product delivers. The oscillating action leaves your mouth feeling as though you have just had a professional cleaning. You can reach the rear molars really well and I expect my dentist will see the difference at my next dental appointment.</li>
            <li> Expensive. Worth the price and more. Powerful. Requires adaptation. Feels like a hygenist just polished your teeth. UV is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> It is really worth the money. I had a simpler one before for many years and enjoyed it a lot. This brush is even better. I like all options of cleaning for different purposes and times of the day. After brushing every time mouth feels really clean. Teeth become whiter in a short period of time without whitening toothpaste. Every time I am looking forward to brushing.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare product was recommended by my oral hygienist as I was failing with conventional brushing.  The Sonicare takes some getting used to if you&#x27;re nor accustomed to electric brushes, but perseverance pays off. The in-built timer is a real help to allow you to focus upon each quadrant in turn.  Since using the brush I have experienced no incidence of gum bleeding or soreness, and undoubtedly my teeth feel far cleaner.  The next visit to the hygienist will prove this one way or the other...  Pros:  works well, several modes of use, sterilizer unit, travel charger.  Cons:  expensive - but if this saves my dental bills, it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> Owned this unit for 3 months then, without warning, the sanitizer stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Phillips and was told that we need a new bulb and they will send us one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now 3 months later and we are still waiting for the bulb - Phillips sends us emails to let us know the bulb is on back order which is very nice but not helping us with the problem.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason we purchased this unit was because of the sanitizer.  But now that&#x27;s not working, we could have bought a cheaper unit without this sanitizer problem.&lt;br /&gt;Not very happy with Phillips.</li>
            <li> This has to be the most perfect toothbrush available. My husband and I love it. You really do get the kind of clean that you only get after getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist office. I really can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about this product except that it&#x27;s expensive. The price is worth it in the long run, however, since your dental health is important. I haven&#x27;t had a cavity yet and I was told that my gums are healthier by my dentist.  I like that it comes with a travel kit (hardcase and small adapter) which makes traveling with this tooth brush easy. Lastly, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush that can be easily shared between household members. I share mine with my husband. The UV sanitizer space is great because it helps to store and sanitize two brush heads at once. Very convenient.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> The new technology for cleaning teeth and revitalizing gum tissue is outstanding. Used with new whitening toothpaste results are good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 2 weeks and all I can say is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;! I don&#x27;t really have the time to write a drawn-out review but there are plenty of good reviews here already. All I can add is \\&quot;THEY&#x27;RE ALL TRUE!\\&quot;-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also can add some value to the reviews by providing the rebate form link (i was searching for it online and called amazon to no avail, but luckily found it in my browser history) for those buyers who purchased one before August 12th and September 2nd, 2012, with the rebate deadline being September 17th, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/00/00/25/44/06/27/2544062750._V391868398_.pdf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEND IN THE FORM BY MONDAY!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the power and how squeeky clean my teeth feel after each brushing. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cabling. I want to have it stand pretty in my bathroom but the charging cables are a little too thick and wild, but I can live with that, so all is good.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Sonicare products for 15 years without incident.  This is just another bells and whistles product to get the consumer to part with more money.  The bulb, meant to last \\&quot;5 years\\&quot; lasted less than 9 months.  Took another 5 months of complicated phone calls and backordering to get a replacement which still didn&#x27;t work.  Phillips will only replace the sanitizing unit...why would we want another unreliable piece of technology.  The whole \\&quot;germs\\&quot; thing...like one reviewer said, our mouths are full of germs.  Clean with peroxide but STAY AWAY from this model.  Simple will do the trick!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have had three of these brushes stop working on me; the brush would not engage in the handle resulting in a useless brush. Phillips promptly replaced two handles but I have given up on the third defective handle. Stay away, trust me on this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on the recommendation of my dentist. It has proved to be a very effective response to my lazy dental habits. Works great, perhaps too many features that most people will not use (\\&quot;massage\\&quot; setting? who has time for that?). Overall a solidly build, high quality product.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for two years now. First I would like to add that the warranty and the service that comes with the warranty is spectacular. Mine stopped working after 23 months of daily use, a month before the warranty ended. I contacted them and they sent one within a week!    The toothbrush itself is amazing. I cannot use a regular one now because it simply does not work half as good. Two minutes and my teeth feel like I have had a cleaning.    This item might seem pricey, but it has definitely been worth it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is excellent customer service. I have been wanting a Sonic brush for a while now and purchasing it through Vol. Inc. was the best decision I could have made. I highly recommend them as their service is top notch.</li>
            <li> Having used the Sonicare system several years ... and happy with it ... I was happy to see the new features included in this model. Philips seems to have gone back to the older vibrating &#x27;pin&#x27; which feels sturdier than the previous system.  There are lots of features with this model, which some users might find helpful.  I just use the normal brush features and it gets me good reviews from my dental hygenist .. and that&#x27;s, after all, what counts.  The only cavil I would have is, given the rather premium price for the unit, that I would have a choice of brush heads included.  I would prefer two of the the larger heads instead of one large and one small.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a fine set and seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone.  I have issues with gum recession (I am getting a gingival graft next month), primarily due to improper and excessive brushing with a regular toothbrush from a young age.  Since I have purchased this toothbrush, the gum recession has not gotten any worse, and my gums are not sore anymore.  I share the toothbrush base with my fiance (he uses a different brush head) and he does not have the gum issues that I have, but he really likes this toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much. it is very efficient for tooth brushing. it is excellent alternative to ordinary brush. i highly recomend it to every body</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic piece of technology. I waited almost a whole year to review this product so I could give an accurate review so here we go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first this is a well crafted device and it feels good in your hands. It works right out of the box (you have to put the toothbrush head on it) and when you first use it your mouth will feel as clean as it does when you leave the dental office after a cleaning. This feeling will last for a few months about 4 to 6 before you have to change the head, (they recommend ever 3 but with the included sanitizer and the easy  way they recommend brushing these heads last a long time.) and once you replace the head it starts all over again. I don&#x27;t think I can go back to the normal toothbrush now that I have spoiled my mouth with this delightful gadget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in the box is the sonic toothbrush, 2 heads (one normal sized and one small one), a charging base with an ionic sanitizer, a travel charger, and a carrying case that holds the toothbrush and 2 heads. (also included are a few interchangeable brush base rings that allow you to differentiate whose brush is whose.) Literally this is everything you will ever need short of replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonic brush has 5 modes which accommodate different durations and vibration speeds, so if you are worried whether or not this will offend your sensitive teeth try the sensitive setting and work your way up. My girlfriend did this and now she does the full clean almost every night before bed. ***One thing you should worry about initially is accidentally brushing up against your teeth with the back of the toothbrush*** It will feel offensive at first, especially if you have sensitive teeth but I assure you no damage is done, but that doesn&#x27;t mean make a habit of it. As you get accustomed to the toothbrush this happens less and less. True story: I chipped a substantial part of one of my front teeth biting my fork at breakfast and had to have an emergency resin filling, I used this on the normal setting that night without thinking and finished without even realizing I had dental work done that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build of this device is very solid, which makes sense because it is meant to vibrate at incredible speeds, the Sanitizing charging base on the other hand is not as substantial so be careful to keep this away from your counter top ledge.  Battery life on this thing is incredible. I travel for work and sometimes I am away for 2-3 weeks at a time and even though I have never brought my travel charger with me the toothbrush has never died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only true criticism I have is that the price is definitely steeper than what most people are going to be comfortable paying, and from what I am told these things do NOT have an indefinite shelf life. But the Philips customer service is outstanding, so should anything happen down the road I am sure they will do all they can to help you find a solution if one is possible. With the cost of dental work nowadays I see this toothbrush as insurance against cavities. It is worth every penny I paid for it. Literally it whitened my teeth over time, reduced the plaque that had built up from poor prior brushing/ flossing, and when used in conjunction with the waterpik water flosser took years of poor dental hygiene off of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I am extremely satisfied with it and I know you will be too.</li>
            <li> Works very well to clean my teeth that the normal toothbrush won&#x27;t. Battery lasts over 2 weeks on once a day use. Replacement heads can be pricey but i feel that this device helps me take better care of my teeth - and probably reduces the visits to the dentist. Recommend using sensitive head to prevent overbrussing.</li>
            <li> love it and my dentist appointments improved</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I purchased 4 of these units for my family.  3 of them have been replaced under warranty.  Now one of the replacements is going bad (works sometimes), and they will not replace it because it is out of the two year warranty (the warranty does not reset after they send you a new unit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The representative says they should last 3-5 years.  My model is HX6950.  She also hinted that the replacements where not brand new, but refurbished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These items are too expensive and the replacement heads ridiculously expensive.  I&#x27;m looking for other options to replace the one going bad.  Not going to throw good money after bad on this.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years.  Makes my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> So I just received the toothbrush and it seems like a really great product, but the price just went down 15 dollars the day after I bought it. Is there a way to get that money back because that&#x27;s just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2010 and it has perform flawlessly.  I used an older sonicare model for a few years prior to purchasing this one, and it was great too.  It feels like you&#x27;ve just been to the dentist after each brushing.  I couldn&#x27;t image going back to a regular brush after having used a sonicare.  It is just that good.</li>
            <li> i had this for LESS than a year and it no longer works.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my dentist-- the only thing I like about it is the UV sanitizer.  No way did I get the same clean feeling as I did with my old Oral B with floss action electric toothbrush.  It fell apart almost two years to the day.  Get yourself a nice Oral-B and a separate UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> This was my third Sonicare in approx 9 years - unfortunately they all die the same way - they just stop charging JUST after the warranty is up and Philips is unwilling to do anything except to give you a &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; to purchase another one on their website - I am stuck now with extra brush heads and no toothbrush!  Chatted online with Alan this evening (who&#x27;s English was not the best) and he told me there&#x27;s nothing they can do - brought back memories of 3 1/2 years ago when I complained that the LAST one I had also stopped working.  My husband has had a Braun AND an Oral B - both last 3 times longer than just one of my Sonicare.  No one can convince me otherwise that they don&#x27;t know what they are doing...making a defective product in China that will not last and then turning their backs on you when the product dies - even if you register it - the only &amp;#34;goodwill&amp;#34; they give is &amp;#34;allowing &amp;#34; you to purchase a new product from them again.  No thanks!  They do not care!  I&#x27;m in customer service and we would never turn our backs on customers after making defective products!  Three out of three??? Shame on ME!!!  You can NOT tell me that they do not know!</li>
            <li> I got this as a recommendation from my dentist. To clarify, they just recommended an electric sonicare type toothbrush. However, I went with this particular model because of the attached stand that held brushes. I share this with my girlfriend, so we each have our own brush heads, and having the closed stand right next to it just makes everything more convenient. She doesn&#x27;t like to brush all that long, so she goes with the regular mode, and I go with the &#x27;gum care&#x27; mode which is essentially 3 minutes. Comes with a great travel case that holds the brush as well as 2 brush heads. I&#x27;ve taken it on a few weekend trips without my charger and battery has held fine. Supposedly has 3 weeks of battery on one charge.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonic Care toothbrush. Do a much better job than a manual brush. My dentist approves (good check ups). When traveling, it stays charged for at least 1 week, but has a nice carry case and smaller charger that fits in my cosmetic bag. It is nice to use the sterilizer regularly.</li>
