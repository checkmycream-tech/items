            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>The sent is always good as is the price.  </li>
            <li>so it lasted a good time.</li>
            <li>On time as promised and good pricing.</li>
            <li>I paid good money for this perfume</li>
            <li>She loves it and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!!</li>
            <li>I just love this perfume</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance I have worn it for about 5 years now!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was very happy to see they made a mistake and sent me the same size bottle of the EDP instead which costs $20.00 more, so</li>
            <li>I am not 100% sure though.....</li>
            <li>My signature scent and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all ladies,super fast shipping and what a beautiful bottle</li>
            <li>I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Made my purchase and am not disappointed with the product with the exception of the alcohol  in it.&lt;br /&gt;Would have preferred non-alcohol product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The perfume smells wonderful and since it is co concentrated, I use far less of it (a scent is to be discovered - not announced).  </li>
            <li>I first tried this fragrance with a sampler.  </li>
            <li>Gaultier&#x27;s Classique with this lacy bodice is my favorite perfume of all...cannot beat it...always commented on and lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>But thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent almost every day since it first came out in 1993.  </li>
            <li>I love the perfume and will order it again from the same seller.</li>
            <li>being said, I believe this is an authentic product, just a different version of the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; Classique.</li>
            <li>I guess I win this round!!</li>
            <li>The scent is not always 100% the same each time I buy it or the same as when I buy it in the store but is still good.</li>
            <li>However, this is a very delicate, attractive scent and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I think that the aroma goes away too fast.</li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to a lot of smells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy mistake, especially because colors are never the same between computer screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bottle started to smell &#x27;off&#x27; after just a short time, like it must have been old to begin</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the Eau de toilette you will notice a different scent because it is not watered down.  </li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> It was a really good perfume except that it was kinda open or unsealed which was a bit awkward !!!</li>
            <li> Was not fresh.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with the product is that the spray nozzle was slightly bent but it still works.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, it is now my Girlfriend&#x27;s everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> It arrives very quickly no matter what.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why, but am leery that this is a counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn &amp;#34;Classique&amp;#34; for several years and was shocked when I opened this bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&amp;#34;t smell anything like what I&#x27;ve been using and makes me wonder if something went terribly wrong with this production or if it is not indeed what is supposed to be.....</li>
            <li> unhappy, will not purchase here again.</li>
            <li> HAS BEEN THE WORST BUY</li>

            <li> I just love this perfume I highly recommend this to all ladies,super fast shipping and what a beautiful bottle</li>
            <li> I BUY THIS PARFUM  AND WAS OPEN WITHOUT PRESSURE HAS BEEN THE WORST BUY</li>
            <li> I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS.  JUST WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Best scent I have owned!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it SAID it was jean Paul Gaultier.  This is not what it is.  They shipped me CLASSIQUE by Jean Paul.  When I phoned in the mistake they told me to send it back and they would correct it.  The 2nd one came and it was still CLASSIQUE.  I returned the 2nd one and asked for my money to be refunded.  I also told them to correct this ad. Amazon said they would.  That was 2 months ago and it is still listing the incorrect product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DISTRIBUTOR.  THEY FALSLY ADVERTISE.</li>
            <li> It arrives very quickly no matter what.  The sent is always good as is the price.  The scent is not always 100% the same each time I buy it or the same as when I buy it in the store but is still good.</li>
            <li> She loves it and it smells nice. Win/Win! I got her this 2 Christmas&#x27; ago so it lasted a good time.</li>
            <li> My son gave me this brand about two or three years ago. I am highly allergic to a lot of smells. However, this is a very delicate, attractive scent and not overpowering. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I first tried this fragrance with a sampler.  I enjoy it. Made my purchase and am not disappointed with the product with the exception of the alcohol  in it.&lt;br /&gt;Would have preferred non-alcohol product.&lt;br /&gt;I have shared this perfume with friends.</li>
            <li> I use the fragrance for years. Regretted. The product is spoofed. Do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my insolence with the same vendor with the same problem.</li>
            <li> Gaultier&#x27;s Classique with this lacy bodice is my favorite perfume of all...cannot beat it...always commented on and lasting fragrance.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> On time as promised and good pricing.</li>
            <li> Smells great (I&#x27;ve been using JPG Classique for many years), but the color is wrong.  Not sure why, but am leery that this is a counterfeit.</li>
            <li> It was a really good perfume except that it was kinda open or unsealed which was a bit awkward !!! But thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered Jean Paul Gaultier Classique EDT spray 3.4 oz .....I love the fragrance I have worn it for about 5 years now!&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to see they made a mistake and sent me the same size bottle of the EDP instead which costs $20.00 more, so I guess I win this round!! Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent almost every day since it first came out in 1993.  I couldn&#x27;t know it any better.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle started to smell &#x27;off&#x27; after just a short time, like it must have been old to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Very unhappy, will not purchase here again.</li>
            <li> I think that the aroma goes away too fast. I am not 100% sure though..... sorry.</li>
            <li> Fragrance notes are different than if purchased in retail store.  Like it had stayed on the shelf for a while.  Was not fresh.</li>
            <li> My signature scent and I love it.  If you&#x27;re used to the Eau de toilette you will notice a different scent because it is not watered down.  The perfume smells wonderful and since it is co concentrated, I use far less of it (a scent is to be discovered - not announced).  My only complaint with the product is that the spray nozzle was slightly bent but it still works.  I love the perfume and will order it again from the same seller.</li>
            <li> I have been out of my fragrance since Mother&#x27;s Day. This is the best price and was delivered as promised and in great condition. I recommend this seller without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn &amp;#34;Classique&amp;#34; for several years and was shocked when I opened this bottle.  It doesn&amp;#34;t smell anything like what I&#x27;ve been using and makes me wonder if something went terribly wrong with this production or if it is not indeed what is supposed to be..... the smell reminds me of shoe polish or nail polish.  I paid good money for this perfume and I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Girlfriend as she has a smaller bottle of Classique that was running low. As others have stated, this isn&#x27;t the same color, and is probably a slightly different scent than you may be used to. However this is likely because there are several different versions of this fragrance and they all have ever so slightly different names. It&#x27;s an easy mistake, especially because colors are never the same between computer screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I believe this is an authentic product, just a different version of the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; Classique. Regardless, it is now my Girlfriend&#x27;s everyday fragrance. Even though it isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; one, she still likes it, and therefore I like it.</li>
            <li> Just want I was looking for without the inconvenience of shopping downtown.</li>
