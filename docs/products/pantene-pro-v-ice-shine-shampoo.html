            <li>Great shampoo, I still prefer the smooth and sleek because I like my hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Eventually your hair is supposed to never produce more oil than you can rinse out with water</li>
            <li>Except that Pantene is easier to use and better smelling.</li>
            <li>but the conditioner is okay</li>

            <li>I was sure the shampoo would have leaked all over the inside of the box, but no, it was fine.</li>
            <li>The Ice Shine Shampoo has a light pleasant smell and it really does add shine to your hair.</li>
            <li>I saw this Pantene that was paraben and dye free, I thought,</li>
            <li>This shampoo as it says is silicone free</li>
            <li>I also like that it is silicone free.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>It smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, does the job of getting out all the &#x27;gunk,&#x27; and leaves your head coming out of the shower fresh!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that it got my hair clean, but it was not noticeably shiny, and with a name like &amp;#34;ice shine&amp;#34; I was expecting that.</li>
            <li>I have tried literally a 100 hair products and this shampoo/conditioner is the ONLY  thing that keeps my hair clean, shiny, preserve the color treatment of my hair AND most importantly for me keeps my face blemish free!</li>
            <li>when I got pregnant again, I just gave up.</li>
            <li>Reviewed from my 6 year old daughter \\&quot;It smells really good and makes my hair really really really really soft\\&quot;</li>

            <li>I usually have a hard time finding hair wash whichs leaves my hair in perfect condition (not too oily and not too dried out), but this product made my hair feel so awesome!</li>
            <li>I am glad they listened and brought it back.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so incredibly shiny, bouncy and soft especially when coupled with the same conditioner.</li>
            <li>i really like this version of pantene</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and the price was great.</li>

            <li>great product, I have very thin hair</li>
            <li>I used it all throughout my pregnancy and thanks to the hormones from son, I had thick, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as watery as Aqua Light, but doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down either.</li>
            <li>I started with the organics and natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I would wash it too frequently.</li>

            <li> My daughter and I have full heads of thick, wavy hair. We&#x27;ve spent hundreds on salon leave-in treatments etc... I bought this because it was on sale and we were both amazed at how great it works. It makes your hair noticeably silkier (to the eye and to the touch) and eliminates the need for any sort of frizz treatment or leave-in conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down either. My daughter is a teenager and I have my hair high and low-lighted at the salon. We will keep using this product and throw out all others. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo,,,,,,</li>
            <li> For almost 3 years I was not using shampoo; the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method they call it. In order to remove oil from your hair you use baking soda as needed and condition with vinegar. Eventually your hair is supposed to never produce more oil than you can rinse out with water and it is supposed to be lovely and natural and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started down the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; path because j wanted to avoid toxic and cancer causing chemicals in regular hair products. And I wanted to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well after 3 years I can tell you it didn&#x27;t work for me. It did seem to work for my husband but even he will use shampoo every now and then. But as a woman, with long hair and hormone fluctuation of pregnancy, my hair wound up too oily at the roots and too dry at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I got pregnant again, I just gave up. I started using shampoo again. I started with the organics and natural shampoo. They don&#x27;t clean. They just feel like you are putting grease in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this Pantene that was paraben and dye free, I thought, well, at least that&#x27;s something. I&#x27;ve always likes Pantene and this does not disappoint. I used it all throughout my pregnancy and thanks to the hormones from son, I had thick, healthy hair. It didn&#x27;t fall out or dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while toxicity is still an issue I&#x27;m facing, I don&#x27;t see any difference between this mainstream shampoo and some &amp;#34;granola&amp;#34; baking soda approach. Except that Pantene is easier to use and better smelling.</li>
            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s not as watery as Aqua Light, but doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down either. A little goes a long way, and the price was great. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I stopped using pantene when they took this off the market a couple of years ago and squandered loads of money on salon brands to get the same results I was getting from this. I am glad they listened and brought it back. Makes my hair so incredibly shiny, bouncy and soft especially when coupled with the same conditioner. If you&#x27;ve hair that needs to be washed everyday and that tends to be weighed down by products then look no further than this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Pantene</li>
            <li> Shame on Pantene for not labeling this as a Clarifying Shampoo.  My color-treated hair looked stripped and damaged in less than a week.  I threw away the shampoo but the conditioner is okay (won&#x27;t buy again, but will use).</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for hair that has more natural oil than mine.  And you can only tell how a shampoo works by trying it on your hair.</li>
            <li> great product, I have very thin hair and I would wash it too frequently. With this shampoo I&#x27;ve been able to reduce the number of times I would wash my hair and my scalp feels very clean</li>
            <li> nice cleansing shampoo with shiny results.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Didn&#x27;t dry my hair out after using it even thought I didn&#x27;t follow up with conditioner. Magnificent scent too.</li>
            <li> Everyone should strip their hair often to remove silicone and other chemicals that build-up in your hair.  This shampoo as it says is silicone free and it will strip your hair of those bad chemicals!!!</li>

            <li> The packaging somehow withstood my mail person jamming the entire box in my mailbox.  I was sure the shampoo would have leaked all over the inside of the box, but no, it was fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what that one reviewer was talking about, because this stuff didn&#x27;t strip the dyed-in colors from my hair. I usually have a hard time finding hair wash whichs leaves my hair in perfect condition (not too oily and not too dried out), but this product made my hair feel so awesome! I can&#x27;t stop touching the bounce it put in my hair.</li>
            <li> Reviewed from my 6 year old daughter \\&quot;It smells really good and makes my hair really really really really soft\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My family likes this shampoo very much. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent shampoo and does a good job onf cleaning myy hair.  Does not take a lot to do the jobl</li>
            <li> great product...good price...</li>
            <li> Pantene Ice Shine has been a life saver for me. I have tried literally a 100 hair products and this shampoo/conditioner is the ONLY  thing that keeps my hair clean, shiny, preserve the color treatment of my hair AND most importantly for me keeps my face blemish free!</li>
