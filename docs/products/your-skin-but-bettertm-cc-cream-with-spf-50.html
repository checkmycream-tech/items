    <ol>
            <li>Excellent CC cream.  </li>
            <li>I bought the medium and it was a perfect match to my skin.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>The best CC cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li>This makeup is excellent.</li>
            <li>Saw all the wonderful reviews and videos on this and HAD to give it a try.</li>

            <li>Was good for normal-dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to give it a good 5-6 pumps for a TIDBIT squirt out.</li>
            <li>I have  rosacea and it does a good job of covering my redness</li>
            <li>Good coverage.  </li>

            <li>I tried this at the recommendation of a makeup artist at a popular makeup reseller.</li>
            <li>Kind of like mint and lemon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to give this a perfect review because it&#x27;s really not that great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good color match, helps with fine lines and covers well.</li>
            <li>I especially love the SPF protection this product offers.</li>

            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup.</li>
            <li>I like using my fingers for application better.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup.  </li>
            <li>Love this because of SPF and void of toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Covers well, better than most.</li>
            <li>Wanted something more moisturizing and help with some unwanted redness in my cheek area.</li>
            <li>But Better</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.</li>
            <li>whatever that it is), but it is definitely more of a medium coverage foundation in my mind.</li>
            <li>I have a full video review on this &amp; it is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>so I have to mix it with my old L&#x27;oreal fair which kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>Color is very orange and the coverage isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>like the spill-proof packaging and the pump for easy access.</li>
            <li>I have the It Cosmetics powder foundation illuminating on order to put over this for when I have a special occasion or wish for a bit more</li>
            <li>Light and creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was love at first try!</li>
            <li>This makeup is great with enough coverage to cover redness.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance but not offensive at all.</li>
            <li>Worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li>Trying to build up Bare Minerals can act strangely on my fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just started using this product and I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>I save this for the days I don&#x27;t want to do full face.</li>
            <li>and I know it doesn&#x27;t make any sense, but even though it covers up all that you want to hide, your true skin does show through.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, not irritating, looks glowy and natural and feels just amazing.</li>
            <li>I know its pricey, but so worth it.</li>
            <li>This is okay, I tried the Light shade at ULTA and it looked rather grey</li>
            <li>been having a heat wave, and I&#x27;ve noticed this makeup stays more than the Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I put a bit of Mineral Veil (illuminating) on top for a little more finished look.</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist this product for me is pure perfection!</li>
            <li>Like the idea that this is a sunscreen first then make up.</li>
            <li>Saves so much time!</li>
            <li>This is my first foray into using a CC cream.</li>
            <li>A real winner!</li>
            <li>I wanted something with more coverage than the Bare Minerals powder foundation I have been using for years (and still like), and something with a little more moisture in it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very matte.  </li>
            <li>If there was a non spf version in this i would be much happier with the product.</li>
            <li>love the coverage and consistency, along with spf, and especially like the pump action</li>
            <li>It has done more for my dark spots than any fading cream ever did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I really like the amount of coverage that it gives - not too light, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I use medium for the natural look.  </li>
            <li>Makes my sking soft.  </li>
            <li>I found that it really was a poor color match and showed all my pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little heavy but as soon as it dries it looks nice and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>This is a good enough product, but a bit costly being that I am very disappointed that mostly half the tube is mostly AIR!</li>
            <li>So far so good, haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to it.</li>
            <li>First time I used too much, subsequently I use very little and still get the amount coverage I want.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Long wearing and not noticeable in the sun/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li> They do mention to put it on like cream and give it about 30 seconds to dry.</li>
            <li> My only consideration is that i wish it came in a few different shades.</li>

            <li> However I found it no better than any other foundation or BB cream that I have</li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy any other foundation!!</li>
            <li> and this feels heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I tried lately.</li>
            <li> For what I was looking for, I felt it was a bit expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy</li>
            <li> I hate that this has spf in it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product, not quite as good as coverage as they describe. It goes on a little heavy but as soon as it dries it looks nice and stays on all day. My skin also looks softer. They do mention to put it on like cream and give it about 30 seconds to dry. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is okay, I tried the Light shade at ULTA and it looked rather grey didn&#x27;t like it at all, but I loved the coverage it gave my skin.  Ulta didn&#x27;t have the medium in stock to try so I just purchased it on Amazon as it was the same price. The Medium shade is a bit too dark for my skin so I have to mix it with my old L&#x27;oreal fair which kind of defeats the purpose. When I run out I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
            <li> This CC cream is very nice. It has very good coverage and evens the skin tone well. In areas of redness, I did find I had to apply 2 coats. For what I was looking for, I felt it was a bit expensive so I returned it.</li>
            <li> It works OK, the coverage is not as good as advertised.  I don&#x27;t care for the way it smells.  Maybe my packaging was a little rancid.. Smelled a little like Noxema.</li>
            <li> So far so good, haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to it. First time I used too much, subsequently I use very little and still get the amount coverage I want.  Like the idea that this is a sunscreen first then make up.</li>
            <li> This makeup is great with enough coverage to cover redness. Light and creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Excellent CC cream.  I use this as a foundation.  I bought the medium and it was a perfect match to my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the cc cream been wearing it for over yr my skin looks and feels better than before. Long wearing and not noticeable in the sun/ Covers all my imperfections from roseaca it;s my skin but better.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. ..nice coverage. I wear it when  I want my complexion to look even,but not done up. Cheaper at QVC...</li>
            <li> Great product!  The best CC cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I feel that although the product was excellent I was overcharged for it.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist this product for me is pure perfection! A must buy!!!</li>
            <li> Love this makeup. Covers well</li>
            <li> My second order of It BB cream.  I use medium for the natural look.  It is an SPC of 50 so provides additional sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and smooth application. I especially love the SPF protection this product offers. It&#x27;s great to have all skin benefits in one product. Saves so much time!</li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy any other foundation!! I am in love! Worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li> I have a full video review on this &amp; it is phenomenal! Best coverage I&#x27;ve ever seen from a BB or CC type product. Works best when applied with fingers. It is lightweight, not irritating, looks glowy and natural and feels just amazing. It has a light fragrance but not offensive at all. I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone. I know its pricey, but so worth it. If you want to try it before purchase, I believe Ulta sells a mini travel size so you can try it before spending the big bucks!&lt;br /&gt;My video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;YqzHdfSVH6g</li>
            <li> The best CC cream or foundation ever. SPF 50! It has done more for my dark spots than any fading cream ever did.</li>
            <li> Product was medium coverage but I am NC 25 and medium was way too peach on me and then turned orangish. Was good for normal-dry skin. However I found it no better than any other foundation or BB cream that I have I tried lately. Would have preferred no pump on the tube.</li>
            <li> This is my first foray into using a CC cream. I tried this at the recommendation of a makeup artist at a popular makeup reseller. I wanted something with more coverage than the Bare Minerals powder foundation I have been using for years (and still like), and something with a little more moisture in it. Trying to build up Bare Minerals can act strangely on my fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was love at first try! It goes on smoothly and provides great coverage. I bought a foundation brush to put this on (not from It Cosmetics) and I like using my fingers for application better. I use 1 pump for my entire face. I put a bit of Mineral Veil (illuminating) on top for a little more finished look. I have the It Cosmetics powder foundation illuminating on order to put over this for when I have a special occasion or wish for a bit more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been having a heat wave, and I&#x27;ve noticed this makeup stays more than the Bare Minerals ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the spill-proof packaging and the pump for easy access.</li>
            <li> This is a good enough product, but a bit costly being that I am very disappointed that mostly half the tube is mostly AIR! I&#x27;ve got to give it a good 5-6 pumps for a TIDBIT squirt out. I will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.  I have  rosacea and it does a good job of covering my redness</li>
            <li> Color is very orange and the coverage isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  it goes on well, it&#x27;s very matte.  Makes my sking soft.  Good coverage.  I will buy this again</li>
            <li> This makeup is excellent. it provides excellent coverage and stays fresh all day. My only consideration is that i wish it came in a few different shades.</li>
            <li> Love this because of SPF and void of toxic ingredients. Covers well, better than most. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of mineral powder foundation. Wanted something more moisturizing and help with some unwanted redness in my cheek area. Saw all the wonderful reviews and videos on this and HAD to give it a try. I found that it really was a poor color match and showed all my pores and fine lines. It did help my redness but that&#x27;s all it helped in my situation. I think I&#x27;m going to go with Jane iredale pressed powder. It&#x27;s a good color match, helps with fine lines and covers well.</li>
            <li> love the coverage and consistency, along with spf, and especially like the pump action</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of Skin But Better and I will be coming back for a third!  Excellent coverage with a natural look and feel.  I have problem skin and this product causes zero breakouts or redness.  A real winner!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I am very pleased with it so far. It is supposedly an &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; moisturizer, serum, etc. This will be put to the test this winter. I really like the amount of coverage that it gives - not too light, not too heavy. The medium shade is perfect for my fairly light skin color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to give this a perfect review because it&#x27;s really not that great. It has the weirdest smell that I can&#x27;t even explain.  Kind of like mint and lemon and this feels heavy on the skin. I save this for the days I don&#x27;t want to do full face. I hate that this has spf in it. Spf irritates my skin to no end. If there was a non spf version in this i would be much happier with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation. I know it says that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;CC cream&amp;#34; (whatever that it is), but it is definitely more of a medium coverage foundation in my mind. Very nice finish and coverage; not cake-y at all. If you&#x27;re looking for a matte finish, this product isn&#x27;t for you. It&#x27;s crazy and I know it doesn&#x27;t make any sense, but even though it covers up all that you want to hide, your true skin does show through.</li>
