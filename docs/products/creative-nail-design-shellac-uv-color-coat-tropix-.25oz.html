            <li>Easy to apply, bright and cheerful</li>
            <li>I love cndc shellac.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>, the man at the salon \\&quot;did not recommend\\&quot; that I get a design painted over top.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li>This was surely a winner.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a matte polish - no frosty look here.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a crayons orange.</li>
            <li>It was fast and good.</li>
            <li>I hesitated to take it off on my own for fear that the shellac would come off too, but I was able to very easily only wipe away the top design.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love how CND Shellac smoothes out the ridges and makes your toes look so pretty.</li>
            <li>I ordered the color Tropix thinking it was a nice vivid coral color.  </li>
            <li>It is not neon and really matches with most everything I have worn.  </li>
            <li>This is a bright summery coral that has some pink undertones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>I just got this and put it on right away.</li>
            <li>Wipe nails down with rubbing alcohol, rinse and your good to go.</li>
            <li>I love CND shellac - and especially this color.</li>
            <li>The color is okay, but it&#x27;s definitely not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly!!</li>
            <li>The color of the bottle is more of a red than the color of the shellac.  </li>
            <li>chose not to return the incorrect polish for an exchange because that&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Color is okay not exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>Overall it is fun for summer, but not a color I will wear very often.</li>
            <li>Super fun and cute, but alas, the other (non-shellac) polish did begin chipping away after day 3.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste money in salons.</li>
            <li>I put a single coat over two coats of hot pop pink and got the nice orangy pink I was hoping for though, so not a total loss.</li>
            <li>Getting use to the limited color choices of CND Shellac and the high cost has made me very selective in ordering their polish.  </li>
            <li>However, my nails grow so quickly that I just purchased the base coat, color, and top coat so that I can touch up at</li>

            <li> Use the CND base coat, 2 coats of color, and the CND top coat for a professional looking  manicure.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this as a Christmas gift to myself (along with about 6 other colors!)</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected at all.  </li>
            <li> This color is almost a neon pink.</li>
            <li> No shimmer, just flat plain carrot/traffic cone.</li>
            <li> It took 3 to 4 coats to not be see through, because of this, it takes longer to do my nails since it is a thinner polish than other shellac colors I have.</li>
            <li> It is very pink.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to judge from the online photos but CND website has a little screen that shows all the various colors side by side for comparison.  </li>
            <li> I got black tiger stripes painted on all but my ring finger nails, and on the ring fingers I got white/silver/pink flowers.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to try it with Iced Cappucino over it sometime to give it a little shimmer.</li>

            <li> Arrived in excellent condition!!</li>
            <li> I love cndc shellac.  I goes on beautifully and stays that way until you take it off.  My last oder of cndc I ordered the color Tropix thinking it was a nice vivid coral color.  It is not what I expected at all.  It is very pink.  The product is very good; this color is misleading.</li>
            <li> I love CND shellac - and especially this color. Looks great in all seasons and not just the warmer climates.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun. It&#x27;s great for spring or summer.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the reviews about the project before purchasing. The picture uploaded of the nail polish is definitely not the same as this color. This color is almost a neon pink. The color is okay, but it&#x27;s definitely not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite summer color for my shellac manicures! Great on toes for pedis for those who wear flip flops! Great color!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly!! It&#x27;s a great summer color and makes your pop. Also, this product stays on longer than regular nail polish, and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> I just got this and put it on right away. I love it!! It&#x27;s a bright pinky orange. A great color for spring and summer. I think I&#x27;m going to try it with Iced Cappucino over it sometime to give it a little shimmer. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this as a Christmas gift to myself (along with about 6 other colors!) and am looking forward to using it this spring/summer</li>
            <li> Got very quickly and just love these nail polishes!</li>
            <li> I had this color put on in a salon and I LOVE it.  It&#x27;s a very nice &#x27;bright coral&#x27;-type of color.  It&#x27;s been 7 days and I have had no problems with the color coming off.  However, my nails grow so quickly that I just purchased the base coat, color, and top coat so that I can touch up at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the man at the salon \\&quot;did not recommend\\&quot; that I get a design painted over top.  I did it anyways.  :) He used regular polish. I got black tiger stripes painted on all but my ring finger nails, and on the ring fingers I got white/silver/pink flowers.  Super fun and cute, but alas, the other (non-shellac) polish did begin chipping away after day 3.  I hesitated to take it off on my own for fear that the shellac would come off too, but I was able to very easily only wipe away the top design.  The Shellac is still perfectly intact!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! Do not waste money in salons. Use the CND base coat, 2 coats of color, and the CND top coat for a professional looking  manicure. Wipe nails down with rubbing alcohol, rinse and your good to go. Follow drying times suggested.</li>
            <li> This color is very striking!  It&#x27;s a very summery color and looks great with a tan!  Plus, this is the \\&quot; in\\&quot; color this year.</li>
            <li> This is a great summer or vacation color.  Easy to apply, bright and cheerful, it&#x27;s perfect with summer clothing or maybe even a pick-me-up in the winter.  I&#x27;m going to try it on my toes for next vacation.  Great color for your Shellac collection.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colors. Try it with the yellow additive... it is awesome! Also great by itself.</li>
            <li> I work at a drugstore and we have hundreds  of choices of nail color to choose from.  Getting use to the limited color choices of CND Shellac and the high cost has made me very selective in ordering their polish.  This was surely a winner.  It is so hard to judge from the online photos but CND website has a little screen that shows all the various colors side by side for comparison.  This is a bright summery coral that has some pink undertones.  It is not neon and really matches with most everything I have worn.  I love how CND Shellac smoothes out the ridges and makes your toes look so pretty.</li>
            <li> Color is okay not exactly what I was expecting and I have found that the color seems to wear on the ends of the nail</li>
            <li> It was fast and good. I am happy with what I bought and to who I bought it. I would do it again.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the color I ordered. I rec&#x27;d a polish that was sort of a muddy mushroom color...yuck !&lt;br /&gt;I chose not to return the incorrect polish for an exchange because that&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. So instead, I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this color to be so different from the bottle color. It took 3 to 4 coats to not be see through, because of this, it takes longer to do my nails since it is a thinner polish than other shellac colors I have. I was expecting a bright orange-red, but this is closer to neon orange. No shimmer, just flat plain carrot/traffic cone. I put a single coat over two coats of hot pop pink and got the nice orangy pink I was hoping for though, so not a total loss. Overall it is fun for summer, but not a color I will wear very often.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites. Great summer polish. Coverage is good. This is more of a matte polish - no frosty look here.</li>
            <li> The perfect summer color.  The color of the bottle is more of a red than the color of the shellac.  This is a coral-y color that is just perfect in every way!  Looks great on any skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is a great color for hands and toes!  Color is bold &amp; bright.</li>
            <li> Bought this thinking it would be kind of a coral color..it&#x27;s more of a crayons orange. Hope to find a color to use it with, dislike it alone</li>
