            <li>Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I have paid a great deal more for a similar product through a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Easy to use before applying moisturiser and after cleansing.</li>
            <li>Skin smoother for fine lines around the eyes and absorbs well</li>

            <li>The \\&quot;smile lines\\&quot; and \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; wrinkles are fading more each day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ts light and silky, not oily.</li>
            <li>Feels fantastic on my skin</li>
            <li>I have just used it and so far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Just a drop goes a long way and my skin feels beautiful.</li>
            <li>My skin started looking better right away.  </li>
            <li>This serum works great on my skin (which is combination to dry skin).</li>
            <li>This serum is light, smooth and scent-free, it&#x27;s the most natural I could find on Amazon</li>
            <li>Great product overall, thanks!</li>
            <li>Love this product and I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>Although this product is not from a famous brand, it works very well.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for full price purchase.  </li>
            <li>This one was not like that and absorbed straight away into my skin and felt lovely.</li>
            <li>so it is getting used up rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I Couldnt recommend this more highly...</li>
            <li>serum doesn&#x27;t feel thick and is absorbed quickly; it looks great under makeup and my skin didn&#x27;t feel like loads of products had been layered on top of each</li>
            <li>35, fair, dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful product, it&#x27;s so soft and silky on your skin and absorbs instantly without leaving an oily or grease feel to my face or neck.</li>
            <li>Thanks tranquil Collection!!</li>
            <li>I have used it daily since then and can attest that it does absorb quickly into my skin and leave a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li>The product soaks into her skin almost instantly and I can honestly say when I touch her face it feels lovely and soft.</li>
            <li>I smile a lot</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results so far in the short time I’ve been using this product – this serum is not at all oily and easily absorbs into my skin leaving it smoother and clearer.  </li>
            <li>when I started using the serum, I could feel my skin tightening right away.  </li>
            <li>goes on smooth with no oily feeling.leaves skin feeling fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>Not in a &#x27;my skin is dry&#x27; kind of way</li>
            <li>I also received the product very quickly, given that I ordered during the busy holiday season.</li>
            <li>However, my skin absorbs it easily and feels so soft when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave this serum 4 stars is because the texture is more liquid than most other serums, but I know for many people this would not be a problem because it feels light, yet still deeply moisturises.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product has been very gentle and seems to be making a huge difference……</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it !</li>
            <li>I am outside in the sunshine most of the day, as I am a garden enthusiast.</li>
            <li>First time using this product.  </li>
            <li>but it absorbs pretty fast before really running!</li>
            <li>Also, I feel too much product comes out even if you depress the pump very lightly</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel super soft and it didn&#x27;t have any offensive odors.</li>
            <li>I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle at age 85 but it has softened my skin and removed that outdoor leathery look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for something to help with my wrinkles and this Serum certainly seems to be it.</li>
            <li>skin getting more loose, etc.  </li>
            <li>Funny thing is I&#x27;m older than he is.</li>
            <li>My skin is falling apart fast at 72 and it helps with age spots, wrinkles and</li>
            <li>I really hoped to like this serum, after finishing the bottle and used as instructed I did not see any results/ improvements in my skin condition at all.</li>
            <li>delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>She said it feels silky and still light enough on her skin to let it breathe.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, however, they really like it.</li>
            <li>so it works really well under make-up.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and is scent-free.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>-you can&#x27;t control how much comes out</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this product and she let me try some to help with my face chafing.  </li>
            <li>My wife said that this Vitamin C Serum left her shin feeling soft and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I am getting to those years in my life where we need to nourish our skin a little more, this product is certainly doing that.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tranquil Collection !</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a lot it absorbs fast and after applying the serum then my moisturizer over my clean exfoliated face it was so smooth and felt firm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found I can get some really high quality products very inexpensively.  </li>
            <li>Dark spots lighter, skin all together better looking.</li>
            <li>, my skin is extremely sensitive and I have no ill reaction to this</li>
            <li>I recently got this product - likely for the same reasons as others, had heard Vitamin C serum is good to combat wrinkles and help with all the anti aging things....</li>
            <li>I had previously tried another Vitamin C serum this one absorbs better and does not leave the sticky after feel to the skin.</li>
            <li>It is the only serum that I have tried that actually works, and I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and definitely is producing results.</li>
            <li>Only a small amount is need for face and neck (the pump is great, no wastage) and it leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>a product junkie and have used just about every type of skin care out there--from high end brands to drugstore stuff.  </li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe its not cool for a dude to be using this stuff but whatever!  </li>
            <li>my mom and sis will buy it again when new one is needed.</li>
            <li>Since using this product my skin is starting to feel much Smoother, softer and really nourished.</li>
            <li>The directions said to use only one pump, but to cover my whole face and under my chin I need to use two pumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week only, so I don&#x27;t know yet if it really works</li>
            <li>I  am hoping it will help keep my skin looking  and feeling soft and supple for a lot</li>
            <li>After trying out the Vitamin C Serum for a little over a month now, I can see significant changes in my face.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ben using it long enough to see any real benefits</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different products but either my face tingles or they smell funny.  </li>
            <li>After only a few weeks, I am noticing fine lines getting less noticeable.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and is scent-free.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> -you can&#x27;t control how much comes out</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product and she let me try some to help with my face chafing.  </li>
            <li> My wife said that this Vitamin C Serum left her shin feeling soft and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I am getting to those years in my life where we need to nourish our skin a little more, this product is certainly doing that.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tranquil Collection !</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot it absorbs fast and after applying the serum then my moisturizer over my clean exfoliated face it was so smooth and felt firm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found I can get some really high quality products very inexpensively.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots lighter, skin all together better looking.</li>
            <li> , my skin is extremely sensitive and I have no ill reaction to this</li>
            <li> I recently got this product - likely for the same reasons as others, had heard Vitamin C serum is good to combat wrinkles and help with all the anti aging things....</li>
            <li> I had previously tried another Vitamin C serum this one absorbs better and does not leave the sticky after feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> It is the only serum that I have tried that actually works, and I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and definitely is producing results.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is need for face and neck (the pump is great, no wastage) and it leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> a product junkie and have used just about every type of skin care out there--from high end brands to drugstore stuff.  </li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe its not cool for a dude to be using this stuff but whatever!  </li>
            <li> my mom and sis will buy it again when new one is needed.</li>
            <li> Since using this product my skin is starting to feel much Smoother, softer and really nourished.</li>
            <li> The directions said to use only one pump, but to cover my whole face and under my chin I need to use two pumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week only, so I don&#x27;t know yet if it really works</li>
            <li> I  am hoping it will help keep my skin looking  and feeling soft and supple for a lot</li>
            <li> After trying out the Vitamin C Serum for a little over a month now, I can see significant changes in my face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ben using it long enough to see any real benefits</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different products but either my face tingles or they smell funny.  </li>
            <li> After only a few weeks, I am noticing fine lines getting less noticeable.</li>
            <li> but there really is a definite softness I haven&#x27;t seen for a long time.</li>
            <li> There is no stinging, but after only a few applications, I could see the peeling of the epidermal layers that usually indicates the product is helping to promote new skin and, hopefully, new collagen production!  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because other items I ordered on the same day came a week earlier.</li>
            <li> I spend alot of time outside in a very dry climate and my face literally peels at this time of the year.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product very long --</li>
            <li> Have only used less than a week.</li>
            <li> After using it for only a few days, my skin looked healthier, smoother and it had a noticeable glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m on the other side of 50</li>
            <li> its my new beauty secret that</li>
            <li> Having used a number of Vitamin C products in the past, I&#x27;m used to the stinging sensation that typically follows application of such products.  </li>
            <li> I had one very annoying wrinkle right above my upper lip that appears to be less noticeable now that I&#x27;m using the Serum.</li>
            <li> Been using about a little over a month.</li>
            <li> so my cheeks tend to get little lines in them.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife a few weeks ago, it arrived within days of ordering so</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and neck, and after a few minutes, once it&#x27;s completely dry, I apply a thin layer of an SPF day moisturizer, and this combination makes my skin feel hydrated and elastic.</li>
            <li> I have used one in the past that remained sticky on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just this past weekend someone referred to me as my husband&#x27;s daughter.</li>
            <li> A little thin</li>
            <li> I have very delicate skin</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product and I highly recommend it!  It is the only serum that I have tried that actually works, and I have tried many products.  My skin is falling apart fast at 72 and it helps with age spots, wrinkles and it refines your skin texture.  You do have to use it once or twice a day for the results to continue of course.  I just hope they keep it at a price we can afford.  I have had communication with this company, Kdf Worldwide,  and they have been great!</li>
            <li> I really hoped to like this serum, after finishing the bottle and used as instructed I did not see any results/ improvements in my skin condition at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this before Christmas and it arrived on 12/24 just as promised.  I have used it daily since then and can attest that it does absorb quickly into my skin and leave a nice matte finish.  I apply my moisturizer after, then my foundation.  I have not noticed any &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; patches as a result of the extra product as I was expecting.  I hope to see m ore benefits as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> After trying out the Vitamin C Serum for a little over a month now, I can see significant changes in my face. Very nice feel. Absorbs quickly and definitely is producing results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife a few weeks ago, it arrived within days of ordering so delivery was very prompt. She absolutely loves it ! She said it feels silky and still light enough on her skin to let it breathe. The product soaks into her skin almost instantly and I can honestly say when I touch her face it feels lovely and soft. She said she will definitely be purchasing this product again !!</li>
            <li> I have just used it and so far so good. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot it absorbs fast and after applying the serum then my moisturizer over my clean exfoliated face it was so smooth and felt firm. I will continue to use it and see. If it continues to work this great I will continue to buy it!! Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> great product..feels good on..goes on smooth with no oily feeling.leaves skin feeling fresh and soft.I reccommend this Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> This serum works great on my skin (which is combination to dry skin). After using it for only a few days, my skin looked healthier, smoother and it had a noticeable glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum doesn&#x27;t feel thick and is absorbed quickly; it looks great under makeup and my skin didn&#x27;t feel like loads of products had been layered on top of each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this serum 4 stars is because the texture is more liquid than most other serums, but I know for many people this would not be a problem because it feels light, yet still deeply moisturises.</li>
            <li> Been using about a little over a month. Dark spots lighter, skin all together better looking. I use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin is extremely sensitive and I have no ill reaction to this serum.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 35, fair, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Can see and feel a difference in my skin. I use it on my face, neck and upper chest. Have been using it about a month. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my product Monday so I have only used it for 3 days but so far so good. I gave it 4 stars because other items I ordered on the same day came a week earlier. I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results</li>
            <li> I Purchased this product for my wife as a Christmas Gift.  We are no longer &amp;#34;Spring Chickens&amp;#34;  so this Anti Aging Moisturizer  worked fantastic.  My wife said that this Vitamin C Serum left her shin feeling soft and refreshing.  So I thank you for the wonderful Product.&lt;br /&gt;The Packaging was so attractive.</li>
            <li> I heard dr oz talk about how amazing vitamin c serum is, but I was sceptical until I tried it for myself. My face looks SO much younger! The \\&quot;smile lines\\&quot; and \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; wrinkles are fading more each day. I will never stop using this stuff. I bought my sister some for christmas.</li>
            <li> This serum is light, smooth and scent-free, it&#x27;s the most natural I could find on Amazon and I love it. I use it on my face and neck, and after a few minutes, once it&#x27;s completely dry, I apply a thin layer of an SPF day moisturizer, and this combination makes my skin feel hydrated and elastic. I also like the pump dispenser better than bottles with a dropper - one pump gives me just enough serum for my face and neck. Great product overall, thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a great value for the money. It made my skin feel super soft and it didn&#x27;t have any offensive odors. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great vitamin c serum for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a product junkie and have used just about every type of skin care out there--from high end brands to drugstore stuff.  Recently I&#x27;ve started ordering a lot of skin care from Amazon.  I&#x27;ve found I can get some really high quality products very inexpensively.  I&#x27;m in  my thirties and was definitely noticing a lack of radiance.  Vitamin c has helped brighten my skin.  I&#x27;m getting compliments again.</li>
            <li> This serum has to be used under a moisturizer. I just started using it and it seems to leave my skin smooth and healthy looking. The directions said to use only one pump, but to cover my whole face and under my chin I need to use two pumps. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Although this product is not from a famous brand, it works very well. My mom and sis was in a doubt that it would be a good one. After two weeks, however, they really like it. my mom and sis will buy it again when new one is needed.</li>
            <li> I recently got this product - likely for the same reasons as others, had heard Vitamin C serum is good to combat wrinkles and help with all the anti aging things.... skin getting more loose, etc.  I like that when I started using the serum, I could feel my skin tightening right away.  Not in a &#x27;my skin is dry&#x27; kind of way but like it was firming back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and neck/upper chest area and also still use my moisturizer.  I might start using it on the backs of my hands too, just to help ward off signs of aging there too!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results so far in the short time I’ve been using this product – this serum is not at all oily and easily absorbs into my skin leaving it smoother and clearer.  I prefer the fact that the serum is dispensed by a pump as opposed to a dropper - one pump is sufficient for my face and neck and if there is any left over, I use on my hands and elbows too.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the longer term results!</li>
            <li> This serum glides on and feels great -- not greasy!!!  Skin smoother for fine lines around the eyes and absorbs well so it works really well under make-up.  I have very delicate skin and I have no problem in continuing to use this product, enjoying the great results.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely fashion and does as promised. I have paid a great deal more for a similar product through a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a difference in the appearance of my skin. It has a softer appearance and more even.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, I love how this feels on my skin. Just a drop goes a long way and my skin feels beautiful. I have sensitive skin and this product has been very gentle and seems to be making a huge difference……&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again !!!</li>
            <li> Since using this product my skin is starting to feel much Smoother, softer and really nourished. I am very impressed with this product. Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Feedback....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, just love this Serum, it is light and feels nice on your skin and dries within seconds to feel absolutely lovely. I am getting to those years in my life where we need to nourish our skin a little more, this product is certainly doing that.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tranquil Collection !</li>
            <li> on the internet as a introduction for $5 and I think it is really good. A little thin but it absorbs pretty fast before really running! I haven&#x27;t ben using it long enough to see any real benefits but they should be showing soon.</li>
            <li> I am outside in the sunshine most of the day, as I am a garden enthusiast. With the onset of summer, I wasn&#x27;t even wearing a sun screen and my skin was looking parched with many wrinkles. This is a wonderful product that brings life back to damaged skin. I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle at age 85 but it has softened my skin and removed that outdoor leathery look. Of course the wrinkles are still with me but there really is a definite softness I haven&#x27;t seen for a long time. It almost makes me feel like I want to wear make-up again.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and smoother.  My friends tell me that my skin is looking radiant.  I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Kdf for this AMAZING Serum!</li>
            <li> First time using this product.  After only a few weeks, I am noticing fine lines getting less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the Vitamin Serum for a short time and I like that goes into your skin rather than sitting on top. I&#x27;ts light and silky, not oily. Only a small amount is need for face and neck (the pump is great, no wastage) and it leaves my skin feeling soft. The laughter lines are diminishing daily.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum was absolutely beautiful on my face. I have used one in the past that remained sticky on my skin. This one was not like that and absorbed straight away into my skin and felt lovely. I will definitely be telling my friends about it and buying it again. Thanks tranquil Collection!!</li>
            <li> great product, goes on nice and smooth..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for something to help with my wrinkles and this Serum certainly seems to be it. Love how smooth my skin feels when using it. It tightens my skin and makes me feel younger. I had one very annoying wrinkle right above my upper lip that appears to be less noticeable now that I&#x27;m using the Serum. Looking forward to even more changes as I continue to use this product. I also received the product very quickly, given that I ordered during the busy holiday season. Give the Vitamin C Serum a try. I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> This product is just beautiful!!! It a delicious serum that absorbs straight into your skin before moisturizing. I felt a change after just one week of using the product.... I Couldnt recommend this more highly... its my new beauty secret that Im telling everyone about. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Having used a number of Vitamin C products in the past, I&#x27;m used to the stinging sensation that typically follows application of such products.  This product is different.  There is no stinging, but after only a few applications, I could see the peeling of the epidermal layers that usually indicates the product is helping to promote new skin and, hopefully, new collagen production!  I&#x27;m in like!</li>
            <li> What a brilliant product !!!! Feels fantastic on my skin and I cannot wait to see the effect.  I have nothing but praise for the vendor, the product arrived within a couple of days.  I cannot recommend this vendor highly enough.  Thank you .. :-)</li>
            <li> Easy to use before applying moisturiser and after cleansing. Highly recommend giving it a try! A product I would purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love this product. Makes my skin feel like I&#x27;m 25 again!!  My skin truly feels lovely after using it.</li>
            <li> This product is smooth , light and easy to apply. It absorbs fast and is scent-free. I smile a lot and I&#x27;m on the other side of 50 so my cheeks tend to get little lines in them. This product has worked wonders on those lines. Just this past weekend someone referred to me as my husband&#x27;s daughter. Funny thing is I&#x27;m older than he is. I&#x27;ll be using this product for a very long time. I highly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Quite satisfied with the product.  I had previously tried another Vitamin C serum this one absorbs better and does not leave the sticky after feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week only, so I don&#x27;t know yet if it really works that&#x27;s why I cannot give it a five star at this time.  However, my skin absorbs it easily and feels so soft when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I can feel and see the difference in my face texture!! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nothing wonderful.  I would not recommend it for full price purchase.  Too runny.  I have seen no visible results.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful product, it&#x27;s so soft and silky on your skin and absorbs instantly without leaving an oily or grease feel to my face or neck. Love this product already and will be buying more. I have just turned 50 and with the help of this product  I  am hoping it will help keep my skin looking  and feeling soft and supple for a lot longer,,,..lol..  I&#x27;m a happy customer and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My skin is looking much more toned &amp; even. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in the appearance of fine lines around eye area.  Also, I feel too much product comes out even if you depress the pump very lightly-you can&#x27;t control how much comes out so it is getting used up rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe its not cool for a dude to be using this stuff but whatever!  I spend alot of time outside in a very dry climate and my face literally peels at this time of the year.  I have tried a few different products but either my face tingles or they smell funny.  My wife really likes this product and she let me try some to help with my face chafing.  I am very impressed.  My skin started looking better right away.  I guess we are going to have to get a his and hers bottle (do they have it in blue?)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother purchasing this product.  Been using it for a month and have notice no changes.  It dries your skin.  After it dries I do put mosturizer on.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any improvement yet. Haven&#x27;t used the product very long -- so here&#x27;s hoping improvement will be seen soon.</li>
            <li> Have only used less than a week. Happy with it so far. It goes on nice and smooth. No skin changes noticed as yet. Will cont. to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is super-moisturizing and makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works for me.  I highly recommend.</li>
