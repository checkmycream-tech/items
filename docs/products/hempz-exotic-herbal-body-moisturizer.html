            <li>By far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Love the soft but noticeable scent.</li>
            <li>far as the lotion inside, it&#x27;s definitely more perfume-y than I was expecting based on reviews.  </li>
            <li>recommend to try this product, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely had to try Hempz after it was recommended to me by my own mom.</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>My skin dries out really easily and are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have tried many many different kinds of moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Works and with a fresh scent , try em all , we did ;)</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t smelled this lotion before I purchased, but I generally love Green Tea and Pear, and I absolutely love HEMPZ lotion...</li>
            <li>it smells good and the light scent slowly disappears unless you press your nose to your skin, which i prefer.  </li>
            <li>We like the Hempz line very much</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and in my opinion is not super strong.</li>
            <li>Let me just syst by saying this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever done, because this product deserves it.</li>
            <li>I knew after the first use that I had to order some.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love Hemp lotions this is my second favorite of the different scents.</li>
            <li>The scent is great and it last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Very moisturising and smells heavenly!</li>
            <li>I love Hempz, it&#x27;s the only lotion I use.  </li>
            <li>and I love all the different scents they have!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin, absorbs pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>it is sticky at first but</li>
            <li>By far my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Very soft and true to the hemp lotions.</li>
            <li>Its a little strong when you first put it on, but the scent fades pretty quickly once absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li>Dries pretty quickly and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>Loving this Exotic Green Tea &amp; Asian Pear Hempz lotion!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast exactly what was described</li>
            <li>if you are going to use on face or if you have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This green tea and pear scent is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Hemps lotion is natural enough to use on the most sensitive of skin, even on your face, but I would recommend not using a scented Hempz but the original</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how well it moisturizes my dry skin!</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t get how freakin&#x27; hard is it to make a good bottle with a working pump?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like everything about this lotion.</li>
            <li>This is watery and I doubt it even really has hemp oil in it.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself works really well, keeps you well moisturized</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>very watery, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all.</li>
            <li>Gave it to my son for Christmas and he appreciated it.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, expected hempz thick consistancy just like the original.</li>
            <li>Heals dry skin super fast!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original since I saw it at my local tanning salon.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes really well and keeps my hands feeling soft!!</li>
            <li>Amazing, the scent is not strong just write!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>We really like the soft scent.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, not too heavy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>so I can buy a normal pump lotion to use.  </li>
            <li>This will last me and my sister and mom a long time :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my few favorite.</li>
            <li>It also applies nicely, rather than some lotions that apply too thick.</li>
            <li>only downside for me is that I don&#x27;t like the strong Asian pear scent that lingers but it smells so good,l (I love green tea smell) when you put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like it has maybe some talcum powder in it or something because when it dries, it leaves your skin so soft and smooth, yet dry like you just put some talcum powder on.</li>
            <li>(I live in New Hampshire) and this lotion smells just like them.</li>
            <li>All the Hempz moisturisers are really nice, and smell-wise, the green tea &amp; asian pear is my favourite.</li>
            <li>The green tea and asian pear kind of smells like jolly ranchers 😀</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling very soft for hours even.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night</li>
            <li>The purchase itself was incident free- arrived a day earlier than expected and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>Consider the scent to be real-pear smelling and that&#x27;s it, not green tea smelling</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, this is a bit overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I would not buy again even though it would leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s all I hoped.</li>
            <li>Wow I thought I had used all the hempz lotions and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 so far, can&#x27;t wait for the others.</li>
            <li>As for the scent, I&#x27;m not so sure about green tea, but it definitely smells like pears!</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean, and moisturizing like I&#x27;ve never experienced.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the little flies in my garden love it too :-).</li>
            <li>but they only carry two scents and I wanted to try a  new one.</li>
            <li>I have paid much higher for in other stores.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitivity to scents, &amp; it&#x27;s not extremely overpowering</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical purchasing the Green Tea and Pear scent, because it seemed almost intimidating, but it smells SO GOOD!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different Hempz lotions, and the original and the green tea &amp; asian pear are my favorites at the moment.</li>
            <li>would probably try the regular scented kind, but because of the useless bottle I will not buy again.</li>
            <li>Just received my first bottle of this moisturizer a few days ago</li>
            <li>I have noticed how remarkably soft and moisturized my skin looks, even after a long day!</li>
            <li>slightly oily, but not too much.</li>

            <li> Great for keeping your skin soft and your color nice after tanning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended for tattoos to use stuff like Lubriderm; I find this brand to actually be better than that in healing.  </li>

            <li> It is my most favorite lotion</li>
            <li> I love Hempz products.</li>
            <li> I love that its basically chemical free....but its  not as moisturizing as I would hope.</li>
            <li> Smells great, fast shipping, no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely when you apply it, without interfering with any fragrance that you may wear.</li>
            <li> This is an okay moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t perform to the level I need.</li>
            <li> love Hempz products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping this one and purchasing more for gifts</li>
            <li> bam here come another one that i love more than the rest.</li>

            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love HEMPZ.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a lighter scent which I like.</li>

            <li> If you are a frequent tanner this is a great product to use to prolong your tan.</li>
            <li> The original replenishes skin effectively, but this one has a great scent and extra supplements.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my order and it was packed well with the other items that I purchased.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion....smells great and works the same.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still to strong for me.  </li>

            <li> after five minutes or so, my skin has absorbed it and voila!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling coated with a film and absorbs quickly when applied after my shower.  </li>
            <li> The pear smell is just right, not too strong.</li>

            <li> I guess is true what they say &amp;</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body right after showering and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and how smooth and soft my skin has been after using this lotion.</li>

            <li> Absorbs quickly, not greasy and great for healing my cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but leaves my skin dry and thirsty...</li>
            <li> Feels good going on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free, oil free, sensitive skin, anti aging, all sorts!  </li>
            <li> Fast &amp; accurate delivery.  </li>

            <li> Youll smell it during application and if you sniff your skin directly, but ive never had another person comment on being able smell it on me.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the soft but noticeable scent.</li>
            <li> far as the lotion inside, it&#x27;s definitely more perfume-y than I was expecting based on reviews.  </li>
            <li> recommend to try this product, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely had to try Hempz after it was recommended to me by my own mom.</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> My skin dries out really easily and are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried many many different kinds of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Works and with a fresh scent , try em all , we did ;)</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t smelled this lotion before I purchased, but I generally love Green Tea and Pear, and I absolutely love HEMPZ lotion...</li>
            <li> it smells good and the light scent slowly disappears unless you press your nose to your skin, which i prefer.  </li>
            <li> We like the Hempz line very much</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely and in my opinion is not super strong.</li>
            <li> Let me just syst by saying this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever done, because this product deserves it.</li>
            <li> I knew after the first use that I had to order some.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love Hemp lotions this is my second favorite of the different scents.</li>
            <li> The scent is great and it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very moisturising and smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> I love Hempz, it&#x27;s the only lotion I use.  </li>
            <li> and I love all the different scents they have!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin, absorbs pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> it is sticky at first but</li>
            <li> By far my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Very soft and true to the hemp lotions.</li>
            <li> Its a little strong when you first put it on, but the scent fades pretty quickly once absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li> Dries pretty quickly and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Loving this Exotic Green Tea &amp; Asian Pear Hempz lotion!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast exactly what was described</li>
            <li> if you are going to use on face or if you have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This green tea and pear scent is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Hemps lotion is natural enough to use on the most sensitive of skin, even on your face, but I would recommend not using a scented Hempz but the original</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how well it moisturizes my dry skin!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get how freakin&#x27; hard is it to make a good bottle with a working pump?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like everything about this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is watery and I doubt it even really has hemp oil in it.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself works really well, keeps you well moisturized</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> very watery, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my son for Christmas and he appreciated it.  </li>
            <li> Great smell, expected hempz thick consistancy just like the original.</li>
            <li> Heals dry skin super fast!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original since I saw it at my local tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes really well and keeps my hands feeling soft!!</li>
            <li> Amazing, the scent is not strong just write!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> We really like the soft scent.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, not too heavy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> so I can buy a normal pump lotion to use.  </li>
            <li> This will last me and my sister and mom a long time :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my few favorite.</li>
            <li> It also applies nicely, rather than some lotions that apply too thick.</li>
            <li> only downside for me is that I don&#x27;t like the strong Asian pear scent that lingers but it smells so good,l (I love green tea smell) when you put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like it has maybe some talcum powder in it or something because when it dries, it leaves your skin so soft and smooth, yet dry like you just put some talcum powder on.</li>
            <li> (I live in New Hampshire) and this lotion smells just like them.</li>
            <li> All the Hempz moisturisers are really nice, and smell-wise, the green tea &amp; asian pear is my favourite.</li>
            <li> The green tea and asian pear kind of smells like jolly ranchers 😀</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling very soft for hours even.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night</li>
            <li> The purchase itself was incident free- arrived a day earlier than expected and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Consider the scent to be real-pear smelling and that&#x27;s it, not green tea smelling</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, this is a bit overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy again even though it would leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s all I hoped.</li>
            <li> Wow I thought I had used all the hempz lotions and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 so far, can&#x27;t wait for the others.</li>
            <li> As for the scent, I&#x27;m not so sure about green tea, but it definitely smells like pears!</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean, and moisturizing like I&#x27;ve never experienced.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the little flies in my garden love it too :-).</li>
            <li> but they only carry two scents and I wanted to try a  new one.</li>
            <li> I have paid much higher for in other stores.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitivity to scents, &amp; it&#x27;s not extremely overpowering</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical purchasing the Green Tea and Pear scent, because it seemed almost intimidating, but it smells SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different Hempz lotions, and the original and the green tea &amp; asian pear are my favorites at the moment.</li>
            <li> would probably try the regular scented kind, but because of the useless bottle I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Just received my first bottle of this moisturizer a few days ago</li>
            <li> I have noticed how remarkably soft and moisturized my skin looks, even after a long day!</li>
            <li> slightly oily, but not too much.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I had to unscrew the top, push down on the pump, and then screw the top back on the first time I used it - before that, the lotion wanted to come out of the base of the pump, rather than out of the spout.</li>
            <li> My skin soaks it right up and absorbs it all, leaving behind only soft skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to fix my dry skin if used daily</li>
            <li> Feels moisturizing and lasts for several hours in dry climate.</li>
            <li> I am a waitress, so I am constantly washing my hands, causing them to be very dry.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy it again when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> My skin soaks it up and within a few days, all of the fissures on my skin are completely healed.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after a few days use.</li>
            <li> Had to thin it down with Suave before using it comfortably.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to explore other scents but will definitely get this one again!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this lotion because it was scented, and from other reviews, the scent was strong.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hang around very long.</li>
            <li> Once it does dry, there is no oily or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin is nit dry</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of the Hempz Green Tea &amp; Asian Pear lotion.</li>
            <li> I will be making another order in the next few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really like any moisturizer I have ever smelled before.</li>
            <li> With this New England winter having so end in sight the changes from heat to freezing cold have played havoc with my already sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> : I have dry skin, hate the lotiony feel so many have.</li>
            <li> So I understand some other reviews in regards to the scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the actually legit version of the lotion or a knock off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy feeling on your skin that other lotions do.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, it works just as well as the other Hempz.</li>
            <li> Its doesnt leave your body feeling dry after a few hours of application.</li>
            <li> down side</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other scents!</li>
            <li> Feels a little lighter than some other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have trouble keeping my hands from cracking and bleeding during the winter months due to the climate and having diabetes.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face every morning and mix a bit into my liquid foundation for a less cakey look.</li>
            <li> The Asian pear thing is just a taste preference, nothing wrong with the product itself, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering throughout the day but you can definitely smell a hint of it on your skin.</li>
            <li> Sort of in between the overbearing fragrance you get with Bath &amp; Body Works and the subtle fragrance you get with regular Suave lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a mess.  </li>
            <li> Will mix with a little aloe vera gel to take that away.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> and I have been using Hempz everyday for 5 years now.</li>
            <li> One of these bottles lasts me about 4 months with everyday use.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I got the Green Tea one</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> fragrances usually offend my skin.</li>
            <li> as for the &amp;#34;Asian&amp;#34; part, I&#x27;m not sure,  </li>
            <li> Wished I would have just bought my usual Vaseline aloe brand.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they have to put dye in it, just paint the bottle...</li>
            <li> However, this lotion definitely helped solve my problem, without leaving a greasy and uncomfortable feel after applying.</li>
            <li> My skin says it sucks.</li>
            <li> I only buy hempz products and u can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, non greasy.</li>
            <li> nozzle was broken when i received it.</li>
            <li> However----the pump came broken and separated</li>
            <li> This product seriously rocks!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting it, but I am a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It is a tad on the expensive side</li>
            <li> As one who cannot tolerate fragrances, it is difficult for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too faint either.</li>
            <li> This stinks, gave it away</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> your instincts are telling you the true&amp;#34;. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so annoying,</li>
            <li> It smells like an awful perfume.</li>
            <li> The stupid PUMP DOESN&#x27;T WORK!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion!!!! I was still getting used to it always wondering what smelled so good and to keep realizing it was me.</li>
            <li> nozzle was broken when i received it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and texture of the lotion. However----the pump came broken and separated and it doesn&#x27;t work. Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Let me just syst by saying this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever done, because this product deserves it. I have sensitive skin and have tried many many different kinds of moisturizers. Fragrance free, oil free, sensitive skin, anti aging, all sorts!  I was skeptical of this lotion because it was scented, and from other reviews, the scent was strong. fragrances usually offend my skin. This lotion does NOT in any way upset my skin. It is so smooth and creamy and dries within about 2 minutes. Once it does dry, there is no oily or greasy feeling. It&#x27;s almost like it has maybe some talcum powder in it or something because when it dries, it leaves your skin so soft and smooth, yet dry like you just put some talcum powder on. It is absolutely wonderful. As for the scent, I&#x27;m not so sure about green tea, but it definitely smells like pears! as for the &amp;#34;Asian&amp;#34; part, I&#x27;m not sure,  I have a pear tree in my yard (I live in New Hampshire) and this lotion smells just like them. Authentic non-artificial smelling pear. So I understand some other reviews in regards to the scent. Consider the scent to be real-pear smelling and that&#x27;s it, not green tea smelling really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely pleased and have recommended it to all my friends.  It is a tad on the expensive side but so so worth it.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice, sweet smell that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. It&#x27;s officially my new favorite scent! It also applies nicely, rather than some lotions that apply too thick. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great product at nearly half the retail cost.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion....smells great and works the same.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance of Hempz lotion products.  I always get several at a time on Amazon because of the price.  Don&#x27;t forget gifts and have some on hand to even take to a friend in the hospital!</li>
            <li> Great product, not greasy and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I love Hempz lotions. I was buying it from the store I work for but they only carry two scents and I wanted to try a  new one. This smells great, very light and clean, and it  leaves my skin feeling wonderful. Can&#x27;t wait to explore other scents but will definitely get this one again!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! No complaints whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I really like everything about this lotion.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the lotion and it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Smell light and fresh. Good scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product! My Skin stays moist for the entire day and the smell is settle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance and I think the Hempz are all wonderful. By ordering two I got a great price and I am trying the Vanilla Plum for the first time.</li>
            <li> Mmmm.. I love this stuff. All the Hempz moisturisers are really nice, and smell-wise, the green tea &amp; asian pear is my favourite. Great price vs buying at the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> smells great and feels good.</li>
            <li> Hempz is basically the only lotion I use. This is my first time buying this scent and it&#x27;s so good!</li>
            <li> I love hempz and can&#x27;t beat the price from this seller! The green tea and asian pear kind of smells like jolly ranchers 😀</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer with a clean smell. Love it</li>
            <li> Not as impressed as with the Pomegranate Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Fresh, clean, and moisturizing like I&#x27;ve never experienced.</li>
            <li> Smells great but I still get ashy</li>
            <li> Constantly looking for wonderful smelling body lotion and this is it! Smells fabulous silky smooth absorbs quickly it is perfect!  My new favorite and it is vegan which makes it even more perfect!! Love love love this bought two bottles and will be ordering more. XOXO</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, great to put on after a hot shower</li>
            <li> It smells very nice, but the feel of the lotion is just ok; kinda watery. Not sure if this is the actually legit version of the lotion or a knock off.</li>
            <li> Great, all natural product.</li>
            <li> Smells so good!  It doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy feeling on your skin that other lotions do.</li>
            <li> smells great.  I&#x27;ve been using the original since I saw it at my local tanning salon.  Great for keeping your skin soft and your color nice after tanning.  great moisturizer, also great if you have tattoos.  It&#x27;s recommended for tattoos to use stuff like Lubriderm; I find this brand to actually be better than that in healing.  Hemp is a great thing and I love how this brand has used it.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described and i love the Hempz</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of the Hempz Green Tea &amp; Asian Pear lotion. I knew after the first use that I had to order some. I love the scent and how smooth and soft my skin has been after using this lotion. This will be the only lotion I will be purchasing for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> The best lotion i have ever used so far. It isnt greasy , you can tell it actually moisterizes. Its doesnt leave your body feeling dry after a few hours of application. Its just a overall good lotion its worth the price even if you are paying 23.00 a bottle i use this lotion eveyday</li>
            <li> This stinks, gave it away</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping! I love hempz lotion, it absorbs so quickly, and this smell is great.</li>
            <li> A wee bit greasy.  Had to thin it down with Suave before using it comfortably.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous !</li>
            <li> Love everything about this lotion.  It has a wonderful scent, takes just a moment to absorb which is a must for me, and the price makes sense for the size of the bottle.  To top it off it arrived on time and was packaged quite efficiently.  Will definitely buy it again when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic!!! It&#x27;s refreshing to put on and smells so good! I can&#x27;t wait to try other scents! thank you!</li>
            <li> All of the hempz line is great</li>
            <li> Was looking for something similar to the body shop hemp lotion.  This is watery and I doubt it even really has hemp oil in it.  My skin says it sucks.</li>
            <li> great product and will keep on using it till they run out.</li>
            <li> I love Hemp lotions this is my second favorite of the different scents. It has a cool relaxing smell. It&#x27;s not over powering at all. I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever!</li>
            <li> Smells good and is a great lotion</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing. The scent is great and it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Absorbs quickly, not greasy and great for healing my cracked skin.</li>
            <li> If you have allergies same away. It smells like an awful perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but leaves my skin dry and thirsty... Disappointed. Wished I would have just bought my usual Vaseline aloe brand.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, the smell is so good. Very soft and true to the hemp lotions.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; and I tried this lotion while visiting his parents. I have trouble keeping my hands from cracking and bleeding during the winter months due to the climate and having diabetes. This lotion doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. My skin soaks it up and within a few days, all of the fissures on my skin are completely healed. We really like the soft scent. They make a triple moisture one, but my fianc&amp;eacute; was allergic and his hands broke out in hives.</li>
            <li> It smells okay.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special about it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t say it does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just okay, probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, non greasy. I have really sensitive skin and this lotion works great. does not leave that greasy oily feel when used.</li>
            <li> This is really good, super smooth skin without greasy feeling.  Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Always amazing lotion. 100% genuine product of the name brand. Thank you! The scent is not too heavy. It&#x27;s light &amp; the moisture you get with these products is always amazing. I&#x27;ve also seen them used in nail spas for manicures as well as pedicures.</li>
            <li> Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> such an awesome lotion</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well!!!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this scent.</li>
            <li> It is great moisturizer, but I find the smell is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, arrived super quick</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Dries pretty quickly and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, shipped quickly, and well priced</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. It smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious. Goes on smooth, no clumps. Doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue. Feels a little lighter than some other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. The only complaint I have is that I had to unscrew the top, push down on the pump, and then screw the top back on the first time I used it - before that, the lotion wanted to come out of the base of the pump, rather than out of the spout. Strange.</li>
            <li> Great transaction!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how well it moisturizes my dry skin!</li>
            <li> Love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t hang around very long. Very moisturizing but not at all heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; accurate delivery.  Product just as described.  Loving this Exotic Green Tea &amp; Asian Pear Hempz lotion!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have every flavor they offer, and am really stuck on this one right now!!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell and the bottle is so cute and reusable, I love this product</li>
            <li> Liked the original so much that I sent this one to my daughter in law who works on a ranch in Wy and she loved it</li>
            <li> Love Hempz. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love this scent as well!</li>
            <li> Works and with a fresh scent , try em all , we did ;)</li>
            <li> Nice! Item as described!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I like the scent, which starts out kind of strong and softens nicely. Unfortunately the little flies in my garden love it too :-). Feels good going on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion, leaves my skin moisturized smells so so good and leaves my skin healthy looking also</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, not too heavy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;Nice light fragrance!</li>
            <li> I swear by Hempz! It is my most favorite lotion and I have been using Hempz everyday for 5 years now. I put on, all over my body, after I get out of the shower. It glides on very smooth so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, so your bottle of lotion will last awhile. One of these bottles lasts me about 4 months with everyday use. Hemps lotion is natural enough to use on the most sensitive of skin, even on your face, but I would recommend not using a scented Hempz but the original if you are going to use on face or if you have super sensitive skin. This green tea and pear scent is pretty nice. Its a little strong when you first put it on, but the scent fades pretty quickly once absorbed into skin. If you are a frequent tanner this is a great product to use to prolong your tan. Also any hempz lotion is great on sunburns. Apply 2-3 times the day u get a sunburn and it&#x27;ll be gone the next day, even on the fairest of skin. It&#x27;ll have your skin looking healthy &amp; rejuvenated, and feeling soft and silky. I am a skin care consultant and I always recommend this product. Love this brand! I get compliments everywhere I go on my skin and I always tell them it&#x27;s Hempz!!</li>
            <li> I like the scent, it works just as well as the other Hempz. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I love Hempz lotions, I purchased this scent based on another reviewer saying it has a very light smell, well...  if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, this is a bit overpowering.  I tried it twice just to give it a fair shot and it&#x27;s still to strong for me.  The lotion itself works really well, keeps you well moisturized and your skin feels nice.  I will stick to the original Hempz.</li>
            <li> I do not like this scent at all. Has a bug spray smell to it. Must be the pear scent. I would not buy again even though it would leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is a good smelling and soft non greasy lotion.</li>
            <li> Hempz makes a wonderful product.  This smells divine !!! Moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz products. They are great moisturizers and don&#x27;t leave your skin oily. I tried this because I wanted to try a different smell. It is okay, but I like the original the best.</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body right after showering and it is fantastic. I also use it on my face every morning and mix a bit into my liquid foundation for a less cakey look. The smell is lovely and in my opinion is not super strong. Youll smell it during application and if you sniff your skin directly, but ive never had another person comment on being able smell it on me.</li>
            <li> Lov sit love it love it! Very moisturising and smells heavenly! Will buy over and over again!</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like cheaper lotions. Smells pretty good. Not sure why they have to put dye in it, just paint the bottle...</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t smelled this lotion before I purchased, but I generally love Green Tea and Pear, and I absolutely love HEMPZ lotion... it wasn&#x27;t as great of a scent as I had anticipated, but it&#x27;s still good, and the lotion is just as good as any other scent.  The purchase itself was incident free- arrived a day earlier than expected and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I like it....I love that its basically chemical free....but its  not as moisturizing as I would hope.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lotion. Smells amazing doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and makes my hands so soft</li>
            <li> It smells real good and leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> this is an awesome lotion. the smell is awesome, it&#x27;s absorbent and its made from hemp.&lt;br /&gt;will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I love Hempz, it&#x27;s the only lotion I use.  This new scent is awesome.  I took the bottle to work to use there.  All the girls in the office use it too.</li>
            <li> Hempz lotion is awesome, not greasy and works wonders. Keeps me from turning into a lizard in AZ</li>
            <li> Smells great, fast shipping, no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Rich, smooth and smells lovely...this is a light rich feeling moisturizer. It smells lovely when you apply it, without interfering with any fragrance that you may wear. This it 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li> The lotion was excellent.  But the fragrance was too strong.  As one who cannot tolerate fragrances, it is difficult for me.I am sticking to the original.</li>
            <li> This is an okay moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t perform to the level I need.</li>
            <li> Love it! Next time I will try the Pomegranate.</li>
            <li> love Hempz products. This one smells delicious</li>
            <li> Love love love the scent of this! While it feels nice and silky going on the hands, the smell is wonderful. My mom stands by this stuff, she always has a bottle of it, so I decided to try it and so far it&#x27;s all I hoped.</li>
            <li> I will be making another order in the next few days. It is great! I&#x27;m going to stock up.</li>
            <li> Amazing, the scent is not strong just write!</li>
            <li> The original replenishes skin effectively, but this one has a great scent and extra supplements. The fragrance is a nice bonus as well.</li>
            <li> I was going to give it to someone as a gift, but I love the smell and how it absorbs so easily without leaving a greasy feel. I&#x27;m keeping this one and purchasing more for gifts</li>
            <li> Wow I thought I had used all the hempz lotions and bam here come another one that i love more than the rest. this smells so good &amp; feels nice on your skin. I would say this is my favorite scented lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not too heavy. Love the soft but noticeable scent.</li>
            <li> I bought the pomegranate but it smelled too girly so i gave it to my wife.  i like this in the morning after i shower.  goes on smooth and not too greasy, but you can feel it moisturize.  it smells good and the light scent slowly disappears unless you press your nose to your skin, which i prefer.  good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great! Would order again:)</li>
            <li> Love this and great price!</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!! Feels nice too!!</li>
            <li> Great lotion and smells terrific! Same quality as any Hempz brand item I have paid much higher for in other stores.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin soft and smells really good.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a pleasant fresh scent. Not too overpowering &amp; it isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, smells very nice.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing and feels great on my skin! I use it every evening after my shower and I feel so healthy and clean! It seems to fix my dry skin if used daily and I love all the different scents they have! I&#x27;ve tried 3 so far, can&#x27;t wait for the others.</li>
            <li> Ordered again.wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin hydrated all day but it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> The pear smell is just right, not too strong. I really like this scent. I&#x27;ve tried different Hempz lotions, and the original and the green tea &amp; asian pear are my favorites at the moment.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice and makes skin soft</li>
            <li> If you like Hempz lotion this is a fine addition to anyone&#x27;s collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for me is that I don&#x27;t like the strong Asian pear scent that lingers but it smells so good,l (I love green tea smell) when you put it on. The Asian pear thing is just a taste preference, nothing wrong with the product itself, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering throughout the day but you can definitely smell a hint of it on your skin.</li>
            <li> With this New England winter having so end in sight the changes from heat to freezing cold have played havoc with my already sensitive skin.  Because I&#x27;ve already use discovered Hempz Body Washes I decided to give the moisturizer a try.  And I love it!  It&#x27;s smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling coated with a film and absorbs quickly when applied after my shower.  The moisturized feeling lasts all day long and even makes my husband say I smell good at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> It worsen my skin condition.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! It has a light scent and spreads on my skin smoothly. I am very happy with my order and it was packed well with the other items that I purchased.</li>
            <li> Excellent products! Super Fast Shipping! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love Hempz, and Amazon has good prices</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting it, but I am a little disappointed.  It feels watery and the pump doesn&#x27;t work. For the only reason that I am not sending it back is because I already opened it to try.  I guess if I wan&#x27;t the really thing I better purchase it at a hair salon.  I guess is true what they say &amp;#34;when it sounds to good to be true your instincts are telling you the true&amp;#34;. :(</li>
            <li> Love the smell and that it&#x27;s not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> We like the Hempz line very much</li>
            <li> This has a light, non-chemical scent. Feels moisturizing and lasts for several hours in dry climate.</li>
            <li> This product seriously rocks!</li>
            <li> The stupid PUMP DOESN&#x27;T WORK!!  It&#x27;s so annoying, I have to unscrew the cap every time to get some out and it&#x27;s just a mess.  I&#x27;m looking forward to it running out so I can buy a normal pump lotion to use.  I just don&#x27;t get how freakin&#x27; hard is it to make a good bottle with a working pump?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the lotion inside, it&#x27;s definitely more perfume-y than I was expecting based on reviews.  Sort of in between the overbearing fragrance you get with Bath &amp; Body Works and the subtle fragrance you get with regular Suave lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably try the regular scented kind, but because of the useless bottle I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> awesome lotion. quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;not a greasy lotion&lt;br /&gt;ordered 4 more!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It moisturizes really well and keeps my hands feeling soft!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is a great consistency.  Not too oily.  Smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I love using this for my body and using the ogx peppermint teatree oil lotion for my face. Green tea helps cure bruises and blemishes fast, which i constantly get between dirtbiking and hitting my shins on the dishwasher like ALL THE TIME. But seriously, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> very watery, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize at all.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. slightly oily, but not too much. Will mix with a little aloe vera gel to take that away.</li>
            <li> Fast exactly what was described</li>
            <li> Great value:) fast service! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Okay.. not as good as Lotion for Everyone.. feels glued on after shower..</li>
            <li> The good about this lotion:  Smells wonderful. It has to be one of the silkiest feeling lotions. I love the way it feels in my hands and just feels wonderful when applying. Doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin, absorbs pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The down side: I have dry skin, hate the lotiony feel so many have. I have to reapply later in the day, it disappears, leaving my skin feeling and looking chalky. Because of that my upper arms start itching. This started the 2nd day of using.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to try this product, it would be worth it. Too bad I can&#x27;t use it. I will use it on my legs(works fine there) till it is gone.</li>
            <li> Best after sun and everyday lotion. Really works!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night and I love it. I got the Green Tea one and I applied it like almost 18 hours ago. My skin is nit dry AT ALL. My skin dries out really easily and are very sensitive. These smell good too and it is sticky at first but after five minutes or so, my skin has absorbed it and voila! No more dry skin. It doesnt take much lotion too so thats great. This will last me and my sister and mom a long time :)</li>
            <li> Definitely had to try Hempz after it was recommended to me by my own mom.I have noticed how remarkably soft and moisturized my skin looks, even after a long day! I am a waitress, so I am constantly washing my hands, causing them to be very dry. However, this lotion definitely helped solve my problem, without leaving a greasy and uncomfortable feel after applying. My skin soaks it right up and absorbs it all, leaving behind only soft skin. I was a bit skeptical purchasing the Green Tea and Pear scent, because it seemed almost intimidating, but it smells SO GOOD! I actually prefer this scent over the Pomegranate! Love it! By far my new favorite lotion. I&#x27;ve already bought three!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping excellent buy</li>
            <li> LOVE it!!!  Gave it to my son for Christmas and he appreciated it.  I use the regular scent on me and grandgirls regularly.  Heals dry skin super fast!!  I highly recommend.  Please don&#x27;t ever run out!</li>
            <li> Love this, smells wonderful and absorbs quickly leaves skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> This very Light &amp; Soothing... And Smells Wonderful!  No Need for Perfume.. Non irritating.. light enough for your face even.</li>
            <li> Just received my first bottle of this moisturizer a few days ago &amp; I love it. My skin feels so soft after a few days use. I have a sensitivity to scents, &amp; it&#x27;s not extremely overpowering and it&#x27;s not too faint either. It&#x27;s not really like any moisturizer I have ever smelled before. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, well worth the cost</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love HEMPZ. I&#x27;m obsessed, amazing product, great smell, leave the skin feeling great, lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice it&#x27;s more of a lighter scent which I like. It leaves your skin feeling very soft for hours even. I only buy hempz products and u can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Great smell, expected hempz thick consistancy just like the original. It&#x27;s my few favorite.</li>
