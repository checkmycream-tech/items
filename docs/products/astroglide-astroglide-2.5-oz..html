            <li>After our Astroglide discovery, I no longer bleed out of my hoo-hah post coitus, nor do I smell like a freshly cleaned Chevy El Camino at night.  </li>
            <li>Good lubricant for vaginal sex and other fun things, not recommended for anal sex</li>
            <li>I bought it at Walgreens on sale and it gets sticky pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great, just not too consistent, need something a little thicker</li>
            <li>Especially good when things are tight or you want extra lubrication.</li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few different lubes and of all of them this one works the best for the purpose it is needed for.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very slippery!</li>
            <li>Off topic, but why is the sexual wellness section of Walgreens same as the feminine care aisle?</li>
            <li>You have to be careful with the kind of skin, I had problems with it, because it produce irritation on the skin</li>
            <li>Makes intimacy more intimate by not having to worry about one age related problem.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough is running better than normal.</li>
            <li>Boy us it good and last a long ass time..</li>
            <li>Longer lasting then the natural lube from Astroglide, great for long sessions!</li>
            <li>My hubby and I just found about Astroglide for the first time just last week, and we loved it so much we felt the need to give it its due praise on the internet.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>it gets really sticky fast.</li>
            <li>Works really well for</li>
            <li>Well I guess I can tell you that it&#x27;s not irritating</li>
            <li>We, of course, didn&#x27;t expect much from a you know Walmart product.</li>
            <li>It then becomes very sticky very rapidly.</li>
            <li>Better than other name brands.</li>
            <li>other reasons why i didnt give it a 5-star but one things for sure</li>

            <li>Maybe this ones for a couple that has pain for more coating but on a regular basis, no thanks.</li>
            <li>Unscented, does help lubricating the area and feels very natural.</li>
            <li>I love this product but this is the small bottle.  </li>
            <li>Old time customer!</li>
            <li>We came across this product at Walmart and that was the only one looked decent there.</li>
            <li>While searching through the aisles in Walmart for my eye drop solution, I accidentally picked up a bottle of Astroglide instead (a silly, yet honest mistake as I couldn&#x27;t see for the life of me since running out of my eyedrops).  </li>

            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t require such a long entry to be submitted...</li>
            <li> It is very liquid and hard to apply without getting everywhere.</li>
            <li> , it is very sticky and thick.</li>
            <li> The wife is a bit dry these days and this helps</li>
            <li> This product especially enhances a hindered condom interface.  </li>
            <li> For unknown reasons, Astroglide is listed under the Amazon category &amp;#34;Eye Care, Eye Drops, Lubricants and Washes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way but it does have a smell to it and it does have a taste to it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not my first pick.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried probably over 5 other products before.</li>
            <li> It stays really long and didn&#x27;t just evaporate in few minutes.</li>
            <li> Doesnt get sticky like other brands.</li>
            <li> Real wet though.</li>
            <li> Got this at a store because they didn&#x27;t have our typical lube (Sliquid Organics).</li>
            <li> Puts a little lube on the rail.</li>
            <li> the texture is fine but after a little while or after you&#x27;ve used it it&#x27;s sticky which is quite annoying.</li>
            <li> All the others are a combined waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It worked well for a few seconds and then got sticky.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> I feel so awkward browsing the same aisle as them</li>
            <li> After a painful experience of squirting a tablespoon of Astroglide into my eyes, my lifesaver of a partner read the bottle and brought to my awareness that this product is not for eyes, but instead a personal lubricant for my downstairs engine room if you know what I mean...</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes terrible.</li>

            <li> Boy us it good and last a long ass time..hehe. don&#x27;t even ask me how</li>
            <li> Works OK, but just saw it in Meijer twice cheaper.</li>
            <li> We were using the &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; form of this and that kind is WAY better. This one is a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have tried several lubricant brands.  Astroglide is the best without question.  All the others are a combined waste of money.  This product especially enhances a hindered condom interface.  It is also the best &amp;quot;personal&amp;quot; lubricant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best lube I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> Gets the job done! ;)</li>
            <li> My hubby and I just found about Astroglide for the first time just last week, and we loved it so much we felt the need to give it its due praise on the internet.  While searching through the aisles in Walmart for my eye drop solution, I accidentally picked up a bottle of Astroglide instead (a silly, yet honest mistake as I couldn&#x27;t see for the life of me since running out of my eyedrops).  After a painful experience of squirting a tablespoon of Astroglide into my eyes, my lifesaver of a partner read the bottle and brought to my awareness that this product is not for eyes, but instead a personal lubricant for my downstairs engine room if you know what I mean... To our delightful surprise, Astroglide was exactly what we had needed for the past 65 years. It wasn&#x27;t until our third or fourth date back in &#x27;49 when my husband just couldn&#x27;t turn on my downstairs sprinkler system if you catch my drift...wink, wink.  For the next 6 decades we had no choice but to create a cocktail of motor oil, windex, and vaseline to have even close to a friction-free, pork-sesh.  After our Astroglide discovery, I no longer bleed out of my hoo-hah post coitus, nor do I smell like a freshly cleaned Chevy El Camino at night.  Thank you, Astroglide, for allowing me to take good care of my cooter!</li>
            <li> it gets really sticky fast. so-so</li>
            <li> Great product. No issues</li>
            <li> yes you can slip a truck in a dog house with it!!</li>
            <li> Works great, much sex was had.</li>
            <li> Me and my wife love this stuff.</li>
            <li> fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Works really well for toys XP Doesnt leave you feeling gross afterwards. Buying a bigger one next time :)</li>
            <li> Love this version, much better than the gel. Is very comfortable to use</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t require such a long entry to be submitted...lets just say its all used up...and it was enjoyed lol</li>

            <li> Good lube. Easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lube.......sex lube! It works............it works good! What else is there to say? Well I guess I can tell you that it&#x27;s not irritating n it has extremely low odor! It smells like..........Lube!n it&#x27;s very slippery!</li>
            <li> It worked well for a few seconds and then got sticky.  It became the opposite of lubricant.  Stay with KY</li>
            <li> Makes intimacy more intimate by not having to worry about one age related problem.</li>
            <li> WAYYYYYY BETTER THAN KY.</li>
            <li> The wife is a bit dry these days and this helps</li>
            <li> Non greasy, non stycky. Doesn&#x27;t irritates me or my partner. Unscented, does help lubricating the area and feels very natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I bought it at Walgreens on sale and it gets sticky pretty quickly. Off topic, but why is the sexual wellness section of Walgreens same as the feminine care aisle? I feel so awkward browsing the same aisle as them LOL.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few different lubes and of all of them this one works the best for the purpose it is needed for.</li>
            <li> I love this product but this is the small bottle.  I assumed it was larger but that is my fault.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite lube. It feels sticky and when pouring it from the bottle its stringy. Definitely not my first pick.</li>
            <li> I found this product...lacking. You see, I mistakenly thought this was Auto Lube and now my car just purs like a kitten. Oddly enough is running better than normal.</li>
            <li> Always comes quickly. Good lubricant for vaginal sex and other fun things, not recommended for anal sex</li>
            <li> We came across this product at Walmart and that was the only one looked decent there. We, of course, didn&#x27;t expect much from a you know Walmart product. To our surprise, it was actually the best lub we have used so far. We&#x27;ve tried probably over 5 other products before. It stays really long and didn&#x27;t just evaporate in few minutes. Also, the bottle lasts forever. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way but it does have a smell to it and it does have a taste to it. Real wet though.</li>
            <li> Works alright but then it gets sticky when it dries</li>
            <li> Awesome. Doesnt get sticky like other brands.</li>
            <li> Good product and discreet delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, and this has always been my favorite lubricant. It doesn&#x27;t get sticky or mealy like so many others.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Delivered on time. I would refer a friend.</li>
            <li> Provides just enough wetness when needed.</li>
            <li> Got this at a store because they didn&#x27;t have our typical lube (Sliquid Organics). This stuff is horrible. It is very liquid and hard to apply without getting everywhere. It then becomes very sticky very rapidly. By the end of the night, everything was sticky. Do not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> When you need to lubricate, this is the gold standard. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Me and my partner love it! So silky smooth it made out sex much more exciting an pleasurable</li>
            <li> For unknown reasons, Astroglide is listed under the Amazon category &amp;#34;Eye Care, Eye Drops, Lubricants and Washes&amp;#34;. I would strongly suggest NOT putting Astroglide in your eyes :)</li>
            <li> Works great, just not too consistent, need something a little thicker but I love this product!</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s  nice and slippery!  Never had any reactions to this brand! Old time customer!</li>
            <li> Im not sure other reasons why i didnt give it a 5-star but one things for sure, it is very sticky and thick. Maybe this ones for a couple that has pain for more coating but on a regular basis, no thanks.</li>
            <li> I can get into any anal cavity with ease with this stuff.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> very good soooo nice weee loveeee ittttt</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered this as I didn&#x27;t want the look at the clerk at target</li>
            <li> As the Hodgetwins all you is two drops</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> excellent for when you and your partner are in the mood. relieves dryness and makes your time together pleasureable</li>
            <li> the texture is fine but after a little while or after you&#x27;ve used it it&#x27;s sticky which is quite annoying.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with the kind of skin, I had problems with it, because it produce irritation on the skin and it is also too sticky.</li>
