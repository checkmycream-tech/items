            <li>&lt;br /&gt;smells great</li>
            <li>This is a great hair product for finishing hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but i should have noted the size of the container.  </li>
            <li>Also holds great.  </li>
            <li>The product smells great, but the positives end there.</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li>is, so I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>After many years of searching this is probably the best hair product ever made for stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li>However, the smell is so so good.</li>
            <li>and I have heard good things about Aveda clay.</li>
            <li>, the product itself smells like vanilla bean, soooo good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;d be the perfect product for me if it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I have the Silky Dirt that comes in a tube too, and loved the scent of it....</li>
            <li>This takes care of the frizz and it smells sensational.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy to be able to help someone</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to, perfect manageability.  </li>
            <li>I would have to order more!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this hair product!</li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>rinses out nicely, holds not to well, but suffices...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread as evenly or nicely on your hand or hair, and feels sticky and gooey.  </li>
            <li>It takes forever to warm up in my hands</li>
            <li>I rub it with my fingers before I put it on her hair to kind of melt it.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s not gel, smells nice,</li>
            <li>This gives your hair a bit of a &amp;#34;day after washing&amp;#34; kind of look.</li>
            <li>and I really liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since cut it shorter and am doing more of a pomade kind of look, so</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much or it will make your hair look oily--takes a bit of practice to find the perfect amount, but if you like Jonathan Product stuff, this is worth a try!</li>
            <li>I think crew fiber is better for hold</li>
            <li>Any more</li>
            <li>I GLAD</li>
            <li>: 10 - best smell out of any hair product I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot) - with Tigi Bedhead Manipulator coming in tied or second, smell-wise.&lt;br /&gt;Washing</li>
            <li>like this way better than products tried, which include:&lt;br</li>
            <li>(If I add water to my hair each hour, it looks OK --</li>
            <li>If I accidentally use more than that, things will get clammy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li>In either situation, this product tames my unruly hair with just a tiny bit...and makes me smell awesome to boot!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This works well, and has the fabulous smell too!  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair product and it smells like almond cookies-good stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>Now I have to spend more and get the product that worked for me.</li>
            <li>Also, many had aromas that turned me off.</li>
            <li>I also found that it works better on almost bone-dry hair.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Take some more and rub it on select strands of hair and then to keep it in place</li>
            <li>This product did not work as well as I had hoped, but it was better than some I have tried</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, after trying many products without finding the right one, and after continuous good reviews at Amazon, and everywhere else, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Goes on just right and looks good too.  </li>
            <li>It works well and it is best applied when your hands or hair is just a bit wet.</li>
            <li>this is not really the best product.</li>
            <li>Did not receive 5 stars because 1) had no real hold, although it does provide excellent control and an awesome look, and 2) hair will eventually get puffy in humid weather or after sweating - but less so than with most products</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;washes out easy</li>
            <li>Out: 10 - washes out easy, even alone with water.&lt;br /&gt;Ease</li>
            <li>the product, in the container, seems like it smelled too feminine and too strongly, and 5)</li>
            <li>but they all had really strong smells.  </li>
            <li>is ideal for me to get all the desired effects (for 4-5&#x27;&#x27;  long hair).</li>
            <li>Best texturizing paste hands down.</li>
            <li>9 - it allows fine hair to be managed and styled perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li>Great for short fine hair</li>
            <li>Bought this product after reading the reviews and giving up on cheap salon products.  </li>
            <li>so here I am trying to smooth the clumps out.  </li>
            <li>It has a light hold</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I initially was turned off to this product the most by it, in all honesty, after actually using it, I have concluded that the very best thing about this product is the smell.  </li>
            <li>I originally came to my hair stylist with a picture of a girl who&#x27;s chin length hair was layered, chunky looking and with ends that flared out.  </li>
            <li>Does not make my hair look dull, gives it a nice shine and gives it great texture.</li>
            <li>If you have short hair I am sure it probably works amazing.</li>
            <li>Clean and works as described.</li>
            <li>My hair was still soft and malleable to the touch, and the product smelled pretty nice after it was in my hair(straight out of the tin has a chemically smell, but it gets better).  </li>
            <li>I was told this product was a good replacement for American Crew Fiber - that is, matte and strong, but I find the Dirt Texturizing paste isn&#x27;t as strong as the American Crew Fiber Paste nor does it keep a matte finish, it makes the hair kind of shiny.</li>
            <li>Firstly, this seemingly-costly product is actually more economical than cheaper alternatives I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;m still halfway through the can</li>
            <li>Good for pixie cuts and short styles.  </li>
            <li>my other reviews, you can see I am a very fair reviewer, and typically positive.</li>
            <li>which allows the more sculpted/dressier/more styled hair and is an excellent product, and use Dirt for casual styles,</li>
            <li>never flakes, always keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking, and sometimes my hair even looks better the next morning.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the bomb... thought they stopped making it but luckily found it here.</li>
            <li>perfect for short hair i use in combination with sumo wax red container.</li>
            <li>After 20+ years, I&#x27;ve finally found a hair style that I&#x27;m happy with thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li>this product, I can restore the tousled morning-after look by puffing my hair out at the top (where it tends to fall flat), straighten the sides, and raise the matte-factor for better tinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The normal size I bought a while ago and made the mistake of not checking to make sure.</li>
            <li>Super long lasting and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and not overpowering when applied - although it woud seem overpowering an a little concentrated when smelling from the container.  </li>
            <li>now to the review this product is wonderful for my short mohawk style cut does not leave my hair hard or unmanageable; it smells great and doesnt become chalky [leave white residue] on the hair.</li>
            <li>forget about rinsing it, takes so many shampoo sessions to really get it out, holds very well, also sticky like pomade  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that the texture was a big deal to be honest.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as well and American Crew products.</li>
            <li>But if you haven&#x27;t found anything you like I think this stuff is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and in the winter I have to deal with static.</li>
            <li>, I got a similar line product before and liked it</li>
            <li>If you want more hold, it combined pretty well with normal gel for</li>
            <li>Just too many other products that I like better.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day, rinses right out no problem.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the styling pastes out there hold well and have the right texture but the manufacturers add a ton of fragrance to mask the chemical smell of their product.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t quite have the right texture to keep my bangs in place.  </li>
            <li>I just haven&#x27;t found the right amount that works yet.  </li>
            <li>That said, it does do an OKAY job and smells nice, but at almost double the price of American Crew</li>
            <li>It is great on all lengths of short hair and is easy to use and does not weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li>It does emulsify easily in the hands and IS easy to spread on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>However, the product does do exactly what it claims to do - that is - make the hair look and feel like it has been a day or 2 after washing.  </li>
            <li>will keep Jonathan Dirt in my arsenal for daily use, but am till in the quest to a product to use when more hold/dressier/more styled hair is needed (i.e. events, outings, parties).  </li>
            <li>I made sure I played enough with it to dissolve on my hands and then applied.  </li>
            <li>It has a really funny smell and does not work that well.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li>but it held my hairdo pretty well even after putting on a helmet to ride my bike.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product and will buy it again when I run out ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if perhaps I should try to nuke the paste first and see how that works cause</li>
            <li>To achieve the same look I needed more than just a hair cut</li>
            <li>more like I wash it every two days and the product lasts until the next wash.  </li>
            <li>Dirt Texturizing paste smells good, and it&#x27;s a stiff product to get out of the jar.  </li>
            <li>I tried pomade: holds very well, but is sticky to the point where on a windy day in the city, you have wonderful random bits in your hair.  </li>
            <li>While I was using this, it was around 5-6 inches long most places.</li>
            <li>, I tried this smaller size (a larger size is available too) after reading the Amazon reviews, however thought that maybe this product was geared more for mens hair, and often products for men have a &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; aroma added to them, which I certainly don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>: rinses out easily, holds ok, doesn&#x27;t last long though.  </li>
            <li>I can do little touch-ups on dry hair too with very good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>colour has gone from a dark brown to more of a white, and the consistency is a lot more \\&quot;gluggy\\&quot; and it feels a lot \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, works pretty well, but if you want a super strong hold, you&#x27;ll want something different.</li>
            <li>This is a huge plus after wearing my hair in a pony tail for several months while allowing it to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this my whole life, and here we have it.</li>
            <li>ITS OK, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li>Can get oily if too much is applied, but not too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was much happier with &amp;#34;Dirty&amp;#34; than this product..</li>
            <li>Very embarrssing.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>recently heard that Jonathan products (although he has nothing to do with them anymore) were available at Duane Reade.</li>
            <li>The product I received either is a knock off or they really changed the product.  </li>
            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As the day progresses, it smells less of vanilla bean and more of almonds (within minute).  </li>
            <li>: 4 - More hold than pomades (but matte finish), less hold than clays, waxes or putties.&lt;br /&gt;Control:</li>
            <li>I did not notice a difference in how my hair felt now vs. previous uses; hopefully there will not be any issues with the consistancy of the product because I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>- I wanted something that would make my super short hair a bit more &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; in order to keep it&#x27;s slightly spiky &amp; separated, textured look.</li>
            <li>I must say I was quite pleased with the results after my initial use, and have just now ordered the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to make your hair stiff or have super strong hold, but if you want a soft medium hold, it should work.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>: rinses out nicely, holds very well, but clumps, looks and feels like plastic when dry (and always looks wet)  </li>
            <li>Hair looks natural and good without looking dry or overly wet.  </li>
            <li>Due to the fact that it provides so much control, and you will have a styled and messy, piece-y hairstyle, one can forego literal \\&quot;hold\\&quot; for control - unless you wanteach strand to like a certain way, or want actual spikes or anime-hair, the control it has is a perfect substitute for traditional \\&quot;hold.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feel like it is not as strong as other people described.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t going to be able to keep your hair firmly in place or anything.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m also really glad to get rid of my heavy hair for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying the new one when this one runs</li>
            <li>Was hesitant to try this product at first, since 1) other than online retailers, it is only physically available at Duane-Reade, which is a pharmacy in  the NY/NJ area, 2)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alterna Hemp Concrete (I like the hold and texture of Concrete better, but it builds up and is hard to wash of - see my review for that</li>
            <li>Although it can be applied (as per the instructions) on damp har as well as dry hair, it looks much better when applied on dry</li>
            <li>But heed my words, on the hair itself after a few minutes, the smell is the BEST thing about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has no real hold, unless you use double or triple the supposed amount to be applied (which is still not much)</li>
            <li>I have long dark &amp; very fine hair</li>
            <li>this stuff smells good, and as long as I take a long long time to get it incorporated, it works well enough to control frizz and curl.</li>
            <li>new jar had some air bubbles on top - the old product felt way to thick to produce air bubbles.  </li>
            <li>Dirt&#x27;s exceptionally long lasting  (used in  the morning, it&#x27;ll remain fairly effective after an active day &amp; night out), and even after that, it wears out gradually and</li>
            <li>really much hold&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t seems to last all day&lt;</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep your hair as soft as I would like it.</li>
            <li>Old product was creamy with an opalescence.  </li>
            <li>My hair has that \\&quot;day after wash\\&quot; look to it ( where the \\&quot;day of wash\\&quot; look is usually super light, soft and fluffy hair and \\&quot;day after wash\\&quot; hair isn&#x27;t greasy but now lays down and has some control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I can&#x27;t say this product is exactly what I was  hoping for (to me, it could be a tiny bit less &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;) it does provide more stiffness than the Kenra #13 does, it hardly has a smell to it,.</li>
            <li>I feel like there must be better products and this container was very very small.</li>
            <li>I love that I only have to use a small amount</li>
            <li>What I do is scoop out a bit (about the size of my top knuckle) put it in the palm of my hand, dry, rub my hands together to spread it evenly over both hands, drip a little water on each hand, rub them together again and run through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Sephora stopped carrying it (but only in the stores, they still sell it online), 3) the container lid does not seem too fancy (seems a little cheap even, although without the lid, the container does seem fancier), 4)</li>
            <li>Can be piled on (re-applied at night, the next day, and the next night, even if you did not wash your hair) without any real buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recently I cut off my thick waist length hair and donated it to Locks For Love.  </li>
            <li>This used to be a fantastic product, but they have reformulated it and now it is not nearly as nice.  </li>
            <li>BedHead Manipulator - barely stands humidity, may spill when travelling&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much, as it will look crusty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Kenra #13 product for a few years now, but wasn&#x27;t quite right</li>
            <li>Just a brief background, I&#x27;m Asian, a guy, short straight black hair, that just wants to stand perpendicular from my scalp, yes even on the sides, so I look like a koosh ball without any product in my hair.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is very slight and neither irritating nor pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have thick coarse Indian hair and this texturing wax is exactly what I need to give my straight hair some body.</li>
            <li>One was the old formula and the other the new.</li>
            <li>is not stiff - feels natural (but a little oily, as it would be if you had not washed it in 2 days).  </li>
            <li>Aveda Control Paste was getting too expensive and hard to find and this has been a great alternative.  </li>

            <li> is, so I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> After many years of searching this is probably the best hair product ever made for stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> However, the smell is so so good.</li>
            <li> and I have heard good things about Aveda clay.</li>
            <li> , the product itself smells like vanilla bean, soooo good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;d be the perfect product for me if it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I have the Silky Dirt that comes in a tube too, and loved the scent of it....</li>
            <li> This takes care of the frizz and it smells sensational.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy to be able to help someone</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to, perfect manageability.  </li>
            <li> I would have to order more!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this hair product!</li>
            <li> amazing</li>
            <li> rinses out nicely, holds not to well, but suffices...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spread as evenly or nicely on your hand or hair, and feels sticky and gooey.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to warm up in my hands</li>
            <li> I rub it with my fingers before I put it on her hair to kind of melt it.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s not gel, smells nice,</li>
            <li> This gives your hair a bit of a &amp;#34;day after washing&amp;#34; kind of look.</li>
            <li> and I really liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since cut it shorter and am doing more of a pomade kind of look, so</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much or it will make your hair look oily--takes a bit of practice to find the perfect amount, but if you like Jonathan Product stuff, this is worth a try!</li>
            <li> I think crew fiber is better for hold</li>
            <li> Any more</li>
            <li> I GLAD</li>
            <li> : 10 - best smell out of any hair product I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot) - with Tigi Bedhead Manipulator coming in tied or second, smell-wise.&lt;br /&gt;Washing</li>
            <li> like this way better than products tried, which include:&lt;br</li>
            <li> (If I add water to my hair each hour, it looks OK --</li>
            <li> If I accidentally use more than that, things will get clammy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> In either situation, this product tames my unruly hair with just a tiny bit...and makes me smell awesome to boot!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This works well, and has the fabulous smell too!  </li>
            <li> My favorite hair product and it smells like almond cookies-good stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Now I have to spend more and get the product that worked for me.</li>
            <li> Also, many had aromas that turned me off.</li>
            <li> I also found that it works better on almost bone-dry hair.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Take some more and rub it on select strands of hair and then to keep it in place</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well as I had hoped, but it was better than some I have tried</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after trying many products without finding the right one, and after continuous good reviews at Amazon, and everywhere else, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Goes on just right and looks good too.  </li>
            <li> It works well and it is best applied when your hands or hair is just a bit wet.</li>
            <li> this is not really the best product.</li>
            <li> Did not receive 5 stars because 1) had no real hold, although it does provide excellent control and an awesome look, and 2) hair will eventually get puffy in humid weather or after sweating - but less so than with most products</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;washes out easy</li>
            <li> Out: 10 - washes out easy, even alone with water.&lt;br /&gt;Ease</li>
            <li> the product, in the container, seems like it smelled too feminine and too strongly, and 5)</li>
            <li> but they all had really strong smells.  </li>
            <li> is ideal for me to get all the desired effects (for 4-5&#x27;&#x27;  long hair).</li>
            <li> Best texturizing paste hands down.</li>
            <li> 9 - it allows fine hair to be managed and styled perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li> Great for short fine hair</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading the reviews and giving up on cheap salon products.  </li>
            <li> so here I am trying to smooth the clumps out.  </li>
            <li> It has a light hold</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I initially was turned off to this product the most by it, in all honesty, after actually using it, I have concluded that the very best thing about this product is the smell.  </li>
            <li> I originally came to my hair stylist with a picture of a girl who&#x27;s chin length hair was layered, chunky looking and with ends that flared out.  </li>
            <li> Does not make my hair look dull, gives it a nice shine and gives it great texture.</li>
            <li> If you have short hair I am sure it probably works amazing.</li>
            <li> Clean and works as described.</li>
            <li> My hair was still soft and malleable to the touch, and the product smelled pretty nice after it was in my hair(straight out of the tin has a chemically smell, but it gets better).  </li>
            <li> I was told this product was a good replacement for American Crew Fiber - that is, matte and strong, but I find the Dirt Texturizing paste isn&#x27;t as strong as the American Crew Fiber Paste nor does it keep a matte finish, it makes the hair kind of shiny.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this seemingly-costly product is actually more economical than cheaper alternatives I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;m still halfway through the can</li>
            <li> Good for pixie cuts and short styles.  </li>
            <li> my other reviews, you can see I am a very fair reviewer, and typically positive.</li>
            <li> which allows the more sculpted/dressier/more styled hair and is an excellent product, and use Dirt for casual styles,</li>
            <li> never flakes, always keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking, and sometimes my hair even looks better the next morning.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb... thought they stopped making it but luckily found it here.</li>
            <li> perfect for short hair i use in combination with sumo wax red container.</li>
            <li> After 20+ years, I&#x27;ve finally found a hair style that I&#x27;m happy with thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> this product, I can restore the tousled morning-after look by puffing my hair out at the top (where it tends to fall flat), straighten the sides, and raise the matte-factor for better tinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The normal size I bought a while ago and made the mistake of not checking to make sure.</li>
            <li> Super long lasting and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and not overpowering when applied - although it woud seem overpowering an a little concentrated when smelling from the container.  </li>
            <li> now to the review this product is wonderful for my short mohawk style cut does not leave my hair hard or unmanageable; it smells great and doesnt become chalky [leave white residue] on the hair.</li>
            <li> forget about rinsing it, takes so many shampoo sessions to really get it out, holds very well, also sticky like pomade  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that the texture was a big deal to be honest.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as well and American Crew products.</li>
            <li> But if you haven&#x27;t found anything you like I think this stuff is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and in the winter I have to deal with static.</li>
            <li> , I got a similar line product before and liked it</li>
            <li> If you want more hold, it combined pretty well with normal gel for</li>
            <li> Just too many other products that I like better.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day, rinses right out no problem.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the styling pastes out there hold well and have the right texture but the manufacturers add a ton of fragrance to mask the chemical smell of their product.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t quite have the right texture to keep my bangs in place.  </li>
            <li> I just haven&#x27;t found the right amount that works yet.  </li>
            <li> That said, it does do an OKAY job and smells nice, but at almost double the price of American Crew</li>
            <li> It is great on all lengths of short hair and is easy to use and does not weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> It does emulsify easily in the hands and IS easy to spread on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> However, the product does do exactly what it claims to do - that is - make the hair look and feel like it has been a day or 2 after washing.  </li>
            <li> will keep Jonathan Dirt in my arsenal for daily use, but am till in the quest to a product to use when more hold/dressier/more styled hair is needed (i.e. events, outings, parties).  </li>
            <li> I made sure I played enough with it to dissolve on my hands and then applied.  </li>
            <li> It has a really funny smell and does not work that well.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> but it held my hairdo pretty well even after putting on a helmet to ride my bike.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and will buy it again when I run out ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if perhaps I should try to nuke the paste first and see how that works cause</li>
            <li> To achieve the same look I needed more than just a hair cut</li>
            <li> more like I wash it every two days and the product lasts until the next wash.  </li>
            <li> Dirt Texturizing paste smells good, and it&#x27;s a stiff product to get out of the jar.  </li>
            <li> I tried pomade: holds very well, but is sticky to the point where on a windy day in the city, you have wonderful random bits in your hair.  </li>
            <li> While I was using this, it was around 5-6 inches long most places.</li>
            <li> , I tried this smaller size (a larger size is available too) after reading the Amazon reviews, however thought that maybe this product was geared more for mens hair, and often products for men have a &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; aroma added to them, which I certainly don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> : rinses out easily, holds ok, doesn&#x27;t last long though.  </li>
            <li> I can do little touch-ups on dry hair too with very good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> colour has gone from a dark brown to more of a white, and the consistency is a lot more \\&quot;gluggy\\&quot; and it feels a lot \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, works pretty well, but if you want a super strong hold, you&#x27;ll want something different.</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus after wearing my hair in a pony tail for several months while allowing it to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this my whole life, and here we have it.</li>
            <li> ITS OK, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Can get oily if too much is applied, but not too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was much happier with &amp;#34;Dirty&amp;#34; than this product..</li>
            <li> Very embarrssing.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> recently heard that Jonathan products (although he has nothing to do with them anymore) were available at Duane Reade.</li>
            <li> The product I received either is a knock off or they really changed the product.  </li>
            <li> and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the day progresses, it smells less of vanilla bean and more of almonds (within minute).  </li>
            <li> : 4 - More hold than pomades (but matte finish), less hold than clays, waxes or putties.&lt;br /&gt;Control:</li>
            <li> I did not notice a difference in how my hair felt now vs. previous uses; hopefully there will not be any issues with the consistancy of the product because I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> - I wanted something that would make my super short hair a bit more &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; in order to keep it&#x27;s slightly spiky &amp; separated, textured look.</li>
            <li> I must say I was quite pleased with the results after my initial use, and have just now ordered the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to make your hair stiff or have super strong hold, but if you want a soft medium hold, it should work.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> : rinses out nicely, holds very well, but clumps, looks and feels like plastic when dry (and always looks wet)  </li>
            <li> Hair looks natural and good without looking dry or overly wet.  </li>
            <li> Due to the fact that it provides so much control, and you will have a styled and messy, piece-y hairstyle, one can forego literal \\&quot;hold\\&quot; for control - unless you wanteach strand to like a certain way, or want actual spikes or anime-hair, the control it has is a perfect substitute for traditional \\&quot;hold.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feel like it is not as strong as other people described.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t going to be able to keep your hair firmly in place or anything.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m also really glad to get rid of my heavy hair for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying the new one when this one runs</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to try this product at first, since 1) other than online retailers, it is only physically available at Duane-Reade, which is a pharmacy in  the NY/NJ area, 2)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alterna Hemp Concrete (I like the hold and texture of Concrete better, but it builds up and is hard to wash of - see my review for that</li>
            <li> Although it can be applied (as per the instructions) on damp har as well as dry hair, it looks much better when applied on dry</li>
            <li> But heed my words, on the hair itself after a few minutes, the smell is the BEST thing about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has no real hold, unless you use double or triple the supposed amount to be applied (which is still not much)</li>
            <li> I have long dark &amp; very fine hair</li>
            <li> this stuff smells good, and as long as I take a long long time to get it incorporated, it works well enough to control frizz and curl.</li>
            <li> new jar had some air bubbles on top - the old product felt way to thick to produce air bubbles.  </li>
            <li> Dirt&#x27;s exceptionally long lasting  (used in  the morning, it&#x27;ll remain fairly effective after an active day &amp; night out), and even after that, it wears out gradually and</li>
            <li> really much hold&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t seems to last all day&lt;</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep your hair as soft as I would like it.</li>
            <li> Old product was creamy with an opalescence.  </li>
            <li> My hair has that \\&quot;day after wash\\&quot; look to it ( where the \\&quot;day of wash\\&quot; look is usually super light, soft and fluffy hair and \\&quot;day after wash\\&quot; hair isn&#x27;t greasy but now lays down and has some control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I can&#x27;t say this product is exactly what I was  hoping for (to me, it could be a tiny bit less &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;) it does provide more stiffness than the Kenra #13 does, it hardly has a smell to it,.</li>
            <li> I feel like there must be better products and this container was very very small.</li>
            <li> I love that I only have to use a small amount</li>
            <li> What I do is scoop out a bit (about the size of my top knuckle) put it in the palm of my hand, dry, rub my hands together to spread it evenly over both hands, drip a little water on each hand, rub them together again and run through my hair.  </li>
            <li> Sephora stopped carrying it (but only in the stores, they still sell it online), 3) the container lid does not seem too fancy (seems a little cheap even, although without the lid, the container does seem fancier), 4)</li>
            <li> Can be piled on (re-applied at night, the next day, and the next night, even if you did not wash your hair) without any real buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently I cut off my thick waist length hair and donated it to Locks For Love.  </li>
            <li> This used to be a fantastic product, but they have reformulated it and now it is not nearly as nice.  </li>
            <li> BedHead Manipulator - barely stands humidity, may spill when travelling&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much, as it will look crusty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Kenra #13 product for a few years now, but wasn&#x27;t quite right</li>
            <li> Just a brief background, I&#x27;m Asian, a guy, short straight black hair, that just wants to stand perpendicular from my scalp, yes even on the sides, so I look like a koosh ball without any product in my hair.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is very slight and neither irritating nor pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse Indian hair and this texturing wax is exactly what I need to give my straight hair some body.</li>
            <li> One was the old formula and the other the new.</li>
            <li> is not stiff - feels natural (but a little oily, as it would be if you had not washed it in 2 days).  </li>
            <li> Aveda Control Paste was getting too expensive and hard to find and this has been a great alternative.  </li>
            <li> (Packaging changed slightly too with the new \\&quot;get dirty\\&quot; writing on the label).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have very straight hair that looks dull and falls volumeless &amp; flat after showers, and sides grow perpendicular to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, they don&#x27;t tend to last for the long haul...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I run out, but will probably stick to American Crew in the long run.</li>
            <li> This worked much better than the first mousse I tried (which made hair hair stiff, crispy, and unpleasant).</li>
            <li> bought the product hoping for matte hold of my hair (which is short, thick, and straight).</li>
            <li> Rewind 06 - not impressed at all, too shiny, cheap feeling, chemical smelling</li>
            <li> This is the paste texturizing paste I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dirt for a long time.  </li>
            <li> i use it on my long hair it gives volume and texture smells</li>
            <li> It actually leaves little white blobs in my hair because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; well into my hands to incorporate into my hair  </li>
            <li> You can apply it dry for a textured matte feel.  </li>
            <li> Let it air dry for 10 minutes or so and ruffle your hair with a towel.</li>
            <li> Although there is no real hold, it does look natural and does create a messy, structured style.  </li>
            <li> ... I typically use American Crew Fiber or Molding Clay.</li>
            <li> This little bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s like pomade where it just weighs my hair down and by the end of the day my hair is flat.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product and likes it enough that I hunted it down on Amazon for him!  </li>
            <li> Always looks wet.  </li>
            <li> Want a wet look?  </li>
            <li> Use it on wet hair to have a gel-like look without the clumps.  </li>
            <li> For now, I alternate with [[ASIN:B0028NE9X6 Matrix Vavoom Messy Couture Molding Paste, 1.7 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected...</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This can be a disadvantage for some, as it demands careful adjustment unlike a spray, but it also makes this product extremely economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Extreme texture, looks like no product was applied (almost).  </li>
            <li> It feels as if the other reviews on this product were written by employees from \\&quot;Jonathan\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> contrary to other reports, it clumps on me.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the back of my finger nail to scrap a bit of it out and rub it between my two fingers.</li>
            <li> When my hair is still wet out of the shower, I rub this in the palm of my hands with a little water then run it through my hair.</li>
            <li> (in fact, the only ones I have found that prevent puffiness are clays and hard to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have to be very careful with the AMOUNT, less than a pea-sized piece, smoothed out into my palms and diluted with water</li>
            <li> Price not worth the size</li>
            <li> , I would say it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> The subject line of my review says it all.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the day at the office, if you tussle your hair a little bit (maybe to scratch it a little bit), it starts dusting.  </li>
            <li> but then it gets a little oily.  </li>
            <li> : Little hold.  </li>
            <li> This product smells a little bit like cake batter.  </li>
            <li> No texture (Does not group hair or enable molding, it is simply too weak of a product)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Kenra #13 was a little too greasy, but everything else I experimented with, both &amp;#34;salon only&amp;#34; and store brands were either too greasy or way too waxy.</li>
            <li> If my hair is even a little bit too damp</li>
            <li> Crew Fiber - hard to manipulate, too thick, Grooming Cream - too shiny, not enough</li>
            <li> My hair is too thin and short</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend for people who wear their hair in a messy style.</li>
            <li> This product dried out my hair, leaving it heavy and a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I bought the old one.</li>
            <li> REALLY well, especially on thick hair, which I have.  </li>
            <li> use it, take a very small amount (like roughly pea sized) and rub it in to the palm of your hand with a little water until it&#x27;s creamy.</li>
            <li> hair still feels touchable as the two products do not leave my hair feeling sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard others say it is impossible to apply too much</li>
            <li> Note the size is small -- 1.7oz.</li>
            <li> However, the hold seems to wane as the day goes on, but I&#x27;m not sure if that was the product or from</li>
            <li> so it lasts forever, if I start getting a few split ends it helps hide them, and that it helps with fly-aways!  </li>
            <li> Just be advised that this is the small travel size.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find products that do not make my hair feel sticky or stiff!  </li>
            <li> So I went on a mad hunt for this, but unfortunately not many places sell it locally anymore -  in hopes for an alternative</li>
            <li> and u can hardly spread it on hair</li>
            <li> You can even fix it late in the day with just damp hands.  </li>

            <li> It is so so thick that it is difficult to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li> (I would equate the strength of hold to that of a very weak mousse)&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it fails to keep my hair molded throughout the day, perhaps lasts a couple hours</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wanted to see how this would work on shoulder length hair. It works well and it is best applied when your hands or hair is just a bit wet. If you have short hair I am sure it probably works amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair is too thin and short so it didn&#x27;t give it any texture. However, the smell is so so good.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;washes out easy&lt;br /&gt;smells great&lt;br /&gt;notshiny&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;not really much hold&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t seems to last all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend for people who wear their hair in a messy style. If you want to style your hair up or in a position and want to have it stay this is not really the best product. I think crew fiber is better for hold and I have heard good things about Aveda clay.</li>
            <li> After many years of searching this is probably the best hair product ever made for stubborn hair.  Just a brief background, I&#x27;m Asian, a guy, short straight black hair, that just wants to stand perpendicular from my scalp, yes even on the sides, so I look like a koosh ball without any product in my hair.    I tried gel: rinses out nicely, holds very well, but clumps, looks and feels like plastic when dry (and always looks wet)  I tried mousse: rinses out easily, holds ok, doesn&#x27;t last long though.  Always looks wet.  I tried pomade: holds very well, but is sticky to the point where on a windy day in the city, you have wonderful random bits in your hair.  It also takes maybe 2+ times to shampoo it out!  I tried wax: forget about rinsing it, takes so many shampoo sessions to really get it out, holds very well, also sticky like pomade  I tried matte: rinses out nicely, holds not to well, but suffices... However, they don&#x27;t tend to last for the long haul...  Maybe 5-6 hours tops.  By the end of the day at the office, if you tussle your hair a little bit (maybe to scratch it a little bit), it starts dusting.  Any more and it looks like someone antiqued you.    Then there&#x27;s Johnathan&#x27;s Dirt.  Holds like a pomade, applies like a matte, rinses like a matte, and lasts all day.  You can even fix it late in the day with just damp hands.  You can apply it dry for a textured matte feel.  Want a wet look?  Use it on wet hair to have a gel-like look without the clumps.  It&#x27;s not sticky either like pomade.  At the end of the day, rinses right out no problem.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this my whole life, and here we have it.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the product and how hard it is to work into my hair makes me skeptical to reccomed it. I feel like there must be better products and this container was very very small.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product for finishing hair. Have used dirt paste for years and will continue to.</li>
            <li> Feel like it is not as strong as other people described. Maybe I did not put enough? I do not know.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but i should have noted the size of the container.  Price not worth the size, the product itself smells like vanilla bean, soooo good. but it fails to keep my hair molded throughout the day, perhaps lasts a couple hours and then it&#x27;s like pomade where it just weighs my hair down and by the end of the day my hair is flat.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse Indian hair and this texturing wax is exactly what I need to give my straight hair some body. I will buy another jar before I go on vacation. You only need a dime size to do the trick.</li>
            <li> ITS OK, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to try this product at first, since 1) other than online retailers, it is only physically available at Duane-Reade, which is a pharmacy in  the NY/NJ area, 2) Sephora stopped carrying it (but only in the stores, they still sell it online), 3) the container lid does not seem too fancy (seems a little cheap even, although without the lid, the container does seem fancier), 4) the product, in the container, seems like it smelled too feminine and too strongly, and 5) the consistency, before scooping it out of  the container and emulsifying it, seems like t was too caked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after trying many products without finding the right one, and after continuous good reviews at Amazon, and everywhere else, I decided to try it.  AM I GLAD I DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I initially was turned off to this product the most by it, in all honesty, after actually using it, I have concluded that the very best thing about this product is the smell.  It smells like vanilla bean and almond paste.  As the day progresses, it smells less of vanilla bean and more of almonds (within minute).  I find myself running my hands though the hair just to smell them.  The smell is great and not overpowering when applied - although it woud seem overpowering an a little concentrated when smelling from the container.  But heed my words, on the hair itself after a few minutes, the smell is the BEST thing about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has no real hold, unless you use double or triple the supposed amount to be applied (which is still not much) but then it gets a little oily.  However, the product does do exactly what it claims to do - that is - make the hair look and feel like it has been a day or 2 after washing.  Although there is no real hold, it does look natural and does create a messy, structured style.  Due to the fact that it provides so much control, and you will have a styled and messy, piece-y hairstyle, one can forego literal \\&quot;hold\\&quot; for control - unless you wanteach strand to like a certain way, or want actual spikes or anime-hair, the control it has is a perfect substitute for traditional \\&quot;hold.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to be a hardened, cake-paste, which is what I prefer.  It does emulsify easily in the hands and IS easy to spread on dry hair.  Although it can be applied (as per the instructions) on damp har as well as dry hair, it looks much better when applied on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Extreme texture, looks like no product was applied (almost).  SMELLS excellent, makes me wanna eat my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is not stiff - feels natural (but a little oily, as it would be if you had not washed it in 2 days).  Can be piled on (re-applied at night, the next day, and the next night, even if you did not wash your hair) without any real buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Little hold.  Can get oily if too much is applied, but not too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: 4 - More hold than pomades (but matte finish), less hold than clays, waxes or putties.&lt;br /&gt;Control: 9 - it allows fine hair to be managed and styled perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: 10 - best smell out of any hair product I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot) - with Tigi Bedhead Manipulator coming in tied or second, smell-wise.&lt;br /&gt;Washing Out: 10 - washes out easy, even alone with water.&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Use: 10 - no science, just scoop, rub palms together, and apply.&lt;br /&gt;Feel in the hair: 9 - feels like there is no product in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Humidity Resistance: 4 - will eventually get puffy in humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Does exactly what it is supposed to, perfect manageability.  Did not receive 5 stars because 1) had no real hold, although it does provide excellent control and an awesome look, and 2) hair will eventually get puffy in humid weather or after sweating - but less so than with most products (in fact, the only ones I have found that prevent puffiness are clays and hard to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this way better than products tried, which include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tigi BedHead Manipulator - barely stands humidity, may spill when travelling&lt;br /&gt;Alterna Hemp Concrete (I like the hold and texture of Concrete better, but it builds up and is hard to wash of - see my review for that product)&lt;br /&gt;Aveda Control Paste - horrible smell, greasier than this one&lt;br /&gt;Fudge Hair Shaper - flakes&lt;br /&gt;Bumble &amp; Bumble SumoTech - not matte enough and only holds 1- 2 hrs&lt;br /&gt;Gatsby Moving Rubber - hair feels unnatural and hard to wash off, hate the smell&lt;br /&gt;BedHead Hard to Get - hate the smell&lt;br /&gt;TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax - horrible smell, too thick&lt;br /&gt;Got2B Glued Spiking Glue - won&#x27;t wash off, no texture&lt;br /&gt;Girl/Boy Spank - too oily, no hold, won&#x27;t wash off&lt;br /&gt;American Crew Fiber - hard to manipulate, too thick, Grooming Cream - too shiny, not enough hold - and ost of the American Crew line&lt;br /&gt;Redken for Men, Maneuver - yucky looking and feeling&lt;br /&gt;Redken Rewind 06 - not impressed at all, too shiny, cheap feeling, chemical smelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep Jonathan Dirt in my arsenal for daily use, but am till in the quest to a product to use when more hold/dressier/more styled hair is needed (i.e. events, outings, parties).  For now, I alternate with [[ASIN:B0028NE9X6 Matrix Vavoom Messy Couture Molding Paste, 1.7 Ounce]] which allows the more sculpted/dressier/more styled hair and is an excellent product, and use Dirt for casual styles,</li>
            <li> A lot of the styling pastes out there hold well and have the right texture but the manufacturers add a ton of fragrance to mask the chemical smell of their product.  I literally went through everything at the pharmacy but they all had really strong smells.  This product smells a little bit like cake batter.  It&#x27;s subtle and not too overpowering.  Also holds great.  Good for pixie cuts and short styles.  Doesn&#x27;t flake or feel crunchy.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It feels as if the other reviews on this product were written by employees from \\&quot;Jonathan\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product hoping for matte hold of my hair (which is short, thick, and straight). The reviews indicated an \\&quot;all day hold\\&quot; with texture. The product smells great, but the positives end there. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No hold (I would equate the strength of hold to that of a very weak mousse)&lt;br /&gt;* No texture (Does not group hair or enable molding, it is simply too weak of a product)&lt;br /&gt;* No durability (If I add water to my hair each hour, it looks OK -- but if I don&#x27;t add water, it looks like I put no product in my hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my other reviews, you can see I am a very fair reviewer, and typically positive. In honesty, this is the worst hair product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading the reviews and giving up on cheap salon products.  I didn&#x27;t think that the texture was a big deal to be honest.  I made sure I played enough with it to dissolve on my hands and then applied.  The hold is very good, provides good texture and indeed lasts all day.  The deal breaker, however, is the smell.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like a Glade scent spray all day and found this to be overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;d be the perfect product for me if it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I used this product for years. I stopped for about a year until I recently got my hair cut short again. So I went on a mad hunt for this, but unfortunately not many places sell it locally anymore -  in hopes for an alternative I went to my local Ulta..and they had it on clearance for $6.50! It was like Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok now to the review this product is wonderful for my short mohawk style cut does not leave my hair hard or unmanageable; it smells great and doesnt become chalky [leave white residue] on the hair. I did notice that the products color is different now, it went from a tan color to almost white color. I have only used it once since I bought it. I did not notice a difference in how my hair felt now vs. previous uses; hopefully there will not be any issues with the consistancy of the product because I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed by this product. It has a really funny smell and does not work that well. I used it once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Aveda Control Paste was getting too expensive and hard to find and this has been a great alternative.  Note the size is small -- 1.7oz.</li>
            <li> ... I typically use American Crew Fiber or Molding Clay. This product was recommend to me, so I tried it out. It smells nice, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as well and American Crew products. I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I run out, but will probably stick to American Crew in the long run.</li>
            <li> The perfect texturizer! Smells great too! Not greasy. Smells like almonds. Perfect for that defined look of texture and style...you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> This used to be a fantastic product, but they have reformulated it and now it is not nearly as nice.  (Packaging changed slightly too with the new \\&quot;get dirty\\&quot; writing on the label).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour has gone from a dark brown to more of a white, and the consistency is a lot more \\&quot;gluggy\\&quot; and it feels a lot \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new jar had some air bubbles on top - the old product felt way to thick to produce air bubbles.  It doesn&#x27;t spread as evenly or nicely on your hand or hair, and feels sticky and gooey.  My hair feels a lot waxier too when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for years, but will stop now.  I can&#x27;t settle for what this product has become.  Disappointing.  Can anyone recommend a replacement product?</li>
            <li> Great for short fine hair</li>
            <li> not thrilled with this stuff  It is so so thick that it is difficult to apply to my hair. It actually leaves little white blobs in my hair because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; well into my hands to incorporate into my hair  I was much happier with &amp;#34;Dirty&amp;#34; than this product..&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff smells good, and as long as I take a long long time to get it incorporated, it works well enough to control frizz and curl.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best mens hair product around.  Goes on just right and looks good too.  Hair looks natural and good without looking dry or overly wet.  No stickiness or drying out.  I give this my gold stamp of approval.</li>
            <li> This is the paste texturizing paste I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  Does not make my hair look dull, gives it a nice shine and gives it great texture.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this seemingly-costly product is actually more economical than cheaper alternatives I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;m still halfway through the can I bought almost a year ago (used 3-4 days a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight hair that looks dull and falls volumeless &amp; flat after showers, and sides grow perpendicular to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, I can restore the tousled morning-after look by puffing my hair out at the top (where it tends to fall flat), straighten the sides, and raise the matte-factor for better tinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does NOT do is make my hair shiny or hard/clammy (hair-gelled looking), thankfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you have to be very careful with the AMOUNT, less than a pea-sized piece, smoothed out into my palms and diluted with water is ideal for me to get all the desired effects (for 4-5&#x27;&#x27;  long hair). If I accidentally use more than that, things will get clammy. I think that&#x27;s the reason behind the negative reviews. This can be a disadvantage for some, as it demands careful adjustment unlike a spray, but it also makes this product extremely economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not the least, Dirt&#x27;s exceptionally long lasting  (used in  the morning, it&#x27;ll remain fairly effective after an active day &amp; night out), and even after that, it wears out gradually and naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very slight and neither irritating nor pleasant.</li>
            <li> I just had my hair cut short, so I decided to experiment with hair products. This worked much better than the first mousse I tried (which made hair hair stiff, crispy, and unpleasant). My hair was still soft and malleable to the touch, and the product smelled pretty nice after it was in my hair(straight out of the tin has a chemically smell, but it gets better).  It has what I would consider a med-high hold. I didn&#x27;t put hairspray over it or anything but it held my hairdo pretty well even after putting on a helmet to ride my bike. However, the hold seems to wane as the day goes on, but I&#x27;m not sure if that was the product or from heat/humidity/sweat. Overall, works pretty well, but if you want a super strong hold, you&#x27;ll want something different.</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this based on the reviews.  This product dried out my hair, leaving it heavy and a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> I was told this product was a good replacement for American Crew Fiber - that is, matte and strong, but I find the Dirt Texturizing paste isn&#x27;t as strong as the American Crew Fiber Paste nor does it keep a matte finish, it makes the hair kind of shiny. That said, it does do an OKAY job and smells nice, but at almost double the price of American Crew, I would say it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  Just too many other products that I like better.  But if you haven&#x27;t found anything you like I think this stuff is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> The subject line of my review says it all.  I LOVE this stuff and it works REALLY well, especially on thick hair, which I have.  I will never use gel again as &amp;#34;Dirt&amp;#34; never flakes, always keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking, and sometimes my hair even looks better the next morning.  The key is learning how to apply it.  What I do is scoop out a bit (about the size of my top knuckle) put it in the palm of my hand, dry, rub my hands together to spread it evenly over both hands, drip a little water on each hand, rub them together again and run through my hair.  Works like a charm every time!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb... thought they stopped making it but luckily found it here.</li>
            <li> I could not stand the smell of this stuff. Threw it away after using it twice.</li>
            <li> I have long dark &amp; very fine hair and it&#x27;s hard to find products that do not make my hair feel sticky or stiff!  I got a sample of this in the mail last year and knew as soon as it ran out I would have to order more!  I love that I only have to use a small amount so it lasts forever, if I start getting a few split ends it helps hide them, and that it helps with fly-aways!  I would recommend this product and will buy it again when I run out ;)</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and in the winter I have to deal with static. In the summer, I have to deal with frizz. In either situation, this product tames my unruly hair with just a tiny bit...and makes me smell awesome to boot! Also works well for shaping and taming my husband&#x27;s mustache and beard. Wonderful product! Won&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> Great for my travel bag!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have the Silky Dirt that comes in a tube too, and loved the scent of it....vanilla, yum!....but it doesn&#x27;t quite have the right texture to keep my bangs in place.  This works well, and has the fabulous smell too!  It&#x27;s not going to make your hair stiff or have super strong hold, but if you want a soft medium hold, it should work.  Don&#x27;t put too much or it will make your hair look oily--takes a bit of practice to find the perfect amount, but if you like Jonathan Product stuff, this is worth a try!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product and it smells like almond cookies-good stuff.</li>
            <li> contrary to other reports, it clumps on me.  I have naturally curly hair.  This takes care of the frizz and it smells sensational.  It takes forever to warm up in my hands so when it is applied, it goes on clumpy so here I am trying to smooth the clumps out.  If I miss a clump, somebody will point it out at work and ask me \\&quot;what is that?\\&quot;  Very embarrssing.  I&#x27;ve heard others say it is impossible to apply too much but I think it is.  I just haven&#x27;t found the right amount that works yet.  I&#x27;m wondering if perhaps I should try to nuke the paste first and see how that works cause I can&#x27;t get this stuff to melt enough to work.  Yes, you can re-wet your hair to spread out the clumps but why should I have to do that?  And I don&#x27;t understand how people can get an even amount applied to one&#x27;s head with this stuff.  I wish they made candles in this scent.  I&#x27;d be all over that like Oprah on a ham.</li>
            <li> This little bottle will last a very long time. It doesn&#x27;t keep your hair as soft as I would like it.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy. My daughter like to smell it while I do her hair. It is different not like putty or gel. I rub it with my fingers before I put it on her hair to kind of melt it. Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works well as it is too solid and u can hardly spread it on hair , I got a similar line product before and liked it but it was discontinued</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it out, as I&#x27;ve wanted to have a textured look to my hair.  This product is perfect without making my hair feel sticky.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my second tub of Dirt. I really like it. It gives just enough &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; to give my  hair some texture. I also like that it is not tacky or sticky.</li>
            <li> Best texturizing paste hands down. I&#x27;ve been using this for my now bob-length hair since I had a pixie cut. Love it! Super long lasting and smells delicious. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Clean and works as described.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I thought I would give this a try instead of the dirt texturizing spray.  No comparison.  Now I have to spend more and get the product that worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair &amp; this product works well to hold the style I want.  Smells great &amp; you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product and likes it enough that I hunted it down on Amazon for him!  Arrived as expected...</li>
            <li> I will keep using it&lt;br /&gt;Like: it&#x27;s not gel, smells nice, last for relaxed hair about 3 days&lt;br /&gt;Dislike: it does not last all week&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist recommended it</li>
            <li> perfect for short hair i use in combination with sumo wax red container.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while, but stopped because it is so expensive. I am a man, and my hair is very hard for me to manage.&lt;br /&gt;I recently heard that Jonathan products (although he has nothing to do with them anymore) were available at Duane Reade. I also read that it was reformulated. I went to buy it and they had 2 on the shelf. One was the old formula and the other the new. Needless to say I bought the old one. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying the new one when this one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;I might have to go back to the Axe pastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Kenra #13 product for a few years now, but wasn&#x27;t quite right - I wanted something that would make my super short hair a bit more &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; in order to keep it&#x27;s slightly spiky &amp; separated, textured look. The Kenra #13 was a little too greasy, but everything else I experimented with, both &amp;#34;salon only&amp;#34; and store brands were either too greasy or way too waxy. Also, many had aromas that turned me off. (I don&#x27;t want to smell my hair product every time I turn my head!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tried this smaller size (a larger size is available too) after reading the Amazon reviews, however thought that maybe this product was geared more for mens hair, and often products for men have a &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; aroma added to them, which I certainly don&#x27;t want. I must say I was quite pleased with the results after my initial use, and have just now ordered the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t say this product is exactly what I was  hoping for (to me, it could be a tiny bit less &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;) it does provide more stiffness than the Kenra #13 does, it hardly has a smell to it,. I also found that it works better on almost bone-dry hair. If my hair is even a little bit too damp it just seems to disappear. I can do little touch-ups on dry hair too with very good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, Jonathan Dirt Tex. Paste is lots cheaper than the Kenra product is, so I&#x27;m quite happy. Try it if you&#x27;ve been searching for something not greasy but not waxy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dirt for a long time.  The product I received either is a knock off or they really changed the product.  It looks and feels like Crisco shortening, the white stuff from a can.  Old product was creamy with an opalescence.  Nothing like that in the one I got.  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Love this texturizing stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This gives your hair a bit of a &amp;#34;day after washing&amp;#34; kind of look. It has a light hold but it isn&#x27;t going to be able to keep your hair firmly in place or anything. If you want more hold, it combined pretty well with normal gel for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it, take a very small amount (like roughly pea sized) and rub it in to the palm of your hand with a little water until it&#x27;s creamy. Rub that through your hair and you are done. Be careful not to use too much, as it will look crusty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am a guy and have thick hair. While I was using this, it was around 5-6 inches long most places. I&#x27;ve since cut it shorter and am doing more of a pomade kind of look, so I don&#x27;t know how it works with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> i use it on my long hair it gives volume and texture smells amazing i love it i bought this second time</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  The product left my hair greasy and just gross.</li>
            <li> A great product! I did good buying this!</li>
            <li> Great product. Just be advised that this is the small travel size. The normal size I bought a while ago and made the mistake of not checking to make sure. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This is the best molding paste/styling product ever.  It is great on all lengths of short hair and is easy to use and does not weigh your hair down.  I like to sytle my hair multiple ways and this product works every time.</li>
            <li> After 20+ years, I&#x27;ve finally found a hair style that I&#x27;m happy with thanks to this stuff. When my hair is still wet out of the shower, I rub this in the palm of my hands with a little water then run it through my hair. Let it air dry for 10 minutes or so and ruffle your hair with a towel. Boom, instant naturally tussled hair look, that leaves your hair soft and fluffy, and doesn&#x27;t look like you did anything at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well for what I need - texture and additional staying power. Tried another brand, but didn&#x27;t compare</li>
            <li> Recently I cut off my thick waist length hair and donated it to Locks For Love.  I&#x27;m really happy to be able to help someone and I&#x27;m also really glad to get rid of my heavy hair for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My now chin level and layered hair do needed something extra or it would just lay there. I originally came to my hair stylist with a picture of a girl who&#x27;s chin length hair was layered, chunky looking and with ends that flared out.  To achieve the same look I needed more than just a hair cut I needed to start using a texturizing paste and this is when I turned to Jonathan for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist instructed me that the texturizing paste will help to create the chunky look I wanted.  Just take a bit of the paste with your fingers and rub it into the hair.  Take some more and rub it on select strands of hair and then to keep it in place spray some hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing and drying my hair I use both the Jonathan product Dirt Texturizing paste and the [[ASIN:B003737XES Jonathan Product Silky Dirt Creme]] to create my style and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair still feels touchable as the two products do not leave my hair feeling sticky or stiff.  My hair has that \\&quot;day after wash\\&quot; look to it ( where the \\&quot;day of wash\\&quot; look is usually super light, soft and fluffy hair and \\&quot;day after wash\\&quot; hair isn&#x27;t greasy but now lays down and has some control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anther thing I like is it lasts without having to be re-applied.  Though I shower every day I do not wash my hair every day, more like I wash it every two days and the product lasts until the next wash.  I like this because I don&#x27;t want to have to style my hair every morning.  This is a huge plus after wearing my hair in a pony tail for several months while allowing it to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jonathan product Dirt Texturizing paste smells good, and it&#x27;s a stiff product to get out of the jar.  I usually use the back of my finger nail to scrap a bit of it out and rub it between my two fingers.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well as I had hoped, but it was better than some I have tried and I really liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li> this product has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Love this hair product!</li>
