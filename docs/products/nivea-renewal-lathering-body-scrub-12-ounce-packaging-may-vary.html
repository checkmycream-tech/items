            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>

            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I really liked it!</li>
            <li>Great smell, wonderful texture and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I found it pleasant however.  </li>

            <li>I loved the smell of this body wash.</li>
            <li>This is a good scrub, just not as scrubby as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Most soaps or lotions either make me break out in rash, or leave me incredibly itchy.  </li>
            <li>That bein said, I do like a good exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li>Besides all that, it washes off clean and smells excellent.</li>
            <li>My husband is very pleased with this scrub--says that it works well, without an overpowering fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It has a very potent perfume smell.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will be great.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nice body scrub, good lather, nice clean scent great price.</li>
            <li>Nivea creates a huge winner here with this wonderful easy to use and store product.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing &amp; lathers well.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin real smooth.</li>
            <li>Make me skin feel so amazing.  </li>
            <li>The price was great and haven&#x27;t seen this available in stores.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery works great!!!</li>
            <li>Im loving this</li>
            <li>ans nicely scented</li>
            <li>The absolute best body wash.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say,</li>
            <li>I thought this product might be a nice way to try and exfoliate while showering</li>
            <li>and it has proven to be quite effective.</li>
            <li>kind of way - I like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>BUT that&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t a nice product.</li>
            <li>Good lord I love this product.</li>
            <li>Feels great after making circles all over my body and washes iff clean.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great skin cleanser for all skin/body types!</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant, therefor extends its use to both males and females.  </li>
            <li>I already love love Nivea Q10!</li>
            <li>Not as good as sea salt and olive oil, but leaves your skin really smooth,  </li>
            <li>My advice is to use it with a cloth and not one of those &#x27;scrubbing mesh ball&#x27; things; I tried it with both, and the exfoliating formula seems to be much more effective when coming off</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great, lots of beads for a good scrub, and leaves my skin soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>Its effective, makes me feel clean!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is cheap, it has a very pleasant scent that i absolutely LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>This is a good scrub for both men and women as the scent is mild  and not overly floral.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve both two more bottles.</li>
            <li>.could be a bit more foamy</li>
            <li>I guess the way it lathers helps the scrubbing crystals to dissolve better than most scrubs.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just started using this last night when I took my shower, but I can already tell that it is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>love this stuff, works well.</li>
            <li>I use it, I love it..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The scent of this body wash and the fact that it&#x27;s a body &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; make this one of my favorite body washes that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love this scrub.  </li>
            <li>it works better as an exfoliate if u use with a loofah.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the sandy texture and the beads.  </li>
            <li>My favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed Nivea lotion through the years; but, this product doesn&#x27;t feel like any Nivea product I have tried before.</li>
            <li>I also feel that the price of this product is excellent and will be purchasing more of this in the future.  </li>
            <li>I love this body scrub.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone looking for better their skin</li>
            <li>Even though the ingredient list reads like chemistry shopping list, I love this stuff and what it has done for my skin.  </li>
            <li>And washes off well after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely recommend.</li>
            <li>I seldom love products, but this scrub deserves 5 stars, and I will continue to buy it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth and I smell great!</li>
            <li>You can do this in the shower but it is much better on a bed or massage table.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m sticking with the tree hut brand, these are better</li>
            <li>such a great value!</li>
            <li>Many people complain of fragrance..</li>
            <li>It really lives up to it&#x27;s name and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Many companies, including L’Oreal, The Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble have agreed to phase out them out.</li>
            <li>I love this nivea scrub.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I really,  really love this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Effective, gentle and moisturizing, this scrub is really good.</li>
            <li>I love the niveea brand.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find many out there that weren&#x27;t designer name brands and over $40</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Nivea Body touch of Renewal several times and impressed.</li>
            <li>When I tried out the Nivea Body Touch, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to except because I don&#x27;t use scrubs often.</li>
            <li>Love love love this scrub.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Nivea since living in Europe for many years.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!</li>
            <li>and it has a nice clean smell that also reminds you of a spa.</li>
            <li>This scrub has the perfect amount of micro-bead to lather ratio and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, I wouldn&#x27;t say that the scent is anything to write home about to be honest, but my skin is so smooth after just one use!</li>
            <li>As a guy I have to say it&#x27;s pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and smells great!</li>
            <li>Pretty good deal considering the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a pretty good sized tube for the price - another</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this product - a nice scent, not too strong; nice exfoliation beads, not too big or too teeny; bottle is a good hefty size as well.</li>
            <li>so when I came across this one I was excited!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, great price - the tube is huge, as it should be when the scrub is for the whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a great balanced shape that fits on your shower shelf easily and is easy to grab when your ready to lather up.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>it lathers just fine :)</li>
            <li>It just makes you feel refreshed and 100% clean after you take your shower!</li>
            <li>It smells so clean!</li>
            <li>Best of all it does it without the abrasiveness of some similar products and a rich lather that makes you feel pampered.  </li>
            <li>Love this body wash and was happy to be able to add it on to an order I recently placed.</li>
            <li>gently and smells good.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED this product so much that I told all my friends about it, how it gave me a smoother body.</li>
            <li>gotta be the best daily scrub - from great smell to being mild on my sensitive skin and moisturizing too.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is gentle, smells deliciously and really helps to clean and scrub your skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin refreshed and rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li>Lathers easily</li>
            <li>It lathers well in the shower or bath and easily applied just like a shower gel.</li>
            <li>strong odor that I could not get off my hands even after repeated washing.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have to strong a scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and mild (kind of like &amp;#34;rain water&amp;#34; types), so not an overbearing perfume smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is rather strong and I have a feeling that will be a turn off for some users.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love that it has the right amount of scrub to soften, leaving my skin feeling healthy and revitalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind strong scented products, you&#x27;ll probably be fine with this.</li>
            <li>That said, it smells really nice, feels quite creamy (despite the grit) and does leave my less severely affected skin feeling pretty delicious.</li>
            <li>It is light and sweet!</li>
            <li>It moisturized fine without stripping my skin , but I often use body cream on shaved legs and elbows anyway.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much like everything from Nivea, so seeing this come up as something to review made me happy.  </li>
            <li>After the very first use, I was incredibly pleased.  </li>
            <li>It has little beads that are excellent exfoliates and the product&#x27;s use leaves one felling reinvigorated.  </li>
            <li>my lotion seemed better absorbed afterwards too.</li>
            <li>I washed my legs, hips and thighs with a body brush and it made my skin so smooth</li>
            <li>THE VERY BEST product for dead cells removal.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product that my GF loves.  </li>
            <li>keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice and really scrubbing.</li>
            <li>after i use it, my skin feels so smooth and moisture.</li>
            <li>Her skin felt smooth and moisturized after using this scrub.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scrubby but not too much, foams nice, works with a washcloth, a puff, your hands, whatever.</li>
            <li>It also rinses clean easily, leaves no sticky residue, and yet your skin is softer after use.</li>
            <li>It has a light, soap-like scent; it scrubs without being too scratchy; and my skin feels hydrated.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after my showers.  </li>
            <li>but skin feels good and soft after....</li>
            <li>I like nivea products they are good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin already looks ready for summer time and this is a great product if you are getting ready to use self tanner.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and sensitive skinned, so my options are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it has just the right amount of grain for scrubbing, it doesn&#x27;t overkill and clog your pores.</li>
            <li>Great value for money and so much better than those over priced other body washes.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week on my face, and it makes me feel really clean and smooth without drying out the skin.  </li>
            <li>Its got a nice scent to it..pretty decent size as well.</li>
            <li>First off, the smell is really good, and pleasant and not super perfumy so that it gives you head ache.</li>
            <li>First let me share that I am a scrub product junkie; I have tried many scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I will going back for more and more!</li>
            <li>I normally go for very scented body wash, in this case I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because I really love the scrubbing beads in this body wash!  </li>
            <li>I liked this product and have no qualms about recommending it to anyone looking for a new body wash to try.</li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s super cheap here.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it is a really big bottle of product.  </li>
            <li>This scrubbing cream is very effective in removing dry skin.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need a ton of the scrub to get a good lather and clean for your entire body.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a good product that does just what it says: exfoliates your skin while leaving you clean.</li>
            <li>Its amazing on my skin and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>This is a nice exfoliating product that is perfect for trying to get your skin back into shape after a harsh winter.  </li>
            <li>Leave my sking smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>I gave the product 5 stars because my sister truely raves about it.  </li>
            <li>FULL DISCLOSURE:</li>
            <li>I think this would work really well for most people.</li>
            <li>THis into the shower with you and experience its rich lather, clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean not fruity or super sweet.</li>
            <li>I love trying out new body washes but sometimes they don&#x27;t keep you feeling completely clean</li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously the best exfoliating body scrub!</li>
            <li>But honestly, I wasn&#x27;t  really expecting much</li>
            <li>As I get older, I&#x27;ve realized I need to take better care of my skin.</li>
            <li>lotion absorbs into the skin quickly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>While I like many Nivea products, for me this scrub was just too highly perfumed.  </li>
            <li>The scrubbing beads really help you get a seriously clean feeling!</li>
            <li>I felt clean and refreshed after using it and it washed right off, leaving no residue or greasy feeling afterward.</li>
            <li>when I ran my hand up and down my leg lol.</li>
            <li>With a light, clean scent this is one that whole family can use.  </li>
            <li>I always love trying out new skin and bath products.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using it before I&#x27;d done the sunless tanning thing, felt clean and fresh, and sloghed away any residue from the old tan.</li>
            <li>It actually works pretty good and lathers well.</li>
            <li>Now dry off really good.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, especially for dry skin</li>
            <li>I love this and feel super fresh with soft cared for skin after using it.</li>
            <li>Fresh unisex scent as well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of lotion I could find this winter to help, but still found myself applying it several times a day.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this scrub when I am done with the free sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling silky, soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>but it is fun if you have someone close that can help you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That said, I am in love with how this product feels so I don&#x27;t mind a gentler soap for the sensitive parts and this for the rougher parts.</li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>It contains these little dissolving scrubbing beads that exfoliate skin during washing, and they&#x27;re very effective.</li>
            <li>Wash each other really good and get all the body scrub off the body.</li>
            <li>(it has just the right amount of \\&quot;scruff\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>noticed a difference in the texture and smoothness of my skin right away.</li>
            <li>Fish who swallow them are not getting the nutrition they need to live a healthy life, thus impacting the whole food chain.</li>
            <li>leaves skin clean, soft and supple and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>Really good in terms of being a scrub, but not necessarily the best when you&#x27;re sweaty or dirty.</li>
            <li>I think it would be great for someone with regular dry skin, but mine is a little too far gone for it to work perfectly.</li>
            <li>On the face if you can leave the scrub on the face until the shower.&lt;br /&gt;NOW turn about is fair play get your partner down on the bed and start scrubbing.</li>
            <li>The texture of the beads is very fine, almost like a facial scrub.  </li>
            <li>Buy this for the pure scrubbing bliss of it!  </li>
            <li>Another benefit to this product is that it comes in a large (12 ounce) bottle, so you get a lot for your money!</li>
            <li>It also does not excessively dry my skin as most shower scrubs do</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh, not too musky or spicy like many men’s scrubs, nor too flowery or feminine scented, so that the guys and girls can use the same product.  </li>
            <li>You need a small bucket, very warm water, a towel,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Very gentle exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product does a good job at exfoliating gently.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>A real bargain, too!</li>
            <li>, my lotion seems to absorb better and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the plenitude of scrubbing crystals as well as the moderate amount of foam that this product provides.  </li>
            <li>But the description says that it&#x27;s okay for daily use.</li>
            <li>And this lasts SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>I believe this is my first time trying Nivea</li>
            <li>I usually go in for more girlie scents, but this is a great one to slough off that dry winter skin that everyone can share in.  </li>
            <li>As a skin care professional, I can tell you there are certain qualities that are important in anything you put on</li>
            <li>I definitely feel the \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; part of it and it has felt pretty good actually</li>
            <li>Most people probably think all body scrubs are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea Touch of renewal Lathering Body Scrub is a great scrub that has a rich lather and tiny microbeads that slough away dead skin cells, leaving your skin super soft</li>
            <li>and then rinses off cleanly leaving your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty large tube and the smell is not offensive to me.</li>
            <li>I realize that it is a body scrub, but a little more later would be nice.  </li>
            <li>like the light fresh scent - it&#x27;s soft with an almost \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; scent, but not in an unpleasant way, more in a \\&quot;this stuff means business, good business for your skin\\</li>
            <li>this is really a good Nivea product and for the price seems unbelievable.  </li>
            <li>But I have never found a scrub at any price that kept that pure clean feel for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>It does contain parabens (preservatives, which I prefer to not have in my skin care products) and it also contains a high amount of sulfates, which is what gives it that fabulous foaming effect, but will not harm your skin, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, since you don&#x27;t leave it on your skin, the parabens are not enough for me to stop using it, and the great size (12oz) means it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely made my skin softer, smoother and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>so my skin is feeling especially dry right now, even more so considering that our winter is dragging out forever.  </li>
            <li>My skin is SUPER sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant but the product is not effective as a scrub.  </li>
            <li>It is not as abrasive as some body scrubs, but is certainly a contender when I need to a body scrub.</li>
            <li>And it smells just like classic Nivea cream which I like!</li>
            <li>The bottle is also huge so it will last for awhile</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I would like it to.</li>
            <li>Gently exfoliates .  </li>
            <li>Lathers and scrubs really well and feel like we really used a exfoliater after the shower.</li>
            <li>This grainy body scrub is really grainy, but that&#x27;s what one buys it for.  </li>
            <li>I added this item to my cart because I needed $4 in order to get free next day deliveries (the things we do...)</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>It really did</li>
            <li>The lathering scrub is reasonably priced and works well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin, but it still exfoliates and moisturizes my skin, leaving it nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell you the body scrubs I&#x27;ve purchased that when applied, didn&#x27;t feel as if they had much \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; to them.</li>
            <li>Gentle exfoliate.</li>
            <li>DO need a partner or someone VERY CLOSE to you.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing this product foe awhile, and I like it vey much.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>A woman in an online forum for the condition suggested it, as it worked really well for her.</li>
            <li>The scrub is gentle - almost too gentle.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>price is incredibly reasonable too.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need too much on my scrubber to lather me up well.</li>
            <li>but they are definitely much improved.</li>
            <li>it exfoliates really well</li>
            <li>Some scrubs just wash right off your body without being able to really scrub with them, but this one penetrates and lets you have time to scrub off all that dead skin.</li>
            <li>I love how big it is and that it will last me a long time:}</li>
            <li>It is big in real than in picture and it feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount of the product - I use a body poof - to create an excellent lather and to cleanse the entire body.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this at other stores and for the size, that price is comparable or better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this one to those who have boys/men who don&#x27;t want the &#x27;girlie&#x27; smells, but still want that deep clean experience.</li>
            <li>The scrub is gentle, yet effective and leaves behind a wonderfully smooth and soft, moisturized feel to you skin.  </li>
            <li>This one has just enough of a rough scrub to it to make me feel as if it is gently but effectively exfoliating.</li>
            <li>From the first use, the skin gets so soft.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; that are supposed to scrub and polish your skin are not very substantial and they dissolve very quickly.</li>
            <li>Not the nicest but good enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Decent price also.</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of using exfoliating scrubs daily, just for the simple fact that I love</li>
            <li>It might be a decent exfoliating product with the microbeads, but all of that doesn&#x27;t matter since I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li>For further information, simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough scrub to stimulate your skin and get your blood moving, but not to smooth the skin completely.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and really takes care of any dryness and makes my skin feel smooth  without residue and has a barely there fresh scent.</li>
            <li>there is a slight pleasant scent, but not much of one --</li>
            <li>I have pretty tough skin, so I’m more interested in the scrubbing aspect than the gentleness of products like this.  </li>
            <li>one day, I noticed, my skin feels so much softer and then I wonder, what have I been doing that making my skin so soft....</li>
            <li>Gets rid of all those rough areas and makes skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite and the fragrance is too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on my face since I ran out of my normal scrub</li>
            <li>The little beads in the wash made me feel very clean even before I was done rinsing.</li>
            <li>It is much too strong and \\&quot;grainy\\&quot; for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert and purposely didn&#x27;t put lotion on after using this product.</li>
            <li>Within two months, it&#x27;s like I have completely new skin.</li>
            <li>If they came out with a fragrance free version, I might try it again, but as it is, the bad outweighs the good.</li>
            <li>(Mine is very sensitive, BTW.)</li>
            <li>This is the first body scrub that actually feels like it works!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>4 stars because haven&#x27;t used it a lot yet, so can&#x27;t say how useful it is in long run..</li>
            <li>I heart this product, not to mention it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>Nivea has recently been bringing out more products, but so have other companies.</li>
            <li>Cannot find this at my local walmart and is twice as much at the drug store!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of this given the price, but it&#x27;s just as nice as some of the more expensive scrubs I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>with no residue our right, dry feeling.</li>
            <li>There are rough little granular in the soap that I liked, there were not too harsh and dissolved and washed away easily.</li>
            <li>This is a very decent body wash especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This is essentially a light exfoliating body wash that is just that, with little to no fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the little granulated beads that exfoliate at the same time as it cleans.</li>
            <li>It may cost a little more but its the only skin you get.</li>
            <li>my skin feels amazingly soft after using this just once.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>So for those of you with sensitive skin who want to exfoliate, MAYBE this is for you.  </li>
            <li>type: can be sensitive</li>
            <li>Unlike some have said in their reviews, I did notice a lathering - enough for me, as some body scrubs don&#x27;t lather at all, or others there is so much lather</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m worried it won&#x27;t completely wash off of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rinsing it off, my skin feels noticeably silky soft.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft scrub and lathers somewhat (not like bar soap).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this numerous times and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a lather.  </li>
            <li>I really wish that I would have done a sniff test by popping open the cap before I bought it.</li>
            <li>It creates a soft, creamy, luxurious lather that is spa-like</li>
            <li>When you rinse it from your skin you will immediately notice how soft your skin feels.</li>
            <li>I got this because I was looking for a body scrub with vitamin E to help with old acne scarring I have on my chest and shoulders.</li>
            <li>The scars on my chest have completely faded and my shoulders aren&#x27;t completely gone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used body washes in the past that felt like you were using half a tube just to keep a good lather going.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; are only lightly abrasive compared to other exfoliating agents.</li>
            <li>Only a clean and smooth feeling - as well as a feeling that your skin&#x27;s pores are open, breathing and clean, rather than clogged or still dirty.  </li>
            <li>I love that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and refreshed from showering after perspiring or having to go without a shower for a few days like while camping and hiking.  </li>
            <li>My only concern, unless I use too much of it, is that even its a big bottle, it goes down pretty fast.</li>
            <li>After this winter, I was hoping it would be a little more abrasive to tackle the dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>The tube is very large and I think the two-pack I bought will last a long time.</li>
            <li>it has micro-beads which feels so fantastic on the skin without being too harsh!</li>
            <li>As a male with sensitive and oily skin, I especially am on the look out for a body scrub that works, but doesn&#x27;t smell like a bouquet of flowers or cost too much.</li>
            <li>Takes a few squeezes to get enough to cover my whole body but its worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>It has a clean, fresh scent, lathers up really well (even in hard water) and rinses without leaving a rubbery or filmy feeling and also without making your skin feel dried out.  </li>
            <li>I like the Nivea Body Touch of Renewal Lathering Body Scrub because while still exfoliating your skin, it truly is gentle enough to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>The beads gently exfoliate the skin; I rup extra on my elbows and knees when necessary.</li>
            <li>It did moisturize well enough to forego after bath lotion, and it did have enough grit to call it a &amp;#34;scrub,&amp;#34; though if you&#x27;re looking for real exfoliation as you&#x27;d need with self-tanner, keep looking.</li>
            <li>My skin started looking dry halfway threw the day, this is a good thing as my skin usually looks dry shortly after a shower.</li>
            <li>overall, the scrub itself is good but the smell is pretty bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other exfoliating body scrubs and most of them were too harsh -</li>
            <li>And the residual oil that is left on the skin after showering is very subtle but still effective.  </li>
            <li>The first time I smelled it, it smelled nice, but once I used it in the shower, it was a bad smell -</li>
            <li>Well, if you have sensitive skin like mine, there is no way you will want to use this daily.</li>
            <li>Take another wet towel and wipe as much of the scrub off the body as you can.</li>
            <li>This is barely noticeable; but you can still tell.</li>
            <li>Many soaps that I have tried often leave behind a sticky residue and this does not do that at all.  </li>
            <li>This is my day to day body scrub, does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for those who just want a nice exfoliator - especially if getting a fake tan.</li>
            <li>It has just enough grit in it to help exfoliate my skin, but not too much that it leaves me irritated (as other products sometimes do).</li>
            <li>In fact, she wants to make this a part of daily regime because it is tough and gentle.  </li>

            <li> I loved the smell of this body wash.</li>
            <li> This is a good scrub, just not as scrubby as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Most soaps or lotions either make me break out in rash, or leave me incredibly itchy.  </li>
            <li> That bein said, I do like a good exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li> Besides all that, it washes off clean and smells excellent.</li>

            <li> The absolute best body wash.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say,</li>
            <li> I thought this product might be a nice way to try and exfoliate while showering</li>
            <li> and it has proven to be quite effective.</li>
            <li> kind of way - I like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> BUT that&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t a nice product.</li>
            <li> Good lord I love this product.</li>
            <li> Feels great after making circles all over my body and washes iff clean.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great skin cleanser for all skin/body types!</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant, therefor extends its use to both males and females.  </li>
            <li> I already love love Nivea Q10!</li>
            <li> Not as good as sea salt and olive oil, but leaves your skin really smooth,  </li>
            <li> My advice is to use it with a cloth and not one of those &#x27;scrubbing mesh ball&#x27; things; I tried it with both, and the exfoliating formula seems to be much more effective when coming off</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great, lots of beads for a good scrub, and leaves my skin soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> Its effective, makes me feel clean!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is cheap, it has a very pleasant scent that i absolutely LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> This is a good scrub for both men and women as the scent is mild  and not overly floral.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve both two more bottles.</li>
            <li> .could be a bit more foamy</li>
            <li> I guess the way it lathers helps the scrubbing crystals to dissolve better than most scrubs.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this last night when I took my shower, but I can already tell that it is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, works well.</li>
            <li> I use it, I love it..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The scent of this body wash and the fact that it&#x27;s a body &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; make this one of my favorite body washes that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Love this scrub.  </li>
            <li> it works better as an exfoliate if u use with a loofah.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the sandy texture and the beads.  </li>
            <li> My favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Nivea lotion through the years; but, this product doesn&#x27;t feel like any Nivea product I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I also feel that the price of this product is excellent and will be purchasing more of this in the future.  </li>
            <li> I love this body scrub.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone looking for better their skin</li>
            <li> Even though the ingredient list reads like chemistry shopping list, I love this stuff and what it has done for my skin.  </li>
            <li> And washes off well after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely recommend.</li>
            <li> I seldom love products, but this scrub deserves 5 stars, and I will continue to buy it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth and I smell great!</li>
            <li> You can do this in the shower but it is much better on a bed or massage table.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m sticking with the tree hut brand, these are better</li>
            <li> such a great value!</li>
            <li> Many people complain of fragrance..</li>
            <li> It really lives up to it&#x27;s name and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Many companies, including L’Oreal, The Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble have agreed to phase out them out.</li>
            <li> I love this nivea scrub.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I really,  really love this.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Effective, gentle and moisturizing, this scrub is really good.</li>
            <li> I love the niveea brand.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find many out there that weren&#x27;t designer name brands and over $40</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nivea Body touch of Renewal several times and impressed.</li>
            <li> When I tried out the Nivea Body Touch, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to except because I don&#x27;t use scrubs often.</li>
            <li> Love love love this scrub.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Nivea since living in Europe for many years.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!</li>
            <li> and it has a nice clean smell that also reminds you of a spa.</li>
            <li> This scrub has the perfect amount of micro-bead to lather ratio and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild, I wouldn&#x27;t say that the scent is anything to write home about to be honest, but my skin is so smooth after just one use!</li>
            <li> As a guy I have to say it&#x27;s pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and smells great!</li>
            <li> Pretty good deal considering the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a pretty good sized tube for the price - another</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product - a nice scent, not too strong; nice exfoliation beads, not too big or too teeny; bottle is a good hefty size as well.</li>
            <li> so when I came across this one I was excited!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, great price - the tube is huge, as it should be when the scrub is for the whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a great balanced shape that fits on your shower shelf easily and is easy to grab when your ready to lather up.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> it lathers just fine :)</li>
            <li> It just makes you feel refreshed and 100% clean after you take your shower!</li>
            <li> It smells so clean!</li>
            <li> Best of all it does it without the abrasiveness of some similar products and a rich lather that makes you feel pampered.  </li>
            <li> Love this body wash and was happy to be able to add it on to an order I recently placed.</li>
            <li> gently and smells good.  </li>
            <li> I LOVED this product so much that I told all my friends about it, how it gave me a smoother body.</li>
            <li> gotta be the best daily scrub - from great smell to being mild on my sensitive skin and moisturizing too.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is gentle, smells deliciously and really helps to clean and scrub your skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin refreshed and rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li> Lathers easily</li>
            <li> It lathers well in the shower or bath and easily applied just like a shower gel.</li>
            <li> strong odor that I could not get off my hands even after repeated washing.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have to strong a scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and mild (kind of like &amp;#34;rain water&amp;#34; types), so not an overbearing perfume smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is rather strong and I have a feeling that will be a turn off for some users.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love that it has the right amount of scrub to soften, leaving my skin feeling healthy and revitalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind strong scented products, you&#x27;ll probably be fine with this.</li>
            <li> That said, it smells really nice, feels quite creamy (despite the grit) and does leave my less severely affected skin feeling pretty delicious.</li>
            <li> It is light and sweet!</li>
            <li> It moisturized fine without stripping my skin , but I often use body cream on shaved legs and elbows anyway.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much like everything from Nivea, so seeing this come up as something to review made me happy.  </li>
            <li> After the very first use, I was incredibly pleased.  </li>
            <li> It has little beads that are excellent exfoliates and the product&#x27;s use leaves one felling reinvigorated.  </li>
            <li> my lotion seemed better absorbed afterwards too.</li>
            <li> I washed my legs, hips and thighs with a body brush and it made my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> THE VERY BEST product for dead cells removal.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product that my GF loves.  </li>
            <li> keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice and really scrubbing.</li>
            <li> after i use it, my skin feels so smooth and moisture.</li>
            <li> Her skin felt smooth and moisturized after using this scrub.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scrubby but not too much, foams nice, works with a washcloth, a puff, your hands, whatever.</li>
            <li> It also rinses clean easily, leaves no sticky residue, and yet your skin is softer after use.</li>
            <li> It has a light, soap-like scent; it scrubs without being too scratchy; and my skin feels hydrated.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth after my showers.  </li>
            <li> but skin feels good and soft after....</li>
            <li> I like nivea products they are good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin already looks ready for summer time and this is a great product if you are getting ready to use self tanner.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and sensitive skinned, so my options are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it has just the right amount of grain for scrubbing, it doesn&#x27;t overkill and clog your pores.</li>
            <li> Great value for money and so much better than those over priced other body washes.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week on my face, and it makes me feel really clean and smooth without drying out the skin.  </li>
            <li> Its got a nice scent to it..pretty decent size as well.</li>
            <li> First off, the smell is really good, and pleasant and not super perfumy so that it gives you head ache.</li>
            <li> First let me share that I am a scrub product junkie; I have tried many scrubs.  </li>
            <li> I will going back for more and more!</li>
            <li> I normally go for very scented body wash, in this case I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because I really love the scrubbing beads in this body wash!  </li>
            <li> I liked this product and have no qualms about recommending it to anyone looking for a new body wash to try.</li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s super cheap here.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and it is a really big bottle of product.  </li>
            <li> This scrubbing cream is very effective in removing dry skin.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need a ton of the scrub to get a good lather and clean for your entire body.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a good product that does just what it says: exfoliates your skin while leaving you clean.</li>
            <li> Its amazing on my skin and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> This is a nice exfoliating product that is perfect for trying to get your skin back into shape after a harsh winter.  </li>
            <li> Leave my sking smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> I gave the product 5 stars because my sister truely raves about it.  </li>
            <li> FULL DISCLOSURE:</li>
            <li> I think this would work really well for most people.</li>
            <li> THis into the shower with you and experience its rich lather, clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and clean not fruity or super sweet.</li>
            <li> I love trying out new body washes but sometimes they don&#x27;t keep you feeling completely clean</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously the best exfoliating body scrub!</li>
            <li> But honestly, I wasn&#x27;t  really expecting much</li>
            <li> As I get older, I&#x27;ve realized I need to take better care of my skin.</li>
            <li> lotion absorbs into the skin quickly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> While I like many Nivea products, for me this scrub was just too highly perfumed.  </li>
            <li> The scrubbing beads really help you get a seriously clean feeling!</li>
            <li> I felt clean and refreshed after using it and it washed right off, leaving no residue or greasy feeling afterward.</li>
            <li> when I ran my hand up and down my leg lol.</li>
            <li> With a light, clean scent this is one that whole family can use.  </li>
            <li> I always love trying out new skin and bath products.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using it before I&#x27;d done the sunless tanning thing, felt clean and fresh, and sloghed away any residue from the old tan.</li>
            <li> It actually works pretty good and lathers well.</li>
            <li> Now dry off really good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially for dry skin</li>
            <li> I love this and feel super fresh with soft cared for skin after using it.</li>
            <li> Fresh unisex scent as well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of lotion I could find this winter to help, but still found myself applying it several times a day.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this scrub when I am done with the free sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling silky, soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> but it is fun if you have someone close that can help you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, I am in love with how this product feels so I don&#x27;t mind a gentler soap for the sensitive parts and this for the rougher parts.</li>
            <li> Worth it</li>
            <li> It contains these little dissolving scrubbing beads that exfoliate skin during washing, and they&#x27;re very effective.</li>
            <li> Wash each other really good and get all the body scrub off the body.</li>
            <li> (it has just the right amount of \\&quot;scruff\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> noticed a difference in the texture and smoothness of my skin right away.</li>
            <li> Fish who swallow them are not getting the nutrition they need to live a healthy life, thus impacting the whole food chain.</li>
            <li> leaves skin clean, soft and supple and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> Really good in terms of being a scrub, but not necessarily the best when you&#x27;re sweaty or dirty.</li>
            <li> I think it would be great for someone with regular dry skin, but mine is a little too far gone for it to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> On the face if you can leave the scrub on the face until the shower.&lt;br /&gt;NOW turn about is fair play get your partner down on the bed and start scrubbing.</li>
            <li> The texture of the beads is very fine, almost like a facial scrub.  </li>
            <li> Buy this for the pure scrubbing bliss of it!  </li>
            <li> Another benefit to this product is that it comes in a large (12 ounce) bottle, so you get a lot for your money!</li>
            <li> It also does not excessively dry my skin as most shower scrubs do</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh, not too musky or spicy like many men’s scrubs, nor too flowery or feminine scented, so that the guys and girls can use the same product.  </li>
            <li> You need a small bucket, very warm water, a towel,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Very gentle exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the product does a good job at exfoliating gently.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> A real bargain, too!</li>
            <li> , my lotion seems to absorb better and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the plenitude of scrubbing crystals as well as the moderate amount of foam that this product provides.  </li>
            <li> But the description says that it&#x27;s okay for daily use.</li>
            <li> And this lasts SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> I believe this is my first time trying Nivea</li>
            <li> I usually go in for more girlie scents, but this is a great one to slough off that dry winter skin that everyone can share in.  </li>
            <li> As a skin care professional, I can tell you there are certain qualities that are important in anything you put on</li>
            <li> I definitely feel the \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; part of it and it has felt pretty good actually</li>
            <li> Most people probably think all body scrubs are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea Touch of renewal Lathering Body Scrub is a great scrub that has a rich lather and tiny microbeads that slough away dead skin cells, leaving your skin super soft</li>
            <li> and then rinses off cleanly leaving your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty large tube and the smell is not offensive to me.</li>
            <li> I realize that it is a body scrub, but a little more later would be nice.  </li>
            <li> like the light fresh scent - it&#x27;s soft with an almost \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; scent, but not in an unpleasant way, more in a \\&quot;this stuff means business, good business for your skin\\</li>
            <li> this is really a good Nivea product and for the price seems unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> But I have never found a scrub at any price that kept that pure clean feel for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> It does contain parabens (preservatives, which I prefer to not have in my skin care products) and it also contains a high amount of sulfates, which is what gives it that fabulous foaming effect, but will not harm your skin, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, since you don&#x27;t leave it on your skin, the parabens are not enough for me to stop using it, and the great size (12oz) means it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely made my skin softer, smoother and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> so my skin is feeling especially dry right now, even more so considering that our winter is dragging out forever.  </li>
            <li> My skin is SUPER sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant but the product is not effective as a scrub.  </li>
            <li> It is not as abrasive as some body scrubs, but is certainly a contender when I need to a body scrub.</li>
            <li> And it smells just like classic Nivea cream which I like!</li>
            <li> The bottle is also huge so it will last for awhile</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> Gently exfoliates .  </li>
            <li> Lathers and scrubs really well and feel like we really used a exfoliater after the shower.</li>
            <li> This grainy body scrub is really grainy, but that&#x27;s what one buys it for.  </li>
            <li> I added this item to my cart because I needed $4 in order to get free next day deliveries (the things we do...)</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> It really did</li>
            <li> The lathering scrub is reasonably priced and works well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin, but it still exfoliates and moisturizes my skin, leaving it nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell you the body scrubs I&#x27;ve purchased that when applied, didn&#x27;t feel as if they had much \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; to them.</li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliate.</li>
            <li> DO need a partner or someone VERY CLOSE to you.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product foe awhile, and I like it vey much.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> A woman in an online forum for the condition suggested it, as it worked really well for her.</li>
            <li> The scrub is gentle - almost too gentle.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> price is incredibly reasonable too.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need too much on my scrubber to lather me up well.</li>
            <li> but they are definitely much improved.</li>
            <li> it exfoliates really well</li>
            <li> Some scrubs just wash right off your body without being able to really scrub with them, but this one penetrates and lets you have time to scrub off all that dead skin.</li>
            <li> I love how big it is and that it will last me a long time:}</li>
            <li> It is big in real than in picture and it feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount of the product - I use a body poof - to create an excellent lather and to cleanse the entire body.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this at other stores and for the size, that price is comparable or better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this one to those who have boys/men who don&#x27;t want the &#x27;girlie&#x27; smells, but still want that deep clean experience.</li>
            <li> The scrub is gentle, yet effective and leaves behind a wonderfully smooth and soft, moisturized feel to you skin.  </li>
            <li> This one has just enough of a rough scrub to it to make me feel as if it is gently but effectively exfoliating.</li>
            <li> From the first use, the skin gets so soft.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; that are supposed to scrub and polish your skin are not very substantial and they dissolve very quickly.</li>
            <li> Not the nicest but good enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Decent price also.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of using exfoliating scrubs daily, just for the simple fact that I love</li>
            <li> It might be a decent exfoliating product with the microbeads, but all of that doesn&#x27;t matter since I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> For further information, simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough scrub to stimulate your skin and get your blood moving, but not to smooth the skin completely.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and really takes care of any dryness and makes my skin feel smooth  without residue and has a barely there fresh scent.</li>
            <li> there is a slight pleasant scent, but not much of one --</li>
            <li> I have pretty tough skin, so I’m more interested in the scrubbing aspect than the gentleness of products like this.  </li>
            <li> one day, I noticed, my skin feels so much softer and then I wonder, what have I been doing that making my skin so soft....</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all those rough areas and makes skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite and the fragrance is too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on my face since I ran out of my normal scrub</li>
            <li> The little beads in the wash made me feel very clean even before I was done rinsing.</li>
            <li> It is much too strong and \\&quot;grainy\\&quot; for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I live in the desert and purposely didn&#x27;t put lotion on after using this product.</li>
            <li> Within two months, it&#x27;s like I have completely new skin.</li>
            <li> If they came out with a fragrance free version, I might try it again, but as it is, the bad outweighs the good.</li>
            <li> (Mine is very sensitive, BTW.)</li>
            <li> This is the first body scrub that actually feels like it works!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> 4 stars because haven&#x27;t used it a lot yet, so can&#x27;t say how useful it is in long run..</li>
            <li> I heart this product, not to mention it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Nivea has recently been bringing out more products, but so have other companies.</li>
            <li> Cannot find this at my local walmart and is twice as much at the drug store!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of this given the price, but it&#x27;s just as nice as some of the more expensive scrubs I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> with no residue our right, dry feeling.</li>
            <li> There are rough little granular in the soap that I liked, there were not too harsh and dissolved and washed away easily.</li>
            <li> This is a very decent body wash especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This is essentially a light exfoliating body wash that is just that, with little to no fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the little granulated beads that exfoliate at the same time as it cleans.</li>
            <li> It may cost a little more but its the only skin you get.</li>
            <li> my skin feels amazingly soft after using this just once.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li> So for those of you with sensitive skin who want to exfoliate, MAYBE this is for you.  </li>
            <li> type: can be sensitive</li>
            <li> Unlike some have said in their reviews, I did notice a lathering - enough for me, as some body scrubs don&#x27;t lather at all, or others there is so much lather</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worried it won&#x27;t completely wash off of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rinsing it off, my skin feels noticeably silky soft.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft scrub and lathers somewhat (not like bar soap).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this numerous times and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a lather.  </li>
            <li> I really wish that I would have done a sniff test by popping open the cap before I bought it.</li>
            <li> It creates a soft, creamy, luxurious lather that is spa-like</li>
            <li> When you rinse it from your skin you will immediately notice how soft your skin feels.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was looking for a body scrub with vitamin E to help with old acne scarring I have on my chest and shoulders.</li>
            <li> The scars on my chest have completely faded and my shoulders aren&#x27;t completely gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used body washes in the past that felt like you were using half a tube just to keep a good lather going.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; are only lightly abrasive compared to other exfoliating agents.</li>
            <li> Only a clean and smooth feeling - as well as a feeling that your skin&#x27;s pores are open, breathing and clean, rather than clogged or still dirty.  </li>
            <li> I love that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I feel clean and refreshed from showering after perspiring or having to go without a shower for a few days like while camping and hiking.  </li>
            <li> My only concern, unless I use too much of it, is that even its a big bottle, it goes down pretty fast.</li>
            <li> After this winter, I was hoping it would be a little more abrasive to tackle the dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> The tube is very large and I think the two-pack I bought will last a long time.</li>
            <li> it has micro-beads which feels so fantastic on the skin without being too harsh!</li>
            <li> As a male with sensitive and oily skin, I especially am on the look out for a body scrub that works, but doesn&#x27;t smell like a bouquet of flowers or cost too much.</li>
            <li> Takes a few squeezes to get enough to cover my whole body but its worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> It has a clean, fresh scent, lathers up really well (even in hard water) and rinses without leaving a rubbery or filmy feeling and also without making your skin feel dried out.  </li>
            <li> I like the Nivea Body Touch of Renewal Lathering Body Scrub because while still exfoliating your skin, it truly is gentle enough to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> The beads gently exfoliate the skin; I rup extra on my elbows and knees when necessary.</li>
            <li> It did moisturize well enough to forego after bath lotion, and it did have enough grit to call it a &amp;#34;scrub,&amp;#34; though if you&#x27;re looking for real exfoliation as you&#x27;d need with self-tanner, keep looking.</li>
            <li> My skin started looking dry halfway threw the day, this is a good thing as my skin usually looks dry shortly after a shower.</li>
            <li> overall, the scrub itself is good but the smell is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other exfoliating body scrubs and most of them were too harsh -</li>
            <li> And the residual oil that is left on the skin after showering is very subtle but still effective.  </li>
            <li> The first time I smelled it, it smelled nice, but once I used it in the shower, it was a bad smell -</li>
            <li> Well, if you have sensitive skin like mine, there is no way you will want to use this daily.</li>
            <li> Take another wet towel and wipe as much of the scrub off the body as you can.</li>
            <li> This is barely noticeable; but you can still tell.</li>
            <li> Many soaps that I have tried often leave behind a sticky residue and this does not do that at all.  </li>
            <li> This is my day to day body scrub, does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for those who just want a nice exfoliator - especially if getting a fake tan.</li>
            <li> It has just enough grit in it to help exfoliate my skin, but not too much that it leaves me irritated (as other products sometimes do).</li>
            <li> In fact, she wants to make this a part of daily regime because it is tough and gentle.  </li>
            <li> I live in hard water central, and even though we have a whole house filter, taking a shower can dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> the deep clean feel that it leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> It has a very clean scent and you really can&#x27;t go wrong with the Nivea brand.</li>
            <li> I have excessive dry skin and have been trying different body lotions with not complete success.</li>
            <li> It states it provides long lasting moisturization</li>
            <li> I like it but don&#x27;t always feel as clean as with other body scrubs, if you need a heavy exfoliation, forget this, but if you have sensitive or delicate skin</li>
            <li> I wanted to find something to scrub my skin as my arms have several dry spots from the wintertime.  </li>
            <li> The beads are sufficient enough to slough away dirt and dead skin cells, but are not rough on your skin.</li>
            <li> I must say that I really like the smell and thick consistency of this body wash.</li>
            <li> I left it in the shower and now it&#x27;s half gone becuase my entire family has been using it.</li>
            <li> I used it two mornings in a row and then returned to my regular body wash because my skin was starting to feel a little tender.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is huge &amp; price is crazy low.</li>
            <li> I have  extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I use to have dry ruff skin all over.</li>
            <li> change the towels on the bed and replace with dry ones.</li>
            <li> I wanted a skin scrub to slough off dry winter skin now that its spring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an exfoliating scrub, so it has little beads in it, but it&#x27;s not a rough scrub (like</li>
            <li> not too wet Start on the back of the neck and continue down the back getting it wet</li>
            <li> I live in a cold winter climate (with hot, humid summers)</li>
            <li> Continue down the gluts and the back of the legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s invigorating and when used with the Nivea lotion my dry, alligator skin is gone!</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> Sometimes the little things in life can make a big difference in how you feel and this is one example.</li>
            <li> The product itself is soft yet exfoliates, just as described, without leaving scratch marks on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> and this does not really hydrate me as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be curious to see how it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> so it will not get wet.</li>
            <li> Get the towel wet but</li>
            <li> Convenient shape for those wet hands in the shower.</li>
            <li> It lasted longer than expected, even when my husband decided to try it to see what I was raving about.</li>
            <li> Really liked the body wash, but HATED what it left in my bath tub after I drained the water.</li>
            <li> The second person lie down on the bed face down.</li>
            <li> My skin is less dry when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> not to much a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It hardly lathers up and I can barely stand the smell of it.</li>
            <li> All other skin types should skip this one (or so I thought until my sister tried this product).  </li>
            <li> The bottle is generous in size, the bits in it are noticeable without being too big or too small.  </li>
            <li> There are an insane amount out on the market today and more being developed every day.  </li>
            <li> MEN ACTIVE 3 SPORT BODY WASH&amp;#34; all over the body including the face.</li>

            <li> She said she had a few dry patches on her legs and this product worked a mini-miracle; no more dry patches.  </li>
            <li> Leave the scrub on the face while you continue down the front of the body.</li>
            <li> And body washes usually have either an overpowering scent or tend to dry out the skin, or both.  </li>

            <li> but I&#x27;d rather pay less.</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> Or maybe in the summer when you need a little something</li>
            <li> Yes, it does lather a little.  </li>
            <li> If anything, it smells a little bit like hand lotion.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while</li>
            <li> Use it everyday</li>
            <li> and it helps remove any dead skin</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent or a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Maybe once a week to slough off dead skin.</li>
            <li> Can use everyday.  </li>
            <li> I used it, and while it seems to exfoliate well and soften my skin, it smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;renewal\\&quot; in this body wash is small micro-beads that scrub dead skin as you wash.  </li>
            <li> It scrubs the grime off me without giving me a scraped up, raw feeling.  </li>
            <li> Nivea has also always been a trusted product brand for me, so I was anxious to give this lathering body scrub a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed in the past couple of days since I started using this</li>
            <li> I felt like this scrub left my body feeling itchy and somewhat uncomfortable - as if I didn&#x27;t shower in days</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used Axe&#x27;s Snake Peel, but find the Axe markup unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> it felt like my skin was raw after using them!  </li>
            <li> Like it as a body wash but as a scrub it sucks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a subtle change in the &#x27;clarity&#x27; of my skin since using it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the skin on my face has never felt tighter and cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find in Northern California...</li>
            <li> they just seemed to stick to my skin after showering which was frustrating.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Nivea, I always think.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> By no means is it a bad product</li>
            <li> My store stopped carrying this item :(&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> cuz of these stupid beads</li>
            <li> I hated the smell</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was debating between 3 or 4 stars, but three stars it is because the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; takes getting used to.  It basically feels like it has sand in it, and it&#x27;s not something I would use daily.  I use it about once a week on my face, and it makes me feel really clean and smooth without drying out the skin.  The tube is very large and I think the two-pack I bought will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great texture - I&#x27;ve both two more bottles. I can&#x27;t get this at a local store.</li>
            <li> As a guy I have to say it&#x27;s pretty good stuff. .could be a bit more foamy but skin feels good and soft after....my lotion seemed better absorbed afterwards too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Nivea, I always think.  It leaves your skin refreshed and rinses off easily.  I guess the way it lathers helps the scrubbing crystals to dissolve better than most scrubs.  I think you&#x27;d be please with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Eh... Just regular plastic micro beads.  Not my favorite and the fragrance is too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> Really liked the body wash, but HATED what it left in my bath tub after I drained the water. The exfoliating beads don&#x27;t dissolve. If you&#x27;re a daily bath taker versus the shower, I&#x27;d go for a different body wash.</li>
            <li> This is really good smells good and works too..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery works great!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously the best exfoliating body scrub! It feels so good, and it&#x27;s even gotten rid of my body acne too! It lasts a long time and smells great!</li>
            <li> This is the first body scrub that actually feels like it works! It&#x27;s invigorating and when used with the Nivea lotion my dry, alligator skin is gone! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells amazing &amp; lathers well. Don&#x27;t use with shower pouf or wash cloth. Once a week for buffed skin. Bottle is huge &amp; price is crazy low. Add on product at check out. Love it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this last night when I took my shower, but I can already tell that it is AWESOME! First off, the smell is really good, and pleasant and not super perfumy so that it gives you head ache. The exfoliating is very, very good! I washed my legs, hips and thighs with a body brush and it made my skin so smooth, I literally said &amp;#34;Daammmmmnnnn&amp;#34; when I ran my hand up and down my leg lol.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the smell. Leave my sking smooth and fresh. I order this product every month. Good size as well</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Im loving this</li>
            <li> Smells so good! Lathers easily</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with this scrub--says that it works well, without an overpowering fragrance.  I trust the Nivea/Eucerin brand (Biersdorf, essentially) and I think that this scrub is a great value as well.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, works well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any great difference. But I have never found a scrub at any price that kept that pure clean feel for more than a few hours. Figure it can&#x27;t hurt to use.</li>
            <li> I use it, I love it.. It does what it says it will do, I use with a pouf an it lathers just fine :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body scrub for my back acne.&lt;br /&gt;I found this and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheap, it has a very pleasant scent that i absolutely LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;but the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; that are supposed to scrub and polish your skin are not very substantial and they dissolve very quickly. so it ends up like a regular soap for me.</li>
            <li> THE VERY BEST product for dead cells removal.  Feels great after making circles all over my body and washes iff clean.  Very hard to find in Northern California...glad Amazon is availabe!!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Use it everyday</li>
            <li> This is my day to day body scrub, does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash and was happy to be able to add it on to an order I recently placed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that my GF loves.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nice body scrub, good lather, nice clean scent great price.I like nivea products they are good for sensitive skin ans nicely scented</li>
            <li> Not the nicest but good enough for everyday use. leaves skin clean, soft and supple and rinses cleanly. Pretty good deal considering the price.</li>
            <li> I like it because it has actual beads that exfoliate but it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> Not too &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34;, not too &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.  This scrub has the perfect amount of micro-bead to lather ratio and leaves my skin super soft. It also has an intoxicatingly delicious smell - without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially for dry skin</li>
            <li> Perfect Amount of scrub. Love it. Exfoliates and smooths. I used it on my Tzone as well...keeps my face smooth. Keeps my legs polished and glowing. Fresh unisex scent as well</li>
            <li> The scent of this body wash and the fact that it&#x27;s a body &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; make this one of my favorite body washes that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a very clean scent and you really can&#x27;t go wrong with the Nivea brand.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub.  Gently exfoliates .  I use it every other day and really takes care of any dryness and makes my skin feel smooth  without residue and has a barely there fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Really great scrub. Very gentle exfoliating. my skin feels amazingly soft after using this just once.&lt;br /&gt;love this product will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> this wash is so great husband loves it</li>
            <li> The absolute best body wash.  Exfoliates and smoothed skin.</li>
            <li> Its got a nice scent to it..pretty decent size as well. it works better as an exfoliate if u use with a loofah.</li>
            <li> Great smell, wonderful texture and comfortable to use.  I have  extremely dry skin and this does not really hydrate me as I had hoped.  It also does not excessively dry my skin as most shower scrubs do so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this had micro-beads in it, and with the world coming to an end cuz of these stupid beads I figured I had to do my part in trying to save the world! #killallthemicrobeads</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a good body scrub.</li>
            <li> I like it but don&#x27;t always feel as clean as with other body scrubs, if you need a heavy exfoliation, forget this, but if you have sensitive or delicate skin it&#x27;s worth a try. Decent price also.</li>
            <li> Love it.. this is really a good Nivea product and for the price seems unbelievable.  Lathers and scrubs really well and feel like we really used a exfoliater after the shower. I do it once a week and it helps remove any dead skin</li>
            <li> I love the little granulated beads that exfoliate at the same time as it cleans.</li>
            <li> Used Nivea for decades.  Never found a product by this company that I didn&#x27;t like.  This grainy body scrub is really grainy, but that&#x27;s what one buys it for.  The lotion moisturizes your skin after the body scrub has done it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Nice and really scrubbing. Not as good as sea salt and olive oil, but leaves your skin really smooth,  with no residue our right, dry feeling. A real bargain, too!</li>
            <li> Really good in terms of being a scrub, but not necessarily the best when you&#x27;re sweaty or dirty. I use it in addition to a regular body wash</li>
            <li> Loooove it! Makes my skin real smooth.</li>
            <li> I added this item to my cart because I needed $4 in order to get free next day deliveries (the things we do...) and I must say I am pleasantly blown away! I didn&#x27;t think much of this given the price, but it&#x27;s just as nice as some of the more expensive scrubs I have used in the past. The scent is mild, I wouldn&#x27;t say that the scent is anything to write home about to be honest, but my skin is so smooth after just one use! I would definitely recommend checking this scrub out.</li>
            <li> Scrolling through soap scrubs I come across this 5 star with a gazillion reviews.  Really?  How can a soap be this great? It&#x27;s soap!  Well my friend, this isn&#x27;t just soap.  It&#x27;s a daily spa of goodness and delight!</li>
            <li> I normally go for very scented body wash, in this case I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because I really love the scrubbing beads in this body wash!  It just makes you feel refreshed and 100% clean after you take your shower!</li>
            <li> I love it.  Make me skin feel so amazing.  Love the sandy texture and the beads.  Definitely give this a shot if you&#x27;re looking to exfoliate!</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash. It is the best after a work out!</li>
            <li> DOES A GREAT JOB ON MY BODY.  LOVE THE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;SCURTISS1974</li>
            <li> I love this scrub! Its effective, makes me feel clean!</li>
            <li> after i use it, my skin feels so smooth and moisture. but it couldn&#x27;t be used as body wash, just the scuba</li>
            <li> I have Keratosis pilaris ( KP) and I was hoping this product could helpful improve my condition somehow. But honestly, I wasn&#x27;t  really expecting much, you know it&#x27;s only $4..... Wrong! It really did help!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The one day, I noticed, my skin feels so much softer and then I wonder, what have I been doing that making my skin so soft....?&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t change any body lotion, I didn&#x27;t do any skin peel.... then I realized I DID start using this Nivea Body Renewal Leathering Body Scrub!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the products!</li>
            <li> This scrub is wonderful. Some scrubs just wash right off your body without being able to really scrub with them, but this one penetrates and lets you have time to scrub off all that dead skin. The smell is pleasant and it is a really big bottle of product.  My skin already looks ready for summer time and this is a great product if you are getting ready to use self tanner. Gets rid of all those rough areas and makes skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This is two opinions in one review, so read to the end.  First let me share that I am a scrub product junkie; I have tried many scrubs.  This product is definitely close to the bottom of my list of recommended scrubs.  The texture of the beads is very fine, almost like a facial scrub.  So for those of you with sensitive skin who want to exfoliate, MAYBE this is for you.  Or maybe in the summer when you need a little something but you don&#x27;t want to clog your pores and want your skin to breathe because of all the heat, MAYBE this is the product you should reach for.  Or maybe you want to give your teenager a starter product that won&#x27;t damage their skin, MAYBE this is the one.  All other skin types should skip this one (or so I thought until my sister tried this product).  This product is combination cleanser with some micro beads. Yes, it does lather a little.  The smell is pleasant but the product is not effective as a scrub.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to moisturize after using it. I have enjoyed Nivea lotion through the years; but, this product doesn&#x27;t feel like any Nivea product I have tried before. Definitely, not a product I will use in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I let my sister try it and she L-O-V-E-S it.  She said she had a few dry patches on her legs and this product worked a mini-miracle; no more dry patches.  Her skin felt smooth and moisturized after using this scrub.  In fact, she wants to make this a part of daily regime because it is tough and gentle.  So after listning to her rave about this body scrub and tried it again.  Well let me just say she can keep it; I stand by my review.  I gave the product 5 stars because my sister truely raves about it.  Without her influence, I would give the product three stars. I shared both experiences with you so you could decide for yourself. I do believe that this is a unisex scrub that would be for even teenage skin.  You get a lot of product for your buck too.  By no means is it a bad product so I think you should tryit for yourself.</li>
            <li> I always love trying out new skin and bath products.  There are an insane amount out on the market today and more being developed every day.  I have always been a fan of using exfoliating scrubs daily, just for the simple fact that I love the deep clean feel that it leaves behind.  Nivea has also always been a trusted product brand for me, so I was anxious to give this lathering body scrub a try.  After the very first use, I was incredibly pleased.  It only takes a small amount of the product - I use a body poof - to create an excellent lather and to cleanse the entire body.  The scent is light and pleasant, therefor extends its use to both males and females.  The scrub is gentle, yet effective and leaves behind a wonderfully smooth and soft, moisturized feel to you skin.  Many soaps that I have tried often leave behind a sticky residue and this does not do that at all.  Only a clean and smooth feeling - as well as a feeling that your skin&#x27;s pores are open, breathing and clean, rather than clogged or still dirty.  I also feel that the price of this product is excellent and will be purchasing more of this in the future.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great skin cleanser for all skin/body types!</li>
            <li> Nivea Body Touch of Renewal Lathering Body Scrub is a superb way to refresh yourself.  It has little beads that are excellent exfoliates and the product&#x27;s use leaves one felling reinvigorated.  Best of all it does it without the abrasiveness of some similar products and a rich lather that makes you feel pampered.  Sometimes the little things in life can make a big difference in how you feel and this is one example.</li>
            <li> I live in a cold winter climate (with hot, humid summers) so my skin is feeling especially dry right now, even more so considering that our winter is dragging out forever.  I&#x27;ve tried every kind of lotion I could find this winter to help, but still found myself applying it several times a day.  I am fair skinned and sensitive skinned, so my options are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an exfoliant for my face but have never used one on my body.  And body washes usually have either an overpowering scent or tend to dry out the skin, or both.  I like Nivea products and this was no exception.  It has a clean, fresh scent, lathers up really well (even in hard water) and rinses without leaving a rubbery or filmy feeling and also without making your skin feel dried out.  I&#x27;ve noticed in the past couple of days since I started using this, my lotion seems to absorb better and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on my face since I ran out of my normal scrub and I can honestly say, I like the way it makes my face feel too.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or reactions from it.  My husband says he likes it too, so I guess it&#x27;s a keeper in our house!</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub. Its amazing on my skin and leaves it soft. It also helps with the darks spots on my body. I would recommend this to everyone looking for better their skin</li>
            <li> As part of my participation in the Amazon Vines program, I received this product for review.  The lathering scrub is reasonably priced and works well.  I have been alternating back and forth with the regular body wash.  The gritty feeling texture opens up the pores.  I recommend this product and would purchase it.</li>
            <li> FULL DISCLOSURE: Although I&#x27;m a guy, I always buy body wash and soap that&#x27;s marketed to women. I don&#x27;t care what anyone says; all the exfoliating, moisturizing stuff they put into women&#x27;s stuff is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, [[ASIN:B0075J4TDI Nivea Body Touch of Renewal Lathering Body Scrub, 12 Ounce]] is one of the best body washes I&#x27;ve ever used. It contains these little dissolving scrubbing beads that exfoliate skin during washing, and they&#x27;re very effective. I&#x27;ve noticed a subtle change in the &#x27;clarity&#x27; of my skin since using it. It lathers well and the lather holds up; I never have to &#x27;reload&#x27; my washcloth during a shower. Besides all that, it washes off clean and smells excellent. My advice is to use it with a cloth and not one of those &#x27;scrubbing mesh ball&#x27; things; I tried it with both, and the exfoliating formula seems to be much more effective when coming off a cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely stick with this product going forward.</li>
            <li> Even though the ingredient list reads like chemistry shopping list, I love this stuff and what it has done for my skin.  This is a great and efficient scrub.  I especially liked using it on my legs and seeing the glow they had afterward.  This scrub does impart moisture; however, I also like to use lotion afterwards.  This is a great way to get your circulation flowing and prepare for tanning.  It does lather, but not a lot.  If that is your selling point, buy body wash.  Buy this for the pure scrubbing bliss of it!  I will going back for more and more!</li>
            <li> As I get older, I&#x27;ve realized I need to take better care of my skin. I thought this product might be a nice way to try and exfoliate while showering and it has proven to be quite effective. I definitely feel the \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; part of it and it has felt pretty good actually (it has just the right amount of \\&quot;scruff\\&quot;). I like that you don&#x27;t need a ton of the scrub to get a good lather and clean for your entire body. I&#x27;ve used body washes in the past that felt like you were using half a tube just to keep a good lather going. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent or a greasy feel. Overall, I think this is a good product that does just what it says: exfoliates your skin while leaving you clean.</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub!  It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin, but it still exfoliates and moisturizes my skin, leaving it nice and soft.  I&#x27;ve tried other exfoliating body scrubs and most of them were too harsh - it felt like my skin was raw after using them!  I like the Nivea Body Touch of Renewal Lathering Body Scrub because while still exfoliating your skin, it truly is gentle enough to use on a daily basis.  Another benefit to this product is that it comes in a large (12 ounce) bottle, so you get a lot for your money! I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> With a light, clean scent this is one that whole family can use.  I usually go in for more girlie scents, but this is a great one to slough off that dry winter skin that everyone can share in.  I really enjoyed using it before I&#x27;d done the sunless tanning thing, felt clean and fresh, and sloghed away any residue from the old tan. I&#x27;d recommend this one to those who have boys/men who don&#x27;t want the &#x27;girlie&#x27; smells, but still want that deep clean experience.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I have a bias to write about this product because it was the one I used as a teenager back in my home country, so it brings some memories.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is gentle, smells deliciously and really helps to clean and scrub your skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scrubby but not too much, foams nice, works with a washcloth, a puff, your hands, whatever. It&#x27;s also moisturizing. And it smells just like classic Nivea cream which I like!</li>
            <li> While I like many Nivea products, for me this scrub was just too highly perfumed.  Smells like men&#x27;s aftershave--strong odor that I could not get off my hands even after repeated washing.  Gave it away.</li>
            <li> Age: 56&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: can be sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you the body scrubs I&#x27;ve purchased that when applied, didn&#x27;t feel as if they had much \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; to them. This one has just enough of a rough scrub to it to make me feel as if it is gently but effectively exfoliating. As well it has a creamy texture that feels wonderful on my skin. Unlike some have said in their reviews, I did notice a lathering - enough for me, as some body scrubs don&#x27;t lather at all, or others there is so much lather I&#x27;m worried it won&#x27;t completely wash off of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the light fresh scent - it&#x27;s soft with an almost \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; scent, but not in an unpleasant way, more in a \\&quot;this stuff means business, good business for your skin\\&quot; kind of way - I like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m rinsing it off, my skin feels noticeably silky soft. I&#x27;ll be curious to see how it makes my skin feel/look as I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty good sized tube for the price - another plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great product I&#x27;ll be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Nivea creates a huge winner here with this wonderful easy to use and store product. Its a great balanced shape that fits on your shower shelf easily and is easy to grab when your ready to lather up. The product itself is soft yet exfoliates, just as described, without leaving scratch marks on delicate skin. It also rinses clean easily, leaves no sticky residue, and yet your skin is softer after use. I love this and feel super fresh with soft cared for skin after using it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this scrub when I am done with the free sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, great price - the tube is huge, as it should be when the scrub is for the whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, excellent quality. It feels wonderful on skin. (Mine is very sensitive, BTW.) No allergic reactions, the scrubbing elements in the lotion are in just perfect quantity. It leaves skin refreshed. And washes off well after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely recommend.</li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliate. Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I seldom love products, but this scrub deserves 5 stars, and I will continue to buy it.  I have pretty tough skin, so I’m more interested in the scrubbing aspect than the gentleness of products like this.  I love the plenitude of scrubbing crystals as well as the moderate amount of foam that this product provides.  I feel clean and refreshed from showering after perspiring or having to go without a shower for a few days like while camping and hiking.  It scrubs the grime off me without giving me a scraped up, raw feeling.  The scent is fresh, not too musky or spicy like many men’s scrubs, nor too flowery or feminine scented, so that the guys and girls can use the same product.  It moisturized fine without stripping my skin , but I often use body cream on shaved legs and elbows anyway.  This is a nice sized tube at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is essentially a light exfoliating body wash that is just that, with little to no fragrance. If anything, it smells a little bit like hand lotion. I felt clean and refreshed after using it and it washed right off, leaving no residue or greasy feeling afterward. The \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; are only lightly abrasive compared to other exfoliating agents. I liked this product and have no qualms about recommending it to anyone looking for a new body wash to try.</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this stuff! It smells so clean! I left it in the shower and now it&#x27;s half gone becuase my entire family has been using it. The scrubbing beads really help you get a seriously clean feeling! The smell is fresh and clean not fruity or super sweet. My skin is soft and smooth and I smell great!</li>
            <li> I pretty much like everything from Nivea, so seeing this come up as something to review made me happy.  And this product did not disappoint.  It has a light, soap-like scent; it scrubs without being too scratchy; and my skin feels hydrated.  I live in hard water central, and even though we have a whole house filter, taking a shower can dry my skin out.  This makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> I must say that I really like the smell and thick consistency of this body wash. It actually works pretty good and lathers well. The only thing I can do without is the exfoliating micro beads....they just seemed to stick to my skin after showering which was frustrating. If they could make a wash without the micro beads then I could see myself using It regularly.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product - a nice scent, not too strong; nice exfoliation beads, not too big or too teeny; bottle is a good hefty size as well. But the description says that it&#x27;s okay for daily use. Well, if you have sensitive skin like mine, there is no way you will want to use this daily. Maybe once a week to slough off dead skin. But daily will shred your skin. Otherwise, a good item.</li>
            <li> Most people probably think all body scrubs are pretty much the same. Not true. As a skin care professional, I can tell you there are certain qualities that are important in anything you put on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea Touch of renewal Lathering Body Scrub is a great scrub that has a rich lather and tiny microbeads that slough away dead skin cells, leaving your skin super soft and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in the texture and smoothness of my skin right away. I absolutely love that it has the right amount of scrub to soften, leaving my skin feeling healthy and revitalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for only 4 stars is because of the ingredients.  It does contain parabens (preservatives, which I prefer to not have in my skin care products) and it also contains a high amount of sulfates, which is what gives it that fabulous foaming effect, but will not harm your skin, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, since you don&#x27;t leave it on your skin, the parabens are not enough for me to stop using it, and the great size (12oz) means it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely made my skin softer, smoother and healthier looking. I would use it again.</li>
            <li> It smells nice. Doesn&#x27;t have to strong a scent. Takes a few squeezes to get enough to cover my whole body but its worth it in the end. Leaves my skin feeling silky, soft and smooth! Actually hadn&#x27;t planned to buy this but I&#x27;m really glad I did!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!! It has made such a difference in my skin since I started using it. I am a man and I work outside. I use to have dry ruff skin all over. I FOUND A CURE FOR THAT. It takes a little while but it is fun if you have someone close that can help you.&lt;br /&gt;First I would suggest you get a &amp;#34;AXE Detailer Shower Tool&amp;#34; you can get them from Amazon or in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;You DO need a partner or someone VERY CLOSE to you. You can do this in the shower but it is much better on a bed or massage table. Cover the bed so it will not get wet. Have the person lie on the bed nude. You need a small bucket, very warm water, a towel,&lt;br /&gt;and hopefully the AXE Detailer Shower Tool .  Get the towel wet but not too wet Start on the back of the neck and continue down the back getting it wet apply the Nivea body scrub not to much a little goes a long way. Start scrubbing the neck and back and arms in a circular motion with the shower tool, take your time, don&#x27;t rush. Continue down the gluts and the back of the legs. Don&#x27;t miss any area. When the back side is finished. Take another wet towel and wipe as much of the scrub off the body as you can. Now is a good time to scrub the bottom of the feet. Have the person turn over Now is the time to do the face DON&#x27;T use the scrub on the face. Instead use the &amp;#34;NIVEA MEN ENERGY FACE SCRUB IT is easer on the face. Scrub the face good. Leave the scrub on the face while you continue down the front of the body. Do a good job on the front. When finished wipe the front off as you did the back. On the face if you can leave the scrub on the face until the shower.&lt;br /&gt;NOW turn about is fair play get your partner down on the bed and start scrubbing. When BOTH of you are done if you have a shower that is big enough for two, both of you step in . Here I use &amp;#34;NIVEA MEN ACTIVE 3 SPORT BODY WASH&amp;#34; all over the body including the face. Wash each other really good and get all the body scrub off the body. Now dry off really good. Here is the last step. change the towels on the bed and replace with dry ones. The second person lie down on the bed face down. At this point I use&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34;NIVEA MEN EXPRESS ABSORPITION REVITALIZING SKIN LOTION&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion absorbs into the skin quickly and dries quickly.When you are done on him and if he has enough strength  have him do you.&lt;br /&gt;I have completed 3 of these sessions and I can say without question my skin looks and feels 20 years younger. I have a masseuse&lt;br /&gt;and she can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive body scrub to exfoliate with. I saw the price and brand and grabbed this and bought it without smelling it. I used it, and while it seems to exfoliate well and soften my skin, it smells pretty bad. The first time I smelled it, it smelled nice, but once I used it in the shower, it was a bad smell - it smelled like glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, the scrub itself is good but the smell is pretty bad. Since I can&#x27;t return it now I&#x27;ll just use it until it&#x27;s gone but not buy it again because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product foe awhile, and I like it vey much.  The beads gently exfoliate the skin; I rup extra on my elbows and knees when necessary. And the residual oil that is left on the skin after showering is very subtle but still effective.  I do not like showering products that leave a lot of reisidue on the skin. This is barely noticeable; but you can still tell. Perfect!</li>
            <li> My store stopped carrying this item :(&lt;br /&gt;Thank u amazon for my rescue!&lt;br /&gt;This gotta be the best daily scrub - from great smell to being mild on my sensitive skin and moisturizing too.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s NIVEA so u can trust it on your skin</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell.  It was half liquid soap half exfoliater and did neither that well.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; product, so paid less than $4. I can&#x27;t find this at other stores and for the size, that price is comparable or better. It&#x27;s an exfoliating scrub, so it has little beads in it, but it&#x27;s not a rough scrub (like St. Ive&#x27;s Apricot). It&#x27;s a soft scrub and lathers somewhat (not like bar soap). The scent is clean and mild (kind of like &amp;#34;rain water&amp;#34; types), so not an overbearing perfume smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty large tube and the smell is not offensive to me. I&#x27;ll use it a couple times a week with a loofah because I&#x27;m a maniac. Works well for ingrowns and KP.</li>
            <li> gently and smells good.  Can use everyday.  I use before shaving to help prevent ingrown hairs.  Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I felt like this scrub left my body feeling itchy and somewhat uncomfortable - as if I didn&#x27;t shower in days - I&#x27;m sticking with the tree hut brand, these are better</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have Ichthyosis Vulgaris, a skin condition that leaves me flaky and scaly. A woman in an online forum for the condition suggested it, as it worked really well for her. For me, it hasn&#x27;t worked as well as I&#x27;d hoped. BUT that&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t a nice product. It has just enough grit in it to help exfoliate my skin, but not too much that it leaves me irritated (as other products sometimes do). I think it would be great for someone with regular dry skin, but mine is a little too far gone for it to work perfectly. That said, it smells really nice, feels quite creamy (despite the grit) and does leave my less severely affected skin feeling pretty delicious. I recommend it for those who just want a nice exfoliator - especially if getting a fake tan. I think this would work really well for most people.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I absolutely love this scrub! it has micro-beads which feels so fantastic on the skin without being too harsh! And this lasts SO MUCH! I have been using it once a week (sometimes twice) and there&#x27;s still plenty of product! such a great value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this numerous times and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a lather.  I realize that it is a body scrub, but a little more later would be nice.  The scrub is gentle - almost too gentle.  After this winter, I was hoping it would be a little more abrasive to tackle the dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> This scrubbing cream is very effective in removing dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product. It hardly lathers up and I can barely stand the smell of it. I really wish that I would have done a sniff test by popping open the cap before I bought it. Every time I&#x27;ve used it, I try to hurry just so I can wash it off because of the smell. It might be a decent exfoliating product with the microbeads, but all of that doesn&#x27;t matter since I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item!!!  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is way nicer than I thought it would be, even for Nivea.  The bottle is generous in size, the bits in it are noticeable without being too big or too small.  there is a slight pleasant scent, but not much of one -- so probably wouldn&#x27;t offend the scent-sensitive!  The price was great and haven&#x27;t seen this available in stores.</li>
            <li> Feels really good! Many people complain of fragrance..I found it soothing but then it&#x27;s a subjective thing. The product works as it says in label.I really liked it! 4 stars because haven&#x27;t used it a lot yet, so can&#x27;t say how useful it is in long run..only thrice till now..</li>
            <li> What a great body scrub. It really lives up to it&#x27;s name and does a great job. It arrived well packaged and on time. Thanks</li>
            <li> Shame on you for allowing microbeads in your product(s). And don’t insult my intelligence by stating that you didn’t know they would be a danger to the environment. Where did you think these microbeads would end up? These micro-particle polyethylene beads, which are less than 1mm in diameter and designed to be washed down the drain, are polluting lakes and the oceans. Fish who swallow them are not getting the nutrition they need to live a healthy life, thus impacting the whole food chain. Many companies, including L’Oreal, The Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble have agreed to phase out them out. But no one is asking the question … How in the world did you ever think these microbeads would be a good thing? It’s shameful. Avoid products with polyethylene as one of its ingredients. Microbeads have been put in facial scrub products, bath gels and toothpastes. For further information, simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li> Smells great, lots of beads for a good scrub, and leaves my skin soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this nivea scrub. From the first use, the skin gets so soft. And that&#x27;s what I am actually looking for. I have been using that product for a while now, and keep buying it cuz it&#x27;s super cheap here. I am not a lover of all nivea products, but I definitely am for this one. My only concern, unless I use too much of it, is that even its a big bottle, it goes down pretty fast. Anyway, I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This is a very decent body wash especially for the price. It creates a soft, creamy, luxurious lather that is spa-like and it has a nice clean smell that also reminds you of a spa. The beads are sufficient enough to slough away dirt and dead skin cells, but are not rough on your skin. I believe this is my first time trying Nivea and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I really,  really love this. You can feel the difference it makes to your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is big in real than in picture and it feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Effective, gentle and moisturizing, this scrub is really good. The bottle is also huge so it will last for awhile</li>
            <li> I am feeling renewed! I LOVED this product so much that I told all my friends about it, how it gave me a smoother body. Great value for money and so much better than those over priced other body washes. Convenient shape for those wet hands in the shower. It lasted longer than expected, even when my husband decided to try it to see what I was raving about. He loved it too!</li>
            <li> I already love love Nivea Q10! I love the niveea brand. It may cost a little more but its the only skin you get. tAKE THis into the shower with you and experience its rich lather, clean and fresh scent. WE found a WINNER, my beau even sneaks to use my Nivea when he thinks I won&#x27;t know. He even uses it on his face.</li>
            <li> Good lord I love this product. It does a great job of exfoliating my skin. My skin is less dry when I get out of the shower. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice exfoliating product that is perfect for trying to get your skin back into shape after a harsh winter.  For some reason, 12 oz turned out to be a much bigger tube than I was expecting.  The smell is rather strong and I have a feeling that will be a turn off for some users.  I found it pleasant however.  It is much too strong and \\&quot;grainy\\&quot; for everyday use.  I used it two mornings in a row and then returned to my regular body wash because my skin was starting to feel a little tender.  It does it&#x27;s job however in helping to remove dead skin particles and making your skin look and feel much fresher.  I will continue to use this occasionally as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is incredibly reasonable too.  A winner!</li>
            <li> I am giving this 2 stars based on the fact that I like the product but I cannot stand the smell. It has a very potent perfume smell. Other than that, the product does a good job at exfoliating gently. It has micro peeling particles and vitamin E pearls that work together according to the information I read. You can use it daily. It states it provides long lasting moisturization but I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in my skin as I always have to have lotion. It may provide the moisturization, I just didn&#x27;t notice anything. If you don&#x27;t mind strong scented products, you&#x27;ll probably be fine with this.</li>
            <li> I wanted a skin scrub to slough off dry winter skin now that its spring. I couldn&#x27;t find many out there that weren&#x27;t designer name brands and over $40 so when I came across this one I was excited! I love that it has just the right amount of grain for scrubbing, it doesn&#x27;t overkill and clog your pores. When you rinse it from your skin you will immediately notice how soft your skin feels. I heart this product, not to mention it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle for the price. This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Nivea has recently been bringing out more products, but so have other companies. As a male with sensitive and oily skin, I especially am on the look out for a body scrub that works, but doesn&#x27;t smell like a bouquet of flowers or cost too much. In the past I&#x27;ve used Axe&#x27;s Snake Peel, but find the Axe markup unacceptable.  I&#x27;ve used the Nivea Body touch of Renewal several times and impressed. It is not as abrasive as some body scrubs, but is certainly a contender when I need to a body scrub.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;renewal\\&quot; in this body wash is small micro-beads that scrub dead skin as you wash.  It feels great on feet, elbows, knees, and face.  Seriously, the skin on my face has never felt tighter and cleaner.  The beads are a little rough for \\&quot;body\\&quot; though.  That said, I am in love with how this product feels so I don&#x27;t mind a gentler soap for the sensitive parts and this for the rougher parts.</li>
            <li> I love trying out new body washes but sometimes they don&#x27;t keep you feeling completely clean and you have to wash a second time. When I tried out the Nivea Body Touch, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to except because I don&#x27;t use scrubs often. But when I put in on my loofah ans started to use it, it felt very nice. The little beads in the wash made me feel very clean even before I was done rinsing.</li>
            <li> Like it as a body wash but as a scrub it sucks</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this body wash. It is light and sweet! I didn&#x27;t need too much on my scrubber to lather me up well. I love that a little goes a long way. There are rough little granular in the soap that I liked, there were not too harsh and dissolved and washed away easily. I live in the desert and purposely didn&#x27;t put lotion on after using this product. My skin started looking dry halfway threw the day, this is a good thing as my skin usually looks dry shortly after a shower. I love how big it is and that it will last me a long time:}</li>
            <li> Hefty bottle you get a lot for your money</li>
            <li> Cannot find this at my local walmart and is twice as much at the drug store! Worth it but I&#x27;d rather pay less. My skin feels smooth after my showers.  Love it!</li>
            <li> got for Christmas stocking stuffers.  I am sure it will be great.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was looking for a body scrub with vitamin E to help with old acne scarring I have on my chest and shoulders. Within two months, it&#x27;s like I have completely new skin. The scars on my chest have completely faded and my shoulders aren&#x27;t completely gone but they are definitely much improved. Also, the breakouts have stopped. Love love love this scrub.</li>
            <li> This is a good scrub, just not as scrubby as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered for my dry skin! I am a fan of Nivea since living in Europe for many years. The brand is the best for problem skin care. I have excessive dry skin and have been trying different body lotions with not complete success. I tried this product and VOILA! It lathers well in the shower or bath and easily applied just like a shower gel. One difference . .  it exfoliates really well and then rinses off cleanly leaving your skin soft and moisturized. It can be used daily and not just weekly as some exfoliating products. After my shower I feel renewed!</li>
            <li> I hated the smell and I think it gave me hives. It did moisturize well enough to forego after bath lotion, and it did have enough grit to call it a &amp;#34;scrub,&amp;#34; though if you&#x27;re looking for real exfoliation as you&#x27;d need with self-tanner, keep looking. There&#x27;s enough scrub to stimulate your skin and get your blood moving, but not to smooth the skin completely. If they came out with a fragrance free version, I might try it again, but as it is, the bad outweighs the good.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find something to scrub my skin as my arms have several dry spots from the wintertime.  This scrub did the job but I personally would only use it once or twice a week.  This is a good scrub for both men and women as the scent is mild  and not overly floral.  I did not get very good lather but that is not an issue for me.  I will be using this for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> My skin is SUPER sensitive.  Most soaps or lotions either make me break out in rash, or leave me incredibly itchy.  That bein said, I do like a good exfoliating scrub.  Finally I have found a product that does both for me.</li>
