            <li>But I buy Neutrogena Sport Face with my own money for my workouts on the track.</li>
            <li>Sport Face with my own money for my workouts on the track.</li>
            <li>Really effective for water sports.</li>
            <li>She burns very easily.  </li>
            <li>and I burn very easily.</li>
            <li>Best face sunscreen I have used so far,</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break me out and offers very good skin protection.</li>
            <li>..not sexy.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I would love to keep this stuff, but I need my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Would love a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t burn your eyes when you sweat or swim.  </li>
            <li>I had better stick to Elta MD sports sunblock.</li>
            <li>In addition, it does not run into one&#x27;s eyes even in the most sweat producing conditions.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy like most sun blocks.  </li>
            <li>SO GLAD.</li>
            <li>Fragrance ok.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used most of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested a bunch of sunscreens because so many burn my eyes when I run.</li>
            <li>Use this sun screen every day with or without makeup.  :-)</li>
            <li>I am a redhead and love to be out side in the summer.</li>
            <li>Great product, lightweight, non greasy, fast drying.</li>
            <li>If you retract your feedback I will gladly refund your money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go on 20 mile runs in Texas with it on (so obviously very sweaty), and my super fair skin has yet to burn!</li>
            <li>it is best used to cover smaller face surfaces, though it is hands down the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is better than most but still isn&#x27;t as friendly as I would like.</li>
            <li>I bought Neutrogena Ultimate Sport Face Sunblock Lotion, SPF 70 for my VERY fair daughter who decided she wanted to play Water Polo this summer.  </li>
            <li>We break a sweat and really need a good sunscreen that sticks with us.</li>
            <li>Price is not any better than your local walmart but still a great product.</li>
            <li>You could have easily contacted me with your concern</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been out in strong sun all day without burning.</li>
            <li>The more my right eye watered, the more it stung and burned.</li>
            <li>and she is fine with that.</li>
            <li>and they are fine.</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot and still the product works fine.</li>
            <li>This time I went to the grocery store, and saw the huge display of sb.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be Fragrance free but doesn&#x27;t smell too chemically.</li>
            <li>Like all dermatologists, I get a bunch of sunscreens for free from manufacturers.  </li>
            <li>Light feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to find a high SPF, face sunscreen in travel size.</li>
            <li>effective, high SPF.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this every day for the last 2 months in my army uniform and it feels amazing!</li>
            <li>I usually find that sport sunscreen is greasy or leaves a burning sensation on my skin, but this one is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I know their products aren&#x27;t rated well when you look at chemicals used and and all that, but nothing at this price point will protect me better from sunburn on a blazing hot August afternoon.  </li>
            <li>They also sell shirts that block ultraviolet light and cool you off.</li>
            <li>I reapply at halftime during games, because no matter how sweat proof it claims to be, I wipe my face clean over and over, and that will remove the sunscreen over time.  </li>
            <li>I loved that stuff, but I like trying something different each time.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NECESSARY TO CARE SKIN, AND IT HAVE A GOOD TEXTURE  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll end with a quick note on visibility of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used high end products like Kiehl&#x27;s and Shisheido and feel this is a better product.</li>
            <li>Most drug store sun block lotions that I have tried for the face are made for people with oily to normal skin.</li>
            <li>I considered okay because itÂ´s good but not the best for high performance, I mean when you really need protection for long time for cycling as example.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has not only been very effective keeping her from getting sunburned, it seems to be highly water resistent as well.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it stung while the solvent was fresh, but after rubbing my eyes until it was dry, both eyes did not burn or sting at all.</li>
            <li>This sunblock is great, it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I start sweating, but it does tingle a little.</li>
            <li>which I noticed with many of the organic or natural sb.  </li>
            <li>but it was worth a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that seems to burn with most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>but it gets absorbed by the time I step out the door.</li>
            <li>I can feel I&#x27;m honoring Hippocrates and his oath:  Even the best sunscreens are not perfect in filtering or blocking ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>but I make sure to wear a hat when I am out and reapply frequently.  </li>
            <li>I think it is probably good sunscreen but should not be marketed as sport face if running in eyes causes extreme pain.</li>
            <li>Yes, you heard right</li>
            <li>love Neutrogena products in general</li>
            <li>so I put on more of my daily moisturizer...</li>
            <li>Better prices here (at my time of purchase) than at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>The first day I used this product  </li>
            <li>I always apply the first time about 30 minutes before sun exposure, to let it soak in, and that will help keep it from running into your eyes.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>Very Gradual!</li>
            <li>more word of advice not related to this sunscreen, so</li>
            <li>I am very scared about getting sun cancer, and this is the only sunscreen I feel confident in wearing.</li>
            <li>My skin is also super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I also rarely have issues with this burning my eyes, which are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The left eye seemed fine.  </li>
            <li>and I was told to put a very high sun block on the area</li>
            <li>very glitzy.</li>
            <li>So, this one went on smoothly and didnt leave me white.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t you want it to stay on if you HAPPEN to go for a run, or to the gym, or until you take a shower, especially if it feels light?    </li>
            <li>Dries fast  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance that I can detect and protects very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also never broken out or had any skin issues that I could relate to using this product.</li>
            <li>This is a real advance in sun protection.</li>
            <li>I am very burned.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of putting this on before a 60 mile bike ride and when I really started sweating on my way up a mountain about halfway into the ride, the sweat got into my eyes and the intense burning began immediately.</li>
            <li>My wife is very picky about sun cream</li>
            <li>Decent product, ok on sensitive skin if not applied several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Protects from sunburn if applied every 1.5-2hours.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>--many sunscreens break down in sunlight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live up at my cottage the whole Summer-</li>
            <li>This one in particular stuck out at me for two reasons..</li>
            <li>I use this product on my face and with only one or two reups a day I can spend 5-8 hours outside without getting burned or bumping up my freckle count. :)</li>
            <li>I have never seen it that high yet, so I was sold.  </li>
            <li>High SPF(though supposedly the FDA is going to put a stop to any labeling over 30)  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly when swimming.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, the oil-free formula didn&#x27;t break my skin out at all</li>
            <li>However, I did notice that the spray caused the skin around my eyes to very lightly burn continuously, and the skin felt stiff and unnatural whenever I would blink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I assumed (very incorrectly) that a product marked as a \\&quot;sport\\&quot; sunscreen and specifically for the face could be worn on my face while performing an outdoor sport.</li>
            <li>I think if I wipe my eyes with a dry clean cloth during the day, it will eliminate that from happening at all.  </li>
            <li>I hope this is not a common thing.  </li>
            <li>I used my normal (SPF 15) sunscreen on my arms and legs</li>
            <li>Product 60 in left eye and 70 in the right eye.</li>
            <li>I stuck with it for a minute to see if 60 would react, but even though my left eye was getting watery out of sympathy for my right eye, I still felt nothing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead living in Chicago and I play soccer every Sunday and run during week days, and this keeps me pale and sunburn free better than any other product out there.</li>
            <li>After a good rinse with tap water and towel dry, I sprayed a dime-size amount of the 50 spray to 2 new fingers that had never been in contact with the previous two products, and quickly rubbed them into both closed eyes simultaneously.  </li>
            <li>, I just did a lab rat style eye test with 3 new sunscreens to see if they burned.</li>
            <li>I live in a state with a lot of sunshine  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena makes other products that are better suited for daily skin protection.</li>
            <li>She has converted me to using it (no small feat).  </li>
            <li>Should someone buy the product first and only then dab some in our eyes like a lab animal to see if we are \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; and if our eyes are about to explode from pain?</li>
            <li>Disappears very quickly into the skin, not greasy or heavy in any way.  </li>
            <li>None at all, just a little light color.</li>
            <li>I bought this sun block for my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>That said I as an adult have no problem using it.</li>
            <li>I did it so that I would know which ones would make my eyes burn or sting before trying them on my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>: I compared Banana Boat Sport Coolzone SPF50+ spray, and Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF60+ lotion, and Neutrogena Sport Face SPF70+ lotion.  </li>
            <li>For children under age 12, I&#x27;d stick with 60 (Sensitive Skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Contains all three of the most common parabens, which the EU believes linked to cancer.</li>
            <li>but it burns my sensitive skin upon application.</li>
            <li>This product offers complete sun protection.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product at a store near my home.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and burn through all the others I have used</li>
            <li>In my opinion, they are probably just unlucky to be sensitive to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I complain and this is their response:  &amp;#34;I was ready to refund your money until I seen the feedback you left.</li>
            <li>I get far fewer breakouts using Elta MD:</li>
            <li>First time in a long time I did not get sunburned.</li>
            <li>I put Lentil bean size amount on a clean finger (one finger for each sunscreen so they didn&#x27;t mix) and vigorously rubbed them onto my eyelid and the entire area around the eye until I felt a reaction with my eye still closed.  </li>
            <li>Since I was testing 2 lotions from the same manufacturer and 1 spray, I first applied each lotion to an eye at the same time.</li>
            <li>I am also 53 years old and drive a shuttle bus on a major college campus for 10 hours a day.  </li>
            <li>I use this everywhere, not just face; you could get cheaper stuff, but a tube of this lasts so long that I don&#x27;t really care</li>
            <li>and I am red and my face is burning when I put on my normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It runs down my forehead right into my eyes and burns.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, I was riding with friends and one of them had plain water with him (not just sports drinks like I did).</li>
            <li>Now My husband uses it as a general sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin and working outside all day does not do my complection any favors</li>
            <li>Confused by the results, I sprayed more and rubbed it into my eyes again with identical reactions.  </li>
            <li>I knocked down one star, because it does burn your eyes for awhile after you first put it on.</li>
            <li>I ran to the kitchen again and dunked my head in the sink, and dried off after the burning subsided in the right eye.</li>
            <li>:  It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes since I started the test, and both eyes feel fine now except for the underlying subtle burn from the spray.  </li>
            <li>When I first applied it I noticed very little fragrance..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve used most of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested a bunch of sunscreens because so many burn my eyes when I run.</li>
            <li> Use this sun screen every day with or without makeup.  :-)</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and love to be out side in the summer.</li>
            <li> Great product, lightweight, non greasy, fast drying.</li>
            <li> If you retract your feedback I will gladly refund your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go on 20 mile runs in Texas with it on (so obviously very sweaty), and my super fair skin has yet to burn!</li>
            <li> it is best used to cover smaller face surfaces, though it is hands down the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is better than most but still isn&#x27;t as friendly as I would like.</li>
            <li> I bought Neutrogena Ultimate Sport Face Sunblock Lotion, SPF 70 for my VERY fair daughter who decided she wanted to play Water Polo this summer.  </li>
            <li> We break a sweat and really need a good sunscreen that sticks with us.</li>
            <li> Price is not any better than your local walmart but still a great product.</li>
            <li> You could have easily contacted me with your concern</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been out in strong sun all day without burning.</li>
            <li> The more my right eye watered, the more it stung and burned.</li>
            <li> and she is fine with that.</li>
            <li> and they are fine.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and still the product works fine.</li>
            <li> This time I went to the grocery store, and saw the huge display of sb.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be Fragrance free but doesn&#x27;t smell too chemically.</li>
            <li> Like all dermatologists, I get a bunch of sunscreens for free from manufacturers.  </li>
            <li> Light feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to find a high SPF, face sunscreen in travel size.</li>
            <li> effective, high SPF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this every day for the last 2 months in my army uniform and it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I usually find that sport sunscreen is greasy or leaves a burning sensation on my skin, but this one is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I know their products aren&#x27;t rated well when you look at chemicals used and and all that, but nothing at this price point will protect me better from sunburn on a blazing hot August afternoon.  </li>
            <li> They also sell shirts that block ultraviolet light and cool you off.</li>
            <li> I reapply at halftime during games, because no matter how sweat proof it claims to be, I wipe my face clean over and over, and that will remove the sunscreen over time.  </li>
            <li> I loved that stuff, but I like trying something different each time.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NECESSARY TO CARE SKIN, AND IT HAVE A GOOD TEXTURE  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll end with a quick note on visibility of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used high end products like Kiehl&#x27;s and Shisheido and feel this is a better product.</li>
            <li> Most drug store sun block lotions that I have tried for the face are made for people with oily to normal skin.</li>
            <li> I considered okay because itÂ´s good but not the best for high performance, I mean when you really need protection for long time for cycling as example.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has not only been very effective keeping her from getting sunburned, it seems to be highly water resistent as well.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it stung while the solvent was fresh, but after rubbing my eyes until it was dry, both eyes did not burn or sting at all.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is great, it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I start sweating, but it does tingle a little.</li>
            <li> which I noticed with many of the organic or natural sb.  </li>
            <li> but it was worth a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that seems to burn with most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> but it gets absorbed by the time I step out the door.</li>
            <li> I can feel I&#x27;m honoring Hippocrates and his oath:  Even the best sunscreens are not perfect in filtering or blocking ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> but I make sure to wear a hat when I am out and reapply frequently.  </li>
            <li> I think it is probably good sunscreen but should not be marketed as sport face if running in eyes causes extreme pain.</li>
            <li> Yes, you heard right</li>
            <li> love Neutrogena products in general</li>
            <li> so I put on more of my daily moisturizer...</li>
            <li> Better prices here (at my time of purchase) than at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> The first day I used this product  </li>
            <li> I always apply the first time about 30 minutes before sun exposure, to let it soak in, and that will help keep it from running into your eyes.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> Very Gradual!</li>
            <li> more word of advice not related to this sunscreen, so</li>
            <li> I am very scared about getting sun cancer, and this is the only sunscreen I feel confident in wearing.</li>
            <li> My skin is also super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I also rarely have issues with this burning my eyes, which are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The left eye seemed fine.  </li>
            <li> and I was told to put a very high sun block on the area</li>
            <li> very glitzy.</li>
            <li> So, this one went on smoothly and didnt leave me white.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you want it to stay on if you HAPPEN to go for a run, or to the gym, or until you take a shower, especially if it feels light?    </li>
            <li> Dries fast  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance that I can detect and protects very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also never broken out or had any skin issues that I could relate to using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a real advance in sun protection.</li>
            <li> I am very burned.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of putting this on before a 60 mile bike ride and when I really started sweating on my way up a mountain about halfway into the ride, the sweat got into my eyes and the intense burning began immediately.</li>
            <li> My wife is very picky about sun cream</li>
            <li> Decent product, ok on sensitive skin if not applied several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Protects from sunburn if applied every 1.5-2hours.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> --many sunscreens break down in sunlight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live up at my cottage the whole Summer-</li>
            <li> This one in particular stuck out at me for two reasons..</li>
            <li> I use this product on my face and with only one or two reups a day I can spend 5-8 hours outside without getting burned or bumping up my freckle count. :)</li>
            <li> I have never seen it that high yet, so I was sold.  </li>
            <li> High SPF(though supposedly the FDA is going to put a stop to any labeling over 30)  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly when swimming.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, the oil-free formula didn&#x27;t break my skin out at all</li>
            <li> However, I did notice that the spray caused the skin around my eyes to very lightly burn continuously, and the skin felt stiff and unnatural whenever I would blink.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I assumed (very incorrectly) that a product marked as a \\&quot;sport\\&quot; sunscreen and specifically for the face could be worn on my face while performing an outdoor sport.</li>
            <li> I think if I wipe my eyes with a dry clean cloth during the day, it will eliminate that from happening at all.  </li>
            <li> I hope this is not a common thing.  </li>
            <li> I used my normal (SPF 15) sunscreen on my arms and legs</li>
            <li> Product 60 in left eye and 70 in the right eye.</li>
            <li> I stuck with it for a minute to see if 60 would react, but even though my left eye was getting watery out of sympathy for my right eye, I still felt nothing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead living in Chicago and I play soccer every Sunday and run during week days, and this keeps me pale and sunburn free better than any other product out there.</li>
            <li> After a good rinse with tap water and towel dry, I sprayed a dime-size amount of the 50 spray to 2 new fingers that had never been in contact with the previous two products, and quickly rubbed them into both closed eyes simultaneously.  </li>
            <li> , I just did a lab rat style eye test with 3 new sunscreens to see if they burned.</li>
            <li> I live in a state with a lot of sunshine  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes other products that are better suited for daily skin protection.</li>
            <li> She has converted me to using it (no small feat).  </li>
            <li> Should someone buy the product first and only then dab some in our eyes like a lab animal to see if we are \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; and if our eyes are about to explode from pain?</li>
            <li> Disappears very quickly into the skin, not greasy or heavy in any way.  </li>
            <li> None at all, just a little light color.</li>
            <li> I bought this sun block for my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> That said I as an adult have no problem using it.</li>
            <li> I did it so that I would know which ones would make my eyes burn or sting before trying them on my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li> : I compared Banana Boat Sport Coolzone SPF50+ spray, and Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF60+ lotion, and Neutrogena Sport Face SPF70+ lotion.  </li>
            <li> For children under age 12, I&#x27;d stick with 60 (Sensitive Skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Contains all three of the most common parabens, which the EU believes linked to cancer.</li>
            <li> but it burns my sensitive skin upon application.</li>
            <li> This product offers complete sun protection.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product at a store near my home.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and burn through all the others I have used</li>
            <li> In my opinion, they are probably just unlucky to be sensitive to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I complain and this is their response:  &amp;#34;I was ready to refund your money until I seen the feedback you left.</li>
            <li> I get far fewer breakouts using Elta MD:</li>
            <li> First time in a long time I did not get sunburned.</li>
            <li> I put Lentil bean size amount on a clean finger (one finger for each sunscreen so they didn&#x27;t mix) and vigorously rubbed them onto my eyelid and the entire area around the eye until I felt a reaction with my eye still closed.  </li>
            <li> Since I was testing 2 lotions from the same manufacturer and 1 spray, I first applied each lotion to an eye at the same time.</li>
            <li> I am also 53 years old and drive a shuttle bus on a major college campus for 10 hours a day.  </li>
            <li> I use this everywhere, not just face; you could get cheaper stuff, but a tube of this lasts so long that I don&#x27;t really care</li>
            <li> and I am red and my face is burning when I put on my normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It runs down my forehead right into my eyes and burns.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily, I was riding with friends and one of them had plain water with him (not just sports drinks like I did).</li>
            <li> Now My husband uses it as a general sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin and working outside all day does not do my complection any favors</li>
            <li> Confused by the results, I sprayed more and rubbed it into my eyes again with identical reactions.  </li>
            <li> I knocked down one star, because it does burn your eyes for awhile after you first put it on.</li>
            <li> I ran to the kitchen again and dunked my head in the sink, and dried off after the burning subsided in the right eye.</li>
            <li> :  It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes since I started the test, and both eyes feel fine now except for the underlying subtle burn from the spray.  </li>
            <li> When I first applied it I noticed very little fragrance..</li>
            <li> other commenters have said only people with \\&quot;sensitive</li>
            <li> Not greasy and last a long time after applied</li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re interested, I apply it ridiculously thick about 45 minutes before I go out.  </li>
            <li> This actually caused a very subtle stinging in the left eye finally, but made my right eye feel like I had just poured Tabasco in my eye.</li>
            <li> After a 2 minute recovery and towel dry, I went back to try 50, which was the spray.  </li>
            <li> Item 50 was unnoticeable without a sheen immediately, 70 dried basically clear with a subtle whitening or lightening of the skin that persisted and was a bit shiny, and 60 remained visibly very white like clown makeup for a long time, and only really lightened after repeated rubbing every 5 minutes or so for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I thought that is really weird because she was fine with it for about a week.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product and I&#x27;m surprised a company that&#x27;s normally as great as Neutragena would put out something that can cause serious pain with normal use.</li>
            <li> I figured my skin was just dry...</li>
            <li> Dry saten touch.</li>
            <li> the technical side, \\&quot;Helioplex\\&quot; refers to photo-stabilization, which means that it resists breaking down when the sun hits it.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed small white heads/blocked pores on my cheeks where my pores tend to be larger.  </li>
            <li> Not very fragrant  </li>
            <li> Be careful with Sport Face around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my eyes immediately after spraying and kept my eyelids closed.  </li>
            <li> I then got my fingers wet and rubbed my eyes to get the areas around my eyes really wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly expensive, but well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Red hair, green eyes</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a hiker, get a hat with wide rims from Sun Precautions or another company called Sunday Afternoons.</li>
            <li> My eyes were on fire, tearing up like crazy, I could barely see anything, was in real pain, and</li>
            <li> Plenty of protection, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Clearly, 60 is completely painless, 70 could drop an assailant in his tracks, and 50 was only painful briefly until it dried and then left the skin around my eyes feel stiff with a barely noticeable burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, but this product is not good for sports.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount to cover my face and neck, and once it&#x27;s on I don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
            <li> It was not really made for average usage.</li>
            <li> Other brands I have tried tend to attract dirt to the face, creating opportunities for blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I use Banana Boat SPF 30 for other areas, and it runs about $1.25/oz.</li>
            <li> Other sun screens always melt into my eyes and burns like heck.  </li>
            <li> I have used this several times and I haven&#x27;t had the usual burning sensation that I am used to.</li>
            <li> This one happens to be a little heavy for daily use</li>
            <li> I am very careful about what products I put on my face.  </li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; sunscreen anytime I&#x27;ll be active out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Though my skin is dry I don&#x27;t like heavy moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Now this was a bit confusing, but I got a different reaction in each eye from 50.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run when I get sweaty; however, do wait a little bit after applying it and using other products.</li>
            <li> That being said, I noticed a few other reviewers whose eyes have burned.  </li>
            <li> When I reapply at halftime, sometimes it gets a little in my eyes, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m already sweating,</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have breakouts everyday.</li>
            <li> Feel kinda heavy but yet not smelly or oily.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I wasn&#x27;t riding alone or in heavy traffic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a small sample at my Dr.&#x27;s office and have been buying this for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> so I bought her a few as this is sometimes hard to find here in Okinawa, Japan.  </li>
            <li> But their is no better alternative at this price point.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell harsh either!</li>
            <li> That may be why other reviewers did not like it or found it irritating.</li>
            <li> I was starting on a tree when my eyes were stinging like crazy</li>
            <li> For once I don&#x27;t have an awkward hand and face tan outside of my uniform!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s with hormonal acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> When they say it \\&quot;won&#x27;t clog pores\\&quot;, they really mean it.</li>
            <li> A little tough to rub in, but I used it on my beach trip this summer and had no burns or break-outs!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this is considered a sports sunblock when it feels like mace in your eyes!!</li>
            <li> Then it Dawn&#x27;ed on my that it had to be this sunblock that was irritating my skin!  </li>
            <li> How wrong I was!</li>
            <li> But very expensive for this size tube.</li>
            <li> I hate smelling like coconuts or bananas like banana boat or coppertone.  </li>
            <li> After applying it to my daughters face for about a week she started screaming telling me it burned very bad.</li>
            <li> so I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It burned so horribly that it made my eye lids</li>
            <li> and the worst thing about suncreen is it getting into your eyes after swimming.</li>
            <li> Eyes stung terribly.</li>
            <li> I had bad allergic reaction when this got in my eyes and had swollen eyes for 2 days!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wear sunblock on my face daily, through all four seasons.  I just ran out of the Burt&#x27;s Bees face sunblock with royal jelly.  I loved that stuff, but I like trying something different each time.  This time I went to the grocery store, and saw the huge display of sb.  This one in particular stuck out at me for two reasons..1) it has a shiny metallic silver tube...very glitzy. 2)  The SPF said 70+.  I have never seen it that high yet, so I was sold.  Another plus that I should mention is that it is rated sweatproof and waterproof.  I like that, bc it will last me all day.      When I first applied it I noticed very little fragrance..Yay!  I hate smelling like coconuts or bananas like banana boat or coppertone.  It didnt leave me looking whiter than I already am...which I noticed with many of the organic or natural sb.  They just cake on and make you white..not sexy.  So, this one went on smoothly and didnt leave me white.  nice!  I loved it, until...    Now here is where I tell you why I am returning it.  Two days after applying once daily...I noticed my cheeks were red and scaly..ew!  I figured my skin was just dry...so I put on more of my daily moisturizer...didnt help.  Then it Dawn&#x27;ed on my that it had to be this sunblock that was irritating my skin!  Four days of once daily application and I am red and my face is burning when I put on my normal moisturizer.  I am upset over this, bc I was really happy with this product.  I hope this is not a common thing.  I will call the company and find out.  Anyway, I would love to keep this stuff, but I need my cheeks.  ha!  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. Why would you not want to protect your skin everyday(other than for concern over oxybenzone) and why wouldn&#x27;t you want it to be oil-free and sweatproof? Don&#x27;t you want it to stay on if you HAPPEN to go for a run, or to the gym, or until you take a shower, especially if it feels light?    Pros: High SPF(though supposedly the FDA is going to put a stop to any labeling over 30)  Stabilizing formula(Helioplex)  Not very fragrant  Dries fast  Not oily or shiny  Not white    Cons: pricey  oxybenzone</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; sunscreen anytime I&#x27;ll be active out in the sun. It only takes a small amount to cover my face and neck, and once it&#x27;s on I don&#x27;t even feel it. No oil or grease at all. Better prices here (at my time of purchase) than at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Great product - does not run when sweating or in humid area</li>
            <li> I usually find that sport sunscreen is greasy or leaves a burning sensation on my skin, but this one is wonderful! I&#x27;ll go on 20 mile runs in Texas with it on (so obviously very sweaty), and my super fair skin has yet to burn!</li>
            <li> I bought Neutrogena Ultimate Sport Face Sunblock Lotion, SPF 70 for my VERY fair daughter who decided she wanted to play Water Polo this summer.  She burns very easily.  This sunscreen has not only been very effective keeping her from getting sunburned, it seems to be highly water resistent as well.  We also like that it does not clog pores and cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is specifically made for use in water or during sporting activities. It was not really made for average usage. Neutrogena makes other products that are better suited for daily skin protection. That may be why other reviewers did not like it or found it irritating. I found that it offered excellent protection in the water. I am fair skinned and I used it during a vacation in Hawaii. After hours of snorkeling, I was not sunburned. I recommend it highly when swimming.</li>
            <li> I bought this sun block for my 4 year old daughter. She was attacked by a dog a couple of months ago. She had plastic surgery on her face and I was told to put a very high sun block on the area every day or the skin would discolor. I found this stuff and thought \\&quot;oh ya\\&quot;! After applying it to my daughters face for about a week she started screaming telling me it burned very bad. I thought that is really weird because she was fine with it for about a week. She persisted saying it hurt every time I tried to put it on. Well I went out an bought the baby stuff Neutrogena makes in spf 70 and she is fine with that. Only draw back to it is that it turns her face white where it is applied.     That said I as an adult have no problem using it. My son who is 7 has not complain either. I suggest it not be used on children under 5.</li>
            <li> El producto es excelente, lo he usado todo el verano y tenido mejores resultados que con cualquier otro bloqueador que haya usado antes. Lo recomiendo ampliamente para las personas que hacen deporte al aire libre.</li>
            <li> Be careful with Sport Face around your eyes. You&#x27;ll be hating life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the name of science, I just did a lab rat style eye test with 3 new sunscreens to see if they burned. I did it so that I would know which ones would make my eyes burn or sting before trying them on my 7 year old.  I&#x27;ll end with a quick note on visibility of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MATERIAL: I compared Banana Boat Sport Coolzone SPF50+ spray, and Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF60+ lotion, and Neutrogena Sport Face SPF70+ lotion.  For simplicity, I&#x27;ll just refer to them by their SPF rating (50, 60, &amp; 70).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;METHODS: The test was simple. I put Lentil bean size amount on a clean finger (one finger for each sunscreen so they didn&#x27;t mix) and vigorously rubbed them onto my eyelid and the entire area around the eye until I felt a reaction with my eye still closed.  Since I was testing 2 lotions from the same manufacturer and 1 spray, I first applied each lotion to an eye at the same time. Product 60 in left eye and 70 in the right eye. After a good rinse with tap water and towel dry, I sprayed a dime-size amount of the 50 spray to 2 new fingers that had never been in contact with the previous two products, and quickly rubbed them into both closed eyes simultaneously.  The results were quite surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:  Lotions were vastly different. I literally had no reaction to 60, but 70 felt like I had been pepper sprayed.  The more my right eye watered, the more it stung and burned. I stuck with it for a minute to see if 60 would react, but even though my left eye was getting watery out of sympathy for my right eye, I still felt nothing.  I finally couldn&#x27;t stand it and ran to the kitchen sink to rinse my eyes.  After a 2 minute recovery and towel dry, I went back to try 50, which was the spray.  Now this was a bit confusing, but I got a different reaction in each eye from 50.  I applied it to my eyes immediately after spraying and kept my eyelids closed.  Within 3 seconds, myright eye was burning like fire, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything from my left eye.  Confused by the results, I sprayed more and rubbed it into my eyes again with identical reactions.  I then got my fingers wet and rubbed my eyes to get the areas around my eyes really wet. This actually caused a very subtle stinging in the left eye finally, but made my right eye feel like I had just poured Tabasco in my eye. I ran to the kitchen again and dunked my head in the sink, and dried off after the burning subsided in the right eye. The left eye seemed fine.  The final test was direct spray onto the eyelid of each closed eye.  Surprisingly, it stung while the solvent was fresh, but after rubbing my eyes until it was dry, both eyes did not burn or sting at all. However, I did notice that the spray caused the skin around my eyes to very lightly burn continuously, and the skin felt stiff and unnatural whenever I would blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:  It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes since I started the test, and both eyes feel fine now except for the underlying subtle burn from the spray.  Clearly, 60 is completely painless, 70 could drop an assailant in his tracks, and 50 was only painful briefly until it dried and then left the skin around my eyes feel stiff with a barely noticeable burning sensation.  For children under age 12, I&#x27;d stick with 60 (Sensitive Skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPEARANCE:  Very different appearance between the 3 products.  Item 50 was unnoticeable without a sheen immediately, 70 dried basically clear with a subtle whitening or lightening of the skin that persisted and was a bit shiny, and 60 remained visibly very white like clown makeup for a long time, and only really lightened after repeated rubbing every 5 minutes or so for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Would love a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t burn your eyes when you sweat or swim.  This is better than most but still isn&#x27;t as friendly as I would like.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance that I can detect and protects very well.  I got a small sample at my Dr.&#x27;s office and have been buying this for a few years now.  Great for face/head...</li>
            <li> I wore this hiking and ended up sweating it into my eyes. It burned so horribly that it made my eye lids swell-- an effect which lasted several days despite that I wetted a bandana and tried to remove it while on the trail. I do have sensitive skin, but this product is not good for sports.</li>
            <li> I work in Austin, TX for a nonprofit doing environmental restoration. I have naturally oily skin and working outside all day does not do my complection any favors so I decided to invest in a sunblock that is designed for faces. As you can imagine working in the Texas heat all day makes me sweat a lot. The first day I used this product  my group and I were using chainsaws to remove invasive trees form a park. I was starting on a tree when my eyes were stinging like crazy and I had to go wash them out. I posted this on the Neutrogena website but when I hit post they said that all reviews had to be screened and wouldn&#x27;t show up for 2 days. 5 days later it is still not up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead living in Chicago and I play soccer every Sunday and run during week days, and this keeps me pale and sunburn free better than any other product out there. I know their products aren&#x27;t rated well when you look at chemicals used and and all that, but nothing at this price point will protect me better from sunburn on a blazing hot August afternoon.  I reapply at halftime during games, because no matter how sweat proof it claims to be, I wipe my face clean over and over, and that will remove the sunscreen over time.  I also rarely have issues with this burning my eyes, which are very sensitive.  I always apply the first time about 30 minutes before sun exposure, to let it soak in, and that will help keep it from running into your eyes. When I reapply at halftime, sometimes it gets a little in my eyes, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m already sweating, nothing you can do about that!! But their is no better alternative at this price point.  I&#x27;ve also never broken out or had any skin issues that I could relate to using this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out and offers very good skin protection.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t run with anything else</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is the best! It lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t make your skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Contains all three of the most common parabens, which the EU believes linked to cancer.</li>
            <li> I have breakouts everyday. My skin is also super sensitive. I live up at my cottage the whole Summer- and the worst thing about suncreen is it getting into your eyes after swimming. I have used this sunblock for 2 years now and it is the ONLY sunscreen that won&#x27;t sting your eyes, and cause them to burn. When they say it \\&quot;won&#x27;t clog pores\\&quot;, they really mean it. I am very scared about getting sun cancer, and this is the only sunscreen I feel confident in wearing. It&#x27;s not greasy.. and I only apply twice a day. Never got one burn yet!</li>
            <li> very good for running.  i sweat alot and this product worked well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my time at the pool but it burns my sensitive skin upon application. I had better stick to Elta MD sports sunblock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for sunblock I can wear while running/hiking.  This sunblock is great, it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I start sweating, but it does tingle a little. I have also noticed small white heads/blocked pores on my cheeks where my pores tend to be larger.  I&#x27;m still looking for great sunblock, but this is good for now!</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried. Price is not any better than your local walmart but still a great product. Word.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to the sun and I burn very easily. Neutrogena Ultimate Sport Face SPF 70 prevents me from burning and moisturizes my skin without leaving a greasy residue. It&#x27;s fairly expensive, but well worth every penny. Great product!</li>
            <li> Did not work too well for me.&lt;br /&gt;The selling point was it won&#x27;t clog pores, I started to have break out which isn&#x27;t too good.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it just don&#x27;t work for me but it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;It did help prevent sunburn.</li>
            <li> The best in sun protection!</li>
            <li> This is the best sun protection for the face I have encountered.  I am very fair skinned and have a history of blistering form the sun.  This product offers complete sun protection.  In addition, it does not run into one&#x27;s eyes even in the most sweat producing conditions.  This is a real advance in sun protection.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned.  Red hair, green eyes the works.  I burn, freckle and peal.  I am also 53 years old and drive a shuttle bus on a major college campus for 10 hours a day.  I put it on in the morning and I do not get burned at all.  I also works great when we go out on our bike, no burn.  That is wonderful</li>
            <li> Decent product, ok on sensitive skin if not applied several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Protects from sunburn if applied every 1.5-2hours.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t skimp on the amount of sunscreen that is applied, apply like you would if applying lotion for moisture but not necessary to slather it on.</li>
            <li> Most drug store sun block lotions that I have tried for the face are made for people with oily to normal skin. This product is an excellent alternative. It doesn&#x27;t run when I get sweaty; however, do wait a little bit after applying it and using other products. I can&#x27;t say enough about the moisturizing effect it has. Though my skin is dry I don&#x27;t like heavy moisturizers. Between moisturizing at night and using this during the day it prevents my skin from drying. I have used high end products like Kiehl&#x27;s and Shisheido and feel this is a better product. I especially like using it on the decolletage area.</li>
            <li> Disappears very quickly into the skin, not greasy or heavy in any way.  Other brands I have tried tend to attract dirt to the face, creating opportunities for blemishes.  This product does not.  At about $4/oz it is best used to cover smaller face surfaces, though it is hands down the best sunscreen I have ever used.  I use Banana Boat SPF 30 for other areas, and it runs about $1.25/oz.</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on my face and neck for a day at X-Games in Austin. I am very burned. I used my normal (SPF 15) sunscreen on my arms and legs and they are fine. This stuff is going in the garbage as I will never let it touch my skin again.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this so I bought her a few as this is sometimes hard to find here in Okinawa, Japan.  She has converted me to using it (no small feat).  It is not greasy like most sun blocks.  Great product...you will be happy.</li>
            <li> Great price for product! Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this every day for the last 2 months in my army uniform and it feels amazing! Lasts all day through all sorts of strenuous activity. I also use it on my hands. For once I don&#x27;t have an awkward hand and face tan outside of my uniform! Very Gradual!</li>
            <li> NECESSARY I&#x27;M SO GLAD. IT&#x27;S NECESSARY TO CARE SKIN, AND IT HAVE A GOOD TEXTURE  TO PROTECT FROM SUN EVEN!!!</li>
            <li> Eyes stung terribly. Fragrance ok. Feel kinda heavy but yet not smelly or oily. I think it is probably good sunscreen but should not be marketed as sport face if running in eyes causes extreme pain.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. Bought this product at a store near my home. Price was good. My face burned when I applied it. Now My husband uses it as a general sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Seems to be Fragrance free but doesn&#x27;t smell too chemically. Lasts, doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes.  Four stars only because my husband says it plugs his pores. All sunscreens do this for him, except from the Alba Botanical kids 45 SPF .</li>
            <li> Use it to bike for 3 hours in the tropic and never get sunburned.  I sweat a lot and still the product works fine.</li>
            <li> Great product. Plenty of protection, a little goes a long way. I use this everywhere, not just face; you could get cheaper stuff, but a tube of this lasts so long that I don&#x27;t really care that it&#x27;s a bit more expensive; I&#x27;d rather carry one tube than two, and this is the choice. I&#x27;ve been out in strong sun all day without burning. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great! A very nice product! Love it! You can buy it that will not regret! Very good product for sure!</li>
            <li> A little tough to rub in, but I used it on my beach trip this summer and had no burns or break-outs! It&#x27;s nice to find a high SPF, face sunscreen in travel size.</li>
            <li> Great Sport Sunscreen. Not greasy and last a long time after applied</li>
            <li> I assumed (very incorrectly) that a product marked as a \\&quot;sport\\&quot; sunscreen and specifically for the face could be worn on my face while performing an outdoor sport. How wrong I was! I made the mistake of putting this on before a 60 mile bike ride and when I really started sweating on my way up a mountain about halfway into the ride, the sweat got into my eyes and the intense burning began immediately. My eyes were on fire, tearing up like crazy, I could barely see anything, was in real pain, and eventually I had to pull over. Luckily, I was riding with friends and one of them had plain water with him (not just sports drinks like I did). We used up nearly an entire bottle of water trying to wash out my eyes and make the burning stop. Thank goodness I wasn&#x27;t riding alone or in heavy traffic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other commenters have said only people with \\&quot;sensitive eyes\\&quot; have the burning problem. Well, what are we supposed to do? Should someone buy the product first and only then dab some in our eyes like a lab animal to see if we are \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; and if our eyes are about to explode from pain? This is a horrible product and I&#x27;m surprised a company that&#x27;s normally as great as Neutragena would put out something that can cause serious pain with normal use.</li>
            <li> Liked this sunblock until I read about the chemicals and stuff used in this product. Check out EltaMD</li>
            <li> I used this for a week&#x27;s vacation in Hawaii, with two to three hours in the sun every day, both on the beach and hiking. No burn! None at all, just a little light color. I highly recommend, the oil-free formula didn&#x27;t break my skin out at all and it worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my wife she, she likes it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Best price</li>
            <li> My daughter and I walk every day in the sun, wind, rain and soon to be snow. We break a sweat and really need a good sunscreen that sticks with us. We will be reordering more, soon!</li>
            <li> I think neutrogena is the best sunblock ever. I surf and I bought that just for sunny days and now I&#x27;m using daily!</li>
            <li> the only sunscreen I have used that stops my face from burning. I have really sensitive skin and burn through all the others I have used</li>
            <li> For those of us with oily skin, this is the best you can hope for.  Won&#x27;t make your face break out, good coverage.  Best face sunscreen I have used so far, and I&#x27;ve used most of them.</li>
            <li> I jog every day and I always wear sunblock.  I bought this because of the \\&quot;Ultra Waterproof\\&quot; description on the front of the packaging.  It is NOT waterproof at all once I start sweating.  It runs down my forehead right into my eyes and burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Neutrogena products in general so I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Other sun screens always melt into my eyes and burns like heck.  Since this is for sports and is to help eliminate that problem, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It does provide good sun protection and it is the best face sunscreen I have found for the burning eyes issue.  I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t get into the eyes at all, it just takes longer for that to happen.  I think if I wipe my eyes with a dry clean cloth during the day, it will eliminate that from happening at all.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that seems to burn with most sunscreens. I have used this several times and I haven&#x27;t had the usual burning sensation that I am used to. It doesn&#x27;t smell harsh either!</li>
            <li> I vacationed on the beach and was out in the sun for 6 days in a row. I wore a ball cap and put on this sunscreen twice a day and my face did not burn at all. I knocked down one star, because it does burn your eyes for awhile after you first put it on. I have yet to find a face sunscreen that does not burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dermatologist who likes to run sprints as an exercise. I&#x27;ve tested a bunch of sunscreens because so many burn my eyes when I run. My eyes are quite forgiving with this sunscreen. That being said, I noticed a few other reviewers whose eyes have burned.  In my opinion, they are probably just unlucky to be sensitive to this sunscreen. In short, some people will have eyes that burn and some won&#x27;t. This applies for all sunscreens. You&#x27;ve got to find one that you tolerate. The same rationale applies for rashes or acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend different sunscreens for different purposes. This one happens to be a little heavy for daily use but it does the job during exercise as well as any that I&#x27;ve tried. In case you&#x27;re interested, I apply it ridiculously thick about 45 minutes before I go out.  I look like a freak around the house but it gets absorbed by the time I step out the door. I recommend reapplying every two hours. For swimmers, reapply every 30 minutes if possible because \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; laboratory testing is done in a bathtub. It&#x27;s a lot different in the pool or the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the technical side, \\&quot;Helioplex\\&quot; refers to photo-stabilization, which means that it resists breaking down when the sun hits it. Yes, you heard right--many sunscreens break down in sunlight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more word of advice not related to this sunscreen, so I can feel I&#x27;m honoring Hippocrates and his oath:  Even the best sunscreens are not perfect in filtering or blocking ultraviolet light. So try to go out after 4 PM in the summer.  Or, if you prefer, get out there at 6 AM and be back home by 9 AM.  If you&#x27;re a hiker, get a hat with wide rims from Sun Precautions or another company called Sunday Afternoons. They also sell shirts that block ultraviolet light and cool you off. I would post their websites but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow links on these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing--- Like all dermatologists, I get a bunch of sunscreens for free from manufacturers.  But I buy Neutrogena Sport Face with my own money for my workouts on the track.Sport Face with my own money for my workouts on the track.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Use this sun screen every day with or without makeup.  :-)</li>
            <li> Dry saten touch. My wife is very picky about sun cream and she rates this the very best. Recommended for face use, not for all-body use.</li>
            <li> I considered okay because itÂ´s good but not the best for high performance, I mean when you really need protection for long time for cycling as example.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this is considered a sports sunblock when it feels like mace in your eyes!! I had bad allergic reaction when this got in my eyes and had swollen eyes for 2 days!!!</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and love to be out side in the summer. I use this product on my face and with only one or two reups a day I can spend 5-8 hours outside without getting burned or bumping up my freckle count. :)</li>
            <li> Great product, lightweight, non greasy, fast drying. But very expensive for this size tube.</li>
            <li> I get this product with the end cut off.  The end has the expiration date on it.  So, these folks cut the edge off of it deleting/concealing the expiration date on it.  I complain and this is their response:  &amp;#34;I was ready to refund your money until I seen the feedback you left. As I stated I have never and would never alter any item. If you retract your feedback I will gladly refund your money. You could have easily contacted me with your concern and I would have refunded you in a minute.&amp;#34;  I actually hadn&#x27;t posted my review and I contacted these people.  However, you can see that I didn&#x27;t hear from them and that  these folks decided to attack me.  DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS VENDOR.</li>
            <li> I live in a state with a lot of sunshine  and I am a daily runner. This sunblock works great. It does not run into your eyes when you sweat.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite sunscreen; non greasy!!!!! effective, high SPF.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s with hormonal acne prone skin.  I am very careful about what products I put on my face.  I cannot use Neutrogena Ultimate Sport Face.  It will give me cystic acne breakouts every time I use it. I now use Elta MD products.  Their Sport product only has 50 spf but I make sure to wear a hat when I am out and reapply frequently.  I get far fewer breakouts using Elta MD: [[ASIN:B000PHTC20 EltaMD UV Sport SPF 50]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
            <li> Really effective for water sports. First time in a long time I did not get sunburned. Light feeling. Goes on well.</li>
