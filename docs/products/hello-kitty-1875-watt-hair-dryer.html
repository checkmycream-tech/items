            <li>Cute hair dryer !</li>
            <li>Doing better using it now since we taught her not to hold so close to her head!</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it had a cooler setting on it.  </li>
            <li>the settings are nice on it.</li>
            <li>Love this Hair Dryer for Girls&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The dryer seems very durable and the price was great.</li>
            <li>and  I love Hello Kitty.</li>
            <li>It drys your hair in no time and it is so cute.</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it, I do :)</li>
            <li>my daughter and I both use it and we love it.</li>
            <li>I found it everywhere for more money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned, super powerful and adorable.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter uses it every day to fix her beautiful red hair as she is a dye in the wool hello kitty fan.</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>and that made her comfortable using this item.</li>
            <li>In addition it&#x27;s probably the best hair dryer we&#x27;ve owned in recent memory and my wife wants one too now.</li>
            <li>i should have gotten something better or more mature.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>When my granddaughter first used it she said it was broke!  </li>
            <li>Good colors, if you&#x27;re looking for pink.</li>
            <li>far as basic functionality, the dryer works as advertised and is VERY cute.   </li>
            <li>My daughter cries sometimes because it&#x27;s too hot.  </li>
            <li>Very faithful dryer.  </li>
            <li>---found it on Amazon for less money &amp; it arrived quickly!!  </li>
            <li>This is a cute hair dryer and my 2-year old daughter loves it because it&#x27;s pink and has a kitty on it.  </li>
            <li>and when you move it up it goes on high and</li>
            <li>The first time we used it I had to direct the dryer a good 5\\&quot; above her head as she complained it was \\&quot;too hot\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a good buy because the gimmick of a pink hair dryer got her to dry her hair with it when she wouldn&#x27;t let me dry it with my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Arrived very promptly and made a terrific gift for young girl</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4 yr old for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 3 year old (we blowdry her hair after baths).  </li>
            <li>I am 18 years old</li>
            <li>This dryer only has one warmth setting accompanied with a LOW &amp; HIGH setting.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use it for any high end styles - just to get a toddler&#x27;s hair dry before she goes to bed.</li>
            <li>When I seen this hair dryer I thought to myself, well my other hair dryer is about ready to die on me anyway.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately after 6 years it has finally died but i am thrilled it&#x27;s still being sold and I can purchase another one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the only way I can get my 3 year old to dry her hair after the bath.</li>
            <li>it was a pure waste of my money because what&#x27;s the point if i can&#x27;t use it.</li>

            <li> Low quality plastic but it&#x27;s the only way I can get my 3 year old to dry her hair after the bath.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 yr old for Christmas.  It works great and I have teased her about stealing it for myself!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter was getting scared of the hair dryer so we tried this one and she loves.  In addition it&#x27;s probably the best hair dryer we&#x27;ve owned in recent memory and my wife wants one too now.</li>

            <li> Very good dryer.  My second one.  My first one burned out, as all hair dryers usually do, after two years.  Very faithful dryer.  Good colors, if you&#x27;re looking for pink.</li>
            <li> gave them to my granddaughters for Easter  they use only HELLO KITTY hairdryers in college</li>
            <li> Cute hair dryer ! Ladies... you know the routine with hair dryers...how long will it last. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I made this order. after i got it, i found out it wasn&#x27;t working. i plugged it &amp; it refused to come on. it was a pure waste of my money because what&#x27;s the point if i can&#x27;t use it. i should have gotten something better or more mature. Now i regret buying it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned, super powerful and adorable. My daughter got it as a bday gift 6 years ago and my entire family of 4 uses it! Unfortunately after 6 years it has finally died but i am thrilled it&#x27;s still being sold and I can purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Love this Hair Dryer for Girls&lt;br /&gt;Very Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Lightwweight&lt;br /&gt;Smaller for little hands&lt;br /&gt;Great speed and Drys Hair well.&lt;br /&gt;Well Made</li>
            <li> This is a cute hair dryer and my 2-year old daughter loves it because it&#x27;s pink and has a kitty on it.  Would be nice if it had a cooler setting on it.  My daughter cries sometimes because it&#x27;s too hot.  All in all, a good buy because the gimmick of a pink hair dryer got her to dry her hair with it when she wouldn&#x27;t let me dry it with my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for my oldest daughter for Christmas  she loves hello kitty. The dryer seems very durable and the price was great. You don&#x27;t find items like this in the store. It has an on/off which is in the center and when you move it up it goes on high and all the way do is the low setting. There is also a button which shoots cold air if it gets too hot.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this Hello Kitty hair dryer. I am 18 years old and  I love Hello Kitty. I have almost everything Hello Kitty. When I seen this hair dryer I thought to myself, well my other hair dryer is about ready to die on me anyway. So I bought this and I love it so much. It works wonderfully. I don&#x27;t know what the other people are talking about that say its not good. It drys your hair in no time and it is so cute. Love it, Love it, Love it, I do :)</li>
            <li> Works fine, lots of power!!! I would definitely recommend!! Arrived very promptly and made a terrific gift for young girl</li>
            <li> WE perched this item  for our daughter .  It blew up after only using it about five times. We had no way to return it for we did not keep the box it came in. I wanted to write the company but now have no info about who makes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for my daughter to use once a week after swimming. It made quite a bit of noise, but did work.Eventually the noise got louder and the dryer stopped blowing air. Unfortunately, by the time it was broke I was past the Amazon 30 day policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with a pink hair dryer from Target for $14.39. [...]</li>
            <li> This dryer works great! my daughter and I both use it and we love it. the settings are nice on it.</li>
            <li> My niece asked for this specific hair dryer for her daughter for Christmas !  I found it everywhere for more money.&lt;br /&gt;BUT---found it on Amazon for less money &amp; it arrived quickly!!  GREAT HAIR DRYER !!!  Very pleased with the service from Amazon</li>
            <li> My daughter hated having her hair dried, so we bought her her very own hair dryer.  She loves Hello Kitty, so she loves that it&#x27;s got the Hello Kitty stuff all over it and that made her comfortable using this item. It works fine.  We don&#x27;t use it for any high end styles - just to get a toddler&#x27;s hair dry before she goes to bed.</li>
            <li> When my granddaughter first used it she said it was broke!  Doing better using it now since we taught her not to hold so close to her head!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it for Christmas</li>
            <li> My granddaughter uses it every day to fix her beautiful red hair as she is a dye in the wool hello kitty fan. Oh the dryer works perfectly.</li>
