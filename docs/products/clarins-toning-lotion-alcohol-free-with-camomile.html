            <li>Refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the cool feel of this toning lotion.</li>
            <li>Very nice; mild and works on sensitive skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Gentle, cooling, effective.</li>
            <li>I am 83 and my skin looks pretty good, thanks to Clarins.</li>
            <li>I really cannot tell much of a difference, but it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend this cosmetic line as I am of the opinion that the French skincare products are superior.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so fresh and clean after I use this.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite toner.</li>
            <li>For the money and their ability to last a long time, they are some of the best.</li>
            <li>I love this toning lotion and use it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>I slap it on and nothing happens, right?</li>
            <li>Exactly the same packaging and product as I&#x27;d buy on the high street, at a good deal cheaper.</li>
            <li>Pretty scent.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product while working at Bloomingdales in NYC on 59th</li>
            <li>I was searching on line to get the same product for better value that the high street retailer and found it here.</li>
            <li>Always had large pores on nose and chin.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>Does not dry skin and face feels clean after use.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Clarins Gentle Foaming Face Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I found this reasonable price here, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li>After I had used so many different products, I decided to go back to Clarins.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would when a friend handed me a free sample as I purchased some other items, I ended up using it more than I did the other products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have used many different kinds of toners, and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling either oily or dry.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on your skin especially if your skin is sensitive like mine.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy the whole line of Clarins.  </li>
            <li>It reminded me of the old body splash, Jean Nate.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that it does help reduce the old nose pores - ugh.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what difference it makes on my face, but I love it just the same.</li>
            <li>Clairns is the best product ever other than it is costly, but my skin is bad</li>
            <li>The smell is a little perfume-ey for my taste but, having said that, it is mild enough to be tolerable and the scent does not linger on your skin forever</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to completely review</li>
