            <li>Great wax.  </li>

            <li>Great wax.</li>
            <li>A great product, but it takes some practice.</li>
            <li>Used it on my heating wax machine and it fits great.</li>
            <li>and I think its a great wax.</li>
            <li>I was using Gigi Brazilian Bikini Microwave Wax which I had great results with and recommend, but after purchasing the Gigi Wax Heater my friend recommended I try this wax.  </li>
            <li>I had great results using this product on my underarms, aside from my bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Great wax.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>packaging was great, received it within a week of ordering.</li>
            <li>Works great and leaves no irritation.</li>
            <li>I assume that it would be really great</li>
            <li>Works great at just grabbing the hair and not your skin I use baby powder before each use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling for awhile to find a great wax to use myself.  </li>
            <li>, it is just as great at home as in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>With using this wax I&#x27;ve had no issues whatsoever and happy</li>
            <li>(Underarms and &#x27;happy trail.&#x27;)</li>
            <li>Holy smokes, this worked great.  </li>
            <li>Great seller and product,</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m happy with that purchase.</li>
            <li>Great thing is that no tissue scarring from the wax!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for the bikini areas.</li>
            <li>This wax is great, it pulls all the hairs in one try.</li>
            <li>(the gigi stuff that comes with the warmer is good) and you are good to go!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite wax!!</li>
            <li>I love this wax!!</li>
            <li>This works fantastic!!!  </li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Use this with the Gigi warmer, wrap some foil around it because the warmer didn&#x27;t come with the &amp;#34;sleeve.&amp;#34; The wax is great, good consistency.</li>
            <li>I have used many wax and this one is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This wax works remarkably well.  </li>
            <li>The best wax I&#x27;ve ever used :)</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research as to which wax is the best, and this one came out on top, so I bit the bullet and bought it.  </li>
            <li>Over all an awesome wax :)</li>
            <li>This wax is easy to apply,easier to take off and does the best job I&#x27;ve experienced in home waxing.</li>
            <li>The best wax ever - almost painless and very clean results.</li>
            <li>I used it in my Gigi wax warmer and it was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li>I purchased the GIGI warmer and the can fit perfectly in it and heated in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>This was a really good wax.</li>
            <li>Good value, fits the purpose.</li>
            <li>I used to have that issue, because I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Melts nicely, and goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the Gigi warmer and it was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>im so excited because i found the perfect product for my brazilian wax</li>
            <li>otherwise I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the wax is great</li>
            <li>Good  fast services excellent product</li>

            <li>I love this wax!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>OMG I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Much better than using strips!</li>
            <li>and you will love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic in a can compared to anything else!</li>
            <li>I gave myself a brazilian for the first time ever and it turned out great!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s muslin-less!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Painless, easy to use, all around great.</li>
            <li>great, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>(about 1/5-1/4 of an inch, instead of 1/2), it will be much more pleasant, almost no pain at all.</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to useüëç</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>This wax is amazing</li>
            <li>So this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the BEST wax I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>No chipping, breaking, or cracking of the wax, just nice pliable strips of wax when pulling off.</li>
            <li>I will do all my own bikini and underarm waxing with cirepil wax now,.</li>
            <li>But because it is nice on my skin, I sometimes use it on my legs.</li>
            <li>I had to get used to using it because before when I would wax  myself I would use the kind that you needed the strips with.</li>
            <li>Savings lots of money doing my own waxing with this product.</li>
            <li>My wife liked this product.</li>
            <li>The tin fits in the Gigi wax warmer (which takes about 45 mins to warm up, btw).  </li>
            <li>I thought it to be a bit pricey, but if it were as good as people claimed, then that was okay.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the type she was using and liked how it worked for her.  </li>
            <li>Give yourself time for the wax warm up; baby powder the area; use applicators to apply in a judicious manner and let it set for a moment.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to wax your own hooha</li>
            <li>but i like the rose  one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a pro, but I&#x27;ve been waxing my own legs for years.</li>
            <li>I used this in beauty school and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>So I decided to order my own and try it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell nice</li>
            <li>but I had kind of a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t trust myself to do my own Brazilian</li>
            <li>and I want to see how effective it will be in the reduction or retardation of hair growth and ingrowns in conjunction with waxing at home.</li>
            <li>Great wax, used very first time and better than wax used by beautician!  </li>
            <li>There is no question about it, no matter how good the esthetician is or how good you are with self waxing, having top quality wax makes a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>Very good.... easy an clean</li>
            <li>It is super stringy but all in all this is a great product</li>
            <li>Overall, excellent product and vastly superior to the cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li>I think what i love best is that if it gets on the floor its super easy to get off and its not sticky if you get it on your nails or your fingers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to work with and does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li>VERY easy to use..</li>
            <li>Very easy to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best wax by far !</li>
            <li>This is the best wax on the market that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I am still getting used to home hard-waxing but this seems to be the best option so far.</li>
            <li>I had no need to warm it many times.</li>
            <li>best wax ever, I have sensitive skin and this wax doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>This wax is wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you or someone you know has sensitive skin, this is the best wax.</li>
            <li>And this stuff is SO EASY TO USE!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply and manage!</li>
            <li>Good product, but be sure it will fit into your warmer before ordering.  </li>
            <li>perfect, reminds of of kind of wax that is used on me when i go to european wax.</li>
            <li>Took about 35 minutes to warm up and was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>After a long time using Gigi&#x27;s waxes this is the best for Brazilian no pain very easy.</li>
            <li>DIY friendly and best of all NO MESS!!</li>
            <li>Love that I don&#x27;t need anything to pull this wax off.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after waxing.</li>
            <li>I tried it and love it.  </li>
            <li>My one issue is that I can&#x27;t use it on my face, but there aren&#x27;t many that I can.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Definitely on my top list of waxes to use.</li>
            <li>I like this wax better than the honee stripless wax.</li>
            <li>but its better for face, bikini, and underarms.</li>
            <li>LOVE that I invested in this.</li>
            <li>I love this wax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more of a gel-like texture as it hardens, so it doesn&#x27;t become brittle and break apart before you get the chance to rip out the hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have so many more waxes left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ordered a cheap coffee mug warmer to warm it up with and that saved me even more $.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it worked like a magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Love that you don&#x27;t have to use strips with this wax.</li>
            <li>it sticks to the hair even better.  </li>
            <li>Which meant it had a better grip on my hairs and was gentler on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I am still smooth!</li>
            <li>Cirepil is salon grade, top quality wax in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a top quality wax, this is it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply some oil before applying the wax.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about the consistency is that it doesn&#x27;t drip as much</li>
            <li>A bit stringy but definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to do home waxea with ease.</li>
            <li>Very happy I found this, I have very coarse hair</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use the prewax oil.</li>
            <li>This wax makes me feel even more confident in doing it myself.</li>
            <li>I love this wax.</li>
            <li>Just like my favorite wax salon.</li>
            <li>This is the best wax I have used I have experimented with many different brands and types this one is on top.</li>
            <li>I found that it works better if you prep the skin with some toner etc.</li>
            <li>This is the most pliable, constructable wax out there.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not too sure if I will be repurchasing thus again.</li>
            <li>I love this wax.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Wax with cloth strips is better.</li>
            <li>Well it is just okay.  </li>
            <li>It stayed on the spatula better and didn&#x27;t drip on</li>
            <li>Love this wax.</li>
            <li>Love this wax, no need to use strips and does not irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>and I was able to give myself a brazilian in 1/3 of the time it took with the gigi wax.  </li>
            <li>This wax is way better than anything you can buy at Sallys.</li>
            <li>there s a better stripless wax email it to me</li>
            <li>It is my favorite wax.</li>
            <li>It is the best wax to use for coarse hair and makes brazillian waxing a breeze.</li>
            <li>It caused many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I must say this is the most comparable to EWC wax</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found something to be able to continue waxing with.</li>
            <li>Came wrapped in plastic and sealed which I appreciated greatly.</li>
            <li>It broke more hairs than it removed.</li>
            <li>in my warmer, I set it to between low and off for a perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>I have been waxing for a while with the Gigi wax, but thought this might be better.  </li>
            <li>Better than the one I had tried before.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I had to go over the area a couple of more times</li>
            <li>It is interesting because most people say sugaring is painless.</li>
            <li>This wax seems to heat up faster than GiGi&#x27;s brazilian wax, dries faster on your skin so you can pull it off sooner and pulls out more hair than GiGi&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy on your skin and relatively easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Great for bikini area even as a person who hasn&#x27;t waxed much at home was easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Overrall, it saved me on going to the beauty shop to get areas wax and its pretty good wax to use everywhere for me.</li>
            <li>Like it much better than the GiGi wax - doesn&#x27;t break it off as easily.</li>
            <li>The wax sticks to your skin good, so it is best to apply it in  a somewhat thick layer for easy removal.</li>
            <li>Warming up process was pain, it took a long time, and it was mostly melting from the bottom, however wax itself was very good.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my skin which is great considering how sensitive I am.</li>
            <li>I am not a cosmotologist, just a home waxer and this is the most user friendly wax I have used.</li>
            <li>Its doesnt break as easily and does pick up 95% of the hairs.</li>
            <li>Easy to do and saves a ton of $$.</li>
            <li>Easy to heat, apply &amp; use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have been self waxing for over 15 years and love this wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy clean up.</li>
            <li>so it is now microwaveable and the handle on the mug makes it easy to stir and</li>
            <li>easy to use product.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to use and grips the hair well.</li>
            <li>Spreads well, easy to leave &amp;</li>
            <li>This wax applied easily and worked like a champ.</li>
            <li>The ones I have tried have never been as pliable and easy to use as this wax.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>* Spreads easily and gets almost all the hairs!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It is painless and so easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>no strips needed, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to spread and reposition.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the warm wax used with the paper strips which takes a hold of the hairs a LOT better.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this wax because of all of the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, you need to make sure it&#x27;s at the right temperature!  </li>
            <li>The first time you use it you can tell that this is an amazing wax.</li>
            <li>(2) Apply a lightweight oil (I use sweet almond oil) before application of wax but make sure you remove the excess or else</li>
            <li>It spreads smoothly and of course the best part, it comes off in one piece, rather than other waxes that come off in bit and pieces.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep your body cool</li>
            <li>Works fine, I like that there are no strips required.</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs just fine</li>
            <li>but if I do, my skin is fine.</li>
            <li>once I got the hang of it, it was easy and pain free</li>
            <li>Once it cools that much you can hold the skin taut and pull against the hair grain to get a nice easy removal.</li>
            <li>This wax get all the hair and leave your skin smooth, my at home wax comes out just as good as a professional wax</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing for years, so I am well acquainted with the pain it can cause, but the results are always worth it.  </li>
            <li>Smooth warmer</li>
            <li>After about an hour, I was done: hairless, smooth, and in no pain and no sign of tenderness whatsoever.</li>
            <li>(4) Do make sure to apply some type of skin calming and soothing product to the freshly waxed area after you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li>It makes for a smooth rip whenever you pull the wax off.  </li>
            <li>I was told it would fit</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this smooth before.</li>
            <li>After school I started using Satin Smooth because it was a bit easier to get and cheaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really great for coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my wax warmer because the can is 14.11 oz., not 14 oz.  </li>
            <li>The Gigi wax warmer works great when heating up the blue wax.</li>
            <li>very comfortable and easy to use worth buying for sure, the only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t smell that great but who really cares</li>
            <li>I got burned many times until I got it to the right temperature.</li>
            <li>I will say that I used way more than I normally do with strip wax though, but I still like it better.</li>
            <li>Colors is so pretty too üòç not that it matters as much as it been a good wax tho.</li>
            <li>This wax comes very close and is very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>So, when using from the hardened state, it will take a significant amount of item to warm the wax in a wax warmer on high.  </li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job spreading on, removing hair, and very little irritation.</li>
            <li>Determined, I started doing more research and realized purchasing the product I did was my first mistake.</li>
            <li>This is my first review on Amazon, and I only have good things to say about this product!</li>
            <li>Originally we purchased it for money saving.  </li>
            <li>was so excited to try this</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this wax after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you don&#x27;t get it too hot.</li>
            <li>FAST N EASY!</li>
            <li>and it is clean and efficient.</li>
            <li>The most sensitive area in my opinion is the top of your hooha lips</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super gentle on the skin!!!</li>
            <li>Specially for doing it yourself at home.</li>
            <li>This is the best hard wax.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple times to get the right temperature, but once you do it waxes wonderfully with little to no irritation!</li>
            <li>So much more effective and painless (unless hairs are too long) than the strips.</li>
            <li>I first experienced Cirepil wax when getting a brazilian done at a local spa.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long to warm up and the consistency is everything!</li>
            <li>love that it is so thorough yet completely gentle for all parts of the bikini.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool but doesn&#x27;t take off anything</li>
            <li>so I recommend heating it and then allowing it to cool just a bit.  </li>
            <li>Works with a much thinner layer than most.  </li>
            <li>and you only pay once for a good amount of waxing</li>
            <li>Love, have to reorder very soon</li>
            <li>I have used it three times placing a foil sheet underneath the work area helps with a quick clean up.</li>
            <li>It is VERY helpful to trim hair (and surrounding areas) before waxing, so you don&#x27;t accidentally grab too many stray hairs.  </li>
            <li>We are known to have the most gentle wax on the market.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer again, and I will never purchase anything else.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own waxing for awhile with soft wax and muslin strips -</li>
            <li>This is hands down the absolute best wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li>because it is actually pretty easy to do at home</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty easy to use yourself.</li>
            <li>The wax is seriously the BEST there is!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive areas or if you are pain sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you just do it quick it shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>When applying make sure you make a decent size glob at the end of where you will pull from (this will help you get your &#x27;flick&#x27; started &amp; will be easier to pull).</li>
            <li>It worked better than Sally Hansen one, it removed more hair in one try, without need for multiple application.</li>
            <li>If the wax cools too quick the hair breaks at the skin instead of pulling from the root.</li>
            <li>I have found personally it works best if you moisturize the area to be waxed with a tiny bit of baby oil</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a pretty safe and classic beginner wax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great not having to use cloth strips, and it really isn&#x27;t messy at all once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few brands/kinds of waxes before I found this wax and this is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>I did my first full Brazilian and underarms as soon as I got it.</li>
            <li>Rarely do I have to go over an area twice</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of waxing and paid a lot of $$ to have someone at a salon do it, but finally decided I can do this on my own AND save a ton of money over what the salons charge.  </li>
            <li>and it left everything nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that you can remove this blue wax spill by using some baby oil while the wax is still warm.</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy this wax and try it with the GIGI Wax Warmer.</li>
            <li>I heard from a co worker that this wax was so much better than the soft wax.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your pot actually will fit a 14.11oz can.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Brazilian waxes, this one by far is the absolute greatest !</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very stringy, leaves a blue residue, and, most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t cleanly remove hair.  </li>
            <li>other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s a good idea to apply some talcum powder to the area you will be waxing to prevent the wax from sticking to the skin and to prevent any moisture or sweat.</li>
            <li>You can pour them right into the reusable in. http://www.amazon.com/Cirepil-Blue-Refill-28-22-Ounce/dp/B008L0AI3U/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_5</li>
            <li>Hardens right on your skin.</li>
            <li>It pulls right off.</li>
            <li>The price is right too</li>
            <li>but I wasnt applying it the right way.</li>
            <li>For those who are having issues with it make sure that the temperature is cool enough before applying to your skin.</li>
            <li>Great little wax pot!</li>
            <li>You have to apply a very large amount for thickness in order to rip from your skin.  </li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell its a great wax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT a painless process and even as a seasoned self waxer I&#x27;ve frozen up and debated on whether calling my boyfriend for help would be worth the lifetime of ridicule.</li>
            <li>As a professional, this is an awesome hard wax.</li>
            <li>It left me smooth and hair free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy to use and cleans up easy.</li>
            <li>Easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick--not runny like most hard wax is when hot.</li>
            <li>Warning, this wax has a strong smell, so make sure you are waxing in a ventilated area and definitely avoid it if you have a sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li>Now I can do my own its painful but with Those stuff its a million times better then strip and cloth method for sure!</li>
            <li>This hard wax is great.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time, I apply patches of wax in different areas  </li>
            <li>I thought that it was a bit too hot at the higher setting at first</li>
            <li>This wax is so much better than traditional wax.</li>
            <li>This wax paid for itself with the first use.</li>
            <li>It pays  by itself with first use.</li>
            <li>First time waxing in my life.</li>
            <li>Hairs embed into wax and come up all on the first try.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be recommending this to my fellow Estheticians and purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li>I used to always use strip wax, but someone told me that the blue wax is better at preventing ingrown hairs, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that this blue wax pulls hair way better than the wax i used before this (sally hansen stripless)...</li>
            <li>This stuff also gets majority of the hair the first time</li>
            <li>I love Cirepil Blue wax!</li>
            <li>did exactly as advertized</li>
            <li>I tested the hot wax on my wrist and ripped it off with no pain.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research as per which wax to buy as this was my first time waxing at home by myself.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of this wax, i waxed my armpits, and my husbands back with this.</li>
            <li>I do not have a wax warmer, so I warmed it up on the stove, inside the pot with hot water in it.</li>
            <li>I had my first brizilian done about 2 years ago and just watched how she did it and copied her.</li>
            <li>I have been getting waxed for the last 10 years and I have to say that I will be saving lots of money :-)</li>
            <li>I used this wax for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>so if this is your first time don&#x27;t be ashamed to leave a landing strip.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li>It being too hot is what is going to cause your strips to break.</li>
            <li>It cools consistently so it comes off in one glorious piece.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was the fasted</li>
            <li>It was completely pain free.</li>
            <li>So I am interested to see how my ingrowns will be reduced.</li>
            <li>This makes is stick better yet after cooled enough</li>
            <li>This wax doesn&#x27;t need to be as hot and so is much more comfortable and leaves less redness after.  </li>
            <li>Set your warmer on super low, as this stuff is much easier to apply if it isn&#x27;t super runny, it takes a while to cool if it is too hot and it can be a pain getting it to stay on the stick.</li>
            <li>Best wax I&#x27;ve used so far, especially compared to other kinds of waxes.</li>
            <li>I ordered more large wooden sticks.</li>
            <li>Instantly and quickly removed so clean up</li>
            <li>It picked up ALL the hair it touched, dried super fast, and had a good consistency (not too brittle, not too soft).</li>
            <li>I notice I have fewer ingrown hair problems with this wax than the hot strip wax (that is much cheaper).</li>
            <li>My first time waxing I was honestly an absolute slob with the wax, dripped it on my shirt and had wax &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; all over the sink.</li>
            <li>I wanted to test out other waxes to see if the wax we use at work is really one of a kind.</li>
            <li>long time waxers will love the consistancy and texture.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean up, but I do my own...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s completely strip-less and had other good reviews</li>
            <li>No  more, this wax to me is just as good.</li>
            <li>This wax is far superior to other brands.  </li>
            <li>Less of a mess, no pulling skin, perfect for Brazilian bikini waxing.</li>
            <li>Make sure the skin isn&#x27;t dry or damaged.</li>
            <li>And to speed up the warming process I transferred the melted wax into a large glass mug</li>
            <li>I do not recommend it for large areas.</li>
            <li>This one works very well, easy to remove and comes off in one solid piece unlike the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Press the wax gently towards the skin when applying then hold the skin tight to pull it off, it takes a little practice but the results are flawless!</li>
            <li>My skin is fine, my redness only lasts like 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34; clean and easy hard wax acai berry&amp;#34; good smell, EXTREMELY stringy, decent hair removal.</li>
            <li>After being told that this was the best hard wax to use, I found it to be a let down to be quite honest, very poor for intimate waxing, at the end found a cheaper wax provider off ebay  with better pricing and easier to work with!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work on fine hair and you have to use double the amount.</li>
            <li>The best part of this wax is how it comes off similar to a hard wax, without ever completely hardening.  </li>
            <li>This is HIGH QUALITY WAX!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>really needs to spread the wax evenly n thickly..and even after that the strip was breakign apart of me when i tried to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also feel like it hurtless because it picked up the hairs and not so much my skin.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>This makes the cleanup so much easier.</li>
            <li>Beads would be much easier to deal with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this a 5 star rating although it really deserves a 4.5 (but that&#x27;s not an option)</li>
            <li>The first heating of the wax took about 30 minutes which was normal.</li>
            <li>WOW - worth every penny of difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this wax.</li>
            <li>ithe whole can in a wax warmer like GiGi</li>
            <li>and it really hurted but</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hurt much.</li>
            <li>Either take  wooden spatula and smooth on, leave spatula on arm til the wax hardens up some then rip.</li>
            <li>Had to really get used to not using wax strips</li>
            <li>So much easier, cheaper, and convenient.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M A VERY PICKY PERSON...</li>
            <li>Give yourself plenty of time to get it ready before you are planning on waxing.  </li>
            <li>This is the real trick.  </li>
            <li>Frustrating, because the wax is a great product.</li>
            <li>This formula is very forgiving.</li>
            <li>I was blown away at how gentle the wax was on my skin.</li>
            <li>This cold wax is awesome!</li>
            <li>But it works really well.</li>
            <li>so that didn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>but you get over it because it works really really well</li>
            <li>I really like this wax because I don&#x27;t have to use strips.</li>
            <li>Works very well too.</li>
            <li>this stuff is very gooey...</li>
            <li>but the product does remove hair very well</li>
            <li>My own personal CON to this wax: my skin was very red for over an hour after waxing.</li>
            <li>comes off quick and easy and creates LESS discomfort.</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s NOT messy like some of the honey waxes are... bonus!!!</li>
            <li>, just WOW!, the shipping was pretty fast as well üòãüòä</li>
            <li>Smell was not the best but tolerable, decent hair removal, awkward cream color.</li>
            <li>Way better than the other products on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waxing 2 other family members with it. :-)  </li>
            <li>My expectations were a bit high since this is a bit pricier than other hard waxes and PR is supposed to be the best.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, dries hard and removes easily.  </li>
            <li>absolutely use again and can highly recommend to anyone to give it a try.</li>
            <li>thanks to this wax, waxing is much easier and painless then before, it&#x27;s almost like walking into the European wax center but in your house at your own time</li>
            <li>I used the GIGI Wax Warmer (Model: 0225) on high the whole time.</li>
            <li>I just use an old pot and pour about a half a cup of water on it and let the warm water heat up the wax.</li>
            <li>closest wax to European wax center&#x27;s that I have been able to find!</li>
            <li>Usually, it takes me forever to do my own Brazilian wax</li>
            <li>Before purchasing Cirepil Blue, I did SO much research in SOO many different waxes, I am so thankful for all the reviews for this wax</li>
            <li>I do full Brazilians, my legs, armpits, upper lip and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>She was going to order her old style (hot wax)</li>
            <li>* Heats up quickly and goes on warm and not hot unlike other waxes.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I can easily use this on my whole body and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like other wax I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My go to place to wax is at the European wax center EWC because of the amazing wax</li>
            <li>Though there are still some leftover hairs, it&#x27;s so much better than what I was using before, which are the wax strips from your typical drugstore.</li>
            <li>That said, its less painless wax for sure.</li>
            <li>Has a slight waxy/plastic scent but nothing so overwhelming it grosses me out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the blue one as it helps when waxing eyebrows to get an exact location of the wax and no scary surprises once it&#x27;s ripped.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Cirepil Blue Wax now that I&#x27;ve finally figured out how to use it!</li>
            <li>Make sure to loofah loofah loofah starting the next day</li>
            <li>easy to use hard wax, clean removal, no pain, absolutely worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  this wax.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this wax.</li>
            <li>Cirepil was great, but I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I&#x27;d be interested in seeing how other brands compare to this particular hard wax.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wax to everyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rated highly here on Amazon for a reason.</li>
            <li>and it took all the fine hair with minimal pain.</li>
            <li>AAAAND, my favorite part, doesn&#x27;t leave a million little pieces of wax stuck afterwards</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick as easily to your skin as other waxes...</li>
            <li>What I liked is that it is a bit thicker than the Gigi hard wax I already had.  </li>
            <li>It comes with its own plastic lid in the chance that your hard wax warmer doesn&#x27;t have a cover.</li>
            <li>Being my first hard wax I guess its okay.</li>
            <li>and I do have sensitive skin but never had this much redness before.</li>
            <li>and I save so much money not getting it professionally done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to buy the bag of beads and a empty can to fit in the warmer.</li>
            <li>If you can deal with the pain the normal non-hard wax is easier to use and quicker.</li>
            <li>Normally a can of the honey wax lasts me like 3 leg waxes.</li>
            <li>It will not remove all the hair at first if you have thick hair, but after a few waxing sessions it really does a great job at removing the resulting finer hairs.</li>
            <li>I just waxed at home for the first time yesterday and this blue wax made the process much easier than I thought.</li>
            <li>This is worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>Make sure if you buy this you use thivk layers, it hurts less and is not messy.</li>
            <li>I can definitely live with it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing again, and would recommend to any one looking for a good hard wax.</li>
            <li>all the hairs off my body because it&#x27;s so easy to use and causes less pain.  </li>
            <li>The wax does a much better job than GiGi and is comparable to European Wax Center.</li>
            <li>I love this wax, I noticed when you put it on if you press harder with the wooden stick</li>
            <li>The sink wax wiped off with toilet paper and wax peeled right off my shirt with no staining.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many of the prior reviews; good and bad.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still hot enough to attach to the hair.</li>
            <li>You want to make sure that when melting the wax that you have a soft ball in the center -- it shouldn&#x27;t be completely fluid.</li>
            <li>I have found that toner worked better than talc or other things prior to waxing.</li>
            <li>This wax is the only wax I trust in my studio for intimate areas!</li>
            <li>Not only was it hot it pulled all the hair out and that hurts...</li>
            <li>I had a proper professional wax warmer, and as I am not ready to invest additional $90 for the equipment I should not be complaining :)</li>
            <li>It is low temp and if it is too hot when you use it, you will need to layer it in order to pull it clean.&lt;br /&gt;Top:&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li>The blue wax pulled out my hairs on the first try when I applied it correctly...</li>
            <li>It starts to harden pretty quickly but doesn&#x27;t get too stiff if you leave it on for a while, which is convenient if you like to work with 2-3+ strips at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, takes a little practice.  </li>
            <li>So, after watching several how-to DIY Brazilian videos on YouTube, I mustered up the courage and went to my local beauty supply store and purchased a very popular, off-the-shelf brand of microwaveable hard wax and set to work after popping two Advil and psyching myself up.</li>
            <li>so maybe just &amp;#34;an old dog getting use to new tricks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I read all the rave reviews about this wax and despite the higher price, decided to go for it due to all the positive hype.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not too messy.</li>
            <li>Previously I used Gigi hard wax and their warmer and it worked great</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bluish stain it leaves on the skin, but still, it doesn&#x27;t make me love it less.</li>
            <li>I used 1/3 of the pot for a half leg waxing, but next time I&#x27;ll definitely be more efficient with time and quantity of wax used.</li>
            <li>The Satin Smooth especially would always break apart mid rip causing extra pain to make a new grip.  </li>
            <li>There is a sting, but it did not leave large red marks all over me.</li>
            <li>This wax is soft and if you apply it the correct way there is no mess!</li>
            <li>The wax warmer collars were a little snug going on but just be patient because they will definitely keep your warmer safe from spills.  </li>
            <li>I love this Hard Wax.</li>
            <li>Slightly more pliable than GiGi hard wax when hardened.  </li>
            <li>Worked better than GiGi hard wax at removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this hard wax.</li>
            <li>if you apply a thin layer it will stick real good to the skin and it will be hard to get an edge up to remove it.</li>
            <li>I was so ready to keep waxing because I felt like such a professional...</li>
            <li>Because of the cost of a professional wax, I wanted to do this at home.</li>
            <li>But it does grasp the hairs, remove the hairs, and I recommend it to anyone who does not have sensitive</li>
            <li>You do your eyebrows regularly, it can&#x27;t be that much worse.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>This gentle ocean blue wax never hurt me.</li>
            <li>NOT messy at alllll...</li>
            <li>it took me about 15mins to complete my under arms.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, and this wax does not cause any sort of reactions for me.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish someone mentioned is that it is very &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; when you put the applicator in and remove it.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smoother than we were getting from a professional hair removal.  </li>
            <li>product is definitely far better/effective  than sally hansen ouch relief wax kit and GiGi All Purpose Honee wax.</li>
            <li>I have had about 15 professional bikini and or Brazilian waxes.</li>
            <li>It seems to grip better and doesn&#x27;t leave behind as much sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>I made my first tin last for three uses (just underarms and bikini, I use an epilator for legs), but think I can get my next tin to last longer by following my own advice and turning the temp down.</li>
            <li>It heats fast and no mess with this tin, just put cap back on and store...</li>
            <li>and we used half of this can, also it took a while because i needed to wait for the wax to cool before pulling.</li>
            <li>My best advice is to trim the hair down short and do small areas, working your way in and down.</li>
            <li>I have visited professional waxing places that use a wax extremely similar to this, if not this exact same wax.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to wait to long to cool the wax off, although the wax cools down much much faster than the GiGi wax.  </li>
            <li>Similar to european wax center&#x27;s wax, it removed hair rather easily even in tougher areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now going on my third week since my first time with the Cirepil Blue</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s safe to say that Cirepil Blue is here to stay, and shaving is a thing of the past in my life.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that the price were a little friendlier on my wallet, but using it to just wax my armpits like I do is way cheaper than having them done professionally, which would cost more than the entire tin itself for just one waxing session.</li>
            <li>It clings to the hair amazingly which cuts down any extra owey pulling like I&#x27;ve found with other waxes.</li>
            <li>and it is so much less messy than the strip kind.</li>
            <li>I personally found that it is far less effective than just about every other type/brand of wax I&#x27;ve used and has almost twice the price tag?!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>It really does dry in seconds.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t redden my skin or stay hot long and at the lower temperature it just wouldn&#x27;t get my courser facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I was able to go over multiple times with no issue, I even got the hairs inside my labia without injuring the delicate skin.</li>
            <li>The can is a little snug in my warmer, but other than that, fantastic!</li>
            <li>I will never buy another wax unless it is proven that it&#x27;s better than Cirepil Blue Wax, which I seriously doubt.  </li>
            <li>It makes waxing so quick and simple, and gives me one less thing to stress out about in my otherwise hectic life.</li>
            <li>And last but not least the classic &amp;#34;GIGI Brazilian Body Hard Wax&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll give this one a 4 because it was the first wax I used</li>
            <li>On a better note very delicate on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Another wax I have tried is &amp;#34;Satin Smooth Calendula Gold Hard Wax&amp;#34; also a 3 star wax.</li>
            <li>sister has sensitive skin and even on low temperature it burns her.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t ever switch back to my old wax.</li>
            <li>it does such a professional job.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it seemed a bit red after use but that went away after a while!</li>
            <li>(yes I always use powder) and it was completely easier to do larger strips as well.</li>
            <li>This is the only wax I use for stubborn or sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>/underarms at home now and only go there for legs and brazillian because of my busy sceldule.</li>
            <li>I followed all professional steps including proper pull away guidelines.</li>
            <li>Is not harsh on skin, I have sensitive skin n while they were red after waxing it went the redness went away soon enough, however do apply baby oil before waxing it helps.</li>
            <li>Not too stringy and dries fast but not fast to where you have to rush.</li>
            <li>Also, pick up the wax on your applicator from the center NOT from the sides where it&#x27;s too hot and too fluid.  </li>
            <li>After having my first Brazilian done at European Wax Center I decided to start hard-waxing my armpits also.</li>
            <li>but I tend to use much more of it and it leaves a lot behind on the skin.</li>
            <li>Minus one point because it goes very quickly and it&#x27;s still kind of difficult to remove all of the little pieces of excess wax, even with oil.</li>
            <li>I found out about Cirepil when I went to go write a less enthusiastic of a cheaper hard wax.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED!!</li>
            <li>but I used so much less wax only applying over each spot once that it made it worth it.</li>
            <li>but I used so much less wax only applying over each spot once that it made it worth it.</li>
            <li>No strips, no mess, just some wax applicators, a wax warmer, Cirepil Blue lotion and oil, some cotton pads</li>
            <li>I, like many of you other ladies, have experimented with Hardwax in the past.</li>
            <li>I took the risk and bought this wax, I just purchased my second one and it really did last a long time considering now</li>
            <li>I am pretty old to the waxing game (I wax myself and my VERY close friends).</li>
            <li>I have been using Gigi&#x27;s for about 1 year now at home and go to a professional for the areas that are a bit more difficult.  </li>
            <li>This is a hard wax so let cool enough to get your pull started.</li>
            <li>I had my first Brazilian professionally done at least 6 years ago and vowed I would never to do it again.  </li>
            <li>Only had trouble the first time using it...</li>
            <li>Has a tiny bit of tack when hard, so can use the back of a strip to clean up any that does get left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not retain much heat so once u blow on it, it cools down enough to not burn the skin</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been waxing for a few years and completely dislike strips because you need to be decently quick and the strips tend to stay sticky and can lead to a mess.  </li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of wax and it leaves a few coarse hairs behind and it doesn&#x27;t grab fine hair too well.</li>
            <li>I was paying so much money every single month to go to the European Wax Center.</li>
            <li>It grips the hair a little better than the Brazilian hard wax, but I don&#x27;t think I would want to put up with the smell after that.</li>
            <li>I find after wiping away the excess that I apply a little talc-free baby powder really helps.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look like a plucked chicken for the first time!!!!</li>
            <li>Really helps cut down on post wax irritation and sensitivity!  </li>
            <li>It goes on MUCH smoother and since it&#x27;s a lot thicker, I didn&#x27;t make half the mess I normally do.</li>

            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Use this with the Gigi warmer, wrap some foil around it because the warmer didn&#x27;t come with the &amp;#34;sleeve.&amp;#34; The wax is great, good consistency.</li>
            <li> I have used many wax and this one is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This wax works remarkably well.  </li>
            <li> The best wax I&#x27;ve ever used :)</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research as to which wax is the best, and this one came out on top, so I bit the bullet and bought it.  </li>
            <li> Over all an awesome wax :)</li>
            <li> This wax is easy to apply,easier to take off and does the best job I&#x27;ve experienced in home waxing.</li>
            <li> The best wax ever - almost painless and very clean results.</li>
            <li> I used it in my Gigi wax warmer and it was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li> I purchased the GIGI warmer and the can fit perfectly in it and heated in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This was a really good wax.</li>
            <li> Good value, fits the purpose.</li>
            <li> I used to have that issue, because I have fair skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Melts nicely, and goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Gigi warmer and it was a perfect fit.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Much better than using strips!</li>
            <li> and you will love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic in a can compared to anything else!</li>
            <li> I gave myself a brazilian for the first time ever and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s muslin-less!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Painless, easy to use, all around great.</li>
            <li> great, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> (about 1/5-1/4 of an inch, instead of 1/2), it will be much more pleasant, almost no pain at all.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to useüëç</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing</li>
            <li> So this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST wax I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> No chipping, breaking, or cracking of the wax, just nice pliable strips of wax when pulling off.</li>
            <li> I will do all my own bikini and underarm waxing with cirepil wax now,.</li>
            <li> But because it is nice on my skin, I sometimes use it on my legs.</li>
            <li> I had to get used to using it because before when I would wax  myself I would use the kind that you needed the strips with.</li>
            <li> Savings lots of money doing my own waxing with this product.</li>
            <li> My wife liked this product.</li>
            <li> The tin fits in the Gigi wax warmer (which takes about 45 mins to warm up, btw).  </li>
            <li> I thought it to be a bit pricey, but if it were as good as people claimed, then that was okay.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the type she was using and liked how it worked for her.  </li>
            <li> Give yourself time for the wax warm up; baby powder the area; use applicators to apply in a judicious manner and let it set for a moment.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to wax your own hooha</li>
            <li> but i like the rose  one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pro, but I&#x27;ve been waxing my own legs for years.</li>
            <li> I used this in beauty school and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> So I decided to order my own and try it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell nice</li>
            <li> but I had kind of a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust myself to do my own Brazilian</li>
            <li> and I want to see how effective it will be in the reduction or retardation of hair growth and ingrowns in conjunction with waxing at home.</li>
            <li> Great wax, used very first time and better than wax used by beautician!  </li>
            <li> There is no question about it, no matter how good the esthetician is or how good you are with self waxing, having top quality wax makes a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> Very good.... easy an clean</li>
            <li> It is super stringy but all in all this is a great product</li>
            <li> Overall, excellent product and vastly superior to the cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> I think what i love best is that if it gets on the floor its super easy to get off and its not sticky if you get it on your nails or your fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to work with and does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li> VERY easy to use..</li>
            <li> Very easy to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best wax by far !</li>
            <li> This is the best wax on the market that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I am still getting used to home hard-waxing but this seems to be the best option so far.</li>
            <li> I had no need to warm it many times.</li>
            <li> best wax ever, I have sensitive skin and this wax doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> This wax is wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you or someone you know has sensitive skin, this is the best wax.</li>
            <li> And this stuff is SO EASY TO USE!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply and manage!</li>
            <li> Good product, but be sure it will fit into your warmer before ordering.  </li>
            <li> perfect, reminds of of kind of wax that is used on me when i go to european wax.</li>
            <li> Took about 35 minutes to warm up and was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> After a long time using Gigi&#x27;s waxes this is the best for Brazilian no pain very easy.</li>
            <li> DIY friendly and best of all NO MESS!!</li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t need anything to pull this wax off.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after waxing.</li>
            <li> I tried it and love it.  </li>
            <li> My one issue is that I can&#x27;t use it on my face, but there aren&#x27;t many that I can.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Definitely on my top list of waxes to use.</li>
            <li> I like this wax better than the honee stripless wax.</li>
            <li> but its better for face, bikini, and underarms.</li>
            <li> LOVE that I invested in this.</li>
            <li> I love this wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more of a gel-like texture as it hardens, so it doesn&#x27;t become brittle and break apart before you get the chance to rip out the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have so many more waxes left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ordered a cheap coffee mug warmer to warm it up with and that saved me even more $.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it worked like a magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Love that you don&#x27;t have to use strips with this wax.</li>
            <li> it sticks to the hair even better.  </li>
            <li> Which meant it had a better grip on my hairs and was gentler on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I am still smooth!</li>
            <li> Cirepil is salon grade, top quality wax in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a top quality wax, this is it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply some oil before applying the wax.</li>
            <li> Another great thing about the consistency is that it doesn&#x27;t drip as much</li>
            <li> A bit stringy but definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to do home waxea with ease.</li>
            <li> Very happy I found this, I have very coarse hair</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use the prewax oil.</li>
            <li> This wax makes me feel even more confident in doing it myself.</li>
            <li> I love this wax.</li>
            <li> Just like my favorite wax salon.</li>
            <li> This is the best wax I have used I have experimented with many different brands and types this one is on top.</li>
            <li> I found that it works better if you prep the skin with some toner etc.</li>
            <li> This is the most pliable, constructable wax out there.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not too sure if I will be repurchasing thus again.</li>
            <li> I love this wax.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Wax with cloth strips is better.</li>
            <li> Well it is just okay.  </li>
            <li> It stayed on the spatula better and didn&#x27;t drip on</li>
            <li> Love this wax.</li>
            <li> Love this wax, no need to use strips and does not irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> and I was able to give myself a brazilian in 1/3 of the time it took with the gigi wax.  </li>
            <li> This wax is way better than anything you can buy at Sallys.</li>
            <li> there s a better stripless wax email it to me</li>
            <li> It is my favorite wax.</li>
            <li> It is the best wax to use for coarse hair and makes brazillian waxing a breeze.</li>
            <li> It caused many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I must say this is the most comparable to EWC wax</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found something to be able to continue waxing with.</li>
            <li> Came wrapped in plastic and sealed which I appreciated greatly.</li>
            <li> It broke more hairs than it removed.</li>
            <li> in my warmer, I set it to between low and off for a perfect consistency.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for a while with the Gigi wax, but thought this might be better.  </li>
            <li> Better than the one I had tried before.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the area a couple of more times</li>
            <li> It is interesting because most people say sugaring is painless.</li>
            <li> This wax seems to heat up faster than GiGi&#x27;s brazilian wax, dries faster on your skin so you can pull it off sooner and pulls out more hair than GiGi&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy on your skin and relatively easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Great for bikini area even as a person who hasn&#x27;t waxed much at home was easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Overrall, it saved me on going to the beauty shop to get areas wax and its pretty good wax to use everywhere for me.</li>
            <li> Like it much better than the GiGi wax - doesn&#x27;t break it off as easily.</li>
            <li> The wax sticks to your skin good, so it is best to apply it in  a somewhat thick layer for easy removal.</li>
            <li> Warming up process was pain, it took a long time, and it was mostly melting from the bottom, however wax itself was very good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my skin which is great considering how sensitive I am.</li>
            <li> I am not a cosmotologist, just a home waxer and this is the most user friendly wax I have used.</li>
            <li> Its doesnt break as easily and does pick up 95% of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Easy to do and saves a ton of $$.</li>
            <li> Easy to heat, apply &amp; use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have been self waxing for over 15 years and love this wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy clean up.</li>
            <li> so it is now microwaveable and the handle on the mug makes it easy to stir and</li>
            <li> easy to use product.  </li>
            <li> It is really easy to use and grips the hair well.</li>
            <li> Spreads well, easy to leave &amp;</li>
            <li> This wax applied easily and worked like a champ.</li>
            <li> The ones I have tried have never been as pliable and easy to use as this wax.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> * Spreads easily and gets almost all the hairs!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It is painless and so easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> no strips needed, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to spread and reposition.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the warm wax used with the paper strips which takes a hold of the hairs a LOT better.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this wax because of all of the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, you need to make sure it&#x27;s at the right temperature!  </li>
            <li> The first time you use it you can tell that this is an amazing wax.</li>
            <li> (2) Apply a lightweight oil (I use sweet almond oil) before application of wax but make sure you remove the excess or else</li>
            <li> It spreads smoothly and of course the best part, it comes off in one piece, rather than other waxes that come off in bit and pieces.</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep your body cool</li>
            <li> Works fine, I like that there are no strips required.</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs just fine</li>
            <li> but if I do, my skin is fine.</li>
            <li> once I got the hang of it, it was easy and pain free</li>
            <li> Once it cools that much you can hold the skin taut and pull against the hair grain to get a nice easy removal.</li>
            <li> This wax get all the hair and leave your skin smooth, my at home wax comes out just as good as a professional wax</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for years, so I am well acquainted with the pain it can cause, but the results are always worth it.  </li>
            <li> Smooth warmer</li>
            <li> After about an hour, I was done: hairless, smooth, and in no pain and no sign of tenderness whatsoever.</li>
            <li> (4) Do make sure to apply some type of skin calming and soothing product to the freshly waxed area after you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> It makes for a smooth rip whenever you pull the wax off.  </li>
            <li> I was told it would fit</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this smooth before.</li>
            <li> After school I started using Satin Smooth because it was a bit easier to get and cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my wax warmer because the can is 14.11 oz., not 14 oz.  </li>
            <li> The Gigi wax warmer works great when heating up the blue wax.</li>
            <li> very comfortable and easy to use worth buying for sure, the only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t smell that great but who really cares</li>
            <li> I got burned many times until I got it to the right temperature.</li>
            <li> I will say that I used way more than I normally do with strip wax though, but I still like it better.</li>
            <li> Colors is so pretty too üòç not that it matters as much as it been a good wax tho.</li>
            <li> This wax comes very close and is very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> So, when using from the hardened state, it will take a significant amount of item to warm the wax in a wax warmer on high.  </li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job spreading on, removing hair, and very little irritation.</li>
            <li> Determined, I started doing more research and realized purchasing the product I did was my first mistake.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon, and I only have good things to say about this product!</li>
            <li> Originally we purchased it for money saving.  </li>
            <li> was so excited to try this</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this wax after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Just be sure you don&#x27;t get it too hot.</li>
            <li> FAST N EASY!</li>
            <li> and it is clean and efficient.</li>
            <li> The most sensitive area in my opinion is the top of your hooha lips</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s super gentle on the skin!!!</li>
            <li> Specially for doing it yourself at home.</li>
            <li> This is the best hard wax.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple times to get the right temperature, but once you do it waxes wonderfully with little to no irritation!</li>
            <li> So much more effective and painless (unless hairs are too long) than the strips.</li>
            <li> I first experienced Cirepil wax when getting a brazilian done at a local spa.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to warm up and the consistency is everything!</li>
            <li> love that it is so thorough yet completely gentle for all parts of the bikini.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool but doesn&#x27;t take off anything</li>
            <li> so I recommend heating it and then allowing it to cool just a bit.  </li>
            <li> Works with a much thinner layer than most.  </li>
            <li> and you only pay once for a good amount of waxing</li>
            <li> Love, have to reorder very soon</li>
            <li> I have used it three times placing a foil sheet underneath the work area helps with a quick clean up.</li>
            <li> It is VERY helpful to trim hair (and surrounding areas) before waxing, so you don&#x27;t accidentally grab too many stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> We are known to have the most gentle wax on the market.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer again, and I will never purchase anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own waxing for awhile with soft wax and muslin strips -</li>
            <li> This is hands down the absolute best wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li> because it is actually pretty easy to do at home</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty easy to use yourself.</li>
            <li> The wax is seriously the BEST there is!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive areas or if you are pain sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you just do it quick it shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> When applying make sure you make a decent size glob at the end of where you will pull from (this will help you get your &#x27;flick&#x27; started &amp; will be easier to pull).</li>
            <li> It worked better than Sally Hansen one, it removed more hair in one try, without need for multiple application.</li>
            <li> If the wax cools too quick the hair breaks at the skin instead of pulling from the root.</li>
            <li> I have found personally it works best if you moisturize the area to be waxed with a tiny bit of baby oil</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a pretty safe and classic beginner wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great not having to use cloth strips, and it really isn&#x27;t messy at all once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few brands/kinds of waxes before I found this wax and this is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> I did my first full Brazilian and underarms as soon as I got it.</li>
            <li> Rarely do I have to go over an area twice</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of waxing and paid a lot of $$ to have someone at a salon do it, but finally decided I can do this on my own AND save a ton of money over what the salons charge.  </li>
            <li> and it left everything nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that you can remove this blue wax spill by using some baby oil while the wax is still warm.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy this wax and try it with the GIGI Wax Warmer.</li>
            <li> I heard from a co worker that this wax was so much better than the soft wax.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your pot actually will fit a 14.11oz can.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Brazilian waxes, this one by far is the absolute greatest !</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very stringy, leaves a blue residue, and, most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t cleanly remove hair.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s a good idea to apply some talcum powder to the area you will be waxing to prevent the wax from sticking to the skin and to prevent any moisture or sweat.</li>
            <li> You can pour them right into the reusable in. http://www.amazon.com/Cirepil-Blue-Refill-28-22-Ounce/dp/B008L0AI3U/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_5</li>
            <li> Hardens right on your skin.</li>
            <li> It pulls right off.</li>
            <li> The price is right too</li>
            <li> but I wasnt applying it the right way.</li>
            <li> For those who are having issues with it make sure that the temperature is cool enough before applying to your skin.</li>
            <li> Great little wax pot!</li>
            <li> You have to apply a very large amount for thickness in order to rip from your skin.  </li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell its a great wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT a painless process and even as a seasoned self waxer I&#x27;ve frozen up and debated on whether calling my boyfriend for help would be worth the lifetime of ridicule.</li>
            <li> As a professional, this is an awesome hard wax.</li>
            <li> It left me smooth and hair free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy to use and cleans up easy.</li>
            <li> Easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is nice and thick--not runny like most hard wax is when hot.</li>
            <li> Warning, this wax has a strong smell, so make sure you are waxing in a ventilated area and definitely avoid it if you have a sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li> Now I can do my own its painful but with Those stuff its a million times better then strip and cloth method for sure!</li>
            <li> This hard wax is great.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time, I apply patches of wax in different areas  </li>
            <li> I thought that it was a bit too hot at the higher setting at first</li>
            <li> This wax is so much better than traditional wax.</li>
            <li> This wax paid for itself with the first use.</li>
            <li> It pays  by itself with first use.</li>
            <li> First time waxing in my life.</li>
            <li> Hairs embed into wax and come up all on the first try.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I will definitely be recommending this to my fellow Estheticians and purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> I used to always use strip wax, but someone told me that the blue wax is better at preventing ingrown hairs, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that this blue wax pulls hair way better than the wax i used before this (sally hansen stripless)...</li>
            <li> This stuff also gets majority of the hair the first time</li>
            <li> I love Cirepil Blue wax!</li>
            <li> did exactly as advertized</li>
            <li> I tested the hot wax on my wrist and ripped it off with no pain.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research as per which wax to buy as this was my first time waxing at home by myself.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of this wax, i waxed my armpits, and my husbands back with this.</li>
            <li> I do not have a wax warmer, so I warmed it up on the stove, inside the pot with hot water in it.</li>
            <li> I had my first brizilian done about 2 years ago and just watched how she did it and copied her.</li>
            <li> I have been getting waxed for the last 10 years and I have to say that I will be saving lots of money :-)</li>
            <li> I used this wax for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> so if this is your first time don&#x27;t be ashamed to leave a landing strip.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li> It being too hot is what is going to cause your strips to break.</li>
            <li> It cools consistently so it comes off in one glorious piece.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was the fasted</li>
            <li> It was completely pain free.</li>
            <li> So I am interested to see how my ingrowns will be reduced.</li>
            <li> This makes is stick better yet after cooled enough</li>
            <li> This wax doesn&#x27;t need to be as hot and so is much more comfortable and leaves less redness after.  </li>
            <li> Set your warmer on super low, as this stuff is much easier to apply if it isn&#x27;t super runny, it takes a while to cool if it is too hot and it can be a pain getting it to stay on the stick.</li>
            <li> Best wax I&#x27;ve used so far, especially compared to other kinds of waxes.</li>
            <li> I ordered more large wooden sticks.</li>
            <li> Instantly and quickly removed so clean up</li>
            <li> It picked up ALL the hair it touched, dried super fast, and had a good consistency (not too brittle, not too soft).</li>
            <li> I notice I have fewer ingrown hair problems with this wax than the hot strip wax (that is much cheaper).</li>
            <li> My first time waxing I was honestly an absolute slob with the wax, dripped it on my shirt and had wax &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; all over the sink.</li>
            <li> I wanted to test out other waxes to see if the wax we use at work is really one of a kind.</li>
            <li> long time waxers will love the consistancy and texture.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean up, but I do my own...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s completely strip-less and had other good reviews</li>
            <li> No  more, this wax to me is just as good.</li>
            <li> This wax is far superior to other brands.  </li>
            <li> Less of a mess, no pulling skin, perfect for Brazilian bikini waxing.</li>
            <li> Make sure the skin isn&#x27;t dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> And to speed up the warming process I transferred the melted wax into a large glass mug</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it for large areas.</li>
            <li> This one works very well, easy to remove and comes off in one solid piece unlike the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Press the wax gently towards the skin when applying then hold the skin tight to pull it off, it takes a little practice but the results are flawless!</li>
            <li> My skin is fine, my redness only lasts like 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34; clean and easy hard wax acai berry&amp;#34; good smell, EXTREMELY stringy, decent hair removal.</li>
            <li> After being told that this was the best hard wax to use, I found it to be a let down to be quite honest, very poor for intimate waxing, at the end found a cheaper wax provider off ebay  with better pricing and easier to work with!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work on fine hair and you have to use double the amount.</li>
            <li> The best part of this wax is how it comes off similar to a hard wax, without ever completely hardening.  </li>
            <li> This is HIGH QUALITY WAX!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> really needs to spread the wax evenly n thickly..and even after that the strip was breakign apart of me when i tried to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also feel like it hurtless because it picked up the hairs and not so much my skin.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> This makes the cleanup so much easier.</li>
            <li> Beads would be much easier to deal with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 5 star rating although it really deserves a 4.5 (but that&#x27;s not an option)</li>
            <li> The first heating of the wax took about 30 minutes which was normal.</li>
            <li> WOW - worth every penny of difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this wax.</li>
            <li> ithe whole can in a wax warmer like GiGi</li>
            <li> and it really hurted but</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt much.</li>
            <li> Either take  wooden spatula and smooth on, leave spatula on arm til the wax hardens up some then rip.</li>
            <li> Had to really get used to not using wax strips</li>
            <li> So much easier, cheaper, and convenient.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M A VERY PICKY PERSON...</li>
            <li> Give yourself plenty of time to get it ready before you are planning on waxing.  </li>
            <li> This is the real trick.  </li>
            <li> Frustrating, because the wax is a great product.</li>
            <li> This formula is very forgiving.</li>
            <li> I was blown away at how gentle the wax was on my skin.</li>
            <li> This cold wax is awesome!</li>
            <li> But it works really well.</li>
            <li> so that didn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> but you get over it because it works really really well</li>
            <li> I really like this wax because I don&#x27;t have to use strips.</li>
            <li> Works very well too.</li>
            <li> this stuff is very gooey...</li>
            <li> but the product does remove hair very well</li>
            <li> My own personal CON to this wax: my skin was very red for over an hour after waxing.</li>
            <li> comes off quick and easy and creates LESS discomfort.</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s NOT messy like some of the honey waxes are... bonus!!!</li>
            <li> , just WOW!, the shipping was pretty fast as well üòãüòä</li>
            <li> Smell was not the best but tolerable, decent hair removal, awkward cream color.</li>
            <li> Way better than the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waxing 2 other family members with it. :-)  </li>
            <li> My expectations were a bit high since this is a bit pricier than other hard waxes and PR is supposed to be the best.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, dries hard and removes easily.  </li>
            <li> absolutely use again and can highly recommend to anyone to give it a try.</li>
            <li> thanks to this wax, waxing is much easier and painless then before, it&#x27;s almost like walking into the European wax center but in your house at your own time</li>
            <li> I used the GIGI Wax Warmer (Model: 0225) on high the whole time.</li>
            <li> I just use an old pot and pour about a half a cup of water on it and let the warm water heat up the wax.</li>
            <li> closest wax to European wax center&#x27;s that I have been able to find!</li>
            <li> Usually, it takes me forever to do my own Brazilian wax</li>
            <li> Before purchasing Cirepil Blue, I did SO much research in SOO many different waxes, I am so thankful for all the reviews for this wax</li>
            <li> I do full Brazilians, my legs, armpits, upper lip and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> She was going to order her old style (hot wax)</li>
            <li> * Heats up quickly and goes on warm and not hot unlike other waxes.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I can easily use this on my whole body and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like other wax I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My go to place to wax is at the European wax center EWC because of the amazing wax</li>
            <li> Though there are still some leftover hairs, it&#x27;s so much better than what I was using before, which are the wax strips from your typical drugstore.</li>
            <li> That said, its less painless wax for sure.</li>
            <li> Has a slight waxy/plastic scent but nothing so overwhelming it grosses me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the blue one as it helps when waxing eyebrows to get an exact location of the wax and no scary surprises once it&#x27;s ripped.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Cirepil Blue Wax now that I&#x27;ve finally figured out how to use it!</li>
            <li> Make sure to loofah loofah loofah starting the next day</li>
            <li> easy to use hard wax, clean removal, no pain, absolutely worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  this wax.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this wax.</li>
            <li> Cirepil was great, but I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I&#x27;d be interested in seeing how other brands compare to this particular hard wax.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wax to everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rated highly here on Amazon for a reason.</li>
            <li> and it took all the fine hair with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> AAAAND, my favorite part, doesn&#x27;t leave a million little pieces of wax stuck afterwards</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick as easily to your skin as other waxes...</li>
            <li> What I liked is that it is a bit thicker than the Gigi hard wax I already had.  </li>
            <li> It comes with its own plastic lid in the chance that your hard wax warmer doesn&#x27;t have a cover.</li>
            <li> Being my first hard wax I guess its okay.</li>
            <li> and I do have sensitive skin but never had this much redness before.</li>
            <li> and I save so much money not getting it professionally done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to buy the bag of beads and a empty can to fit in the warmer.</li>
            <li> If you can deal with the pain the normal non-hard wax is easier to use and quicker.</li>
            <li> Normally a can of the honey wax lasts me like 3 leg waxes.</li>
            <li> It will not remove all the hair at first if you have thick hair, but after a few waxing sessions it really does a great job at removing the resulting finer hairs.</li>
            <li> I just waxed at home for the first time yesterday and this blue wax made the process much easier than I thought.</li>
            <li> This is worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> Make sure if you buy this you use thivk layers, it hurts less and is not messy.</li>
            <li> I can definitely live with it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing again, and would recommend to any one looking for a good hard wax.</li>
            <li> all the hairs off my body because it&#x27;s so easy to use and causes less pain.  </li>
            <li> The wax does a much better job than GiGi and is comparable to European Wax Center.</li>
            <li> I love this wax, I noticed when you put it on if you press harder with the wooden stick</li>
            <li> The sink wax wiped off with toilet paper and wax peeled right off my shirt with no staining.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many of the prior reviews; good and bad.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still hot enough to attach to the hair.</li>
            <li> You want to make sure that when melting the wax that you have a soft ball in the center -- it shouldn&#x27;t be completely fluid.</li>
            <li> I have found that toner worked better than talc or other things prior to waxing.</li>
            <li> This wax is the only wax I trust in my studio for intimate areas!</li>
            <li> Not only was it hot it pulled all the hair out and that hurts...</li>
            <li> I had a proper professional wax warmer, and as I am not ready to invest additional $90 for the equipment I should not be complaining :)</li>
            <li> It is low temp and if it is too hot when you use it, you will need to layer it in order to pull it clean.&lt;br /&gt;Top:&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li> The blue wax pulled out my hairs on the first try when I applied it correctly...</li>
            <li> It starts to harden pretty quickly but doesn&#x27;t get too stiff if you leave it on for a while, which is convenient if you like to work with 2-3+ strips at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, takes a little practice.  </li>
            <li> So, after watching several how-to DIY Brazilian videos on YouTube, I mustered up the courage and went to my local beauty supply store and purchased a very popular, off-the-shelf brand of microwaveable hard wax and set to work after popping two Advil and psyching myself up.</li>
            <li> so maybe just &amp;#34;an old dog getting use to new tricks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I read all the rave reviews about this wax and despite the higher price, decided to go for it due to all the positive hype.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and not too messy.</li>
            <li> Previously I used Gigi hard wax and their warmer and it worked great</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bluish stain it leaves on the skin, but still, it doesn&#x27;t make me love it less.</li>
            <li> I used 1/3 of the pot for a half leg waxing, but next time I&#x27;ll definitely be more efficient with time and quantity of wax used.</li>
            <li> The Satin Smooth especially would always break apart mid rip causing extra pain to make a new grip.  </li>
            <li> There is a sting, but it did not leave large red marks all over me.</li>
            <li> This wax is soft and if you apply it the correct way there is no mess!</li>
            <li> The wax warmer collars were a little snug going on but just be patient because they will definitely keep your warmer safe from spills.  </li>
            <li> I love this Hard Wax.</li>
            <li> Slightly more pliable than GiGi hard wax when hardened.  </li>
            <li> Worked better than GiGi hard wax at removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this hard wax.</li>
            <li> if you apply a thin layer it will stick real good to the skin and it will be hard to get an edge up to remove it.</li>
            <li> I was so ready to keep waxing because I felt like such a professional...</li>
            <li> Because of the cost of a professional wax, I wanted to do this at home.</li>
            <li> But it does grasp the hairs, remove the hairs, and I recommend it to anyone who does not have sensitive</li>
            <li> You do your eyebrows regularly, it can&#x27;t be that much worse.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> This gentle ocean blue wax never hurt me.</li>
            <li> NOT messy at alllll...</li>
            <li> it took me about 15mins to complete my under arms.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and this wax does not cause any sort of reactions for me.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish someone mentioned is that it is very &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; when you put the applicator in and remove it.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smoother than we were getting from a professional hair removal.  </li>
            <li> product is definitely far better/effective  than sally hansen ouch relief wax kit and GiGi All Purpose Honee wax.</li>
            <li> I have had about 15 professional bikini and or Brazilian waxes.</li>
            <li> It seems to grip better and doesn&#x27;t leave behind as much sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> I made my first tin last for three uses (just underarms and bikini, I use an epilator for legs), but think I can get my next tin to last longer by following my own advice and turning the temp down.</li>
            <li> It heats fast and no mess with this tin, just put cap back on and store...</li>
            <li> and we used half of this can, also it took a while because i needed to wait for the wax to cool before pulling.</li>
            <li> My best advice is to trim the hair down short and do small areas, working your way in and down.</li>
            <li> I have visited professional waxing places that use a wax extremely similar to this, if not this exact same wax.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wait to long to cool the wax off, although the wax cools down much much faster than the GiGi wax.  </li>
            <li> Similar to european wax center&#x27;s wax, it removed hair rather easily even in tougher areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am now going on my third week since my first time with the Cirepil Blue</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s safe to say that Cirepil Blue is here to stay, and shaving is a thing of the past in my life.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the price were a little friendlier on my wallet, but using it to just wax my armpits like I do is way cheaper than having them done professionally, which would cost more than the entire tin itself for just one waxing session.</li>
            <li> It clings to the hair amazingly which cuts down any extra owey pulling like I&#x27;ve found with other waxes.</li>
            <li> and it is so much less messy than the strip kind.</li>
            <li> I personally found that it is far less effective than just about every other type/brand of wax I&#x27;ve used and has almost twice the price tag?!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> It really does dry in seconds.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t redden my skin or stay hot long and at the lower temperature it just wouldn&#x27;t get my courser facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I was able to go over multiple times with no issue, I even got the hairs inside my labia without injuring the delicate skin.</li>
            <li> The can is a little snug in my warmer, but other than that, fantastic!</li>
            <li> I will never buy another wax unless it is proven that it&#x27;s better than Cirepil Blue Wax, which I seriously doubt.  </li>
            <li> It makes waxing so quick and simple, and gives me one less thing to stress out about in my otherwise hectic life.</li>
            <li> And last but not least the classic &amp;#34;GIGI Brazilian Body Hard Wax&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll give this one a 4 because it was the first wax I used</li>
            <li> On a better note very delicate on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Another wax I have tried is &amp;#34;Satin Smooth Calendula Gold Hard Wax&amp;#34; also a 3 star wax.</li>
            <li> sister has sensitive skin and even on low temperature it burns her.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever switch back to my old wax.</li>
            <li> it does such a professional job.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it seemed a bit red after use but that went away after a while!</li>
            <li> (yes I always use powder) and it was completely easier to do larger strips as well.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax I use for stubborn or sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> /underarms at home now and only go there for legs and brazillian because of my busy sceldule.</li>
            <li> I followed all professional steps including proper pull away guidelines.</li>
            <li> Is not harsh on skin, I have sensitive skin n while they were red after waxing it went the redness went away soon enough, however do apply baby oil before waxing it helps.</li>
            <li> Not too stringy and dries fast but not fast to where you have to rush.</li>
            <li> Also, pick up the wax on your applicator from the center NOT from the sides where it&#x27;s too hot and too fluid.  </li>
            <li> After having my first Brazilian done at European Wax Center I decided to start hard-waxing my armpits also.</li>
            <li> but I tend to use much more of it and it leaves a lot behind on the skin.</li>
            <li> Minus one point because it goes very quickly and it&#x27;s still kind of difficult to remove all of the little pieces of excess wax, even with oil.</li>
            <li> I found out about Cirepil when I went to go write a less enthusiastic of a cheaper hard wax.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED!!</li>
            <li> but I used so much less wax only applying over each spot once that it made it worth it.</li>
            <li> but I used so much less wax only applying over each spot once that it made it worth it.</li>
            <li> No strips, no mess, just some wax applicators, a wax warmer, Cirepil Blue lotion and oil, some cotton pads</li>
            <li> I, like many of you other ladies, have experimented with Hardwax in the past.</li>
            <li> I took the risk and bought this wax, I just purchased my second one and it really did last a long time considering now</li>
            <li> I am pretty old to the waxing game (I wax myself and my VERY close friends).</li>
            <li> I have been using Gigi&#x27;s for about 1 year now at home and go to a professional for the areas that are a bit more difficult.  </li>
            <li> This is a hard wax so let cool enough to get your pull started.</li>
            <li> I had my first Brazilian professionally done at least 6 years ago and vowed I would never to do it again.  </li>
            <li> Only had trouble the first time using it...</li>
            <li> Has a tiny bit of tack when hard, so can use the back of a strip to clean up any that does get left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not retain much heat so once u blow on it, it cools down enough to not burn the skin</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been waxing for a few years and completely dislike strips because you need to be decently quick and the strips tend to stay sticky and can lead to a mess.  </li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of wax and it leaves a few coarse hairs behind and it doesn&#x27;t grab fine hair too well.</li>
            <li> I was paying so much money every single month to go to the European Wax Center.</li>
            <li> It grips the hair a little better than the Brazilian hard wax, but I don&#x27;t think I would want to put up with the smell after that.</li>
            <li> I find after wiping away the excess that I apply a little talc-free baby powder really helps.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look like a plucked chicken for the first time!!!!</li>
            <li> Really helps cut down on post wax irritation and sensitivity!  </li>
            <li> It goes on MUCH smoother and since it&#x27;s a lot thicker, I didn&#x27;t make half the mess I normally do.</li>
            <li> I also bought the GiGi wax warmer and the wooden applicator sticks, and yes, it took me a while to wax my legs, and in the beginning I obviously started slow, but the results were only positive!</li>
            <li> Maybe because I have a lot of coarse dense hair with deep folicles, I am not sure, but sugaring was very traumatic for me physically and emotionally.</li>
            <li> After waxing my skin was not bright red, irritated or broken out, in fact it was calm and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on skin, but is hard to use properly.</li>
            <li> and I did notice that you do have to put this on a little thicker than normal...</li>
            <li> I use the Gigi wax warmer, put it on the setting between Low and Medium for about 15 minutes then bring it between Medium and High, a little bit closer to the High side and poke the center of floating wax down.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different kinds of hard wax like GiGi and Satin Smooth</li>
            <li> (((hair must be long enough as recommended 6mm I believe?, apply a lot and spread it downwards)))</li>
            <li> I purchased this wax for its low heat temperature that would be gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;in conjunction with this I would lightly apply baby powder or olive oil and each and everytime, the first strip of wax is always pulls out nothing, yet extremely painful!!</li>
            <li> I then came across a very thorough video of a self-Brazilian wax and noted in the comments that the creator was using a blue hard wax that looked like a shimmery jelly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to use on larger areas of the body (like legs) because you can really only apply smallish globs of wax before it hardens.</li>
            <li> it was on my toilet, in the tub and of course my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove wax that is left behind with a cotton ball and a little oil.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a certain thickness for hard wax to work at</li>
            <li> I ordered this blue wax when half of my hair had grown back from my last sugar wax, and it was PAINLESS!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After purchasing the GIGI Brazilian Body Hard wax, I was very discouraged that I wasn&#x27;t doing the procedure correctly.</li>
            <li> negative is it did not cool as quickly</li>
            <li> People here said this blue wax was easier and more effective than hard wax and was less painful than hard wax....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this wax, a wax warmer,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t careful for the blue dye though.</li>
            <li> I researched to see if I could find something close to what the European Wax Center used</li>
            <li> It works great, only reason it is 4 and not 5 stars is because it leaves some blue residue behind that is very difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and for repeated uses.</li>
            <li> I used to go to European Wax center</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and waxer for European Wax Center.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional jobs that were a waste because of breakage.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this wax and not the less expensive competitors.</li>
            <li> It always seemed to leave some stranded hairs behind and took a while to dry (not to mention it would break easily if it over dried).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other waxes and it doesn&#x27;t cause the same level of irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing myself for a very long time</li>
            <li> It is harsher on my skin leaving it dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve used countless other brands (warm &amp; hard) and have never had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> This is much easier to remove from hard surfaces than other waxes, but if you get it in carpet or bath mats they are done for.</li>
            <li> Not new to waxing, but new to hard wax.</li>
            <li> Its gentle for face and other delicate areas.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to work with when really hot</li>
            <li> It took just a little wax for two people and this tin will last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I can wax my entire body vs Gigi where I need a can and a half.</li>
            <li> I was immediately prepared to have a repeat of previous self disaster with tiny screams, bleeding, and sore, tender parts but</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the wax they use at European Wax Centers, if not it is very similar.  </li>
            <li> It should be slightly tacky but not enough to stick to your fingers in strings.  </li>
            <li> I do not have coarse hair on my face and it got about 1/3 of targeted area, and even less than that</li>
            <li> I only did half of 1 leg before giving up.</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves my skin less red afterwards...</li>
            <li> I did make a mess and had blue stuff EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li> For those saying it leaves a blueness, it doesn&#x27;t when you apply it properly at a certain thickness and apply it as a single mass strip, if you accidentally spread it too thin and you get little wax drops don&#x27;t just scrape it off, get a bit of wax and put it over the drops then pull it off and you won&#x27;t have any blue on you.</li>
            <li> The pain seemed to go from a 10 (being the most painful) to a mere 3/4 (mild sting and then gone).</li>
            <li> It does not leave skin blue, and comes off with minimal pain!(Having previous experience in handling wax, of course) I have used Gigi hard and soft wax for years</li>
            <li> I put a little talc on a cotton ball and swab the area before waxing for maximum removal because this wax is a little sensitive to there being a layer of oil on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use the Gigi&#x27;s wax warmer and this container fits however the gigi&#x27;s collars do not fit without cutting them which is easy enough to do.  </li>
            <li> It took me a little bit to learn how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> Wax actually shrinks to grab even the little hairs.</li>
            <li> A little research and a purchase later</li>
            <li> Got this after getting hard wax at a professional wax center.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They say you should have a lump in the center</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed on a poor review was that &amp;#34;you have to apply so much in order to rip it off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So because I have tried a few different waxes</li>
            <li> So because I have tried a few different waxes</li>
            <li> This is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Never really worked before</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your time with a different brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and was in search of a few different waxes.</li>
            <li> and I must say that this is closed to their formula.</li>
            <li> So I decided to spend the few extra bucks and get Cirepil again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy, stringy, turns your fingernails blue.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> I recommend going to European wax center a few times before trying at home...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require annoying strips which is so nice.</li>
            <li> In the meantime I went it and bought a professional wax heater -- no more microwaveable anything for me again!  </li>
            <li> , I have grown to prefer hard wax, and after using this wax, I feel like I should have done my research a long time ago before waisting so much money on Gigi hard wax.</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;ll need to buy it often since a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard wax is not for everyone, waxing yourself in general is not for everyone</li>
            <li> Far less messier as well, usually my bathroom looks a mess for days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other waxes, but this one is the one I kept seeing the pros use.  </li>
            <li> , I use the other brand for my face, but use this for everything else.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I did not find this wax smelled AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> (Made the mistake of not using powder in the past and I&#x27;ve definitely suffered for it!)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break like other waxes.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!</li>
            <li> You do not have to worry about using only a thin amount at a time, you can&#x27;t really go too thick with this stuff... unless you are doing it like frosting a cake.  </li>
            <li> I never get those results with any other wax.</li>
            <li> I usually have waxing done at European Wax and was looking for something close to the wax they use.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews re:</li>
            <li> Grips the hair and is easier to apply than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Similar to other reviews I read, it can get a little messy or &amp;#34;stringy,&amp;#34; but</li>
            <li> There are very few if any hairs left after removal,which is a problem I have always had with Gigi.  </li>
            <li> but the blue wax didn&#x27;t leave a mess at all and very little residue wax was left anywhere so no more using tons of wax off.</li>
            <li> Minimal mess, easily removed, less painful than any other wax I have tried.</li>
            <li> blue hard wax:4-5</li>
            <li> I only try two hard waxes</li>
            <li> At first it was a little difficult to use.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell.....</li>
            <li> The laser actually really works, I was skeptical</li>
            <li> This one is gooey enough that it goes on thick</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t leave the wax on too long as you sit on your aluminum foil feeling sorry for yourself, trust me the wax gets brittle and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> with that first wax piece laid down and then subsequently pulled off, I was so shocked.</li>
            <li> Also, put a cloth down when waxing to protect your floors.</li>
            <li> time was cut down.  </li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve read reviews of other people/other wax brands where they have to scrape the wax off their skin afterwards - not the case here!).  </li>
            <li> I would never use any other wax!</li>
            <li> If you do, take an old piece of the hard wax and press the shiny side down onto the wax pieces left behind, press down firmly and then with a pull it off.</li>
            <li> Clean and less painful.</li>
            <li> (This is where the half of a star deduction comes from)</li>
            <li> I also had previously used Gigi microwaveable bikini wax, which tended to break for me.</li>
            <li> I also used way less wax waxing everything south of the belly button that no would using the Gigi waxes.</li>
            <li> Just one thing I notice: if you trim the hair slightly to make it shorter</li>
            <li> so that you have less skin pulling</li>
            <li> I went through about a quarter can for half legs.</li>
            <li> Must use baby powder at a minimum prior to application of the wax or you will be trying to strip wax that has adhered to the skin too much and it becomes painful.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s significantly less mess.</li>
            <li> It takes practice but it does its job with less of a mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write out reviews, but if I didn&#x27;t for this item then I would feel selfish.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be cutting my costs at going to the European Wax Center.</li>
            <li> you have to pull the was off with your fingers which makes a mess..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s waxing it&#x27;s going to be super painful.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a lot less messy than the strip wax.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive way to get your waxing done with little cost, if you can tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li> If you touch it and the wax is a little tacky wait another little bit.  </li>
            <li> Have to do a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> (wipe off any excess or the wax won&#x27;t stick), then also rub on a little baby powder before applying the wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hard waxes with no success.  </li>
            <li> Its a little messy.</li>
            <li> I am a very thick haired Italian and this removed my hair with 1 application.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star is because little pieces of the wax stay behind and I have to scrub them off</li>
            <li> Although I did have to go over my underarms a few times to get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does not fit...</li>
            <li> (3) I didn&#x27;t have any issues with any wax residue being left behind on my lady parts but did when I waxed my underarms.</li>
            <li> made me feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It smells like a harsh chemical.</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of a learning curve and can be messy but removes hair well but doesn&#x27;t damage the skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not fit the warmers.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time on this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just wasted $22.00 on a can of wax</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge problem, I&#x27;m going to use it up</li>
            <li> Drips less too!</li>
            <li> Assuming you use it correctly, you won&#x27;t burn yourself, which is a risk you take with other hard waxes.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Gigi &amp;#34;all purpose hard wax&amp;#34;, and the difference I see between them is that this one is easier to spread and doesn&#x27;t crack like the other one.</li>
            <li> The problem I&#x27;ve had with other hard waxes is temp control.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken down yet but a few tears of self pity were shed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the edges lift up easier and the whole strips come off intact, it nets out to being much less painful than conventional hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Just like European wax, but less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair down below</li>
            <li> Not very effective.  </li>
            <li> At least a half hour, maybe longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;hard wax&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t get as hard as some other hard waxes I have used.</li>
            <li> Not good for legs or other areas</li>
            <li> That being said those that posted those that posted this stuff makes a mess are a little crazy with the proper technique I had no issues</li>
            <li> This wax blows all other hair removal waxes away!!!</li>
            <li> The hard wax dried down to a pliable rubber consistency that didn&#x27;t turn brittle and into a questionable plastic-like mess from the previous retail brand I tried.</li>
            <li> It goes on gently removes all the hair, does not burn scar or smell bad.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t last 10 minutes before I called it quits and cut the remaining &amp;#34;hard wax&amp;#34; out of my hair and lady parts, jumped in the shower and shaved the rest because I wasn&#x27;t fond of the random bald patches</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a small room.</li>
            <li> nothing out of the ordinary.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the wax works.</li>
            <li> I was never able to find out &amp;#34;how hot&amp;#34; to put my warmer at-- even after scouring the internet--</li>
            <li> this is very hard wax to use as it is extremely sticky and does not pull off well.</li>
            <li> I also find it much less painful than sugaring that was performed by a professional waxer.</li>
            <li> It is very messy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very messy.</li>
            <li> Just a real mess.</li>
            <li> I have had about 2 cycles for a total of 3 years of professional laser hair removal and it did work to reduce and retard hair growth for a year or so.</li>
            <li> But it stays dark blue, which makes it impossible to see the hair through it or on the wax once removed.</li>
            <li> Not crumbly when hardened, so there is way less leave behind.  </li>
            <li> If you have never used hard wax, it could be a bit difficult; however, as long as you watch videos online on how to use hard wax, it will help a ton and save you a lot of pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot less painful than traditional wax and cloth.</li>
            <li> This is a hard wax</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gigi Hard Brazilian wax for years</li>
            <li> I would rate Gigi hard wax a 4.</li>
            <li> hard wax:7-8</li>
            <li> BUT that is a known quality of hard wax NOT this wax.</li>
            <li> Yes hard wax used a lot in order to remove</li>
            <li> Yes hard wax used a lot in order to remove</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert at waxing, but this hard wax is easier to use than the wax with strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hard wax for a while</li>
            <li> that are hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way easier and cleaner to use than the Gigi hard wax.</li>
            <li> Looked for some hard waxes for senstive areas and this was the reccommended one.</li>
            <li> but it can at time be hard to pull.</li>
            <li> Having a hard time getting use to this product.  </li>
            <li> and I was researching hard waxes</li>
            <li> I prefer hard wax to sugar or strips.</li>
            <li> It is what is known in the business as a hard wax and requires some additional skill in the application and removal process.</li>
            <li> There were no appreciable differences between this and cheaper hard waxes during use, except the smell -</li>
            <li> hard to come off.</li>
            <li> * delicate areas before waxing there.  </li>
            <li> Spreads on thick with no flaking or brittleness while you are pulling the wax off....</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this wax, mainly because I have had bad experiences with waxes irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> sticks even with powder... left blue color on skin :{  will be throwing it away and won&#x27;t be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> so I was trying to heat it up on high, resulting in a thin, sticky mess that hardens and chips off when you try to remove it, resulting in some really painful removal and pain-in-the-butt application!</li>
            <li> so if you can&#x27;t handle the subtle wax smell...</li>
            <li> seriously a lifesaver</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m mad how long I&#x27;ve been wasting my time and money on it.</li>
            <li> A few other waxes I have tried are either useless or crazy sticky and stringy.  </li>
            <li> Ive had some pretty terrible experiences in NYC getting waxed.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is very hard to get rid of the residual.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a small amount behind that is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Of all the waxes I have used, this one hurts the least (I was actually shocked by how little it hurt).  </li>
            <li> so the strip doesn&#x27;t break up when you pull it, as opposed to the cheaper one that went on thin and would come apart.</li>
            <li> Spread it thin and pull up.  </li>
            <li> If you do your legs, know that you&#x27;ll go through a lot of wax, even when you learn to apply it in a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> False.</li>
            <li> Not quit as painful as other waxes.</li>
            <li> This type of wax is way less painful and leaves behind fewer to no hairs.</li>
            <li> This makes for a less painful hair removal.</li>
            <li> Smell is not important wax removal isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little annoying</li>
            <li> Then randomly, one day I decided &amp;#34;Hey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both before, and THOUGHT I preferred the strips, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It literally &amp;#34;shrink wraps&amp;#34; the hair and while slightly uncomfortable when pulling off it wasn&#x27;t a killer.</li>
            <li> Horrible, leaves blue stains on skin</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gigi hard wax before, and i hate that stuff.</li>
            <li> otherwise I may have purchased another wax and have been unhappy.</li>
            <li> VERY difficult to remove from skin.....</li>
            <li> Waxing my underarm was very expensive</li>
            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad I wanted to cry.</li>
            <li> Not to bad to use on your face by yourself.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything bad to say EXCEPT: the smell.</li>
            <li> but it has a really bad chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li> Gives me a bad headache</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m frustrated is because I can&#x27;t get it into my wax warmer.</li>
            <li> TIPS:  (1)</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t ever stop supplying this product or increase the price to a crazy amount!</li>
            <li> and it disappointed.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the stupid strips.</li>

            <li> This wax is not stringy does not drip all over the&lt;br /&gt;Place. It does not retain much heat so once u blow on it, it cools down enough to not burn the skin but it&#x27;s still hot enough to attach to the hair. It&#x27;s the best wax by far !</li>
            <li> The wax does a much better job than GiGi and is comparable to European Wax Center. One can of this stuff and I can wax my entire body vs Gigi where I need a can and a half. This is a hard wax so you don&#x27;t need strips. This type of wax is way less painful and leaves behind fewer to no hairs. Remember to use a oil before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are done keep the tin and order the refills that are in the bag. You can pour them right into the reusable in. http://www.amazon.com/Cirepil-Blue-Refill-28-22-Ounce/dp/B008L0AI3U/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_5</li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t need anything to pull this wax off.  Hardens right on your skin. It pulls right off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few brands/kinds of waxes before I found this wax and this is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  It removes even the shortest, tiniest hair.  I love the way my skin feels after waxing. It&#x27;s also the best wax to do Brazilian, this wax makes me wanna wax all the hairs off my body because it&#x27;s so easy to use and causes less pain.  I use a GiGi warmer with this and also the Gigi epilation oil and cooling gel.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bluish stain it leaves on the skin, but still, it doesn&#x27;t make me love it less. Most of the time, I apply patches of wax in different areas  so I don&#x27;t have to wait to long to cool the wax off, although the wax cools down much much faster than the GiGi wax.  I highly recommend  this wax.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been waxing for a few years and completely dislike strips because you need to be decently quick and the strips tend to stay sticky and can lead to a mess.  That&#x27;s why I purchased Cirepil Blue Wax, it&#x27;s completely strip-less and had other good reviews so I thought I&#x27;d try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, you need to make sure it&#x27;s at the right temperature!  I use the Gigi wax warmer, put it on the setting between Low and Medium for about 15 minutes then bring it between Medium and High, a little bit closer to the High side and poke the center of floating wax down.  They say you should have a lump in the center but I found that at that temperature it wasn&#x27;t adhering to the hairs well enough.  I thought that it was a bit too hot at the higher setting at first but it didn&#x27;t redden my skin or stay hot long and at the lower temperature it just wouldn&#x27;t get my courser facial hair.  For those saying it leaves a blueness, it doesn&#x27;t when you apply it properly at a certain thickness and apply it as a single mass strip, if you accidentally spread it too thin and you get little wax drops don&#x27;t just scrape it off, get a bit of wax and put it over the drops then pull it off and you won&#x27;t have any blue on you.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST wax I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using Gigi Hard Brazilian wax for years and I&#x27;m mad how long I&#x27;ve been wasting my time and money on it. Usually, it takes me forever to do my own Brazilian wax but with this wax, honey, I was done in no time.  I didn&#x27;t have to go back over the areas as much, only twice in some areas. I will never buy another wax unless it is proven that it&#x27;s better than Cirepil Blue Wax, which I seriously doubt.  If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this, don&#x27;t hesitate and wait like I did, just go ahead and buy buy buy!  I used it in my Gigi wax warmer and it was a perfect fit. The wax warmer collars were a little snug going on but just be patient because they will definitely keep your warmer safe from spills.  Again, this wax is nothing but the best.  It didn&#x27;t take long to warm up and the consistency is everything! No chipping, breaking, or cracking of the wax, just nice pliable strips of wax when pulling off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other waxes, but this one is the one I kept seeing the pros use.  I tried it and love it.  I like not needed the strips.  My one issue is that I can&#x27;t use it on my face, but there aren&#x27;t many that I can.  That&#x27;s ok, I use the other brand for my face, but use this for everything else.  -- it&#x27;s NOT messy like some of the honey waxes are... bonus!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write out reviews, but if I didn&#x27;t for this item then I would feel selfish. Before purchasing Cirepil Blue, I did SO much research in SOO many different waxes, I am so thankful for all the reviews for this wax otherwise I may have purchased another wax and have been unhappy. This is HIGH QUALITY WAX! The first time you use it you can tell that this is an amazing wax. It does not leave skin blue, and comes off with minimal pain!(Having previous experience in handling wax, of course) I have used Gigi hard and soft wax for years, I have grown to prefer hard wax, and after using this wax, I feel like I should have done my research a long time ago before waisting so much money on Gigi hard wax. I would rate Gigi hard wax a 4. This is a five star wax forsure, if you don&#x27;t take my word for it then do your research, you will definitely come back to this wax!:)&lt;br /&gt;Pain tolerance of course is different for everyone, however for a brizilian waxes, on a sale from 1 to 10 of pain:&lt;br /&gt;Gigi hard wax:7-8&lt;br /&gt;Cirepil blue hard wax:4-5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Waxing!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this wax. Very disappointed. It breaks the hair does not remove it.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I did not find this wax smelled AT ALL.  I&#x27;ve been waxing for years, so I am well acquainted with the pain it can cause, but the results are always worth it.  Of all the waxes I have used, this one hurts the least (I was actually shocked by how little it hurt).  Also, you don&#x27;t need waxing strips with the blue wax, which is a bonus.  I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this wax, a wax warmer, the sticks, etc. because it is actually pretty easy to do at home and you can save a lot of money (especially with the prices salons charge!).</li>
            <li> As a professional, this is an awesome hard wax. Great to use for a brazilian. Definitely on my top list of waxes to use. (And there is only 2 favs on my list)</li>
            <li> This wax is so much better than traditional wax. While it adheres to the hair, it does not rip off the skin. DIY friendly and best of all NO MESS!! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very good.... easy an clean</li>
            <li> Love this! Best wax I&#x27;ve used so far, especially compared to other kinds of waxes.</li>
            <li> Works fine, I like that there are no strips required. I don&#x27;t careful for the blue dye though.</li>
            <li> This is what they use at the day spa I go to for waxing. A bit tricky to apply, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s pretty easy to use yourself.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Assuming you use it correctly, you won&#x27;t burn yourself, which is a risk you take with other hard waxes. It&#x27;s easy to remove wax that is left behind with a cotton ball and a little oil. I followed up my initial order with follow up orders.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Got this after getting hard wax at a professional wax center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One really needs to spread the wax evenly n thickly..and even after that the strip was breakign apart of me when i tried to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no novice to waxing as I do it myself at home. You get this thing on to any thing and it wont come out!</li>
            <li> I like this wax better than the honee stripless wax. Its doesnt break as easily and does pick up 95% of the hairs. I used it on my legs just fine but its better for face, bikini, and underarms. I also feel like it hurtless because it picked up the hairs and not so much my skin.</li>
            <li> This wax works perfectly for bikini area as well as arm pits and my husband uses it for his nose.</li>
            <li> Way better than the other products on the market. I won&#x27;t ever use anything else</li>
            <li> Because of the cost of a professional wax, I wanted to do this at home. I researched to see if I could find something close to what the European Wax Center used and this is it! I bought the Gigi Wax Warmer Model 0225 and these two items work great together. Since I had only planned to do brows and lip, I bought the smaller wax sticks.  If you plan to do your bikini line, I would also buy some larger wooden sticks.  I did buy the oil and calming lotion at Sally&#x27;s.  LOVE that I invested in this. Easy to do and saves a ton of $$.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah! this wax is the best one I have try and you should try it too.</li>
            <li> I love this wax. Painless, easy to use, all around great. Shipping was fast too. The can is a little snug in my warmer, but other than that, fantastic!</li>
            <li> It works great, only reason it is 4 and not 5 stars is because it leaves some blue residue behind that is very difficult to take off. But it does grasp the hairs, remove the hairs, and I recommend it to anyone who does not have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;My sister has sensitive skin and even on low temperature it burns her. My skin is fine, my redness only lasts like 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great wax. Inexpensive way to get your waxing done with little cost, if you can tolerate the pain. Lasts a long time and for repeated uses.</li>
            <li> This is the best wax I have ever used. It is nice and thick--not runny like most hard wax is when hot. This makes the cleanup so much easier. It&#x27;s also more of a gel-like texture as it hardens, so it doesn&#x27;t become brittle and break apart before you get the chance to rip out the hair. I used it for a Brazilian and it got even the lightest and thinnest hairs.</li>
            <li> Excellent! See my post wax pic! I recommend going to European wax center a few times before trying at home... They use a very similar wax, and watching their techniques helps. I will do all my own bikini and underarm waxing with cirepil wax now,.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for hair removal.</li>
            <li> Easy to heat, apply &amp; use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been self waxing for over 15 years and love this wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy clean up.</li>
            <li> im so excited because i found the perfect product for my brazilian wax......  and more.....THANKS!!!!!!....If doesn&#x27;t work for u i show you how to do it....</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this wax, mainly because I have had bad experiences with waxes irritating my skin. Have no fear!! This is the wax for you!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I did my first full Brazilian and underarms as soon as I got it. It left me smooth and hair free. Although I did have to go over my underarms a few times to get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is so thorough yet completely gentle for all parts of the bikini. This wax paid for itself with the first use. I have so many more waxes left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a cheap coffee mug warmer to warm it up with and that saved me even more $. And to speed up the warming process I transferred the melted wax into a large glass mug so it is now microwaveable and the handle on the mug makes it easy to stir and manipulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of this wax and the results and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Great wax its my go to wax</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It pays  by itself with first use. After I used it, I melt it again and will use it again.  I got burned many times until I got it to the right temperature. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li> LOVE this wax! It takes a couple times to get the right temperature, but once you do it waxes wonderfully with little to no irritation!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool but doesn&#x27;t take off anything n it&#x27;s waxing it&#x27;s going to be super painful.</li>
            <li> VERY difficult to remove from skin.....sticks even with powder... left blue color on skin :{  will be throwing it away and won&#x27;t be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> First time waxing in my life. Was scared but&lt;br /&gt;it worked like a magic. I&#x27;m in love with this product. It doesn&#x27;t even hurt unbeilivable. My legs are silky !!! Amazing. (((hair must be long enough as recommended 6mm I believe?, apply a lot and spread it downwards)))</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to use and not too messy. Love that you don&#x27;t have to use strips with this wax. Takes 30-45 to heat up in warmer.</li>
            <li> This is the best wax on the market that I have tried so far. It is very easy on your skin and relatively easy to work with. I use it on my face, underarms and the back of head at the hairline and it is clean and efficient. Rarely do I have to go over an area twice but if I do, my skin is fine. It&#x27;s harder to use on larger areas of the body (like legs) because you can really only apply smallish globs of wax before it hardens. But because it is nice on my skin, I sometimes use it on my legs. I notice I have fewer ingrown hair problems with this wax than the hot strip wax (that is much cheaper).</li>
            <li> This stuff is ammaazziinngggg!!!!, just WOW!, the shipping was pretty fast as well üòãüòä</li>
            <li> I love this Hard Wax. I used to use the Gigi &amp;#34;all purpose hard wax&amp;#34;, and the difference I see between them is that this one is easier to spread and doesn&#x27;t crack like the other one. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am still getting used to home hard-waxing but this seems to be the best option so far. A few other waxes I have tried are either useless or crazy sticky and stringy.  Set your warmer on super low, as this stuff is much easier to apply if it isn&#x27;t super runny, it takes a while to cool if it is too hot and it can be a pain getting it to stay on the stick. Also, put a cloth down when waxing to protect your floors. This is much easier to remove from hard surfaces than other waxes, but if you get it in carpet or bath mats they are done for. I made my first tin last for three uses (just underarms and bikini, I use an epilator for legs), but think I can get my next tin to last longer by following my own advice and turning the temp down.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite wax!! It heats fast and no mess with this tin, just put cap back on and store...very gentle, grape the hair perfectly and leaves you silky smooth!!</li>
            <li> Good product, but be sure it will fit into your warmer before ordering.  I have the dual Satin Smooth warmer and it does not fit...</li>
            <li> I was paying so much money every single month to go to the European Wax Center. No  more, this wax to me is just as good. I had to get used to using it because before when I would wax  myself I would use the kind that you needed the strips with. I love this wax, I noticed when you put it on if you press harder with the wooden stick it sticks to the hair even better.  I&#x27;m very happy I took the risk and bought this wax, I just purchased my second one and it really did last a long time considering now I&#x27;m waxing 2 other family members with it. :-)  The price is right too and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the stupid strips.</li>
            <li> I use this with my gigi warmer and it fits like a glove. The wax is seriously the BEST there is!</li>
            <li> easy to use product.  not fabric strips needed</li>
            <li> great, easy to use.  gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I had my first Brazilian professionally done at least 6 years ago and vowed I would never to do it again.  Years of using depilatory creams and shaving almost daily just started getting to me. Then randomly, one day I decided &amp;#34;Hey, why don&#x27;t you give yourself a Brazilian? You do your eyebrows regularly, it can&#x27;t be that much worse.&amp;#34;  So, after watching several how-to DIY Brazilian videos on YouTube, I mustered up the courage and went to my local beauty supply store and purchased a very popular, off-the-shelf brand of microwaveable hard wax and set to work after popping two Advil and psyching myself up. I didn&#x27;t last 10 minutes before I called it quits and cut the remaining &amp;#34;hard wax&amp;#34; out of my hair and lady parts, jumped in the shower and shaved the rest because I wasn&#x27;t fond of the random bald patches look I had going on.  Determined, I started doing more research and realized purchasing the product I did was my first mistake. I then came across a very thorough video of a self-Brazilian wax and noted in the comments that the creator was using a blue hard wax that looked like a shimmery jelly. It was Cirepil Blue. Without a second thought, I hopped online and placed an order through Amazon. Item arrived in two days with regular shipping and all I had to do was wait the alloted 3 weeks for the hair to grow back in. In the meantime I went it and bought a professional wax heater -- no more microwaveable anything for me again!  When that time came, I prepared my materials and got to work. I was immediately prepared to have a repeat of previous self disaster with tiny screams, bleeding, and sore, tender parts but with that first wax piece laid down and then subsequently pulled off, I was so shocked. HAPPILY SHOCKED!  The pain seemed to go from a 10 (being the most painful) to a mere 3/4 (mild sting and then gone). The hard wax dried down to a pliable rubber consistency that didn&#x27;t turn brittle and into a questionable plastic-like mess from the previous retail brand I tried. Which meant it had a better grip on my hairs and was gentler on my skin. After about an hour, I was done: hairless, smooth, and in no pain and no sign of tenderness whatsoever. I was so surprised. I can now see you truly get what you pay for.  I am now going on my third week since my first time with the Cirepil Blue and I am still smooth! I will never pick up another razor and I&#x27;m saying a forever goodbye to Nair, Veet, etc.! I have since used it three times to wax my underarms (2x) and my eyebrows (1x). And I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing but I am actually looking forward to my second go at a self-Brazilian with the Cirepil Blue. I&#x27;m hooked! This is amazing stuff. I don&#x27;t even want to try another brand!  TIPS:  (1) You want to make sure that when melting the wax that you have a soft ball in the center -- it shouldn&#x27;t be completely fluid. Also, pick up the wax on your applicator from the center NOT from the sides where it&#x27;s too hot and too fluid.  (2) Apply a lightweight oil (I use sweet almond oil) before application of wax but make sure you remove the excess or else you won&#x27;t get a proper adhesion to the hairs. I find after wiping away the excess that I apply a little talc-free baby powder really helps. Hairs embed into wax and come up all on the first try.  (3) I didn&#x27;t have any issues with any wax residue being left behind on my lady parts but did when I waxed my underarms. If you do, take an old piece of the hard wax and press the shiny side down onto the wax pieces left behind, press down firmly and then with a pull it off. Instantly and quickly removed so clean up time was cut down.  (4) Do make sure to apply some type of skin calming and soothing product to the freshly waxed area after you&#x27;re finished. Really helps cut down on post wax irritation and sensitivity!  Happy waxing! ;)</li>
            <li> I was introduced to blue wax over a year ago and have not found anything that compares to the results and ease of use. Cirepil was great, but I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I&#x27;d be interested in seeing how other brands compare to this particular hard wax.</li>
            <li> This is the best hard wax. It is really easy to use and grips the hair well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on skin, but is hard to use properly. Great for sensitive areas or if you are pain sensitive. If you can deal with the pain the normal non-hard wax is easier to use and quicker.</li>
            <li> I used to go to European Wax center and I like this wax because it is very similar</li>
            <li> This wax is far superior to other brands.  I have always been a fan of waxing and paid a lot of $$ to have someone at a salon do it, but finally decided I can do this on my own AND save a ton of money over what the salons charge.  I started out with Gigi brand and there is a learning curve.  After my Gigi tin got low, I decided out of curiosity to try another brand.  There is no question about it, no matter how good the esthetician is or how good you are with self waxing, having top quality wax makes a HUGE difference.  Cirepil is salon grade, top quality wax in my opinion.  There are very few if any hairs left after removal,which is a problem I have always had with Gigi.  It never got all of the hair no matter how meticulous I was with prepping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a top quality wax, this is it.</li>
            <li> This wax doesn&#x27;t need to be as hot and so is much more comfortable and leaves less redness after.  It seems to grip better and doesn&#x27;t leave behind as much sticky residue.  It is super stringy but all in all this is a great product and I am happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> The wax is amazing!! I am an Esthetician and use this for my bikini and Brazilian waxes. It does a wonderful job spreading on, removing hair, and very little irritation. I will definitely be recommending this to my fellow Estheticians and purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Won&#x27;t ever switch back to my old wax. Clean and less painful. Drips less too!</li>
            <li> The best wax ever! I applied it around my lip and eyebrow area. This gentle ocean blue wax never hurt me. Its temperature after melted in the pot seemed to be perfectly constant. I had no need to warm it many times. PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Slightly more pliable than GiGi hard wax when hardened.  Worked better than GiGi hard wax at removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melted well in GiGi heater at lowest setting.  Spreads well, easy to leave &amp;#34;thick edges&amp;#34; which start and remove easier.  Not crumbly when hardened, so there is way less leave behind.  Has a tiny bit of tack when hard, so can use the back of a strip to clean up any that does get left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the edges lift up easier and the whole strips come off intact, it nets out to being much less painful than conventional hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will absolutely use again and can highly recommend to anyone to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This wax applied easily and worked like a champ. All hair gone with one pull.  And it is awesome that the container fits perfectly in the Gigi wax warmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with a Gigi wax warmer and freed myself from monthly waxing payments. This is the same wax that&#x27;s used at the spa I go to (used to go to). This wax is great for all areas of  the body. I do full Brazilians, my legs, armpits, upper lip and eyebrows. It&#x27;s very easy to work with and does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Awesome wax for an at home wax job!</li>
            <li> I thought it was beads not solid. My fault for not understanding. Beads would be much easier to deal with.</li>
            <li> I wax myself and friends and have used all sorts of waxes. After a long time using Gigi&#x27;s waxes this is the best for Brazilian no pain very easy. Not good for legs or other areas just use for Brazilian or face area.</li>
            <li> Best wax. Hands down. Better get you some!(</li>
            <li> Great wax.  Not quit as painful as other waxes.</li>
            <li> I used to always use strip wax, but someone told me that the blue wax is better at preventing ingrown hairs, so I gave it a try. I have to say, it&#x27;s a lot less messy than the strip wax. It goes on MUCH smoother and since it&#x27;s a lot thicker, I didn&#x27;t make half the mess I normally do. I will say that I used way more than I normally do with strip wax though, but I still like it better. Normally a can of the honey wax lasts me like 3 leg waxes. I don&#x27;t think this blue wax will even last for two.</li>
            <li> Wax does a great job of holding onto any hair it touches and doesn&#x27;t pull the skin. So much more effective and painless (unless hairs are too long) than the strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 5 star rating although it really deserves a 4.5 (but that&#x27;s not an option) I am pretty old to the waxing game (I wax myself and my VERY close friends). The first heating of the wax took about 30 minutes which was normal. I&#x27;ve read many of the prior reviews; good and bad. Things I noticed as I waxed compared to what reviewers wrote. It left a blue color on the skin: False. I have no blue residue at all on my skin. I prepped and cleaned up with some tea tree oil and it left everything nice. Another thing I noticed on a poor review was that &amp;#34;you have to apply so much in order to rip it off&amp;#34; well yes.. There&#x27;s a certain thickness for hard wax to work at it&#x27;s best BUT that is a known quality of hard wax NOT this wax. Also some comments about the smell. It smells like wax. Totally tolerable I actually forgot about it almost instantly. Hard wax is not for everyone, waxing yourself in general is not for everyone so if you can&#x27;t handle the subtle wax smell... Don&#x27;t wax.  My own personal CON to this wax: my skin was very red for over an hour after waxing. (This is where the half of a star deduction comes from) I have been waxing myself for a very long time and I do have sensitive skin but never had this much redness before. I can definitely live with it. I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34; clean and easy hard wax acai berry&amp;#34; good smell, EXTREMELY stringy, decent hair removal. 3 stars. Another wax I have tried is &amp;#34;Satin Smooth Calendula Gold Hard Wax&amp;#34; also a 3 star wax. Smell was not the best but tolerable, decent hair removal, awkward cream color. And last but not least the classic &amp;#34;GIGI Brazilian Body Hard Wax&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll give this one a 4 because it was the first wax I used and it&#x27;s a pretty safe and classic beginner wax. Smell is not important wax removal isn&#x27;t bad. NONE of these waxes though come even close to the hair removal capabilities of Cirepil Blue Wax. I am a very thick haired Italian and this removed my hair with 1 application. Not once did I have to go over a spot for a second time. It was amazing. Yes hard wax used a lot in order to remove but I used so much less wax only applying over each spot once that it made it worth it. So because I have tried a few different waxes this is the one to use!have to go over a spot for a second time. It was amazing. Yes hard wax used a lot in order to remove but I used so much less wax only applying over each spot once that it made it worth it. So because I have tried a few different waxes this is the one to use!</li>
            <li> I, like many of you other ladies, have experimented with Hardwax in the past. The ones I have tried have never been as pliable and easy to use as this wax. It is awesome. It is a little hard to work with when really hot so I recommend heating it and then allowing it to cool just a bit.  I did a test area on my arm and it took all the fine hair with minimal pain. My goal is to give myself a bikini wax. I am going to order some numbing cream to help me cope with the pain. Overall I recommend this product and I will be purchasing refills.</li>
            <li> The best wax ever - almost painless and very clean results. Make sure you apply some oil before applying the wax. I forgot about it and put some baby powder instead of oil - that was a nightmare. My number 1 wax from now on.</li>
            <li> This product is saving me thousands in waxing services! No wonder I started doing it myself. It grabs hairs at the root. No longer need to let my hair grow for 5 weeks and drive myself nuts in the process. After a week of hair growth, this wax will take care of it.</li>
            <li> Savings lots of money doing my own waxing with this product.</li>
            <li> I found out about Cirepil when I went to go write a less enthusiastic of a cheaper hard wax. WOW - worth every penny of difference. This one is gooey enough that it goes on thick so the strip doesn&#x27;t break up when you pull it, as opposed to the cheaper one that went on thin and would come apart. Another great thing about the consistency is that it doesn&#x27;t drip as much so there&#x27;s significantly less mess. Getting wax off of furniture is a nightmare, so this is reason enough to choose Cirepil over the cheaper one. Minus one point because it goes very quickly and it&#x27;s still kind of difficult to remove all of the little pieces of excess wax, even with oil. Overall, excellent product and vastly superior to the cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  best wax</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  Works with a much thinner layer than most.  A bit stringy but definitely my favorite. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Rips the hair out not the skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this wax. I have stubborn upper lip facial hair and this gets the hair out. Though there are still some leftover hairs, it&#x27;s so much better than what I was using before, which are the wax strips from your typical drugstore. I also had previously used Gigi microwaveable bikini wax, which tended to break for me. This wax retains a sort of rubbery texture, which helps when pulling it and the hair off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s a good idea to apply some talcum powder to the area you will be waxing to prevent the wax from sticking to the skin and to prevent any moisture or sweat. (Made the mistake of not using powder in the past and I&#x27;ve definitely suffered for it!) I&#x27;ve found that you can remove this blue wax spill by using some baby oil while the wax is still warm.</li>
            <li> It works, easily.&lt;br /&gt;Warm ithe whole can in a wax warmer like GiGi and it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Glad we made the purchase.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This was is awesome!! I have thick hair down below and I&#x27;m able to do home waxea with ease. It&#x27;s not messy to use and cleans up easy. Reordering now.</li>
            <li> Not new to waxing, but new to hard wax. Very happy I found this, I have very coarse hair and it is virtually painless compared to strips and gooey wax.</li>
            <li> I love it. I use this to wax my upper lip and underarm.  Waxing my underarm was very expensive and it really hurted but thanks to this wax, waxing is much easier and painless then before, it&#x27;s almost like walking into the European wax center but in your house at your own time and you only pay once for a good amount of waxing</li>
            <li> This is just what I expected. This is my first purchase of wax and it leaves a few coarse hairs behind and it doesn&#x27;t grab fine hair too well. Hope this helps. Also‚Ä¶the smell isn&#x27;t the best:/</li>
            <li> Love this! I got yesterday and immediately tested it out. All hair came off and no bleeding in the bikini zone! I&#x27;m no expert at waxing, but this hard wax is easier to use than the wax with strips. If it gets on the ground,  just wait till it hardens and peel. Any left on skin, baby oil takes it off.</li>
            <li> Loved it,  works great!!!</li>
            <li> Use this with the Gigi warmer, wrap some foil around it because the warmer didn&#x27;t come with the &amp;#34;sleeve.&amp;#34; The wax is great, good consistency. Use it on my pits and upper lip, takes 15 minutes and I save so much money not getting it professionally done. Also, I noticed that this blue wax pulls hair way better than the wax i used before this (sally hansen stripless)... I can actually wax my legs and the hairs come out! Never really worked before</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing it does such a professional job. After purchasing the GIGI Brazilian Body Hard wax, I was very discouraged that I wasn&#x27;t doing the procedure correctly. Wow, I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy this wax and try it with the GIGI Wax Warmer. You won&#x27;t regret buying this wax. VERY easy to use..NOT messy at alllll...it took me about 15mins to complete my under arms. I was so ready to keep waxing because I felt like such a professional...This was my 2nd time doing the procedure at home. Please don&#x27;t ever stop supplying this product or increase the price to a crazy amount! Thank you</li>
            <li> My wife liked this product. She was going to order her old style (hot wax) but she wanted to try this one, so we got this. She is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase. I&#x27;ve used both before, and THOUGHT I preferred the strips, but I was wrong. Great product.</li>
            <li> There is no argument here that it gets the hair out well. What I don&#x27;t like is that the one can couldn&#x27;t finish my legs...made me feel like I wasted my money. I would rather shave my legs than spend $20 to get the front of my legs done.</li>
            <li> This wax works well. My only complaint is the smell.....that&#x27;s not the smell of wax. It smells like a harsh chemical. It gave me a headache. I&#x27;ve used hard wax for a while and I did notice that you do have to put this on a little thicker than normal... Not a big deal... It doesn&#x27;t stick as easily to your skin as other waxes... Make sure to use the prewax oil. I&#x27;ll probably keep using it until I run out of it. It grips the hair a little better than the Brazilian hard wax, but I don&#x27;t think I would want to put up with the smell after that. Side note: I do get headaches if I wear perfumes or someone has put on plenty. So you may want to decide for yourself about the smell.</li>
            <li> * Heats up quickly and goes on warm and not hot unlike other waxes.&lt;br /&gt;* Stays pliable even after use! Doesn&#x27;t break like other waxes.&lt;br /&gt;* Spreads easily and gets almost all the hairs!&lt;br /&gt;* I have sensitive skin and it seemed a bit red after use but that went away after a while!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different kinds of hard wax like GiGi and Satin Smooth and I will say that this is the best.  I use the GiGi warmer and it fits great.  It makes for a smooth rip whenever you pull the wax off.  The Satin Smooth especially would always break apart mid rip causing extra pain to make a new grip.  This stuff also gets majority of the hair the first time AAAAND, my favorite part, doesn&#x27;t leave a million little pieces of wax stuck afterwards that are hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your time with a different brand.</li>
            <li> closest wax to European wax center&#x27;s that I have been able to find! very comfortable and easy to use worth buying for sure, the only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t smell that great but who really cares</li>
            <li> Love this wax! Ive had some pretty terrible experiences in NYC getting waxed. So I decided to take a leap of faith and do it myself. This wax makes me feel even more confident in doing it myself. I didn&#x27;t buy a warmer for it. I just use an old pot and pour about a half a cup of water on it and let the warm water heat up the wax. The wax makes the experience very pleasant. I can easily use this on my whole body and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like other wax I&#x27;ve tried. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> So this stuff is amazing. Way easier and cleaner to use than the Gigi hard wax. A lot nicer to the skin, I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it sticking to my skin (yes I always use powder) and it was completely easier to do larger strips as well. Far less messier as well, usually my bathroom looks a mess for days but the blue wax didn&#x27;t leave a mess at all and very little residue wax was left anywhere so no more using tons of wax off. I also used way less wax waxing everything south of the belly button that no would using the Gigi waxes. I highly recommend this wax to everyone.</li>
            <li> This did not meet my expectations. Used it for chin area and left hairs. It is very messy.</li>
            <li> I love Cirepil Blue wax! It&#x27;s great not having to use cloth strips, and it really isn&#x27;t messy at all once you get the hang of it. It will not remove all the hair at first if you have thick hair, but after a few waxing sessions it really does a great job at removing the resulting finer hairs. I have really sensitive skin, and this wax does not cause any sort of reactions for me. I think it&#x27;s safe to say that Cirepil Blue is here to stay, and shaving is a thing of the past in my life.</li>
            <li> I have used many wax and this one is the best I have ever used. It took me a little bit to learn how to use it properly. I did make a mess and had blue stuff EVERYWHERE but I wasnt applying it the right way. Make sure if you buy this you use thivk layers, it hurts less and is not messy. I have used the Gigi hard wax before, and i hate that stuff. It hurt so bad I wanted to cry. This wax is soft and if you apply it the correct way there is no mess! I think what i love best is that if it gets on the floor its super easy to get off and its not sticky if you get it on your nails or your fingers. This was a great buy, it grabbed all the hair. I love this wax!!</li>
            <li> Great wax. Works really well.</li>
            <li> I love this wax. It is painless and so easy to use</li>
            <li> did exactly as advertized</li>
            <li> Love, have to reorder very soon</li>
            <li> The best.  Just like my favorite wax salon.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the absolute best wax I have ever used. Minimal mess, easily removed, less painful than any other wax I have tried. Completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> easy to use hard wax, clean removal, no pain, absolutely worth the extra price. i found myself using it even on my legs.</li>
            <li> This is the best wax I have used I have experimented with many different brands and types this one is on top. It goes on gently removes all the hair, does not burn scar or smell bad. Its gentle for face and other delicate areas. I found that it works better if you prep the skin with some toner etc. Press the wax gently towards the skin when applying then hold the skin tight to pull it off, it takes a little practice but the results are flawless! I have found that toner worked better than talc or other things prior to waxing. After waxing my skin was not bright red, irritated or broken out, in fact it was calm and smooth. I have used it three times placing a foil sheet underneath the work area helps with a quick clean up.</li>
            <li> This wax is the only wax I trust in my studio for intimate areas! Love Cirepil products! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I purchased this wax to remove facial hair. It literally &amp;#34;shrink wraps&amp;#34; the hair and while slightly uncomfortable when pulling off it wasn&#x27;t a killer. I&#x27;m fair skinned and I didn&#x27;t have a red face that made me want to hide in the house for several hours afterwards either. I tested the hot wax on my wrist and ripped it off with no pain. I purchased the GIGI warmer and the can fit perfectly in it and heated in about 30 minutes. My first time waxing I was honestly an absolute slob with the wax, dripped it on my shirt and had wax &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; all over the sink. The sink wax wiped off with toilet paper and wax peeled right off my shirt with no staining. So glad I purchased this wax and not the less expensive competitors. It&#x27;s rated highly here on Amazon for a reason.</li>
            <li> Working as a waxer at a well know waxing franchise I wanted to test out other waxes to see if the wax we use at work is really one of a kind. This wax comes very close and is very easy to work with. Because the wax I use at work is exclusive to the company and its brand, if I had to purchase a wax to use outside of work, I&#x27;d buy cirepil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and was in search of a few different waxes. I read all the rave reviews about this wax and despite the higher price, decided to go for it due to all the positive hype. I personally found that it is far less effective than just about every other type/brand of wax I&#x27;ve used and has almost twice the price tag?!</li>
            <li> I love it! Very easy to do.</li>
            <li> Easy on sensitive skin. Not to bad to use on your face by yourself. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> this is very hard wax to use as it is extremely sticky and does not pull off well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt much. If you just do it quick it shouldn&#x27;t. Either take  wooden spatula and smooth on, leave spatula on arm til the wax hardens up some then rip.</li>
            <li> This wax works remarkably well.  It is VERY helpful to trim hair (and surrounding areas) before waxing, so you don&#x27;t accidentally grab too many stray hairs.  (I used this as a bikini wax)</li>
            <li> A great product, but it takes some practice. If you have never used hard wax, it could be a bit difficult; however, as long as you watch videos online on how to use hard wax, it will help a ton and save you a lot of pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I definitely prefer this over all the others!</li>
            <li> This is the most pliable, constructable wax out there. It is my only choice for body waxing services.  I&#x27;m sold</li>
            <li> Being my first hard wax I guess its okay. Looked for some hard waxes for senstive areas and this was the reccommended one. Had to really get used to not using wax strips but it saved on the expense on it. Used it on my heating wax machine and it fits great. Overrall, it saved me on going to the beauty shop to get areas wax and its pretty good wax to use everywhere for me.</li>
            <li> Horrible, leaves blue stains on skin</li>
            <li> This was a really good wax. I have been doing Brazilian waxing on myself for about 9 years now and have always used Gigi. I decided to give this a try because my friend uses it and I think its a great wax. I can&#x27;t think of anything bad to say EXCEPT: the smell. I can&#x27;t quite describe the smell but it has a really bad chemical smell to it. I feel like I&#x27;m walking into some mechanic or autobody shop when I&#x27;m using it in my room and I don&#x27;t have a small room. Gives me a bad headache so I&#x27;m not too sure if I will be repurchasing thus again. If you can get past the smell its a great wax.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The best wax I&#x27;ve ever used :)</li>
            <li> I have been getting waxed for two years, but just recently starting doing it myself at home. So much easier, cheaper, and convenient. I was using Gigi Brazilian Bikini Microwave Wax which I had great results with and recommend, but after purchasing the Gigi Wax Heater my friend recommended I try this wax.  I am not sure if this is the wax they use at European Wax Centers, if not it is very similar.  Similar to other reviews I read, it can get a little messy or &amp;#34;stringy,&amp;#34; but nothing out of the ordinary.  Gets every hair, even those stubborn ones.  I had great results using this product on my underarms, aside from my bikini area.  Awesome results.</li>
            <li> I heard from a co worker that this wax was so much better than the soft wax.  It is!  Spread it thin and pull up.  There is a sting, but it did not leave large red marks all over me.</li>
            <li> I love this wax! My go to place to wax is at the European wax center EWC because of the amazing wax and I must say that this is closed to their formula. I love it!</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product. The only thing I wish someone mentioned is that it is very &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; when you put the applicator in and remove it. otherwise I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax I use for stubborn or sensitive areas. Perfect for brazilians, bikini, nose &amp; ear waxing. When applying make sure you make a decent size glob at the end of where you will pull from (this will help you get your &#x27;flick&#x27; started &amp; will be easier to pull). This is a hard wax so let cool enough to get your pull started. WARNING: This product does not work w/ strips</li>
            <li> I like this wax, and I&#x27;ve used the refill wax dots, too.  The tin fits in the Gigi wax warmer (which takes about 45 mins to warm up, btw).  This hard wax is great.  I&#x27;m a novice waxer, and when I make mistakes, there&#x27;s no fall-out (I&#x27;ve read reviews of other people/other wax brands where they have to scrape the wax off their skin afterwards - not the case here!).  If you do your legs, know that you&#x27;ll go through a lot of wax, even when you learn to apply it in a thin layer.  I&#x27;ve taken to doing all-but-legs for the time being, even though my legs were my learning canvas.</li>
            <li> I heated this stuff up and teabagged it... I do not recommend doing that! Not only was it hot it pulled all the hair out and that hurts...</li>
            <li> great wax! cant go without. i would say its a painless type wax because it doesnt get stuck to skin.</li>
            <li> Great wax. Easy to use.  Will def save you money.</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE IT! GOT IT YESTERDAY AND TRIED IT OUT, AND IT GRABBED THE HAIRS BY THE ROOT! BUY IT, YOU WONT REGRET IT! TRUST ME, I&#x27;M A VERY PICKY PERSON...</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Never going back to regular wax. Less of a mess, no pulling skin, perfect for Brazilian bikini waxing.</li>
            <li> I love this wax.  I used it in my skin care clinic for years.  It goes on smoothly, dries hard and removes easily.  It does have a bit of a learning curve and can be messy but removes hair well but doesn&#x27;t damage the skin.  Make sure the skin isn&#x27;t dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> Loves this wax for brazilian!</li>
            <li> Great wax!! Works well</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the wax works. I hear it&#x27;s awesome. The reason I&#x27;m frustrated is because I can&#x27;t get it into my wax warmer. I was told it would fit but it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m sure the wax is great but I just wanted to let everyone who hasn&#x27;t bought this product before. Make sure your pot actually will fit a 14.11oz can.</li>
            <li> best wax ever, I have sensitive skin and this wax doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. will repurchase again and again and again</li>
            <li> Great but it can at time be hard to pull. I&#x27;m a beginner so maybe don&#x27;t have the proper technique.</li>
            <li> You have to apply a very large amount for thickness in order to rip from your skin.  Wax with cloth strips is better.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research as to which wax is the best, and this one came out on top, so I bit the bullet and bought it.  I thought it to be a bit pricey, but if it were as good as people claimed, then that was okay.  Well it is just okay.  What I liked is that it is a bit thicker than the Gigi hard wax I already had.  It stayed on the spatula better and didn&#x27;t drip on it&#x27;s way from the can to the skin.  But it stays dark blue, which makes it impossible to see the hair through it or on the wax once removed. I have only used it once, on my face and bikini area.  It didn&#x27;t remove the hair as well as the Gigi wax, but that may be because I didn&#x27;t have the oil it recommends.  I am now thinking about purchasing it to see if it makes a difference.  I will use it up, but I don&#x27;t know if I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Best wax on the market!</li>
            <li> Much better than using strips!</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon, and I only have good things to say about this product! I did a lot of research as per which wax to buy as this was my first time waxing at home by myself. I also bought the GiGi wax warmer and the wooden applicator sticks, and yes, it took me a while to wax my legs, and in the beginning I obviously started slow, but the results were only positive! Warning, this wax has a strong smell, so make sure you are waxing in a ventilated area and definitely avoid it if you have a sensitive sense of smell. I used 1/3 of the pot for a half leg waxing, but next time I&#x27;ll definitely be more efficient with time and quantity of wax used.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of this wax, i waxed my armpits, and my husbands back with this. I do not recommend it for large areas. my hubby is not hairy, he has splotches of hair here and there on his back and we used half of this can, also it took a while because i needed to wait for the wax to cool before pulling. packaging was great, received it within a week of ordering.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the salon! Takes some practice, but such a money and time saver.</li>
            <li> Love this wax. Works great and leaves no irritation. It&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for a Sally Hansen wax. I do not have a wax warmer, so I warmed it up on the stove, inside the pot with hot water in it. Warming up process was pain, it took a long time, and it was mostly melting from the bottom, however wax itself was very good. It worked better than Sally Hansen one, it removed more hair in one try, without need for multiple application. I assume that it would be really great it I had a proper professional wax warmer, and as I am not ready to invest additional $90 for the equipment I should not be complaining :)</li>
            <li> I just waxed at home for the first time yesterday and this blue wax made the process much easier than I thought. No strips, no mess, just some wax applicators, a wax warmer, Cirepil Blue lotion and oil, some cotton pads and here we go. It took just a little wax for two people and this tin will last a long time. I like how it wraps the hair instead of the skin and my husband and I had no soreness or redness after. My skin has never been this smooth before. Just one thing I notice: if you trim the hair slightly to make it shorter (about 1/5-1/4 of an inch, instead of 1/2), it will be much more pleasant, almost no pain at all. Buy this wax and you will love it!</li>
            <li> Good  fast services excellent product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wax for years and it is so much less messy than the strip kind. I put a little talc on a cotton ball and swab the area before waxing for maximum removal because this wax is a little sensitive to there being a layer of oil on the skin.</li>
            <li> No problems purchasing the item. The wax sticks to your skin good, so it is best to apply it in  a somewhat thick layer for easy removal. if you apply a thin layer it will stick real good to the skin and it will be hard to get an edge up to remove it. What i like is that it dries instantly once it hits the skin. It takes practice but it does its job with less of a mess.</li>
            <li> This works fantastic!!!  Leaves skin smoother than we were getting from a professional hair removal.  Just keep the heat low.  Originally we purchased it for money saving.  Now we do because of the results!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Love this wax, no need to use strips and does not irritate your skin. Wax actually shrinks to grab even the little hairs.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I used it in the gigi wax warmer and I was able to give myself a brazilian in 1/3 of the time it took with the gigi wax.  Use oil beforehand (the gigi stuff that comes with the warmer is good) and you are good to go! Spreads on thick with no flaking or brittleness while you are pulling the wax off....seriously a lifesaver</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to useüëç</li>
            <li> I was looking for a standard sized can of wax to use for refilling afterward with refill wax chips. Good value, fits the purpose.</li>
            <li> the wax was expired or something because I could not get it off my skin. used this wax in school and never had any issues until i ordered this one.</li>
            <li> Works great at just grabbing the hair and not your skin I use baby powder before each use and it Doesn&#x27;t pull at the skin at all. That being said those that posted those that posted this stuff makes a mess are a little crazy with the proper technique I had no issues I had my first brizilian done about 2 years ago and just watched how she did it and copied her. Now I can do my own its painful but with Those stuff its a million times better then strip and cloth method for sure!</li>
            <li> I decided to save money and begin waxing at home. I have been getting waxed for the last 10 years and I have to say that I will be saving lots of money :-) This wax is way better than anything you can buy at Sallys. It is low temp and if it is too hot when you use it, you will need to layer it in order to pull it clean.&lt;br /&gt;Top:&lt;br /&gt;Put corn starch on the skin prior to waxing so that you have less skin pulling</li>
            <li> perfect, reminds of of kind of wax that is used on me when i go to european wax. i wax my face/underarms at home now and only go there for legs and brazillian because of my busy sceldule. no strips needed, easy to use. long time waxers will love the consistancy and texture. f there s a better stripless wax email it to me</li>
            <li> Why the blue coloring? it was on my toilet, in the tub and of course my skin. It did remove hair.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected! It breaks the hair to often!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling for awhile to find a great wax to use myself.  After visiting a local salon for some *ahem* private waxing... I noticed the type she was using and liked how it worked for her.  A little research and a purchase later, it is just as great at home as in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note...  There aren&#x27;t a lot of directions with this item.  So, when using from the hardened state, it will take a significant amount of item to warm the wax in a wax warmer on high.  At least a half hour, maybe longer.  Give yourself plenty of time to get it ready before you are planning on waxing.  Also, you will need some applicators, like Popsicle sticks or tongue depressor type applicators.  You do not need wax strips.  The best part of this wax is how it comes off similar to a hard wax, without ever completely hardening.  You also need baby powder to apply in *ahem* delicate areas before waxing there.  It helps protect the skin from the wax, allowing the wax to only adhere to the hairs you are wishing to pull out.  You do not have to worry about using only a thin amount at a time, you can&#x27;t really go too thick with this stuff... unless you are doing it like frosting a cake.  Which would be overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum up....  Give yourself time for the wax warm up; baby powder the area; use applicators to apply in a judicious manner and let it set for a moment.  This is the real trick.  If you touch it and the wax is a little tacky wait another little bit.  It should be slightly tacky but not enough to stick to your fingers in strings.  Once it cools that much you can hold the skin taut and pull against the hair grain to get a nice easy removal.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cirepil Blue Wax for years. It is my favorite wax. It is the best wax to use for coarse hair and makes brazillian waxing a breeze.</li>
            <li> I used this wax for the first time ever. While I have not waxed before, this stuff did not work for me. It caused many ingrown hairs. I followed all professional steps including proper pull away guidelines. I would not buy this wax again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to wax your own hooha this is the stuff to get!  It grabs all the hair and actually pulls it out as opposed to breaking it off like I&#x27;ve found some waxes to do. It&#x27;s NOT a painless process and even as a seasoned self waxer I&#x27;ve frozen up and debated on whether calling my boyfriend for help would be worth the lifetime of ridicule. I haven&#x27;t broken down yet but a few tears of self pity were shed. My best advice is to trim the hair down short and do small areas, working your way in and down. The most sensitive area in my opinion is the top of your hooha lips so if this is your first time don&#x27;t be ashamed to leave a landing strip. Also, don&#x27;t leave the wax on too long as you sit on your aluminum foil feeling sorry for yourself, trust me the wax gets brittle and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well. Good luck ladies and happy ripping!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a similar, if not the same wax used by the high-end wax spa I go to. It&#x27;s great but I tend to use much more of it and it leaves a lot behind on the skin. I went through about a quarter can for half legs. You may need to research techniques or tricks to use this wax. That said, its less painless wax for sure.</li>
            <li> They need to make this a smaller tin. It does not fit the warmers.  Frustrating, because the wax is a great product.</li>
            <li> Having a hard time getting use to this product.  I thought it said can be used with strips also..... didn&#x27;t work.  Takes a lost of time.  Have to do a little at a time.  On a better note very delicate on the skin.  I&#x27;ve been waxing myself for 40yrs so maybe just &amp;#34;an old dog getting use to new tricks&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ll keep trying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but i like the rose  one</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and waxer for European Wax Center. We are known to have the most gentle wax on the market. I  am moving out of state where there is no EWC and I was researching hard waxes so I can continue to wax myself when a co worker told me about this wax. I must say this is the most comparable to EWC wax I have ever used. For those who are having issues with it make sure that the temperature is cool enough before applying to your skin. The trick is to put a ball of wax on your stick and hold it up for 5 seconds. If the wax starts to drop toward the floor within that 5 seconds then it&#x27;s too hot. It being too hot is what is going to cause your strips to break. Also, if your hair is thicker then you need to apply a thicker strip. With using this wax I&#x27;ve had no issues whatsoever and happy I&#x27;ve found something to be able to continue waxing with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pro, but I&#x27;ve been waxing my own legs for years. I prefer hard wax to sugar or strips. The problem I&#x27;ve had with other hard waxes is temp control. If the wax cools too quick the hair breaks at the skin instead of pulling from the root. I&#x27;ve had professional jobs that were a waste because of breakage. I don&#x27;t want red spiky bumps the next day!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. I used the GIGI Wax Warmer (Model: 0225) on high the whole time. This formula is very forgiving. Easy to spread and reposition. It cools consistently so it comes off in one glorious piece. It pulls every hair it touches buy the root. The first time I used it was the fasted I&#x27;ve ever waxed my legs, and there was ZERO breakage. I didn&#x27;t use or need and oils or powders to keep it from sticking.</li>
            <li> I used this in beauty school and liked it a lot. After school I started using Satin Smooth because it was a bit easier to get and cheaper. It always seemed to leave some stranded hairs behind and took a while to dry (not to mention it would break easily if it over dried). So I decided to spend the few extra bucks and get Cirepil again. This stuff is like magic in a can compared to anything else! It picked up ALL the hair it touched, dried super fast, and had a good consistency (not too brittle, not too soft). I am a true believer again, and I will never purchase anything else. This is worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> I first experienced Cirepil wax when getting a brazilian done at a local spa. I was blown away at how gentle the wax was on my skin. I didn&#x27;t look like a plucked chicken for the first time!!!! It blew me away. So I decided to order my own and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can fits perfectly in a gigi wax warmer. And this stuff is SO EASY TO USE! No strips are required. I gave myself a brazilian for the first time ever and it turned out great! All because of this wax! It clings to the hair amazingly which cuts down any extra owey pulling like I&#x27;ve found with other waxes. It doesn&#x27;t require annoying strips which is so nice. And it&#x27;s super gentle on the skin!!! I will forever buy this! Not that I&#x27;ll need to buy it often since a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t hesitate in buying this! It&#x27;ll change your life! :D</li>
            <li> After being told that this was the best hard wax to use, I found it to be a let down to be quite honest, very poor for intimate waxing, at the end found a cheaper wax provider off ebay  with better pricing and easier to work with!</li>
            <li> This wax blows all other hair removal waxes away!!! It does not remove skin like traditional waxes. I used to have that issue, because I have fair skin. This wax is wonderful for sensitive skin. It removes all of my unwanted hair, and doesn&#x27;t irritate. I love the fact that it&#x27;s muslin-less!</li>
            <li> If you or someone you know has sensitive skin, this is the best wax. It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other waxes and it doesn&#x27;t cause the same level of irritation. This is not, however, a wax for beginners. It is what is known in the business as a hard wax and requires some additional skill in the application and removal process.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is an esthetician recommended this was to me.  After years of using cheaper brands, I bit the bullet and bought some.  I will never buy the cheaper brands again.  It spreads smoothly and of course the best part, it comes off in one piece, rather than other waxes that come off in bit and pieces.</li>
            <li> This wax get all the hair and leave your skin smooth, my at home wax comes out just as good as a professional wax I never get those results with any other wax. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star is because little pieces of the wax stay behind and I have to scrub them off it&#x27;s a little annoying</li>
            <li> This cold wax is awesome! Only had trouble the first time using it... But it works really well. FAST N EASY!</li>
            <li> Great wax, used very first time and better than wax used by beautician!  Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Came wrapped in plastic and sealed which I appreciated greatly. It comes with its own plastic lid in the chance that your hard wax warmer doesn&#x27;t have a cover. Easy to use and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my skin which is great considering how sensitive I am. Has a slight waxy/plastic scent but nothing so overwhelming it grosses me out. It really does dry in seconds. I&#x27;d recommend the blue one as it helps when waxing eyebrows to get an exact location of the wax and no scary surprises once it&#x27;s ripped.</li>
            <li> This wax is easy to apply,easier to take off and does the best job I&#x27;ve experienced in home waxing. Will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Try it.</li>
            <li> My expectations were a bit high since this is a bit pricier than other hard waxes and PR is supposed to be the best. There were no appreciable differences between this and cheaper hard waxes during use, except the smell - this stuff reeks. I don&#x27;t use this on clients though so that didn&#x27;t really bother me. It starts to harden pretty quickly but doesn&#x27;t get too stiff if you leave it on for a while, which is convenient if you like to work with 2-3+ strips at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waxing however, I find this irritates my skin. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve used countless other brands (warm &amp; hard) and have never had a bad reaction. With this, I get hives &amp; the area is a bit itchy for an hour or so. It&#x27;s not a huge problem, I&#x27;m going to use it up but I definitely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I could not get this to work. Tried all angles, all variations in temp, everything I could think of. I have been doing my own waxing for awhile with soft wax and muslin strips - was so excited to try this and it disappointed. I do not have coarse hair on my face and it got about 1/3 of targeted area, and even less than that when I tried it on my coarser body hair. (Underarms and &#x27;happy trail.&#x27;) It was almost painless, but go figure if it&#x27;s not even removing the hair. Very sad.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this wax after reading the reviews. I usually have waxing done at European Wax and was looking for something close to the wax they use. This wax is NOT the same. It is harsher on my skin leaving it dry and flaky. It also does not epilate the hair well at all. It broke more hairs than it removed. It also leaves a small amount behind that is difficult to remove. I only did half of 1 leg before giving up.</li>
            <li> I am not a cosmotologist, just a home waxer and this is the most user friendly wax I have used. in my warmer, I set it to between low and off for a perfect consistency. Just be sure you don&#x27;t get it too hot.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It doesn&#x27;t smell nice but you get over it because it works really really well and you don&#x27;t have to use any strips. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. Will buy it again</li>
            <li> Similar to european wax center&#x27;s wax, it removed hair rather easily even in tougher areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is it did not cool as quickly</li>
            <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Melts nicely, and goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to get off - and takes no strips of linen.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
            <li> great product! Specially for doing it yourself at home.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me and it&#x27;s very messy. It feels as if it doesn&#x27;t remove any hair. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Like it much better than the GiGi wax - doesn&#x27;t break it off as easily.</li>
            <li> Great for bikini area even as a person who hasn&#x27;t waxed much at home was easy once you get the hang of it. A lot less painful than traditional wax and cloth.</li>
            <li> Holy smokes, this worked great.  Definitely will be cutting my costs at going to the European Wax Center.</li>
            <li> You do not need wax strips at all. This wax works well as intended. It will harden after application to enable you to remove it as a wax strip.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews re: it&#x27;s messy, stringy, turns your fingernails blue. Just a real mess. I much prefer the warm wax used with the paper strips which takes a hold of the hairs a LOT better. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time on this product.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hard waxes with no success.  This one works very well, easy to remove and comes off in one solid piece unlike the others I have tried.  You will not go wrong using this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this wax because of all of the good reviews.  But it&#x27;s very stringy, leaves a blue residue, and, most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t cleanly remove hair.  I have been waxing for a while with the Gigi wax, but thought this might be better.  It&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> Love this hard wax. Great seller and product,</li>
            <li> Works great!  Make sure you keep your body cool so wax can harden.  I place a fan in front of me.</li>
            <li> About 4 weeks later, I am still finding clothes with tiny blue blobs that will not come off.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Cirepil Blue Wax now that I&#x27;ve finally figured out how to use it! I was never able to find out &amp;#34;how hot&amp;#34; to put my warmer at-- even after scouring the internet-- so I was trying to heat it up on high, resulting in a thin, sticky mess that hardens and chips off when you try to remove it, resulting in some really painful removal and pain-in-the-butt application! My only wish is that the price were a little friendlier on my wallet, but using it to just wax my armpits like I do is way cheaper than having them done professionally, which would cost more than the entire tin itself for just one waxing session.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Grips the hair and is easier to apply than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Better than the one I had tried before. Colors is so pretty too üòç not that it matters as much as it been a good wax tho. I only try two hard waxes n I would recommend this one. Is not harsh on skin, I have sensitive skin n while they were red after waxing it went the redness went away soon enough, however do apply baby oil before waxing it helps. Over all an awesome wax :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Brazilian waxes, this one by far is the absolute greatest !</li>
            <li> Great little wax pot!</li>
            <li> Did not work well on legs or under arms. Had to keep applying it to the same areas. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was the best wax for manzilians that I had found, but I&#x27;m still looking. Everything as seller described.</li>
            <li> At first it was a little difficult to use. once I got the hang of it, it was easy and pain free</li>
            <li> I have visited professional waxing places that use a wax extremely similar to this, if not this exact same wax. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;hard wax&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t get as hard as some other hard waxes I have used. This makes for a less painful hair removal. I will definitely be purchasing again, and would recommend to any one looking for a good hard wax.</li>
            <li> I will never use any order waxing product again. This Cirepil Blue works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely far better/effective  than sally hansen ouch relief wax kit and GiGi All Purpose Honee wax.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used it for years when I worked in a spa and now I&#x27;m using it at home for personal use. It&#x27;s fantastic. It makes waxing so quick and simple, and gives me one less thing to stress out about in my otherwise hectic life.</li>
            <li> After having my first Brazilian done at European Wax Center I decided to start hard-waxing my armpits also. Since I don&#x27;t have the money go there regularly, I decided to try it myself after watching videos on YouTube. I bought this along with the Gigi warmer and it was a perfect fit. Took about 35 minutes to warm up and was easy to apply. Not too stringy and dries fast but not fast to where you have to rush. This stuff is really great for coarse hair. I had to go over the area a couple of more times but I had kind of a lot of hair. I don&#x27;t trust myself to do my own Brazilian but I will keep doing this for my underarms and tomorrow I&#x27;m going to try it on my upperlip. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my wax warmer because the can is 14.11 oz., not 14 oz.  Very frustrating! Just wasted $22.00 on a can of wax I can&#x27;t warm up!!! I&#x27;m going to have to buy the bag of beads and a empty can to fit in the warmer. Didn&#x27;t realize it was too big until after I ripped off the cover.</li>
            <li> I have had about 15 professional bikini and or Brazilian waxes. And I have personally waxed myself about 10 times. Previously I used Gigi hard wax and their warmer and it worked great, it&#x27;s what I was used to.  People here said this blue wax was easier and more effective than hard wax and was less painful than hard wax....I might agree. I also find it much less painful than sugaring that was performed by a professional waxer. It is interesting because most people say sugaring is painless. On a pain scale of 1-10, sugaring is a 10 for me, I was so bruised and I had to ice my privates for hours!!!! I got sugared 3 times by two different waxers and it hurt with both. Maybe because I have a lot of coarse dense hair with deep folicles, I am not sure, but sugaring was very traumatic for me physically and emotionally. I ordered this blue wax when half of my hair had grown back from my last sugar wax, and it was PAINLESS!!!!!!! I was able to go over multiple times with no issue, I even got the hairs inside my labia without injuring the delicate skin. The blue wax pulled out my hairs on the first try when I applied it correctly... It was completely pain free. I used coconut oil to prepare my skin. Make sure to loofah loofah loofah starting the next day so I don&#x27;t get ingrowns and I apply a moisturizer. I often use my facial moisturizer or coconut oil on my bikini area. The Gigi wax warmer works great when heating up the blue wax. I ordered more large wooden sticks. I also  recently purchased the Remington laser hair remover from target and I want to see how effective it will be in the reduction or retardation of hair growth and ingrowns in conjunction with waxing at home. I have had about 2 cycles for a total of 3 years of professional laser hair removal and it did work to reduce and retard hair growth for a year or so. So I am interested to see how my ingrowns will be reduced. The laser actually really works, I was skeptical but now I&#x27;m happy with that purchase.</li>
            <li> Its a little messy. Hard to clean up, but I do my own...so yeah</li>
            <li> I really like this wax because I don&#x27;t have to use strips. Works very well too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wax for its low heat temperature that would be gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;in conjunction with this I would lightly apply baby powder or olive oil and each and everytime, the first strip of wax is always pulls out nothing, yet extremely painful!! And what I notice is that the wax pulls my hair mid way through my skin, hence the excruciating pain. Then i&#x27;d have to go over 2-3x to get all the hairs, even the thinnest. Great thing is that no tissue scarring from the wax!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product with the GIGI wax warmer, which imo, even on the lowest heat, over burns the wax.</li>
            <li> this stuff is very gooey...it dries immediately and you cant use the strips with it you have to pull the was off with your fingers which makes a mess..but the product does remove hair very well</li>
            <li> I would never use any other wax!</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected. Great for the bikini areas. I have found personally it works best if you moisturize the area to be waxed with a tiny bit of baby oil (wipe off any excess or the wax won&#x27;t stick), then also rub on a little baby powder before applying the wax. This makes is stick better yet after cooled enough comes off quick and easy and creates LESS discomfort. Must use baby powder at a minimum prior to application of the wax or you will be trying to strip wax that has adhered to the skin too much and it becomes painful.</li>
            <li> Great wax! Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Best wax ever.  After my 2nd self performed Brazilian I don&#x27;t feel a thing and it&#x27;s easy to apply and manage!</li>
            <li> Just like European wax, but less expensive.  Easy to use, takes a little practice.  I ordered the beads this time.</li>
            <li> This wax is great, it pulls all the hairs in one try. I will get this wax from now on!</li>
            <li> Not very effective.  hard to come off.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gigi&#x27;s for about 1 year now at home and go to a professional for the areas that are a bit more difficult.  The place I go to uses this wax.  I use the Gigi&#x27;s wax warmer and this container fits however the gigi&#x27;s collars do not fit without cutting them which is easy enough to do.  This wax seems to heat up faster than GiGi&#x27;s brazilian wax, dries faster on your skin so you can pull it off sooner and pulls out more hair than GiGi&#x27;s.  Also, it leaves my skin less red afterwards... this may be psychological as I don&#x27;t understand how that can be.  The only con is the price...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work on fine hair and you have to use double the amount. Plus, it is very hard to get rid of the residual. I am not buying it again.</li>
