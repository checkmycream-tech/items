            <li> Love it,,,love it,,,,, Love it,  It is the absolute BEST!</li>
            <li> good for the dry skin</li>
            <li> Received product 2 days ahead of schedule and it is authentic nuskin.</li>
            <li> It leave my skin moisturizer when i woke up in the morning. I  like the product.</li>
            <li> Oh ...How i MISSed YOU!  my face feels alive again!!</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and that is the only reason why it&#x27;s only worth one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered around 11 o&#x27;clock at night and got it on my hand around 12:30 the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product was used. The seal was broken, the barcode was broken too. When I first opened the cap, the cream oozed out from the broken seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy from here again.</li>
            <li> This cream feels good on my skin. It&#x27;s smooths my skin and makes it feel moist without being greasy. I noticed that it has some paraffin in the ingredients and that is not the best but, according to my dermatologist, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Effective and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Please note that a Sponsor Distributor ID# is not a promo code and it should not be posted and used freely, it&#x27;s against Nu Skin&#x27;s policy for a good reason. Would you want someone unethical to be your business partner? What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to become an active distributor? If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life. I had bought Nu Skin products about 5 years ago from a beauty salon and I love it. Now, I&#x27;m a distributor and have a wonderful sponsor distributor to help and guide me to grow my Nu Skin business. This might be the business opportunity that you&#x27;ve been looking for and it may become your future and retirement income one day. Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and this product works for me!</li>

            <li> Another great moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nu Skin for years and I believe it has truly helped to keep my skin more youthful.  Many people have commented that I look younger than my true age. All I do is wash my face with water and moisturize with Nu Skin.  When my local salesperson gve up selling Nu Skin, I was thrilled to find it availabe via Amazon.</li>
            <li> It feels moisture on my skin but I don&#x27;t like the fragrance. It&#x27;s a bit too strong for my taste. I applies it on before I go to bed so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. After all it&#x27;s a good product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nothing feels better -  I keep trying other products and end up throwing them out so I&#x27;ve decided this is the ONLY face cream for me.  I use it day and night.  Hope I never run out of it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used alot of moisturizer&#x27;s in the past and clearly this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love it. Its a wonderful product and gives just the right moisture to your skin to hydrate it. I bought it for the first time and will continue to use it. Goes on nicely and does not stay oilly once applied. It drys into the skin immideately.  No sticky after affect. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Has been all I&#x27;ve used for at least fifteen years now.  I am continually looking younger!  ðŸ˜Š</li>
