    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a Bose in terms of sonic quality, but for listening to sports talk on KNBR on a weekday morning or music on a Sunday morning, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I put mine on the window ledge to get best reception and it works.     </li>
            <li>Especially love the separate on/off button.  </li>
            <li>The Conair Shower Radio is a very good radio for the price.</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>The price was great and it worked well for a while.  </li>
            <li>The push button on/off feature as well as the curved tuner &amp; volume knobs are great for use with damp hands.  </li>
            <li>This thing works great.  </li>
            <li>Not that great.</li>
            <li>It looks great with any decor.  </li>
            <li>(so cheap I bought it in 3 colors!), and it is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>i have no idea who wrote all the good reviews i read about this items</li>
            <li>Good quality, volume, AM/FM, and</li>
            <li>My roommates and I used this radio for years, and it worked perfectly the whole time!  </li>
            <li>I also liked that the radio comes in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li>Absolute perfection at a great price!!</li>
            <li>I may have to add a tether to this radio, but other wise, for $10, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The recipient said this shower radio gets better reception than any radio in the house.</li>
            <li>Works much better than one which sticks to the wall.</li>
            <li>I suspect there are better shower radios out there, but not at this price.</li>
            <li>so that he could listen to his favorite radio station while taking a shower.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how it got some of the better reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more for use in the backyard &amp; at the beach.  </li>
            <li>This item is well designed, compact, has a sturdy and waterproof battery compartment, and best of all, seem quite good at receiving a lot of stations in the usually obscure shower places you will use it.  </li>
            <li>The ease of use &amp; the sound quality make the Conair SR12 better than any of the 3 shower radios I&#x27;ve had, one of which cost 3x as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it is easy to move around.</li>
            <li>She says it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>The one thing the Memorex had was a rope lanyard, so I could securely tie it to something.</li>
            <li>This is a great, simple shower radio.</li>
            <li>Used for about a year, then had to get rid of it because the sound was so staticky.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>So whats great about this radio is that it is really loud for its size and the stations that come in are really clear for this quality radio.</li>
            <li>The reception is great, it plays loud and clear with just a push of the button.  </li>
            <li>A great little shower radio.  </li>
            <li>Worth reading reviews of this product which helped.</li>
            <li>Nice visual design</li>
            <li>one for an outside shower.great reception and sound is way better than one would expect from a $10 radio.  </li>
            <li>I bought this radio because a friend had a shower radio I loved listening too, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a product that I won&#x27;t be using other than taking showers.</li>
            <li>For a small radio, it&#x27;s got really good sound</li>
            <li>I was only ever able to get one or two static-filled radio stations in, and depending on where in the bathroom I had the radio, not even those came in well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to agree with the first two reviewers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The radio tunes to ALL of our local stations beautifully &amp; the sound is actually quite good for such a small &amp; inexpensive radio.  </li>
            <li>The batteries seem to last about 4 months or more, depending on how much you use it.</li>
            <li>This radio could not pick up the station that I listen to most frequently, even though all of the other radios in my house pick it up fine.</li>
            <li>With this little beauty, the power button is huge and easy to push, even with my contacts out.</li>
            <li>As always with dial radios, you may need to fiddle a bit to get it just-right on a certain station, but thankfully once you do, that dial need not be nudged until you change your mind.</li>
            <li>Tone is good for in the shower, but hardly \\&quot;hi-fi\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my sister, who really, reaaalllly wanted a shower radio for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>The sound is loud and clear.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!!!</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive, true, but for something that only lasts a month it cost way too much</li>
            <li>Main problem: the switch doesn&#x27;t appear to be waterproof -- it stopped working after about one month.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the seperate on/off button.  </li>
            <li>This radio is small, durable, the battery compartment door fastens way more securely than the Memorex did, so I think it may last longer without water intrusion.</li>
            <li>Speaker is real clear.  </li>
            <li>I assumed it just needed new batteries</li>
            <li>so I changed all four batteries to a brand new set.  </li>
            <li>The hook end is big enough to fit over the shower head, door knobs, and drawer pulls</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is a quality control problem with this radio what with the mixed reviews, but I&#x27;ve had nothing but good luck with this device since my purchase in late August 2009.</li>
            <li>Channels come in clear and the volume goes really high.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would caution someone buying this is, I live in a big city with a ton of radio stations and if you lived in a more rural place I wouldn&#x27;t buy it because not all the stations come in.</li>
            <li>* Watch for the price to come down &amp; become available directly through Amazon *</li>
            <li>Bought it for my son (13 years old)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let you know if those match my experience thus far.</li>
            <li>at least I could say I tried, and, unlike the Rembrandt, it came in her favorite color.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect much out of this radio since it was only $9, but thought I could give it a shot for that price.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>i have promotional radio the size of a very small cube that has better signal then this radio...</li>
            <li>But what she really wanted was a shower radio, so when her birthday came I broke down and got this one.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews regarding this shower radio, most ranging from average to poor.  </li>
            <li> Ten dollars well spent.</li>
            <li> The knobs are easier to grip in the wet shower too.  </li>
            <li> This radio is small enough to pack to the beach, or on the boat or to travel.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if those people are expecting it to wash their backs for them, but if you&#x27;re searching for a shower radio to play music for the 30 minutes you&#x27;re in the bathroom each morning, look no further.  </li>
            <li> The only difficulty I had was that it was a little difficult to find certain stations, but that&#x27;s typical.</li>
            <li> Makes her life just that little bit happier.  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s crazy how much she loves this thing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it made no change and within a week of that it died entirely.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant, because all of the reviews I read for the various models, even the expensive ones, were dismal.  </li>
            <li> This little compact shower radio packs a mean punch!  </li>
            <li> She hardly ever wears the diamonds, but she uses this radio all the time.</li>
            <li> I had the Memorex Shower Radio with CD for a year or two, until it leaked and was broken.    </li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever purchased.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive radio so I could listen to music and the morning news in the shower. The Conair Shower Radio is a very good radio for the price. The sound is loud and clear. The hook end is big enough to fit over the shower head, door knobs, and drawer pulls so it is easy to move around. The batteries seem to last about 4 months or more, depending on how much you use it. I also liked that the radio comes in a variety of colors. This radio is well-worth its price.</li>
            <li> I had the Memorex Shower Radio with CD for a year or two, until it leaked and was broken.    Just got this radio last week (so cheap I bought it in 3 colors!), and it is perfect for me. It&#x27;s not a Bose in terms of sonic quality, but for listening to sports talk on KNBR on a weekday morning or music on a Sunday morning, it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m only in the shower for 10 minutes and the point of this radio is to not miss the end of the interview or the song I was listening to while shaving.    This radio is small, durable, the battery compartment door fastens way more securely than the Memorex did, so I think it may last longer without water intrusion. This radio is small enough to pack to the beach, or on the boat or to travel.    Someone else mentioned the power button. With the Memorex you have to twist the volume dial to turn it on and set the volume. With this little beauty, the power button is huge and easy to push, even with my contacts out. And the radio \\&quot;remembers\\&quot; the volume level I have already set.    The Memorex only ever had 1 CD in it for the entire time I owned it.    The one thing the Memorex had was a rope lanyard, so I could securely tie it to something. I may have to add a tether to this radio, but other wise, for $10, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> A #1 gift. The recipient said this shower radio gets better reception than any radio in the house. The shower has a window in it so that may help. She can hang it anywhere in the shower to enhance the reception too. Works much better than one which sticks to the wall. Worth reading reviews of this product which helped.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever purchased. I was only ever able to get one or two static-filled radio stations in, and depending on where in the bathroom I had the radio, not even those came in well. Plus, not even a week after I purchased it, the on/off button wouldn&#x27;t work and to shut the thing off I had to remove the batteries. Even for the bargain price of $10, this product was a JOKE. Do not waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great, simple shower radio. AM/FM tuners, dial operation, battery-powered, with convenient on/off button (as opposed to others which use the volume dial as a power switch). As always with dial radios, you may need to fiddle a bit to get it just-right on a certain station, but thankfully once you do, that dial need not be nudged until you change your mind. I put mine on the window ledge to get best reception and it works.     All I wanted to do was listen to music in the shower/bathroom, and that&#x27;s what I got with this! Ten dollars well spent.</li>
            <li> This item is well designed, compact, has a sturdy and waterproof battery compartment, and best of all, seem quite good at receiving a lot of stations in the usually obscure shower places you will use it.  I suspect there are better shower radios out there, but not at this price. Tone is good for in the shower, but hardly \\&quot;hi-fi\\&quot;. Nice visual design and it seems sturdy enough to take take a fall or two.</li>
            <li> This radio could not pick up the station that I listen to most frequently, even though all of the other radios in my house pick it up fine. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Main problem: the switch doesn&#x27;t appear to be waterproof -- it stopped working after about one month.  If you keep the switch depressed it sort of works but take your hand off and it stops.    It was inexpensive, true, but for something that only lasts a month it cost way too much</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son (13 years old) so that he could listen to his favorite radio station while taking a shower.  It was noisy and the sound quality was poor (I guess you get what you pay for).  I don&#x27;t understand how it got some of the better reviews.</li>
            <li> A great little shower radio.  I particularly like the seperate on/off button.  The knobs are easier to grip in the wet shower too.  For $10, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> The price was great and it worked well for a while.  Then I noticed that the volume was less and less powerful and the reception was weaker.  I assumed it just needed new batteries so I changed all four batteries to a brand new set.  Unfortunately it made no change and within a week of that it died entirely.  It made it for just over five months.      As for how I used it, just to show it was not user error.  I used it for about an hour each morning, it was not in the direct stream of water, in fact, it hung just outside the shower curtain and got little or no water spray.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is a quality control problem with this radio what with the mixed reviews, but I&#x27;ve had nothing but good luck with this device since my purchase in late August 2009. * Watch for the price to come down &amp; become available directly through Amazon *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The radio tunes to ALL of our local stations beautifully &amp; the sound is actually quite good for such a small &amp; inexpensive radio.  The push button on/off feature as well as the curved tuner &amp; volume knobs are great for use with damp hands.  The ease of use &amp; the sound quality make the Conair SR12 better than any of the 3 shower radios I&#x27;ve had, one of which cost 3x as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more for use in the backyard &amp; at the beach.  I&#x27;ll let you know if those match my experience thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to agree with the first two reviewers.  I bought this as a gift for my sister, who really, reaaalllly wanted a shower radio for Christmas.  I was hesitant, because all of the reviews I read for the various models, even the expensive ones, were dismal.  I didn&#x27;t want to disappoint her by giving her something that would just break. I got her something else for Christmas, I don&#x27;t remember what.  Diamonds, an undiscovered Rembrandt, a Gutenberg bible, something like that.  But what she really wanted was a shower radio, so when her birthday came I broke down and got this one.  I figured, hey, it was ten bucks - at least I could say I tried, and, unlike the Rembrandt, it came in her favorite color.  Well, it&#x27;s crazy how much she loves this thing.  She says it works just fine.  Makes her life just that little bit happier.  Looks forward to it every day.  Seriously!  She hardly ever wears the diamonds, but she uses this radio all the time.</li>
            <li> This thing works great.  Channels come in clear and the volume goes really high.  Speaker is real clear.  Dropped it several times and nothing has broke.</li>
            <li> bought two of these...one for an outside shower.great reception and sound is way better than one would expect from a $10 radio.  Especially love the separate on/off button.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I bought this radio because a friend had a shower radio I loved listening too, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a product that I won&#x27;t be using other than taking showers. So whats great about this radio is that it is really loud for its size and the stations that come in are really clear for this quality radio. The only thing I would caution someone buying this is, I live in a big city with a ton of radio stations and if you lived in a more rural place I wouldn&#x27;t buy it because not all the stations come in.</li>
            <li> i have no idea who wrote all the good reviews i read about this items but nothing can be farther than the truth... i have promotional radio the size of a very small cube that has better signal then this radio...</li>
            <li> Used for about a year, then had to get rid of it because the sound was so staticky. Not that great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews regarding this shower radio, most ranging from average to poor.  I&#x27;m not sure if those people are expecting it to wash their backs for them, but if you&#x27;re searching for a shower radio to play music for the 30 minutes you&#x27;re in the bathroom each morning, look no further.  Good quality, volume, AM/FM, and I like the that the on/off button is separate from the volume.  Not to mention, you can&#x27;t beat the price...</li>
            <li> For a small radio, it&#x27;s got really good sound and the kids don&#x27;t have a problem finding a station.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I did not expect much out of this radio since it was only $9, but thought I could give it a shot for that price.  My roommates and I used this radio for years, and it worked perfectly the whole time!  I was surprised.  It can be very loud for such a small radio.  The only difficulty I had was that it was a little difficult to find certain stations, but that&#x27;s typical.</li>
            <li> This little compact shower radio packs a mean punch!  The reception is great, it plays loud and clear with just a push of the button.  It looks great with any decor.  Absolute perfection at a great price!!</li>
