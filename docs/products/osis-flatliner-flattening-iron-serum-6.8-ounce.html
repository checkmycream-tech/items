            <li> but I still have to touch it up with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I would recommend not to use it in on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It made it very dry and sticky.</li>
            <li> I think it contributes to a little bit of build up in your hair, but this is totally remediated by using a clarifying shampoo weekly.</li>
            <li> I did not return this time due to needing the spray and it being an add on item</li>
            <li> This product was a let down, I brought it but haven&#x27;t used it, because it leaves a build up, is sticky and smells weird.</li>
            <li> So I feel this product is not good but not for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have a thin hear.</li>
            <li> did not like the spray but doesn&#x27;t mean it is a bad product</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> Finally something that really works for my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making a FABULOUS product.&lt;br /&gt;Not everything works for me, but this does.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do well with my curly hair,  I gave it to my daughter and she said she liked it.  So I gave it a 4 star because my daughter does not have curly hair and it worked for her. So I feel this product is not good but not for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that this product is that much better than any other over the counter straightening product. It&#x27;s O.K. but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair shiny which is what I&#x27;d hoped I&#x27;d get along with nice straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair. It made it very dry and sticky. I used it as described. I would recommend not to use it in on dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> works great with my wives hair she is able to have better control with her flat iron and she loves it</li>
            <li> This product works great on my hair when I use the flat iron.  It protects it well!  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product when you use your straightener.&lt;br /&gt;Love the feel of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have a thin hear. This product make my hair more stronger!</li>
            <li> This product was a let down, I brought it but haven&#x27;t used it, because it leaves a build up, is sticky and smells weird. I am really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my hair can survive without this product. I get my hair straightened every three months (Keratin blowout) but I still have to touch it up with the flat iron. This is the product I use. It sprays on nicely, protects my hair from the heat of the flatiron and makes my hair soft and shiny. I&#x27;m a bit of a hair snob...get cut every 6 weeks, get straightened and use only good products. If you want something that works well and keeps your hair from getting frizzy in humidity, try this.</li>
            <li> great for flat iron use</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my moderate chemical sensitivities, as it is fragrance-free. Also, it works!</li>
            <li> did not like the spray but doesn&#x27;t mean it is a bad product just was not for me.  1 1</li>
            <li> WIFE IS HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.THANKS E.P.</li>
            <li> The spary nozzle on this flat-iron spray is very easily clogged and comes out in a stream, not a mist.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling silky, but come out more stiff.  I took a chance, but would NOT purchase again.</li>
            <li> I heated a lot of good thing about this heat protected, can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
