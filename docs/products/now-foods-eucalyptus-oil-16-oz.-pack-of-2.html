            <li>SMELLS GREAT</li>
            <li>It is also great for those who suffer from sinus problems as I do.  </li>

            <li>It may not guarantee that I won&#x27;t get stung, but it sure raises the odds in my favor!, but it sure raises the odds in my favor!</li>

            <li>/&gt;Needlesstosay I am pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The two pack was a better deal this time around....</li>
            <li>I love NOW products</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>High quality and great price</li>
            <li>My Wife uses this for minor aches and works great!!!</li>
            <li>It is a great product and comparable to other great brands available at fancy health stores.</li>
            <li>A good product at a reasonable price......great combination.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product was very securely packed and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This is so great and the great beware is to use too much, like more-at first-than perhaps half a capful</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>really helps me breath better at night when I put in my humidifier at night.</li>
            <li>A cool mist humidifier aids in cooling the passages to decrease swelling while eucalyptus creates a temporary dilator.  </li>
            <li>very clean smell, high quality, will purchase again!</li>
            <li>this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good value and a 16 ounce bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>new favorite use for this though, is for wasp repellant.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing;  a healthy and hearty essence that we keep near the sauna and another bottle in the bathrooms.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t remember the ratio for it, but I&#x27;m sure an online search would give you the same info I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Have had lots of comments from others about how much they like the smell of it!</li>
            <li>Much better for the home than chemicals and about ten times cheaper--and it does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li>Appreciate being able to purchase an essential oil at a reasonable enough price to be able to enjoy it in my bath daily.</li>
            <li>Strong,lasts for hours, such a clean fresh aroma throughout my home.</li>
            <li>I received the bottles quite fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Greenals (seller profile)] and was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>when mixed with cheap vodka (yes, Google it) and put in a one quart spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is real 100% eucalyptus oil.  </li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING.  </li>
            <li>Hope you will continue to make NOW Foods Products available since the health food stores in Eastern Idaho have limited quantity and archaic ordering policies.</li>
            <li>I have a home steam room, I went through the amazon reviews and this Company had a high rating</li>
            <li>a couple of weeks before you need it as shipping is kind of slow.</li>
            <li>Either I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the smell of Vick&#x27;s Vapo-Rub or the other brands are just cheap knock-offs.  </li>
            <li>New Sold by:</li>
            <li>Always before I bought the small bottles just because I love the scent and like to put drops of it in the water kettle on my wood stove.</li>
            <li>Last year was the first year we didn&#x27;t have any wasp nests in those areas.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to both wasps and bees, and was reading about natural repellants.</li>
            <li>rather they don&#x27;t access (literally nothing else has worked, and we&#x27;ve tried everything) and so far, they&#x27;ve stopped about 2 feet away like they&#x27;ve walked into an invisible wall.</li>
            <li>the cost is near nothing compared to benefits.</li>
            <li>This has been excellent for the whole family including the baby when we get a cold and have some trouble breathing.</li>
            <li>I got up the next morning while it was still cool and sprayed the heck outta that crack, and a few wasps came stumbling out and died.</li>
            <li>Thanks for keeping the price down</li>
            <li>We bought a house that had a slight smoke odor and this method really helps disburse the odor.  </li>

            <li> We bought a house that had a slight smoke odor and this method really helps disburse the odor.  </li>
            <li> I want an oil that is effective and brings back childhood memories( not necessarily of being sick, but the comforting feel of Grandma rubbing Vick&#x27;s on my chest).  </li>
            <li> Early on, I do think a small nest was forming because I saw a few going in and out of a specific crack.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the other things listed for this oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product was extremely well packaged(thankgoodness!--oil).</li>
            <li> a q-tip to apply it to the crevices of the counters and other areas we&#x27;d</li>
            <li> Uses are endless!</li>
            <li> other thing I do is dab a few drops of this on my clothes and on the bill of my cap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long that lasts, but I would think you&#x27;d need to re-spray vulnerable areas in subsequent years.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat it and you use so little</li>
            <li> For those of us with serious sinus issues, eucalyptus helps with dry air and congested sinus passages.  </li>
            <li> I take a cotton ball and put a few drops in it and spread them around the house.  </li>
            <li> spray bottle with water--shake it up a little and spray!</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays into the steam and walla!</li>
            <li> Put some teak oil and eucalyptus oil in with your regular stain, mix it well, and all your wood will naturally smell &#x27;bad&#x27; to the wasps!</li>
            <li> (Cheaper spray bottles will cause it to clog, even if you thin it with water).</li>
            <li> This is the worst Eucalyptus oil I have ever seen, I really even wonder if its just some spiked water, there product is a JOKE.  </li>
            <li> Used it in my steamer to open up throat during winter cedar season, the worst in south Texas</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already reviewed this product,  and my opinion stands: if you&#x27;re sick and tired of being the target of no-seeums</li>
            <li> I use eucalyptus oil in a vaporizer in the winter months and it keep you from getting a head cold.</li>
            <li> I try to keep three to five bottles of this on hand at all times for cold and flu seasons.  </li>

            <li> Helps me stay healthy in the winter!</li>
            <li> I did my homework before I bought the Eucalyptus Oil.  I take a cotton ball and put a few drops in it and spread them around the house.  We bought a house that had a slight smoke odor and this method really helps disburse the odor.  Not 100% yet but close.  Haven&#x27;t tried the other things listed for this oil.&lt;br /&gt;Needlesstosay I am pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Also I received the bottles quite fast.</li>
            <li> I just bought two of these bigger bottles, for the second year in a row. Always before I bought the small bottles just because I love the scent and like to put drops of it in the water kettle on my wood stove. It makes the house smell awesome in the winter. It also works great in an oil burner. or in a steam inhaler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite use for this though, is for wasp repellant. I am allergic to both wasps and bees, and was reading about natural repellants. I found out last year that eucalyptus oil works wonders. I put in a sprayer that can spray oil type products, and I spray it on all the areas that wasps like to build nests in the spring. (Cheaper spray bottles will cause it to clog, even if you thin it with water). We have a lot of wood on our decks, both in the flooring, railings, and ceilings. There are cracks in the ceiling that make great &#x27;nest&#x27; spots, so I also spray it in all the cracks. Last year was the first year we didn&#x27;t have any wasp nests in those areas. Early on, I do think a small nest was forming because I saw a few going in and out of a specific crack. I got up the next morning while it was still cool and sprayed the heck outta that crack, and a few wasps came stumbling out and died. I didn&#x27;t see any there after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great time to use this is when you are building a deck, a wood fence, or anything that will need stained. Put some teak oil and eucalyptus oil in with your regular stain, mix it well, and all your wood will naturally smell &#x27;bad&#x27; to the wasps! I don&#x27;t know how long that lasts, but I would think you&#x27;d need to re-spray vulnerable areas in subsequent years. And I don&#x27;t remember the ratio for it, but I&#x27;m sure an online search would give you the same info I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I do is dab a few drops of this on my clothes and on the bill of my cap. It also keeps the mosquitos away!&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, I will order a couple of these big bottles every year. It may not guarantee that I won&#x27;t get stung, but it sure raises the odds in my favor!, but it sure raises the odds in my favor!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve purchased this product.  I&#x27;ve tried two alternatives and neither stacked up to this brand.  The two pack was a better deal this time around....</li>
            <li> I got this oil to use in a mixture for my horses to keep the bug off them it works really nice and i like the big bottle so i&#x27;m not always buying it , it arrived when they said it would , I will be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Compared to the health food store price, great deal. Used it in my steamer to open up throat during winter cedar season, the worst in south Texas</li>
            <li> Great for aches and pains.  Great price.  Excellent seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already reviewed this product,  and my opinion stands: if you&#x27;re sick and tired of being the target of no-seeums this is for you. I make a mixture of 3 teaspoons of this oil,  and fill up a 10 oz. spray bottle with water--shake it up a little and spray! No-seeums hone in on the CO2 we breath out so it is especially important to spray your bedding.</li>
            <li> A great item, a great price and awesome service.</li>
            <li> Use it each time that I sauna........great just for the essance and also head colds! Have had lots of comments from others about how much they like the smell of it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before and I like it. Never a problem using this oil with grape seed oil for massage. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Product was extremely well packaged(thankgoodness!--oil). Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Thank you. Keep up the good work.  Hope you will continue to make NOW Foods Products available since the health food stores in Eastern Idaho have limited quantity and archaic ordering policies.</li>
            <li> great product.  This was a repeat purchase.  Wish they had a non glass container to put in the shower</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for making a eucalyptus spray for the steam shower. Last time I bought this:[2 of: Eucalyptus Essential Oil 100% Pure-16oz [Health and Beauty] Condition: New Sold by: Greenals (seller profile)] and was very dissapointed. Seemed to be an oil but the smell was off and was not what I was looking for. We use the steam regularly and have found this product A+++ when mixed with cheap vodka (yes, Google it) and put in a one quart spray bottle. Just a few sprays into the steam and walla!</li>
            <li> I use this product to stimulate my scalp with my hair conditioner; I use this oil in my humidifier, in my bathwater, as a body oil rub to stimulate and soften the skin.  For those of us with serious sinus issues, eucalyptus helps with dry air and congested sinus passages.  A cool mist humidifier aids in cooling the passages to decrease swelling while eucalyptus creates a temporary dilator.  I love NOW products and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried off-brands of eucalyptus oil, and NONE of them smell like eucalyptus oil!  Either I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the smell of Vick&#x27;s Vapo-Rub or the other brands are just cheap knock-offs.  I want an oil that is effective and brings back childhood memories( not necessarily of being sick, but the comforting feel of Grandma rubbing Vick&#x27;s on my chest).  Now Eucalyptus Oil does that for me.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only brand of eucalyptus oil I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Product was very securely packed and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Love that this great oil comes in a 2 pack!  I keep one in the laundry room and one in the kitchen!  Uses are endless!</li>
            <li> Great product/ fair price</li>
            <li> I use eucalyptus oil in a vaporizer in the winter months and it keep you from getting a head cold. smells great and  keeps your sinus&#x27; open and everyone loves it and it helps the little babies that have colds it is wonderful and arrived in very good shape packaging was good and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Very good product and the price was right,fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is real 100% eucalyptus oil.  If that is what you are looking for then this is the product.  Order a couple of weeks before you need it as shipping is kind of slow.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for the express purpose of keeping my and my roommate&#x27;s two youngest cats off the counters. Literally as soon as I opened it after it arrived a day earlier than the guaranteed delivery date, both cats shied away from me like I had introduced them to a dog. (Cats are known to dislike the scent of eucalyptus)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used a q-tip to apply it to the crevices of the counters and other areas we&#x27;d rather they don&#x27;t access (literally nothing else has worked, and we&#x27;ve tried everything) and so far, they&#x27;ve stopped about 2 feet away like they&#x27;ve walked into an invisible wall. Much better for the home than chemicals and about ten times cheaper--and it does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li> High quality and great price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that it comes in a glass bottle.  The plastic won&#x27;t leech into the oil this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good value and a 16 ounce bottle lasts a long time.  I use mine in my bath water.  I place my oil in an European drip bottle and drip 10+ drops into the bath water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to have to find out if Trader Joe&#x27;s carries this product so I can do a price comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good shipping too!</li>
            <li> My Wife uses this for minor aches and works great!!! It is a great product and comparable to other great brands available at fancy health stores.</li>
            <li> This is so great and the great beware is to use too much, like more-at first-than perhaps half a capful as oh my you can cause burning where you would never want it. BUT aches, pain, colds? You can&#x27;t beat it and you use so little the cost is near nothing compared to benefits. A MUST HAVE around my house</li>
            <li> Appreciate being able to purchase an essential oil at a reasonable enough price to be able to enjoy it in my bath daily.</li>
            <li> very clean smell, high quality, will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great - we put this with peppermint oil in our diffuser every night and we haven&#x27;t had a cold/congestion/allergies since we started doing this! Great for adding to boiling water on the stove to fill the house with eucalytpus aroma!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of Eucalyptus oil and I use it for different things. I mix it with some water to disinfect my kitchen and my bathroom. I put it in my electric ceramic aroma wax burner and the best of all, I added some drops to my body lotion and it has helped me with my legs pain. I have recommended this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Strong,lasts for hours, such a clean fresh aroma throughout my home. Will purchase again, and cheaper than a candle</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING.  SMELLS GREAT</li>
            <li> I try to keep three to five bottles of this on hand at all times for cold and flu seasons.  It is also great for those who suffer from sinus problems as I do.  Put in a vaporizer this is the ultimate to get to sleep.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. Thanks for keeping the price down</li>
            <li> No complaints. The smell of this is pleasant, and helps myself with breathing problems. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have a home steam room, I went through the amazon reviews and this Company had a high rating so I purchase.  This is the worst Eucalyptus oil I have ever seen, I really even wonder if its just some spiked water, there product is a JOKE.  BEWARE  DO NOT BUY</li>
