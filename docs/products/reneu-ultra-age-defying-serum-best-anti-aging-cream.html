            <li>Regular use over time will reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and improve the texture of the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was asked to review this item because people know that I am really into my skin care.  </li>
            <li>…the serum is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of using it in the morning and evening, I feel like my face is so much softer.  </li>
            <li>Did absolutely  nothing ..</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely no greasy or sticky feeling, and I am immediately able to being applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>As a guy over 50, this has really helped me with the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The pump cap is easy to use and dispenses a large drop, which goes a long</li>
            <li>High quality ingredients for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of the ReNeu Ultra Age Defying Serum from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review and have been using the product for the past month.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to try it as I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>has high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I like this skin care serum.  </li>
            <li>in to my skin fast with a moist finish to my skin that stays soft for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>and I was really pleasantly surprised by how much I like this ant-aging serum.  </li>
            <li>hydrates my skin very well and keep my skin soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I notice that her skin is smoother, really smoother and soft.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that after been using the ReNeu, not only has my skin not had any adverse reactions, but I&#x27;m noticing an improvement in the fine lines around my eye area and overall complexion.  </li>
            <li>Once applied my skin feels moisturized and very soft.</li>
            <li>I am usually sensitive to products</li>
            <li>Natural and makes the skin feel nurtured.</li>
            <li>Renovage®, Matrixyl®, and Hyaluronic Acid work together to smooth and firm your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>and I was totally surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying different serums lately and would classify this more as a lotion than a serum.  </li>
            <li>This skin cream is slightly viscous and white like a lotion, but it absorbs into the skin quickly like a serum, leaving it feeling silky.  </li>
            <li>soothes and moisturizes sensitive facial skin and protects it from loss of moisture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the name labels ReNeu a serum I would consider it more of a cream due to its thick, white, creamy texture and the moisture it provides my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I like this skin care serum.  I was asked to review this item because people know that I am really into my skin care.  Well here goes…the serum is very lightweight.  I like that it is non-greasy and goes on so smoothly. I even use it as a primer for my makeup in the morning.  I am usually sensitive to products but this serum is great.  I even like the smell.  After a couple of weeks of using it in the morning and evening, I feel like my face is so much softer.  My skin feels fresh and hydrated.  I’ve done a lot of research on anti aging products and reNeu has high quality ingredients.  This serum has Renovage which is often referred to as a fountain of youth!  It works on the skin at the cellular level.  Anyway, I am so happy that I’m really seeing the effects on my face.  Check out reNeu Age Defying Serum - you’ll like it.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try for no charge.  I usually don&#x27;t like scented products however this has a very light scent which is pleasant.  I also like that the texture is smooth and not greasy absorbing  in to my skin fast with a moist finish to my skin that stays soft for quite some time.  I tell others about this product and would now purchase it.  Thank you for the sample I was given to try. S. N.</li>
            <li> Really love this serum that I got as a sample.  I love it!  I am picky about what I put on my face and I was really pleasantly surprised by how much I like this ant-aging serum.  It’s light and not oily.  It goes on smooth and works as a base for my makeup.  I put it on twice a day after I wash my face.  I like the feel on my skin!  I’m already noticing that my skin is improving.  It’s softer and smoother.  I will continue using this because I feel like I’m doing something great for my face.  This serum is fantastic and I will order it again.</li>

            <li> I probably would not have bought this on my own but a friend gave me this as a gift and I really like it.  I can see and feel a difference in skin already.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. We received this as a gift in a promotion. We loved the quality of the product and it works.  Natural and makes the skin feel nurtured.</li>
            <li> ReNeu combines the most powerful anti-aging ingredients to bring you their Ultra Age Defying Serum. ReNeu firms and hydrates your skin, shrinks the size of pores, reduces pigmentation and redness, and improves the appearance of wrinkles. ReNeu uses only the best anti-aging ingredients available in their Ultra Age Defying Serum. Renovage®, Matrixyl®, and Hyaluronic Acid work together to smooth and firm your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ReNeu comes in a pretty 1 oz bottle with a handy pump on the top for dispensing. I followed the instructions on the bottle which indicate to use the product once in the am and once in the pm.  I pump out the product into my hand (two pumps) and then massage it into my skin. I has a bit of a cooling sensation which is very invigorating, especially in the morning. Once applied my skin feels moisturized and very soft. There is absolutely no greasy or sticky feeling, and I am immediately able to being applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the name labels ReNeu a serum I would consider it more of a cream due to its thick, white, creamy texture and the moisture it provides my skin. I notice that my foundation goes on very smoothly when I apply this serum before hand, which I love. I am impressed by this product, and I am happy to have added it to my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my girl friend, she is so happy to try it out. The bottle is pretty and we both like the pump because it is easy to get the serum out nicely. The serum is lightweight, not sticky at all. It leaves skin clean and smooth. She has used it twice a day for two weeks now and she can&#x27;t say enough good feeling about this serum. I notice that her skin is smoother, really smoother and soft. It seems to diminish her lines a bit. Pretty cool! I am glad that she loves this serum and no oily or greasy feeling after it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this serum at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I am lucky to get a sample to try, and my friend is lucky to have me.</li>
            <li> I received this item as a gift and have been using it for about a week.  What I really have noticed is this &amp;#34;HYDRATES AND FIRMS SKIN and balances moisture throughout the day; Firms skin and increases elasticity resulting in improved skin texture and tone; minimizes pore size.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve always used lotions on my face but realize now that helping it stay there is what&#x27;s been missing.  Over time I would expect to see a change in how my wrinkles appear when I look in the mirror.  There is a very light but pleasing scent to the product,</li>
            <li> Love It! I can&#x27;t say enough about this Ultra Age Defying Serum. I love the smooth and silky feeling of the serum. It goes on easily and is quickly absorbed into the skin. Plus there is no greasy feeling! It makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. There is no skin irritation that I&#x27;ve found with other products. I love that I can us it as a primer under my makeup. Plus the very light scent is heavenly! I&#x27;m at the age where I need to take care of my skin. I&#x27;ve been researching anti aging products and was thrilled to find everything I need in one bottle. I was really excited when I was given this product for trial and review. I&#x27;m using it twice a day and I am pleased with the results so far. My skin is starting to feel different and look different, it&#x27;s softer! High quality ingredients for a reasonable price. I Highly Recommend this reNeu serum, enjoy!</li>
            <li> This skin cream is slightly viscous and white like a lotion, but it absorbs into the skin quickly like a serum, leaving it feeling silky.  It has a faint citrusy fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soothes and moisturizes sensitive facial skin and protects it from loss of moisture. Regular use over time will reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and improve the texture of the skin.  I am also using it on some other areas with irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container holds 30 ml (1 oz.).  The pump cap is easy to use and dispenses a large drop, which goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peptides included in the formula are being studied to determine if they can stimulate skin regeneration when applied topically.  It also includes over a dozen other  ingredients that are helpful for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient:  Aqua, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, octyl palmitate, caprylic/capric triglyceride and teprenone (Renovage), palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 (Matrixyl), dimethicone, sodium hyaluronate, xylitol, boron nitride, sclerotium gum, Citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) fragrance, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, potassium sorbate.&lt;br /&gt;ReNeu provided skin cream for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this product twice a day for a week and really like it! My skin feels fresher, smooth and more hydrated.  This product was easy to use. It goes on easy and It&#x27;s not greasy.  I’m not one to take a lot of time with my face, so I like that it is a single skin care product that i will keep using! I’m going to get more when this bottle runs out.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love my ReNeu Ultra Age Defying Serum! I am quite fussy when it comes to face creams and anti-ageing products I have found it hard to find one that feels great on my face as well as to have some positive effect. I was given this as a gift by one of my best friends and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
            <li> I was given this cream to sample and I was totally surprised how well it worked. As a guy over 50, this has really helped me with the wrinkles around my eyes. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love my ReNeu Ultra Age Defying Serum!  I am quite fussy when it comes to face creams and anti-ageing products I have found it hard to find one that feels great on my face as well as to have some positive effect.  I was given this as a gift by one of my best friends and I absolutely love it.  It is so silky smooth on my face and my skin does feel firmer too. So highly recommended - I will certainly be back for more when I need to replace this.</li>
            <li> I was given the Reneu as a gift to try, and I promised to give a fair review and here it is;  Really liked it and will try it again!</li>
            <li> I was given this product to test, and so far I&#x27;m very happy with the progress my skin is making. The serum goes on smooth and absorbs quickly with no sticky feel. And my fine lines are getting softer as I keep using this product. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of the ReNeu Ultra Age Defying Serum from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review and have been using the product for the past month.  I was hesitant at first to try it as I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.  However, I&#x27;ve found that after been using the ReNeu, not only has my skin not had any adverse reactions, but I&#x27;m noticing an improvement in the fine lines around my eye area and overall complexion.  It looks brighter and the skin seems more taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other/similar brands, the ReNeu serum is at a wonderful price point and works wonders.  Recommended!!</li>
            <li> Wow. First of all I love the feel of the serum. It’s light and has a nice citrusy smell. I have sensitive skin and this feels great. It already is making my skin softer and silkier. I received this product as a gift and I was really impressed with this all in one anti aging formula, so I started doing some research. ReNeu has incredible ingredients. The patented ingredients Renovage and Matrixyl are both from France and have been proven in clinical trials. Look what Renovage can do after just one month. I was also impressed that it can help me get rid of my sunspots. Waiting for my long term results but these results have got me motivated!</li>
