            <li>WIN GRIP DOES NOT WORK!</li>
            <li>This is the BEST alternative to wig caps!  </li>
            <li>Brilliant!</li>
            <li>This headband worked great!  </li>
            <li>I have been warring a wig for over a year since having chemo and the wiggrip is the best  at holding my wig in place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It is great I am going to buy another.</li>
            <li>I think this is going to work out great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>nothing moves once you put it on and living in a very warm and humid climate</li>
            <li>The Wigrip is doing a great job of keeping her wig in place, and she is happy and confident in her appearance when she goes to church or out to eat.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the top of my wig is snug against the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable!</li>
            <li>love it though!</li>
            <li>It works really good, for the most part.</li>
            <li>Otherwise nice.</li>
            <li>you can not get them, then of course this price is worthwhile, but for me, I feel cheated by my own mistake.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was Prompt and in perfect new condition.  </li>
            <li>This one is a must for wig wearers, I own two plan on ordering more ( just in case)...</li>
            <li>Works well on front and sides -- feels very secure.</li>
            <li>After putting on the Wigrip, my wig stays put and feels very secure.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because my friend has one and suggested I give it a try - glad I did.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hairband.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd one and it works perfectly with my lace front wig.  </li>
            <li>I just wish the cost of the product was a bit more affordable.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I use no bobby pins or anything else, and it all stays in place and it a much better experience.  </li>
            <li>It works ok, but after two weeks of wearing it falls apart.</li>
            <li>Love it so much,i am ordering another one.</li>
            <li>Mix in the added challenge of wearing glasses and you can understand why I was looking for SOMETHING to make my costuming easier and more</li>
            <li>So I love the idea of what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more of a comfort issue for me.</li>
            <li>This thing is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Holds wig in place pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most comfortable one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have alopecia, actually long hair that I have to pin up to put a wig on...and this comfortable wigrip holds the wig on perfectly.</li>
            <li>Works good for about 3 hours when I start really</li>
            <li>This is by far the most comfortable and effective band I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li>I would purchase this again as it is easy to use and basically does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>The most comfortable and secure.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better than a full cap.</li>
            <li>It seems I have \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; hair (fine and silky, nothing for the wig cap to grip), so the wig shop said to tease my hair before putting on the wig cap, so it had something to \\&quot;grip\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and that is why I am having to wear a wig and the bobby pins hurt.</li>
            <li>liked it so much that i bought three</li>
            <li>I had one that I received for free when i purchased another wig.  </li>
            <li>I like it cause it doesn&#x27;t hurt your head and also is comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I have not had to make one adjustment to my wig and it feels quite comfortable as well.</li>
            <li>was already familiar with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I bought a cute wig, pinned my hair up, put on a wig cap and pinned the pretty wig on.  </li>
            <li>I feel very secure now when i wear my wigs, thanks to this &amp;#34;wigrip&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It is easy and comfortable to wear but play around with it when you first get it as a little practice at getting it on correctly and then getting the wig on correctly will make for a much more successful day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true,  The wig never, ever moves with this product..</li>
            <li>Sometimes I also need to use adhesive, or some sort of headband to really make sure my wig doesn&#x27;t go anywhere.</li>
            <li>Its great to wear with my hair units (wigs) and holds them in place without using those harsh combs.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear, and kept the wig in place, even on a very windy day.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost-</li>
            <li>All the wispies stay back super easy now!</li>
            <li>right side of the band.</li>
            <li>$20 was pricey for this product, but to be worth it in order to be able to spare the hair I have left from the wig clips and or not to have to use tape or glue.</li>
            <li>On a recent vacation to Disney, I was able to ride all of the rides, even the fastest coasters and my wig never moved when using this band.  </li>
            <li>While it does ride up in the back, it is still much better than having to use clips or any type of adhesives.</li>
            <li>I am a board certified family nurse practitioner like a (PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT), in the medical field seeing patients for many years.</li>
            <li>I used it for scarves, they really keep them up there!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>No matter how many time I whip my hair about or how much extra weight I add to the wig it now stays in place and does not slide off.</li>
            <li>THANKS MILANO!</li>
            <li>I guess a month worth of wearing and washing is tooooo much?  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>A nice alternative to pins, but certainly not infallible.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause any discomfort, and I don&#x27;t have enough of my nature hair to wear hair clips, so i didn&#x27;t have good options prior to this.</li>
            <li>This comfort band does pretty much what it claims -- keeps the wig in place without having to worry about pulling with clips.</li>
            <li>Their wig grips are identical and sell for only $10 which is far more what the grip is worth, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Wish I found this long ago as it&#x27;s remarkably more cool and comfortable than the other options out there.  </li>
            <li>I need large.</li>
            <li>Very well thought out and well made.</li>
            <li>for 20 is too much + shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li>Really holds wig in place  </li>
            <li>I have had to test it in very windy weather and everything stayed where it was supposed to stay.  </li>
            <li>I think anyone wearing a wig could really benefit for this product.  </li>
            <li>My wig really stays in place.</li>
            <li>All of which adds to much pressure and added heat to my head.</li>
            <li>Now everything stays in place, there is no unnecessary pressure, no added wig cap to overheat my head, and my glasses also stay in place.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>She bought a nice wig, but we couldn&#x27;t seem to pin it enough to keep it from slipping up.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a decent head band.</li>
            <li>Save your edges ladies and purchase this little quick fix!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love this little invention.</li>
            <li>I could have bought one near my office in brooklyn for much less.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>This works better than bobbie pins and clips; however, it creeps up the back of my head, along with the wig, so that I still have to adjust the back of the wig on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>The wig feels secure even if I turn my head upside down.  </li>
            <li>I even tried pulling slightly at the wig to see how secure it was.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and holds the wig tightly.  </li>
            <li>Not quite large enough!</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, I either have to take off my wig completely or take it off and fix the wigrip again so it will stay in place.</li>
            <li>What I was doing before caused total hair loss across the front of my head so the hair combs on the wigs really hurt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 4 wigs so far (lace front and non-lace front)</li>
            <li>should as far as wig security.</li>
            <li>It always seemed to ride up up in the back, creating a small bubble effect on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I wish that it would really stay on a bit tighter and not move/ride up in the back, but I can deal with it, if it means not having to use what I mentioned above.</li>
            <li>Those situations typically also involve wearing hats, hair pieces, cyberfalls, or some other heavy attachment to the wig and because I am very dynamic in my movements I typically have to wear a wig cap, use gel and bobby pins on my own short hair, sew in combs or wig clips to the wig, and I still use 2-3 strong large long skinny clips.</li>
            <li>Now knowing how well it works, I would have spent twice as much on this item.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer now after only a few days of wearing this item.  </li>
            <li>This little headband holds onto my fine hair without slipping and without pain.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth almost $20.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and wigs tend to slip off my head.</li>

            <li> wear a lot of wigs during costuming events, cosplay during 10+ hr long conventions, and regular dress code restricted parties/events/clubs.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about it long ago.  </li>
            <li> The Velcro part is really long it fits my largish head with plenty of room to spare.</li>
            <li> I am no longer adjusting my hair all day long!  </li>
            <li> I recently started wearing wigs due to thinning hair in the front and down the middle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a month and haven&#x27;t had a single problem.</li>
            <li> Patients suffering from chemotherapy hair loss because of cancer, women like me with alopecia,hair loss due to female pattern baldness, and women with hair loss due to medications or other health related issues.</li>
            <li> I have a hole in the Wigrip and the stiches are coming loose.</li>
            <li> Also, I would recommend buying a product made the same, but at half the cost, from a website called Wrapunzel.</li>
            <li> I apply the band a little different from the YouTube video because I have very short hair and a lot of wispies to keep slicked down.</li>
            <li> especially if you are wearing a wig everyday.</li>
            <li> Expensive for just one, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a few different bands that claimed to hold wigs in place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those days are clearly in the past now!</li>
            <li> received the wig-grip the other day and could not believe how well it works.</li>
            <li> I can brush my wig with one hand, before I had to use my other hand to hold it in place.</li>
            <li> Then I put my wig and place my glasses over my ears and slightly through the &amp;#34;sideburns&amp;#34; built into the wigs I usually buy so the tail end of my glasses are actually through and under the wig.</li>
            <li> The velcro is too large a piece and makes the band somewhat uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> So what I so is slick back those ends with a little texturing powder and put on the band just over my ears and lower on my neck.</li>
            <li> I order the dark brown one.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 84 year old mom whose hair has become so thin</li>
            <li> So typically I have a throbbing headache in 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> I started wearing a wig every day just a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> This product was a waste of me returning it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few days ago, but I purchased in beige.  </li>
            <li> No more headaches  from making the wig too tight....</li>
            <li> If you have lost your hair, buy wig tape at a wig store and it will keep your wig in place with just a few small pieces strategically placed.</li>
            <li> the wig does not move...and no more itching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a wig every day for the past seven years.</li>
            <li> I had become used to having to adjust my wig at least once a day.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t noticeable to other people, but it drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> Wig caps hurt, pinning my wig to my thinning hair hurt, repinning my wig to my hair was a constant battle and it felt like the stupid thing was sliding off my head all the time.  </li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s thin and flimsy and I haven&#x27;t even washed it</li>
            <li> It is expensive though for what it is.</li>
            <li> I am appaled by the bad quality.</li>
            <li> I feel stupid</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>

            <li> This works better than bobbie pins and clips; however, it creeps up the back of my head, along with the wig, so that I still have to adjust the back of the wig on a regular basis. Works well on front and sides -- feels very secure.</li>
            <li> My wig was always sliding and falling off until I used this band.  It is comfortable and holds the wig tightly.  On a recent vacation to Disney, I was able to ride all of the rides, even the fastest coasters and my wig never moved when using this band.  It even held when swimming in the water parks.  I wear it every day and never have to worry about my wig moving anymore.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this little invention. Its great to wear with my hair units (wigs) and holds them in place without using those harsh combs. My units don&#x27;t shift around like it can when I use the combs. Save your edges ladies and purchase this little quick fix!!</li>
            <li> Holds my wig in pace without combs digging into my scalp</li>
            <li> liked it so much that i bought three</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my friend has one and suggested I give it a try - glad I did. It works really good, for the most part. While it does ride up in the back, it is still much better than having to use clips or any type of adhesives. I wish that it would really stay on a bit tighter and not move/ride up in the back, but I can deal with it, if it means not having to use what I mentioned above. By the end of the day, I either have to take off my wig completely or take it off and fix the wigrip again so it will stay in place. I would purchase this again as it is easy to use and basically does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I am a board certified family nurse practitioner like a (PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT), in the medical field seeing patients for many years. Patients suffering from chemotherapy hair loss because of cancer, women like me with alopecia,hair loss due to female pattern baldness, and women with hair loss due to medications or other health related issues. In my personal review and opinion -DONT BUY THIS MILANO WINGRIP. I read the amazon comments about this product. I watched all the Wingrip how to videos 0n U-tube. $20 was pricey for this product, but to be worth it in order to be able to spare the hair I have left from the wig clips and or not to have to use tape or glue. WIN GRIP DOES NOT WORK! I TRIED EVERYTHING WINGRIP WITH WIGS, SCARFS... slips, falls I would give this a ZERO, Iwill share my opinion with you, my patients and personal friends. perhaps amazon should remove it from being sold on amazon.</li>
            <li> Works great. Holds wig in place pretty good. Only problem is it stretches out after a dozen or so uses.</li>
            <li> I used it for scarves, they really keep them up there!</li>
            <li> As my daughter&#x27;s hair grows back this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that keeps her wig in place. Great product.</li>
            <li> A nice alternative to pins, but certainly not infallible.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most comfortable and effective band I&#x27;ve tried!  Wish I found this long ago as it&#x27;s remarkably more cool and comfortable than the other options out there.  Very well thought out and well made.</li>
            <li> The most comfortable and secure. This one is a must for wig wearers, I own two plan on ordering more ( just in case)...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true,  The wig never, ever moves with this product..I am no longer adjusting my hair all day long!  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hairband.  It&#x27;s the most comfortable one I&#x27;ve ever had.  It doesn&#x27;t move around and your wig stays on all day until you take it off.  It doesn&#x27;t move around, itch, squeeze your head, etc.  I don&#x27;t even need bobby pins to hold it in place.  This is my 2nd one and it works perfectly with my lace front wig.  I order the dark brown one.  I would definitely reccomend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST alternative to wig caps!  It doesn&#x27;t slip.  It doesn&#x27;t squeeze your head.  It doesn&#x27;t leave indentions in your forehead.  It is well worth the cost- especially if you are wearing a wig everyday.</li>
            <li> works like a dream.....nothing moves once you put it on and living in a very warm and humid climate it&#x27;s much better than a full cap.No more headaches  from making the wig too tight....</li>
            <li> too bulky, and did not hold wig well. You can see it on forehead.</li>
            <li> A must have for all wig wearers. Expensive for just one, but worth it. My friends want to purchase too. Highly recommended. Thank you Milano!</li>
            <li> The comfort band is working for me.  I just wish the cost of the product was a bit more affordable.</li>
            <li> It is great I am going to buy another.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  So glad I bought it.  I don&#x27;t have alopecia, actually long hair that I have to pin up to put a wig on...and this comfortable wigrip holds the wig on perfectly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 84 year old mom whose hair has become so thin she is embarrassed to go out.  She bought a nice wig, but we couldn&#x27;t seem to pin it enough to keep it from slipping up.  The Wigrip is doing a great job of keeping her wig in place, and she is happy and confident in her appearance when she goes to church or out to eat.</li>
            <li> Works good for about 3 hours when I start really sweating!&lt;br /&gt;I love it though!</li>
            <li> I had one that I received for free when i purchased another wig.  But it got lost.&lt;br /&gt;I was already familiar with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it if you do not want to lose you hair to wigcombs underneath.&lt;br /&gt;That Being Said- I feel stupid, b/c I misread the item and was under the impression based on the picture that I was going receive 3 for 20$. Which is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;One for 20 is too much + shipping and handling.  I could have bought one near my office in brooklyn for much less.&lt;br /&gt;If you can not get them, then of course this price is worthwhile, but for me, I feel cheated by my own mistake.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was Prompt and in perfect new condition.  So the Seller did as they promised.  Again, my error, not theirs.</li>
            <li> This Wigrip comfort band has been a life saver. I have fine, thin hair and wigs tend to slip off my head. After putting on the Wigrip, my wig stays put and feels very secure. I will be back for another one!!!</li>
            <li> Nice quality, easy to put on.  If unsure of directions, just go to their YouTube video.  Ive only had it 2 days-tried it once with my wig and seems to work. Haven&#x27;t tried it with a scarf yet. Don&#x27;t know if it would hold on a mannequin of someone without hair.</li>
            <li> The velcro is too large a piece and makes the band somewhat uncomfortable. Otherwise it is a decent head band.</li>
            <li> I started wearing a wig every day just a few weeks ago.  (My hair is thinning from blood pressure meds.)  So I bought a cute wig, pinned my hair up, put on a wig cap and pinned the pretty wig on.  It seems I have \\&quot;slippery\\&quot; hair (fine and silky, nothing for the wig cap to grip), so the wig shop said to tease my hair before putting on the wig cap, so it had something to \\&quot;grip\\&quot;.  OMG, such pain after an hour.  Wig caps hurt, pinning my wig to my thinning hair hurt, repinning my wig to my hair was a constant battle and it felt like the stupid thing was sliding off my head all the time.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to take my wig off every night because it HURT.  My scalp was sore every night and it even hurt to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WiGrip has changed all of that.  This little headband holds onto my fine hair without slipping and without pain.  The wig feels secure even if I turn my head upside down.  (Got a cord out from under the desk at work so I know it holds well.)  I am a loyal customer now after only a few days of wearing this item.  THANK YOU for creating this simple, pain-free option.  Brilliant!</li>
            <li> ok but too expensive for what it is which is a simple elastic headband</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of me returning it cause it did nothing like it was suppose to do and returned it</li>
            <li> Not quite large enough! It is med-large size. I need large. Otherwise nice.</li>
            <li> I feel very secure now when i wear my wigs, thanks to this &amp;#34;wigrip&amp;#34; band. It didn&#x27;t cause any discomfort, and I don&#x27;t have enough of my nature hair to wear hair clips, so i didn&#x27;t have good options prior to this.</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing wigs due to thinning hair in the front and down the middle. What I was doing before caused total hair loss across the front of my head so the hair combs on the wigs really hurt. I would go through the day scratching my head and adjusting my wig. I&#x27;ve tried about 4 wigs so far (lace front and non-lace front)...I was miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the wig-grip the other day and could not believe how well it works. I can brush my wig with one hand, before I had to use my other hand to hold it in place. I can even pull clothes over my head...the wig does not move...and no more itching.</li>
            <li> I think this is going to work out great.  Really holds wig in place  I am updating my review because I have realized that I love this product and have found that wearing a wig is not such a difficult thing now that I am using it.  It has been several months now and it makes all the difference to me, where it used to be putting on a wig and using lots of  huge bobby pins to anchor the thing to my head made for a very uncomfortable experience even though I had purchased a gel type band that was supposed to keep my wig in place, it just didn&#x27;t offer much help at all and that was for twice the price I paid for the Wigrip!.  My hair is fine and that is why I am having to wear a wig and the bobby pins hurt. Now simply using the Wigrip I use no bobby pins or anything else, and it all stays in place and it a much better experience.  I have had to test it in very windy weather and everything stayed where it was supposed to stay.  It is easy and comfortable to wear but play around with it when you first get it as a little practice at getting it on correctly and then getting the wig on correctly will make for a much more successful day.  I think anyone wearing a wig could really benefit for this product.  Also I was worried that it would make my head even hotter while wearing the wig but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable! Does hold wig in place!</li>
            <li> Worthless. If you have lost your hair, buy wig tape at a wig store and it will keep your wig in place with just a few small pieces strategically placed.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but after two weeks of wearing it falls apart. I have a hole in the Wigrip and the stiches are coming loose. It&#x27;s just falling apart. I am appaled by the bad quality.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! My wig really stays in place. Love it so much,i am ordering another one. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like it cause it doesn&#x27;t hurt your head and also is comfortable. Only thing was it took me a bit to get the wig over it.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s thin and flimsy and I haven&#x27;t even washed it and it&#x27;s already falling apart. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth almost $20.</li>
            <li> The product works as it is advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear a lot of wigs during costuming events, cosplay during 10+ hr long conventions, and regular dress code restricted parties/events/clubs. Those situations typically also involve wearing hats, hair pieces, cyberfalls, or some other heavy attachment to the wig and because I am very dynamic in my movements I typically have to wear a wig cap, use gel and bobby pins on my own short hair, sew in combs or wig clips to the wig, and I still use 2-3 strong large long skinny clips. Sometimes I also need to use adhesive, or some sort of headband to really make sure my wig doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. All of which adds to much pressure and added heat to my head. So typically I have a throbbing headache in 2-3 hours. Mix in the added challenge of wearing glasses and you can understand why I was looking for SOMETHING to make my costuming easier and more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those days are clearly in the past now! I apply the band a little different from the YouTube video because I have very short hair and a lot of wispies to keep slicked down. So what I so is slick back those ends with a little texturing powder and put on the band just over my ears and lower on my neck. Then I slide the band in position and retighten. Bingo. All the wispies stay back super easy now! Then I put my wig and place my glasses over my ears and slightly through the &amp;#34;sideburns&amp;#34; built into the wigs I usually buy so the tail end of my glasses are actually through and under the wig. Now everything stays in place, there is no unnecessary pressure, no added wig cap to overheat my head, and my glasses also stay in place. No matter how many time I whip my hair about or how much extra weight I add to the wig it now stays in place and does not slide off. THANKS MILANO!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t waste money on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a wig every day for the past seven years. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a few different bands that claimed to hold wigs in place. Inevitably, they would end up shifting by the end of the day. I had become used to having to adjust my wig at least once a day. It always seemed to ride up up in the back, creating a small bubble effect on the top of my head. It wasn&#x27;t noticeable to other people, but it drove me crazy. I received my WiGrip this morning and decided to see how well it lived up to it&#x27;s claim. I&#x27;ve now been wearing it for about 12 hours and I have not had to make one adjustment to my wig and it feels quite comfortable as well. Best of all, the top of my wig is snug against the top of my head. I even tried pulling slightly at the wig to see how secure it was. It didn&#x27;t budge a bit. Now knowing how well it works, I would have spent twice as much on this item. I&#x27;m definitely a fan and will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> So I love the idea of what it is supposed to do and I must say it does that however the quality of it is the problem.  After regular use it is already tearing and seems warn and I have not had it but for a month now.  I guess a month worth of wearing and washing is tooooo much?  Not for the price.</li>
            <li> While keeping my hair piece in place wasn&#x27;t an issue, this band helped as a buffer between the wig and my scalp...so it&#x27;s more of a comfort issue for me. Works like it should as far as wig security.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few days ago, but I purchased in beige.  I did not see the brown color option.  Ordering again today in brown.  This headband worked great!  Comfortable to wear, and kept the wig in place, even on a very windy day.</li>
            <li> This thing is fabulous!  I wish I had known about it long ago.  It seems so simple that you can&#x27;t believe the hype, but believe it.  It really works.  I will buy it again. Every wig wearer should have one!</li>
            <li> I have been warring a wig for over a year since having chemo and the wiggrip is the best  at holding my wig in place.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This comfort band does pretty much what it claims -- keeps the wig in place without having to worry about pulling with clips. Only warning is that if the headband slips on your hair, the wig will move with it.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and haven&#x27;t had a single problem. It doesn&#x27;t stretch out, and is showing no signs of wearing out.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the tag on the outter right side of the band. When wearing a scarf with this product, (which is what I use it for) the tag can be a challenge to hide. Also, I would recommend buying a product made the same, but at half the cost, from a website called Wrapunzel. Their wig grips are identical and sell for only $10 which is far more what the grip is worth, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It works for stopping slippage. It is expensive though for what it is. It&#x27;s literally a velour fabric headband with a Velcro closure. The Velcro part is really long it fits my largish head with plenty of room to spare.</li>
