            <li>The bronzers in this lotion are fantastic!</li>

            <li>so I am glad to have found it here.</li>
            <li>ok meh</li>
            <li>I know many people is going to think that I shouldn&#x27;t put one star if I didn&#x27;t try this product</li>
            <li>even though I sent many e-mails, not even a \\&quot;umm... Sorry?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Give it a try---you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>This has a much better smell than the one I had been using.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I will get the kardashian lotion next as it works perfect on me.</li>
            <li>i think i was mainly in love with the bottle, name and the scent described.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way this lotion feels on my skin and a scent I can deal with after tanning.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re Darker a shot! :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>It also makes your skin super soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today, and I&#x27;m already a lot more tan than I was before!  </li>
            <li>Many people think it smells good, but I think it smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely soft and it smells really nice!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and I can already tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>AND IT GOES ON SO SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li>Definitely a great product and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion 3 times so far, and it&#x27;s been good since the 1st.</li>
            <li>The Spellbound Tanning Lotion does smell great before and after tanning, and the bottle presentation is nice, it&#x27;s just missing something that I cannot put my finger on yet.</li>
            <li>I got mine included free at the salon with my first tanning package, but they don&#x27;t have it any more</li>
            <li>My skin also tans super easy.</li>
            <li>all of those are great, the smell is very floral and the silicon emulsions make your skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I love the the tanning product, makes you brown the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>Give Smile!</li>
            <li>The effect after use is shown very fast, it smells nice and it is so much cheaper buying it this way (saves about 35 euro&#x27;s a bottle!).</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>Oh and it has a soft pleasant smell and leaves the skin very soft, better than lotions.  </li>
            <li>so overall its cute packaging, smells great and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>maybe the fact i dont like the floral smell but overall not bad leaves your skin very silky smooth feeling and a great taning color.</li>
            <li>I love the way I smell when I go tanning thanks to spellbound.</li>
            <li>I love this product and found it really helped accelerate in the tanning salon.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell delicious, it got me back to my sun kissed glow quickly...</li>
            <li>Another nice thing was my tan looks natural and golden</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff because I liked the name, the bottle was pretty, and  wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>lol My results seem to be typical as of now, but gaining color quickly.</li>
            <li>I think there are so many new lotions out now</li>
            <li>the scent is like a soft citrus clean smell it works and is very easy to use without turning colors.. doesnt work as fast as described but it does work</li>
            <li>The very FIRST time I tried this lotion I saw a difference right there in the tanning room while putting my clothes on.</li>
            <li>Rare in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I had never really found a lotion that smelled good AFTER the tanning session was over.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>But this lotion I was not crazy about and will never order again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used way better products so far.</li>
            <li>i have used many other lotions before and have had better and faster results.</li>
            <li>They all seem to work about the same as far as results go (for me anyway, I am fair skinned).</li>
            <li>They work with you very well and respond quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is super creamy and rubs in really well.  </li>
            <li>I naturally can tan easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no George Hamilton, but I don&#x27;t look red any more after my tanning sessions.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>You can still tell it&#x27;s there for sure, but it doesn&#x27;t stink at all allowing me to go back to work the rest of the day without being so paranoid of someone smelling me.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this product for first time tanners.</li>
            <li>and I tan only in top level beds/stand ups.</li>
            <li>I am definitely purcahsing this magical tanning solution again.</li>
            <li>For my 6 years of tanning, this is the one and only lotion I&#x27;ve been satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>This lotion won&#x27;t leave you smelling funny after you tan.</li>
            <li>leaves you extremely soft and smooth like you just shaved!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Finally, I now realize the price of the lotions now dictate the results it creates (most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it makes your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Tanning qualities are very high with this lotion also.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>After i had the baby and was ready to start tanning again, i came accord this lotion on amazon.</li>
            <li>It also left my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>but I would still highly recommend you try it out!</li>
            <li>Feels very silky....</li>
            <li>Plus it works fast.  </li>
            <li>leaves skin smooth but dries it out later leaving it ashy</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It does really glide on</li>
            <li>Well at least it smelt good.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, but this product, along with slow, gradual visits to the tanning bed, have given me the darkest color I have ever achieved.  </li>
            <li>Something wasn&#x27;t right about my bottle, maybe a bit old considering designer skin discontinued this.</li>
            <li>I love this product-doesn&#x27;t smell like the usual tanning lotions, not heavy, just perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>Soon after getting married I became pregnant and had to leave my love of tanning behind.</li>
            <li>(i am blonde hair and green eyes and fair skinned)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>wow! results in 2 days!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny you spend and the smell is simply addicting!</li>
            <li>is such a light lotion/serum it sinks right into the skin yet still leaves it hydrated.</li>
            <li>I used this lotion for 3 weeks with minimal results, I was starting to think I was one of those people that aren&#x27;t able to obtain a tan in a tanning bed....</li>
            <li>You will see results right away, not only in the tanning booth but the natural sun also.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I was red at first</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>it is a little strong, or perfumy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find a good lotion at a decent price that doesn&#x27;t leave you with a streaky, orange result.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to those looking for fast and lasting results!</li>
            <li>I had very limited tanning time this year prior to vacation and was only able to go 10 times.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>It got me dark fast!!</li>
            <li>It also gets me very dark really quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definately gunna go back to buy the cheap stuff at Target because this was a waste of $35.</li>
            <li>and i got a slight golden tan.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, the only problem I had was that my blue ribbon fell off and sometimes plastic cap on the inside comes off so sometimes when I squeeze it out</li>
            <li>I was a huge \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; fanatic through the later part of high school, college, and my engaged relationship.  </li>
            <li>I generally prefer a tingle lotion though, so</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for something to tan fast or even darker then getting a slight color, this one may not be for you.</li>

            <li> Oh and it has a soft pleasant smell and leaves the skin very soft, better than lotions.  </li>
            <li> so overall its cute packaging, smells great and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> maybe the fact i dont like the floral smell but overall not bad leaves your skin very silky smooth feeling and a great taning color.</li>
            <li> I love the way I smell when I go tanning thanks to spellbound.</li>
            <li> I love this product and found it really helped accelerate in the tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it smell delicious, it got me back to my sun kissed glow quickly...</li>
            <li> Another nice thing was my tan looks natural and golden</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because I liked the name, the bottle was pretty, and  wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> lol My results seem to be typical as of now, but gaining color quickly.</li>
            <li> I think there are so many new lotions out now</li>
            <li> the scent is like a soft citrus clean smell it works and is very easy to use without turning colors.. doesnt work as fast as described but it does work</li>
            <li> The very FIRST time I tried this lotion I saw a difference right there in the tanning room while putting my clothes on.</li>
            <li> Rare in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I had never really found a lotion that smelled good AFTER the tanning session was over.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> But this lotion I was not crazy about and will never order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used way better products so far.</li>
            <li> i have used many other lotions before and have had better and faster results.</li>
            <li> They all seem to work about the same as far as results go (for me anyway, I am fair skinned).</li>
            <li> They work with you very well and respond quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is super creamy and rubs in really well.  </li>
            <li> I naturally can tan easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no George Hamilton, but I don&#x27;t look red any more after my tanning sessions.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> You can still tell it&#x27;s there for sure, but it doesn&#x27;t stink at all allowing me to go back to work the rest of the day without being so paranoid of someone smelling me.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product for first time tanners.</li>
            <li> and I tan only in top level beds/stand ups.</li>
            <li> I am definitely purcahsing this magical tanning solution again.</li>
            <li> For my 6 years of tanning, this is the one and only lotion I&#x27;ve been satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> This lotion won&#x27;t leave you smelling funny after you tan.</li>
            <li> leaves you extremely soft and smooth like you just shaved!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Finally, I now realize the price of the lotions now dictate the results it creates (most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it makes your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Tanning qualities are very high with this lotion also.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After i had the baby and was ready to start tanning again, i came accord this lotion on amazon.</li>
            <li> It also left my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> but I would still highly recommend you try it out!</li>
            <li> Feels very silky....</li>
            <li> Plus it works fast.  </li>
            <li> leaves skin smooth but dries it out later leaving it ashy</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It does really glide on</li>
            <li> Well at least it smelt good.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned, but this product, along with slow, gradual visits to the tanning bed, have given me the darkest color I have ever achieved.  </li>
            <li> Something wasn&#x27;t right about my bottle, maybe a bit old considering designer skin discontinued this.</li>
            <li> I love this product-doesn&#x27;t smell like the usual tanning lotions, not heavy, just perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> Soon after getting married I became pregnant and had to leave my love of tanning behind.</li>
            <li> (i am blonde hair and green eyes and fair skinned)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> wow! results in 2 days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny you spend and the smell is simply addicting!</li>
            <li> is such a light lotion/serum it sinks right into the skin yet still leaves it hydrated.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for 3 weeks with minimal results, I was starting to think I was one of those people that aren&#x27;t able to obtain a tan in a tanning bed....</li>
            <li> You will see results right away, not only in the tanning booth but the natural sun also.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was red at first</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> it is a little strong, or perfumy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a good lotion at a decent price that doesn&#x27;t leave you with a streaky, orange result.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to those looking for fast and lasting results!</li>
            <li> I had very limited tanning time this year prior to vacation and was only able to go 10 times.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> It got me dark fast!!</li>
            <li> It also gets me very dark really quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definately gunna go back to buy the cheap stuff at Target because this was a waste of $35.</li>
            <li> and i got a slight golden tan.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, the only problem I had was that my blue ribbon fell off and sometimes plastic cap on the inside comes off so sometimes when I squeeze it out</li>
            <li> I was a huge \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; fanatic through the later part of high school, college, and my engaged relationship.  </li>
            <li> I generally prefer a tingle lotion though, so</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for something to tan fast or even darker then getting a slight color, this one may not be for you.</li>
            <li> after you use it, you dont have that horrible smell either, it actually smells pretty good</li>
            <li> I normally would have to lay out everyday for about a week to get the same results.  </li>
            <li> Okay so i bought this the other day and needless to say i will never buy another brand of tanning lotion again.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not stink like other lotions do.</li>
            <li> Smells the same, feels the same, until you apply it, it rubs of in little rolled up lotion lines?</li>
            <li> but people should be aware that this seller sucks !,</li>
            <li> I do not use tanning beds, I tan outdoors and am very pale, nearly albino after winter.  </li>
            <li> but I was told by the tanning staff to ignore the redness that it was suppose to make me a little red as it has properties that bring oxygen to the skin to tan.</li>
            <li> since I have a olive-like skin complexion; however, I am a white male in my late 20s born in Kansas.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after a few sessions of only 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a fancy tanning bed, just a plain jane low end bed</li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> My skin got really dark.</li>
            <li> but I also don&#x27;t get dark.</li>
            <li> The only negative....</li>
            <li> If anything I feel like I&#x27;m not getting dark at all.</li>
            <li> the only complaint i have it the strength of the product.</li>
            <li> The ONLY complaint I have is that when you screw off the lid the part of the bottle where the lotion is supposed to come out, also comes off.</li>
            <li> This gets u dark for tannin beds</li>
            <li> Even with shipping and handling, i paid half of what it would have cost me before taxes at the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> so get this shit werks if ya tryna get dark..</li>
            <li> I use this stuff for the feel and the little bit of bronzing color even without sun...  </li>
            <li> it just gave me a little color.</li>
            <li> Does not get you very dark.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I wasted my time, money, and skin on spellbound...</li>
            <li> It does not have a heavy scent which is a plus factor.</li>
            <li> 3 Stars were given to this product for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> after one month and a half I didn&#x27;t get my product at all !</li>
            <li> so it doesnt make you feel uncomfortable if youre unable to go home and take a shower right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky, it&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
            <li> if not better</li>
            <li> I have used Designer Skin products in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually use a tanning product with tingle</li>
            <li> ( and i have tried quit q few!)</li>
            <li> Used it on hard to tan places and noticed a gradual difference.</li>
            <li> I am a very dark tan!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mediocre, nothing compared to when I purchased it out of a designer skin retailer.</li>
            <li> I was sad to see it didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a mediocre bronzer.</li>
            <li> It also broke me out SO BAD, which hasn&#x27;t ever happened before.</li>
            <li> I normally hate tanning bed lotions because of how they smell afterwards, like burnt lotion.</li>

            <li> FAVORITE SUNTAN LOTION. GREAT SMELL AND IT GOES ON SO SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li> Has a great smell. Leaves your skin soft. Used it on hard to tan places and noticed a gradual difference. It does say only 4x and that&#x27;s probably what it is. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it and will continue to. If I purchase again I might go for a deeper tanning solution.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned, but this product, along with slow, gradual visits to the tanning bed, have given me the darkest color I have ever achieved.  I&#x27;m no George Hamilton, but I don&#x27;t look red any more after my tanning sessions.  This product will not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I&#x27;ve been tanning for about two weeks now and I&#x27;m already seeing a huge difference. The bronzers in this lotion are fantastic! They aren&#x27;t streaky at all! I would recommend this product to anyone who is either just beginning to tan or already has a nice color. It works well for either level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion 3 times so far, and it&#x27;s been good since the 1st. It smells great! And after I tan there&#x27;s no nasty tan lotion after smell. You can still tell it&#x27;s there for sure, but it doesn&#x27;t stink at all allowing me to go back to work the rest of the day without being so paranoid of someone smelling me. lol My results seem to be typical as of now, but gaining color quickly. Over all this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I had tried several several lotions before this one and found that it took longer to see results.  The very FIRST time I tried this lotion I saw a difference right there in the tanning room while putting my clothes on. Since the store didn&#x27;t have the product anymore, I went on line to buy this because the one I bought that was suppose to be sooo great was not as great as Spellbound.  I highly recommend it to those looking for fast and lasting results!</li>
            <li> I love the the tanning product, makes you brown the first time you use it.  If you have a had time getting tan, this product will give you a nice brown tan. Pam Riley</li>
            <li> Out of all the tanning bed lotions I have tried, this one feels best on my skin - very moisturizing but light. Smells nice, too. They all seem to work about the same as far as results go (for me anyway, I am fair skinned). I got mine included free at the salon with my first tanning package, but they don&#x27;t have it any more so I am glad to have found it here. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff for the feel and the little bit of bronzing color even without sun...  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today, and I&#x27;m already a lot more tan than I was before!  My skin is extremely soft and it smells really nice!</li>
            <li> I paid 70 dollars for this lotion in a tanning salon. And I was very happy with it. My skin got really dark. And it smells fantasic. Almost like Ralph Lauren perfume... Or Paris Hilton Twilight... I generally prefer a tingle lotion though, so now im using a lotion called Siren. But they stopped making it. So i tried Smolder. And its also a really great lotion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this tanning lotion on Friday and received it on Monday. Lotion smells great and works! I would definitely recommend it to anyone else. It has a very nice fragrance to it. Definitely does not stink like other lotions do.</li>
            <li> I would reccommend this seller for excellent service and products. I recvd&#x27; purchased items promptly and the product was as good as the enticement to buy it said! Rare in my opinion. Will buy again this product and others from this seller.</li>
            <li> Something wasn&#x27;t right about my bottle, maybe a bit old considering designer skin discontinued this. Smells the same, feels the same, until you apply it, it rubs of in little rolled up lotion lines? If that makes descriptive sense. Works ok meh it&#x27;s mediocre, nothing compared to when I purchased it out of a designer skin retailer.</li>
            <li> like this product smells nice and great in tanning booths gives great color</li>
            <li> Yes ! I know many people is going to think that I shouldn&#x27;t put one star if I didn&#x27;t try this product but people should be aware that this seller sucks !, after one month and a half I didn&#x27;t get my product at all ! even though I sent many e-mails, not even a \\&quot;umm... Sorry?\\&quot;. Thank God Amazon policies are awesome and we can rely on them in case that a crappy seller like this guy does stuff like this.</li>
            <li> THis product smells so good! I was a huge \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; fanatic through the later part of high school, college, and my engaged relationship.  I used all kinds of lotions that would help get me tanned faster. I had never really found a lotion that smelled good AFTER the tanning session was over. The majority of them smelled made me smell like burnt hair.  Soon after getting married I became pregnant and had to leave my love of tanning behind. After i had the baby and was ready to start tanning again, i came accord this lotion on amazon. After reading the reviews that it smelled good, i decided to try it. AND IT DOES! my husband will even complements my \\&quot;smell\\&quot; after i have been to the gym and tanning.. i guess this one is a keeper! Not only does it smell delicious, it got me back to my sun kissed glow quickly... keep i mind i handed tanned in over a year.</li>
            <li> They work with you very well and respond quickly.  The product was as described and is a wonderful product!  Thank you for your services!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hispanic but never have tanned well. I don&#x27;t burn either but I also don&#x27;t get dark. I bought this product because it had good ratings and gave it a try. It&#x27;s not sticky, it&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. It got me dark fast!! I could tell the difference after one session. I was red at first but I was told by the tanning staff to ignore the redness that it was suppose to make me a little red as it has properties that bring oxygen to the skin to tan. I don&#x27;t use a fancy tanning bed, just a plain jane low end bed and I&#x27;m the darkest I have ever been in my entire life and I&#x27;m from the tropics so that&#x27;s saying a lot. It leaves my skin super smooth. I would reccomend this product for first time tanners.</li>
            <li> great lotion except had a strong smell caused me a headache maybe the fact i dont like the floral smell but overall not bad leaves your skin very silky smooth feeling and a great taning color.I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the price, not to mention the wonderful smell-this is by far the best product I have ever used for tanning.  I do not tan well and this stuff is great!  i will purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> Great lotion to start out with!  Smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky.  Will buy again.  I highly recommend it. Give it a try---you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> is such a light lotion/serum it sinks right into the skin yet still leaves it hydrated. I defiantly got tanner while using this lotion. It also left my skin hydrated and smooth. I think there are so many new lotions out now that are just as good if not better so I wouldnt repurchase but I would still highly recommend you try it out!</li>
            <li> I love this product-doesn&#x27;t smell like the usual tanning lotions, not heavy, just perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended to me by a friend who owns a tanning salon. I have used Designer Skin products in the past. This has a much better smell than the one I had been using. Tanning qualities are very high with this lotion also.</li>
            <li> Even with shipping and handling, i paid half of what it would have cost me before taxes at the tanning bed. after you use it, you dont have that horrible smell either, it actually smells pretty good so it doesnt make you feel uncomfortable if youre unable to go home and take a shower right away.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is amazing and the seller I bought it from Shop Wars was amazing with the delivery time and the product was perfectly in tact. I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Buying on here saved me $25 dollars! That is even considering this lotion, where I tan, is on SALE! At regular price, there is a difference of $50! WOW! I will NEVER buy at the tanning salon again, that&#x27;s for sure!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great! Feels very silky....nice. The only negative....it is a little strong, or perfumy.</li>
            <li> I normally hate tanning bed lotions because of how they smell afterwards, like burnt lotion. This smells great even afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It smells good so I can use it then go about my day.  It is super creamy and rubs in really well.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.  Plus it works fast.  I noticed a difference after a few sessions of only 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> so maybe it is because i&#x27;m VERY white, but it didn&#x27;t seem to me that this lotion worked at all. it did however make me smell delightful.    other than that, i wasn&#x27;t happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell. leaves skin smooth but dries it out later leaving it ashy so I constantly have to apply body lotion on. Does not get you very dark. I am a big tanner and I tan only in top level beds/stand ups. My skin also tans super easy. But this lotion I was not crazy about and will never order again. I will get the kardashian lotion next as it works perfect on me. I won&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a waste of money. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now using the same tanning bed I&#x27;ve always used and I feel like I&#x27;m not getting any darker then I use too. If anything I feel like I&#x27;m not getting dark at all. I&#x27;m definately gunna go back to buy the cheap stuff at Target because this was a waste of $35.</li>
            <li> after seeing this lotion everywhere, i finally decided to purchase it. i think i was mainly in love with the bottle, name and the scent described. all of those are great, the smell is very floral and the silicon emulsions make your skin feel very soft. the packaging is cute and the bottle is a good size. the only complaint i have it the strength of the product. i have used many other lotions before and have had better and faster results. i tanned for 3 months, about 3 days a week and i got a slight golden tan. it just gave me a little color. (i am blonde hair and green eyes and fair skinned) the back of the bottle says its categorized as a &amp;#34;booster&amp;#34; too.... i wouldn&#x27;t classify it as that. so overall its cute packaging, smells great and leaves skin very soft. but if you are looking for something to tan fast or even darker then getting a slight color, this one may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really works. The ONLY complaint I have is that when you screw off the lid the part of the bottle where the lotion is supposed to come out, also comes off. I have only used it a few times and I can already tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This gets u dark for tannin beds nshit cus I&#x27;m a dude not tryna lay outmy front yard like a tool so get this shit werks if ya tryna get dark..</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for 3 weeks with minimal results, I was starting to think I was one of those people that aren&#x27;t able to obtain a tan in a tanning bed.... then I got worship me... and wow! results in 2 days! I couldn&#x27;t believe I wasted my time, money, and skin on spellbound... I was sad to see it didn&#x27;t work... I wish it would have. Well at least it smelt good.</li>
            <li> I do not use tanning beds, I tan outdoors and am very pale, nearly albino after winter.  After putting this on I laid out 35-40 minutes on each side and was blown away.  I normally would have to lay out everyday for about a week to get the same results.  Another nice thing was my tan looks natural and golden and I didn&#x27;t burn, I just tanned.  This has revolutionized my sun-bathing experieince.  Oh and it has a soft pleasant smell and leaves the skin very soft, better than lotions.  I am definitely purcahsing this magical tanning solution again.</li>
            <li> For my 6 years of tanning, this is the one and only lotion I&#x27;ve been satisfied with.  It&#x27;s worth every penny you spend and the smell is simply addicting!</li>
            <li> This is a bronze rand sun tan lotion in one bottle. Great smell and it works out of this world.</li>
            <li> This lotion won&#x27;t leave you smelling funny after you tan. It leaves your skin feeling silky and your tan will look amazing!!</li>
            <li> The effect after use is shown very fast, it smells nice and it is so much cheaper buying it this way (saves about 35 euro&#x27;s a bottle!). Best regards from Holland!</li>
            <li> I love the way I smell when I go tanning thanks to spellbound. The shipping was fast, the only problem I had was that my blue ribbon fell off and sometimes plastic cap on the inside comes off so sometimes when I squeeze it out, I get a lot of lotion. It does really glide on you body very smooth and it makes your skin super soft. Definitely a great product and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Okay so i bought this the other day and needless to say i will never buy another brand of tanning lotion again. I am set on using this brand only for now one because the way it makes your skin look, feel, and smell.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves you extremely soft and smooth like you just shaved!&lt;br /&gt;I used it one time and it made me 2 shades darker than what the Snooki tanning lotion did&lt;br /&gt;also the smell is great when you get out of the tanning bed you don&#x27;t feel like you smell like a tanning bed. Im very happy with this and i will defiantly buy more/ try different kinds</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this lotion feels on my skin and a scent I can deal with after tanning. I just started using it and am looking forward to my next tanning session.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because I liked the name, the bottle was pretty, and  wanted to try something new. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. Many people think it smells good, but I think it smells like old lady perfume. It also broke me out SO BAD, which hasn&#x27;t ever happened before. It&#x27;s also a mediocre bronzer. I&#x27;ve used way better products so far. Give Smile! You&#x27;re Darker a shot! :)</li>
            <li> very beautiful bottle and the scent is like a soft citrus clean smell it works and is very easy to use without turning colors.. doesnt work as fast as described but it does work</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. The smell is good, it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you just got lubed.  I would recommend this lotion.  You will see results right away, not only in the tanning booth but the natural sun also.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this product and found it really helped accelerate in the tanning salon.  It also makes your skin super soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li> They lotion actually seemed to cause me to lose my tan. I dont know why? I usually use a tanning product with tingle so i dont know if it had anything to do with it. After purching this i used for about 2 weeks and was getting lighten instead of darker. I went to Sallys and purchased a bottle of lotion for $10 and it works great!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It does not have a heavy scent which is a plus factor. I had very limited tanning time this year prior to vacation and was only able to go 10 times. I am a very dark tan!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion. It smells amazing! It also gets me very dark really quick. I haven&#x27;t used this in years, but I do remember how great it was, and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased by far! It&#x27;s difficult to find a good lotion at a decent price that doesn&#x27;t leave you with a streaky, orange result. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and feels on my skin! Best lotion i have ever tried( and i have tried quit q few!)</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel silky, not sticky.  It speeds up tanning evenly. Love it . Use it as often as I can.</li>
            <li> 3 Stars were given to this product for a few reasons. I naturally can tan easy since I have a olive-like skin complexion; however, I am a white male in my late 20s born in Kansas. I have not gotten any noticeably darker in the 3 weeks I have been using it, as my wife has asked me recently if I had been. The Spellbound Tanning Lotion does smell great before and after tanning, and the bottle presentation is nice, it&#x27;s just missing something that I cannot put my finger on yet. Finally, I now realize the price of the lotions now dictate the results it creates (most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I still have some lotion left, I will add on my final thoughts for this product, but will probably not be buying this product again.</li>
