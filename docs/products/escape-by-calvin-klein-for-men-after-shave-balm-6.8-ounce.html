            <li> This product has been discountinued by Calvin Klein. This as you can imagine is now very difficult to find. MY wife is just crazy about the scent and I like how it makes my skin feel after shaving. I save my entire head and use this product on my entire head. I makes my skin shine like I polished it with a buffer. What is the saying about life......Oh Yea...Happy wife,  happy life.....</li>
            <li> I choose this product because of it&#x27;s name but was very disappointed. I have other Calvin Klein products which I liked. I&#x27;d not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the Fragrance, have been using for years along with eternity my favorites by far, thank you Calvin Klein your products are outstanding.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Escape Balm recently from Amazon and I thought I was getting a great deal. They are selling it at half of the price of local stores. This item that arrived was either old or counterfeit.     Unfortunately when I received the product the tube looks old and the balm smelled like paint! The tube is supposed to be white and arrived yellowed at the top like it was displayed in the sun.     I put some of the balm in my hands and could tell immediately that this was either defective or counterfeit. It really smelled bad. I am shipping it back. Please be careful if you order this product and be prepared to return it.</li>
            <li> DISSAPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. THE SMELL IS TOO STRONG. IT REMINDS ME OF CHEAPER CALOGNE. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> A little watery, but smells nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who has used this product for years and says it is hard to find. thank you for your fast service</li>
            <li> Thanks for the Fast Service. Great I use it today</li>
            <li> was a knockout, returned it</li>
            <li> I know that this scent has been around for quite awhile but there&#x27;s a good reason for that. It&#x27;s fabulous. This creamy balm just feels right.</li>
            <li> Exceptional fragrance product!</li>
            <li> What can I say -- Escape smells great, my husband loves it, and I love it on him. He prefers using the Balm over an alcohol product because it is very soothing on a freshly shaved face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use after shave products with alcohol in them because they irritate my skin.  I have tried many after shave balms and like Calvin Kline the best.  They are, of course a little expensive, so this purchase from Amazon was a very, very good buy.</li>
            <li> Except it was to much money for what you got</li>
            <li> Nice feel not overpowering fragrance, could use a little more fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.  Would recomment&#x3D;d it for daytime wear but need something stronger for evening wear.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for men with sensitive skin.  Most of the stores stopped carrying it in our area - just glad to find it on-line.</li>
            <li> It has a good feel,It keeps my skin smooth and I believe It helps protect from the every dayRays of the Sun.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance. Does good job of moisturizing after sharing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.You cannot beat the price. Product was received in a timely manner. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Smells very good on my husband. (You never know when your buying a fragrance blind) Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and comes in a good quantity.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe this doesn&#x27;t have higher rating. It will last you years because it only takes a dime size amount to cover your face. It smells great and get tons of compliments; i do suggest airing out for 30 min to hour after use due to it is very strong scent and if overly used or immediate meeting anyone it will smell like you sprayed cologne on not mist and walk through. I&#x27;ve bought for gifts to others and for myself. Two tubes has lasted me years. Even not using as balm a little dab on your clothes is better than cologne and lasts all day. LET ME SAY THIS \\&quot;I don&#x27;t wear cologne and generally don&#x27;t want to smell good or bad but this i like and do wear\\&quot;</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, SO GLAD WE ARE ABLE TO BUY AS NEEDED</li>
