            <li>I make my own hand cream.  </li>
            <li>Love this mango butter:)!</li>
            <li>and it is very smooth, melts and then cools well.</li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>but thats ok.</li>
            <li>This product had my favorite packaging.</li>
            <li>The mango butter was very smooth and absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every other day, and it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Melts easily without a grainy feeling</li>
            <li>The product itself is so easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t know why you would purchase mango butter and want it to be gritty, but I think it would make a great scrub if you add some sea salt or sugar.</li>
            <li>Other than that great stuff just pakaging could be better.</li>
            <li>So far very satisfied and will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li>This is a great quality natural organic very mostorizing Mango butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really healthy for your skin, which is the main reason I got it.</li>
            <li>This shipped fine, but the texture was very grainy, even after melting and blending for lip balm and body butter.</li>
            <li>Love how it melts in my hands and does wonders for my natural hair type 4-c</li>
            <li>I love anything thats natural.</li>
            <li>I love it so much better than shea butter in the lotions I make because it is moisturizing without being greasy and has such a soft scent.  </li>
            <li>but was expecting more of a mango fragrance and that would be a little more like a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>Wrapped up tight for freshness and made a good whipped butter.</li>
            <li>This Raw Mango Butter makes my hair smell amazing!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap.</li>
            <li>This is my first order of mango butter.  </li>
            <li>soft and rich in moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is described as 1 lb/16 oz pure mango butter.  </li>
            <li>pure mango butter smells like absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Odorless and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li>I give this 5 stars because the wait time to receive the mango butter was fast.  </li>
            <li>I had been using shea butter to make my body butters, but it seems like the mango butter is so much softer.  </li>
            <li>It also hardened back up after letting it sit in the fridge for awhile stayed that way at room temperature, and it maintained the smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>But overall not bad product in the end</li>
            <li>It is difficult to warm and smooth out for skin, hair.</li>
            <li>I live in Las Vegas, and my family</li>
            <li>(it does not smell like mango, but it has a nice, subtle smell).  </li>
            <li>i actually bought this particular one for black jar as i thought it would heat in sun better, but it came in a clear jar-</li>
            <li>It might be pure but it definitely is not 1 lb.  </li>
            <li>Product not as consistent as pervious orders, looking more for a raw rough texture.</li>
            <li>I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it also had the naturally occurring mango butter scent...</li>
            <li>very slight and sweet</li>
            <li>Okay this is very hard to rub into hair or skin.</li>
            <li>Took me a while to choose one since many reviewers complained about the smell for other brands (even for those that had high reviews).  </li>
            <li>But, please be a little more professional, the label lists raw and organic mango butter, I doubt that these are the only ingredients.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin sooo soft and repairs any dry skin that I have.  </li>

            <li> Makes my skin sooo soft and repairs any dry skin that I have.  </li>
            <li> It comes in an amber colored container with a professional looking label (a lot of times when purchasing &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; butters and such from online, the packaging is a little bit sketchy and looks like the labels were created in Microsoft Paint... not the case here).</li>
            <li> and I have a problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> So, I set out to make a moisturizing soap for us that wouldn&#x27;t dry out our skin.</li>
            <li> I had to melt it down to use it, and it still maintained that very grainy and dried out texture after being melted down and used.</li>
            <li> This item was not high quality.</li>
            <li> I melted it down with different combinations of the other butters that I bought and it was one of the easiest to melt.</li>
            <li> When I got the butter, the container said 16 fl oz which is a lot less than a lb of mango butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused why it got low ratings from other buyers, but to disprove their reviews, it is indeed 16 oz of product, and 16 oz &#x3D; 1 lb.</li>
            <li> The container seemed a little under-filled, and the mango butter was dried out and grainy.</li>
            <li> that its organic raw and unrefined</li>
            <li> I mix it with shea butter and carrier oils or use it raw either way my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> The businesses that are at home are the heart of small business in this country.</li>
            <li> I use this product to protect wooden bowls, the underside of my oak cutting board, my desk and me!</li>
            <li> Silly me to think this product was going to smell like mango...</li>
            <li> My family suffers with ezema</li>

            <li> Great quality. Melts easily without a grainy feeling</li>
            <li> Love this mango butter:)!</li>
            <li> I use it to make homemade lotions.  Really nice product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I use it in my lip gloss and I get lots of compliments when I give it to friends.  I will definitely purchase again and recommend it to others.  In fact I already have.</li>
            <li> I made multiple versions of body butter with this and it is very smooth, melts and then cools well. Odorless and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This item was not high quality. The container seemed a little under-filled, and the mango butter was dried out and grainy. I had to melt it down to use it, and it still maintained that very grainy and dried out texture after being melted down and used. I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and I got it. Wrapped up tight for freshness and made a good whipped butter. Pleased. Thanks</li>
            <li> I really love it! but was expecting more of a mango fragrance and that would be a little more like a bar of soap. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap. I live in Las Vegas, and my family and I have a problem with dry skin. So, I set out to make a moisturizing soap for us that wouldn&#x27;t dry out our skin. Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li> Silly me to think this product was going to smell like mango...lol&lt;br /&gt;Real pure mango butter smells like absolutely nothing. Love how it melts in my hands and does wonders for my natural hair type 4-c</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because the wait time to receive the mango butter was fast.  The product itself is so easy to work with.  I love it so much better than shea butter in the lotions I make because it is moisturizing without being greasy and has such a soft scent.  Not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Product not as consistent as pervious orders, looking more for a raw rough texture. But overall not bad product in the end</li>
            <li> I had been using shea butter to make my body butters, but it seems like the mango butter is so much softer.  I think I&#x27;ll be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> it does not have a smell- hoped it would have a fruit essence. i actually bought this particular one for black jar as i thought it would heat in sun better, but it came in a clear jar- i could have bought a smaller one elsewhere to try. i put in my dash to melt.</li>
            <li> I received the Mango butter in a timely manner, no problems there, but when I opened it to my surprise it is not creamy like the pic. It contain an additive that is coarse and grainy. It is difficult to warm and smooth out for skin, hair. The businesses that are at home are the heart of small business in this country. But, please be a little more professional, the label lists raw and organic mango butter, I doubt that these are the only ingredients.</li>
            <li> the mango butter was amazing in quality.&lt;br /&gt;was soft and rich in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;loved that its organic raw and unrefined&lt;br /&gt;it also had the naturally occurring mango butter scent...very slight and sweet (but it does not and should not smell like mangoes)</li>
            <li> Good butter for massage or body care.</li>
            <li> It is described as 1 lb/16 oz pure mango butter.  It might be pure but it definitely is not 1 lb.  When I got the butter, the container said 16 fl oz which is a lot less than a lb of mango butter.</li>
            <li> This is my first order of mango butter.  Took me a while to choose one since many reviewers complained about the smell for other brands (even for those that had high reviews).  This one arrived quickly and it smells very good (it does not smell like mango, but it has a nice, subtle smell).  It came in a solid plastic jar.  So far very satisfied and will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love anything thats natural.This is a great quality natural organic very mostorizing Mango butter. My family suffers with ezema so our skin always begging for moisture. I mix it with shea butter and carrier oils or use it raw either way my skin loves it. This butter takes a while to melt in my hands but thats ok. The only con is the plastic container it come with the plastic started to chip into my mango butter and its not sealed correctly. Other than that great stuff just pakaging could be better.</li>
            <li> This Raw Mango Butter makes my hair smell amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it every other day, and it&#x27;s an awesome product. My girlfriend loves the smell of it as well. It&#x27;s also really healthy for your skin, which is the main reason I got it. Shipped super fast. Definitely a must have for any bathroom!</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with coconut oil, cocoa butter, and shea butter, all from different sellers. This product had my favorite packaging. It comes in an amber colored container with a professional looking label (a lot of times when purchasing &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; butters and such from online, the packaging is a little bit sketchy and looks like the labels were created in Microsoft Paint... not the case here). The mango butter was very smooth and absorbs easily into the skin. I have no complaints. I melted it down with different combinations of the other butters that I bought and it was one of the easiest to melt. It also hardened back up after letting it sit in the fridge for awhile stayed that way at room temperature, and it maintained the smooth consistency. I&#x27;m confused why it got low ratings from other buyers, but to disprove their reviews, it is indeed 16 oz of product, and 16 oz &#x3D; 1 lb. And I don&#x27;t know why you would purchase mango butter and want it to be gritty, but I think it would make a great scrub if you add some sea salt or sugar.</li>
            <li> Okay this is very hard to rub into hair or skin. If anything I would just mix it into a homemade deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> This worked great in lotion bars.</li>
            <li> I make my own hand cream.  I like the freshness of this butter</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing to use in products or just by itself.  Makes my skin sooo soft and repairs any dry skin that I have.  I will buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> This shipped fine, but the texture was very grainy, even after melting and blending for lip balm and body butter. I have bought once before and did not experience this same problem. This batch must have been processed differently prior to shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this butter its great</li>
            <li> Ecellent product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I use this product to protect wooden bowls, the underside of my oak cutting board, my desk and me!</li>
