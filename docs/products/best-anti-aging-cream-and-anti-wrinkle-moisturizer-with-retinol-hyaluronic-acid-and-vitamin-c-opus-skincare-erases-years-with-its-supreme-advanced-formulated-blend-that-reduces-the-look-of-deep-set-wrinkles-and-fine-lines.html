            <li>So far, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>The best part is that my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>Another thing I want to touch on is the scent, it is very light.</li>
            <li>It is great on my combination skin, absorbs quickly without oily residue and has softened, and/or eliminated some of my fine lines.</li>
            <li>and I surely can see a difference in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I know the ingredients in this moisturizer have many beneficial properties.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love to golf and garden.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely nightcream.  </li>
            <li>Skin appears softer, more supple.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many creams, lotions and potions in my day.</li>
            <li>Impressed overall.</li>
            <li>I received this product in a timely manner and have been pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Cream is ok.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that you use it morning and night.</li>
            <li>Having older skin, I have tried many to relieve dryness and look more youthful and this cream is doing  great for me.</li>
            <li>So happy I went out of my comfort zone to try something new!</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty good</li>
            <li>I’m pleased to recommend this fabulous product to all.</li>
            <li>I received the Anti-wrinkle cream very quickly.</li>
            <li>I feel it improves my apperance by tightning and therefore reducing fine lines for a smoother apperance.  </li>
            <li>It is silky smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>but my skin feels smooth</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my laugh lines are not as prominent.  </li>
            <li>Both of these products come in pump dispenser type bottle, so one pump of each mixed together works great.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>First of all it came with a &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; pump, there was just a top but no tube going into the cream to allow it to be pushed out.</li>
            <li>I do not usually subscribe to these products but took a chance because of the great reviews and reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>We will be ordering more in the future for sure!</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for normal to dry skin types and great for normal to oily skin types to use as a night cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using for nearly a month now, and have been pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products and found this one by far to be the best, been using it for several weeks and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>and I look great so long as I don&#x27;t smile too wide, (LOL.)</li>
            <li>I love this new night cream!  </li>
            <li>I guess my chemistry or skin type just doesn&#x27;t respond quickly.  </li>
            <li>Will need more time to see if there is a marked difference in skin appearance over time.</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthier and my smile lines around my eyes have soften.</li>
            <li>I love this new night cream so much that I have also been using it in the day.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer was the immediate hydration and softness to my skin.</li>
            <li>The first night I put this moisturizer on my face</li>
            <li>My skin seemed smoother &amp; softer after the first week.</li>
            <li>Most facial products either cause a reaction on my skin or breakouts.  </li>
            <li>My entire life I have struggled with finding a moisturizing cream that does not leave my skin oily, so for the most part I have just gone without.</li>
            <li>With Opus skincare, my face looks fresher, younger and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>Those fine lines are softening and starting to disappear.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>My daughter likes the cream itself, but will end up wasting a lot of it as she cannot get much out without the pump.</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid really works.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and the product stands up to its claims.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping to be &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; by this product, but after 7 weeks I see no results yet.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s really working on the wrinkles and firmness.</li>
            <li>Have used it for 6 weeks --haven&#x27;t seen much change in my skin</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have used Opus for a couple weeks now, and haven&#x27;t seen much improvement.</li>
            <li>Too much may result in oiliness.</li>
            <li>i really like it,good product,ill buy again.</li>
            <li>This was good product it took the whole bottle to see results so for me it was a bit slow.</li>
            <li>Not sure it has done a great job on wrinkles yet (have only been using about a week), but skin is softer and like the consistency of the product.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s possible this will be just fine for you.</li>
            <li>I’m 50ish and have noticed a mysterious disappearance of many of my dreaded facial lines.  </li>
            <li>I intend to continue using this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>works really well to hydrate and smooth out little wrinkles without</li>
            <li>The first morning after putting Opus Elite on I saw a big reduction in my pores.</li>
            <li>My pores are shrinking, and my skin feels smooth and tight.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>As a skin care professional</li>
            <li>Got a complete breakout from this.</li>
            <li>I am 27 years old and do not have any wrinkles (that I notice); however, I chose to use this cream for firming and preventing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and feels tighter.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product</li>
            <li>This product has not caused any extra redness and I have not broken out from it.</li>
            <li>No mess and No waste...</li>
            <li>I have been battle large pores for a long time.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased to say that my skin is no longer dry, and a lot less oily!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what is expected.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be disappointed, get ready for beautiful younger looking skin!</li>
            <li>I am blessed with minimal lines and large pores.</li>
            <li>I am 45 yrs old and starting to show signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>The next morning my skin felt very soft and my pours looked smaller.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a little exfoliation in the mornings, so maybe with a little more use.....</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product as other products I have used have dried out my skin or did not glide on with easy.  </li>
            <li>Also the cream seems old and dry.</li>
            <li>I have not yet used this regularly (still using other products) but I just want to say that I have very sensitive skin, rosacea, etc.</li>

            <li> I would definitely recommend this product as other products I have used have dried out my skin or did not glide on with easy.  </li>
            <li> Also the cream seems old and dry.</li>

            <li> I have combination skin that gets dry and oily at the same time</li>
            <li> The crazy thing is, my skin seems to be balancing the more I use this product.</li>
            <li> This is in a bottom, but a cream and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> All the skin care products that you can end up spending a lot of money on, such as under eye , dark spots , wrinkles, is all wrapped up in this one product.</li>

            <li> I will continue to use it until the container is empty.  </li>
            <li> Definitely big box results with little box price!</li>
            <li> I was also starting to see small lines forming around my lips and eyes.  </li>

            <li> It has never made my skin feel dried out or tight.  </li>
            <li> Just received this cream and used it a few days.</li>
            <li> heavy</li>
            <li> I started using it a few weeks ago and immediately my skin felt smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li> I saw results within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> $40.00 for a broken bottle of old dried up cream doesn&#x27;t do it for me!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would order again</li>
            <li> I have been using a sample of Opus Elite for the past two weeks.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT the case with some others that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> But it won&#x27;t pump out, I have to get something to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; it out.  :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  I wash my face as soon as I get home from work to remove my makeup and put the cream on.  It works overnight and I surely can see a difference in the morning.  My skin feels smoother and looks brighter.</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly what is expected.</li>
            <li> I like it, came promptly.</li>
            <li> I am going to return it! First of all it came with a &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; pump, there was just a top but no tube going into the cream to allow it to be pushed out. Also the cream seems old and dry. I will never buy anything from this company again. $40.00 for a broken bottle of old dried up cream doesn&#x27;t do it for me!!!</li>
            <li> Just received this cream and used it a few days. So far so good. I like the texture and the pleasant scent. Skin feels good after applications. Will need more time to see if there is a marked difference in skin appearance over time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how amazing this product is! It&#x27;s magic in a bottle. All the skin care products that you can end up spending a lot of money on, such as under eye , dark spots , wrinkles, is all wrapped up in this one product. My skin feels luminous and brighter since using opus. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, get ready for beautiful younger looking skin!</li>
            <li> Thank you Opus Elite. l love this product! My skin is smoother, softer, and firmer. Even my husband has started using it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cream for a while and chose this because of the ingredients. So far I&#x27;m impressed! My skin is tighter and lines are diminished. I&#x27;m 51 so can use a little help. This is doing the job! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Had a problem with the pump , contacted the company and they immediately sent a replacement. Have found that storing this product upside down also helps with the pump problem. Not sure it has done a great job on wrinkles yet (have only been using about a week), but skin is softer and like the consistency of the product. Not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my daughter, at her request.  After using it for two days the internal pump mechanism broke. My daughter likes the cream itself, but will end up wasting a lot of it as she cannot get much out without the pump.</li>
            <li> Just like a “Twilight Zone” episode, my skin gets younger looking every day.  My pores are shrinking, and my skin feels smooth and tight.  I’m 50ish and have noticed a mysterious disappearance of many of my dreaded facial lines.  I’m pleased to recommend this fabulous product to all. Just two weeks of use has been simply amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Julie</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, improves skin tone.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but there was no pump attached and I had to apply with a Q-tip. Not sure if I would order again</li>
            <li> As a skin care professional I know the ingredients in this moisturizer have many beneficial properties.  Retinol, Hyalauronic Acid and Vitamin C have wonderful anti-aging benefits.  The product was received quickly and the pump works great.  This is a great moisturizer for normal to dry skin types and great for normal to oily skin types to use as a night cream.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. I have been using a sample of Opus Elite for the past two weeks.  I am 45 yrs old and starting to show signs of aging.  The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer was the immediate hydration and softness to my skin. I am blessed with minimal lines and large pores. The first morning after putting Opus Elite on I saw a big reduction in my pores. I have been battle large pores for a long time.  I am also developing sun spots. I love to golf and garden.  After a weeks’ time those age spots have lighten.  I was also starting to see small lines forming around my lips and eyes.  The hyaluronic acid really works. Those fine lines are softening and starting to disappear. This stuff is amazing. Shipment was fast and the product stands up to its claims.  Very happy to have a night moisturize that has 3 amazing ingredients in one product. Retinol, Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C. A Very Happy Customer.  Thank You Opus Elite. Definitely recommending this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> The first night I put this moisturizer on my face I noticed my skin tingling and a few hours later my skin was experience a gentle exfoliation. I could tell an immediate response to my skin.The next morning my skin felt very soft and my pours looked smaller. I have been using this moisturizer for a week now and I am really impressed. My skin looks healthier and my smile lines around my eyes have soften. I have use many different anti-aging products in the past and this one out exceeds anything I have used in the past. Happy to have a night moisturize that does more then one thing to my skin. I will defiantly continue to buy this night cream. Happy! Happy!</li>
            <li> I had prompt delivery of the product  I give this cream a 5  star rating. It goes on good under your make up also. I use it am and pm. My skin feels smoother and softer. My complexion  has improved in a couple weeks use. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to improve the look and feel of your skin. The only drawback is the price of the cream.</li>
            <li> Too soon to comment on this item.  it is a skin care product - so that it &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;needs time before results can be seen</li>
            <li> Got a complete breakout from this. It may be me, I may have an allergy or so for the ingredients, the same happened with one of the neutrogia anti wrinkle lotions, also had retinol so I guess I should not use that again.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to be &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; by this product, but after 7 weeks I see no results yet.  I guess my chemistry or skin type just doesn&#x27;t respond quickly.  I will continue to use it until the container is empty.  If my skin improves by then, then I will shout it out!</li>
            <li> I got the cream, I like it but not the pump, should be in a jar.  Will get again, when I order</li>
            <li> This is a lovely nightcream.  It absorbs beautifully and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on anything.&lt;br /&gt;I still have wrinkles and jowls - but my skin feels smooth and I look great so long as I don&#x27;t smile too wide, (LOL.) This may be all I can expect, considering that I am 79 y.o. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is great on my combination skin, absorbs quickly without oily residue and has softened, and/or eliminated some of my fine lines. I do not usually subscribe to these products but took a chance because of the great reviews and reasonable cost. I intend to continue using this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and do not have any wrinkles (that I notice); however, I chose to use this cream for firming and preventing wrinkles. I can feel my face firm/tighten immediately after putting it on and it still feels great when I wake up in the morning! I would recommend this night cream and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Iloved the feel on my skin and I think it rejuvenates the pores in my face</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work like I Tought!</li>
            <li> I am 53 yrs. old and I have very dry skin and maturing skin.&lt;br /&gt;Usually moisturizers for my skin type come in a jar and are heavy.&lt;br /&gt;This works really well to hydrate and smooth out little wrinkles without&lt;br /&gt;that heavy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all it&#x27;s in a pump. No mess and No waste...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s really working on the wrinkles and firmness.</li>
            <li> Skin appears softer, more supple. Happy with this night cream!</li>
            <li> Love this and it works great on my skin.  I look younger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams, lotions and potions in my day. I must say that my skin feels tighter, smoother &amp; polished since I&#x27;ve been using Opus Elite! So happy I went out of my comfort zone to try something new! Definitely big box results with little box price! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this new night cream so much that I have also been using it in the day. My face is feeling smoother and it stays hydrated without a greasy feel at all. Having older skin, I have tried many to relieve dryness and look more youthful and this cream is doing  great for me. I will order again. !</li>
            <li> Have used it for 6 weeks --haven&#x27;t seen much change in my skin</li>
            <li> This was good product it took the whole bottle to see results so for me it was a bit slow. My skin is pretty good so I did not need deep treatment. I would get again.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. My skin seemed smoother &amp; softer after the first week. So far, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this new night cream!  I have been using for nearly a month now, and have been pleased with the results!  I have combination skin that gets dry and oily at the same time and I am pleased to say that my skin is no longer dry, and a lot less oily!  I have also noticed that my laugh lines are not as prominent.  I would definitely recommend this cream to friends and I plan on purchasing again!  I hope they come out with a day cream soon... ( hint, hint!) as I love this product!</li>
            <li> Most facial products either cause a reaction on my skin or breakouts.  This one does not?  My skin is soft and feels tighter.  I&#x27;m 60ish  so I know the difference from morning to night. I feel it improves my apperance by tightning and therefore reducing fine lines for a smoother apperance.  Definitly a must have product.  Impressed overall.</li>
            <li> great    love the product and the price!</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome!  I started using it a few weeks ago and immediately my skin felt smoother and softer.  After each use my skin feels cleaner in the monring.  It has never made my skin feel dried out or tight.  I look forward to how my skin will feel after further use!</li>
            <li> I have used Opus for a couple weeks now, and haven&#x27;t seen much improvement. I have noticed a little exfoliation in the mornings, so maybe with a little more use.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products and found this one by far to be the best, been using it for several weeks and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely manner and have been pleased with it.  I use it at night and find it to be effective in combating wrinkles and evening skin tone.</li>
            <li> I received the Anti-wrinkle cream very quickly. It is for my wife who tells me that it is doing everything as claimed and is very happy with the product to date. We will be ordering more in the future for sure!</li>
            <li> Cream is ok.  But it won&#x27;t pump out, I have to get something to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; it out.  :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb! Love it! Great balance of moisturizing and anti aging. I used this in combination with the  Hyaluronic Acid Serum With Vitamin C, A, D &amp; E | By Vernal Skincare | and got awesome results. This is in a bottom, but a cream and goes a long way. Too much may result in oiliness. Both of these products come in pump dispenser type bottle, so one pump of each mixed together works great.  Make sure that you use it morning and night. I saw results within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> i really like it,good product,ill buy again.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this moisturizing cream every night before  I go to sleep. I am in love with it! I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone to breakouts. My entire life I have struggled with finding a moisturizing cream that does not leave my skin oily, so for the most part I have just gone without. However, as an RN (and aging woman) I know the importance of moisture in preventing wrinkles. The crazy thing is, my skin seems to be balancing the more I use this product. Another thing I want to touch on is the scent, it is very light. This is NOT the case with some others that I have tried in the past. Overall, I really like this product and I will be buying it again and again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  The best part is that my skin feels so soft.  I put it on at night before bed and it is still on my face in the morning.  It is silky smooth and easy to apply.  I would definitely recommend this product as other products I have used have dried out my skin or did not glide on with easy.  With Opus skincare, my face looks fresher, younger and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> Noticed the hydration change immediately but don&#x27;t see any changes in wrinkles. I don&#x27;t find this a good value.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used this regularly (still using other products) but I just want to say that I have very sensitive skin, rosacea, etc. This product has not caused any extra redness and I have not broken out from it. So if you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s possible this will be just fine for you.</li>
            <li> Just because I just received the product and I&#x27;m starting to use it I expect to see results and keep you informed.&lt;br /&gt;If it takes me a while to get but I hope all is well order another soon.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
