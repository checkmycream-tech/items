            <li>(Do make sure you use a cleanser with salicylic acid</li>

            <li>You can&#x27;t beat this price - I know as I looked all over the internet! :)</li>

            <li>I love Clarisonic,I love this brush</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll most assuredly place a repeat order.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if I was getting a knock off</li>

            <li>I will not live a day without my MIA2 and these brush heads are perfect for keeping on hand so that I do not have to worry about running out of them!</li>
            <li>the results have been amazing (and using Fresh&#x27;s Soy Cleanser).</li>
            <li>These work fine.</li>
            <li>I was able to quickly attach them to my MIA &amp; I</li>
            <li>All the brushes for Clarisonic are great but Clarisonic Brush for Delicate Skin is perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Very effective cleansing brush heads, but super soft to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>nice brush heads and a decent price.</li>
            <li>I have the Clarisonic Mia, and the original head felt as if it provided a deeper cleansing of my skin.</li>
            <li>We got exactly what we were hoping for... an authentic product, packaged in a Clarisonic box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the manufacturer recommends replacing more frequently . .</li>
            <li>I clean the brushes once a week with antibacterial soap to clean and prolong the brush life.</li>
            <li>For combo skin like mine - zits and wrinkles, oily and dry areas - this brush head feels the best so far!</li>
            <li>I found this to be true.)  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem like the right fit.</li>
            <li>was quick.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it kept my face super clean, left my face smooth and mosturized.</li>
            <li>These fit VERY snugly into the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>Love the soft bristles</li>
            <li>It is worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>These Replacement Brush Heads have just the right texture for cleansing thoroughly without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>They are authentic Clarisonic, so I pay a little more for them, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li>Original part and high quality.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, ordered it in the morning, received it in the afternoon.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that burns, becomes irritated, and breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>delicate brushes do get my skin clean, and they do feel good.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my wife&#x27;s Clarisonic unit and they are exactly as needed.  </li>
            <li>I will never be able to go back to hand cleansing.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m consistent with using it my skin looks brighter and feels smoother.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them yet but as far as I can tell- they are genuine Clarisonic products AND the description &amp;#34;Twin-pack&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and cheaper than in the stores since it was the dual pack.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to replace my almost 5 month old original &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; skin brush.</li>
            <li>I love that this little machine can clean my skin so well.</li>
            <li>they came very timely.....</li>
            <li>I really like the texture of the brushes for &amp;#34;Delicate&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The brushes appear to be the real thing with the Clarisonic label on the box.</li>
            <li>I love them especially because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>use Clarisonic daily and have noticed significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Now, with the new heads, my Clarisonic is cleaning my skin the way it is meant to.  </li>
            <li>Not sure these were authentic or new.</li>
            <li>i have bought some Clarisonic Replacement Brush Heads for Delicate Skin for stand by , it is ok for my skin.</li>
            <li>They are soft, not scratchy</li>
            <li>Love the product, and always use the delicate heads.  </li>
            <li>Strange odor and appeared to have been gently used!</li>
            <li>Completely cleared my teenagers skin within 2 weeks of using.</li>
            <li>Just as advertised; for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I love my Mia, I&#x27;m so grateful there are brusheads for delicate skin.</li>
            <li>Works well with my ultra sensitive skin</li>
            <li>As I mentioned, my skin is not sensitive at all, so I was surprised after my first time using the Clarisonic that the brush felt too abrasive on my skin</li>
            <li>Most do not fit the Clarisonic, and are not the same quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noticeable that my pores are becoming smaller and less visible now.</li>
            <li>After 2 years of using mainly the deep pore cleansing heads and the acne heads, I noticed this option.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes my skin is more delicate, after a facial.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use but must barely touch my cheek area</li>
            <li>After reading on makeupalley about different brush heads, I came to the conclusion that a lot of people switch from the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush head that comes with the kit to &amp;#34;delicate,&amp;#34; even people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the real Clarisonic replacement brush head, vibrates in the outer ring, spins in the center.</li>

            <li> , then turn it on while applying it to a dry towel which dries it pretty thoroughly, then I put on the little plastic cap and screw the head off</li>
            <li> Though sometimes when my skin got sensitive, it irritated my skin, I&#x27;ll stop using it for few days, but generally it keeps my face away from pimples and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with large pores, a couple active (although small) pimples at a time, and my skin is in no way sensitive.</li>
            <li> Priced a lot less than buyingn direct.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave it red after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I use Retin-A every other night for just general skin maintenance (tretinion gel 0.025%).</li>
            <li> especially I would have expected that.</li>
            <li> must be careful and not order they generic brush heads.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my face is less oily, and my overall skin health is just...</li>
            <li> nights I use the delicate brush on the low setting for one minute by following the indicating beeps and</li>
            <li> I like the delicate brush head as I have sensitive but oily skin and</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> you use less products as you&#x27;re not putting make-up or moisturizers on dead skin cells, so they last longer..</li>
            <li> Usually can get about 3 months of daily use out of a head before replacing.  </li>
            <li> I chose the option offered by Amazon after reading a few reviews indicating trouble with 3rd party sellers.</li>
            <li> It looks and performs ok still to harsh for my face:(</li>
            <li> Next time I will not get the heads for delicate skin for my Mia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of Clarisonic products--they are way too rough on my skin and</li>
            <li> My wrinkles appear less, and friends always ask what I&#x27;ve been doing to my skin...</li>
            <li> and I had the tight &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after one minute.</li>
            <li> These are still too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> this seemed too harsh.</li>
            <li> (not a cheap knock-off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to break it in a bit, so hang in there.&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Clarisonic, I&#x27;ve gotten noticeably smoother, healthier looking skin.  </li>
            <li> Prior to finding these, I never replaced my brushes because they were so darned expensive.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to have damaged the delicate head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an issue Delicate Skin Clarisonic Brush Head.</li>
            <li> Because of my rosacea, I prefer to use the delicate brushes.</li>
            <li> even with the delicate brush, I break out all over.</li>
            <li> I use the Clarisonic brush heads for delicate skin, and I try to purchase them every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To hard for delicate skin!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering the delicate brushes after reading the reviews of getting fake products, etc.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed in these replacement heads.</li>

            <li> excellent brushes! I love them especially because I have sensitive skin. They are soft, not scratchy</li>
            <li> Love my Clarisonic.....Brushes are wonderful</li>
            <li> These are fabulous.  Prior to finding these, I never replaced my brushes because they were so darned expensive.  Now, with the new heads, my Clarisonic is cleaning my skin the way it is meant to.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Functional. It looked &amp; worked as advertised. My wife was very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the soft bristles</li>
            <li> These Replacement Brush Heads have just the right texture for cleansing thoroughly without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install on my Clarisonic Mia. I will definitely purchase these again!</li>
            <li> Well the box had no seal whatsoever and being a hygienic item especially I would have expected that. It looks and performs ok still to harsh for my face:(</li>
            <li> its perfect for cleaning skin</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with large pores, a couple active (although small) pimples at a time, and my skin is in no way sensitive. I use Retin-A every other night for just general skin maintenance (tretinion gel 0.025%). As I mentioned, my skin is not sensitive at all, so I was surprised after my first time using the Clarisonic that the brush felt too abrasive on my skin and I had the tight &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after one minute. I knew what the Clarisonic was supposed to feel like because an esthetician had used it on my face before I had a facial and this seemed too harsh. After reading on makeupalley about different brush heads, I came to the conclusion that a lot of people switch from the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush head that comes with the kit to &amp;#34;delicate,&amp;#34; even people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I have not used the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most nights I use the delicate brush on the low setting for one minute by following the indicating beeps and the results have been amazing (and using Fresh&#x27;s Soy Cleanser). My pores are smaller, my face is less oily, and my overall skin health is just... better. I will never be able to go back to hand cleansing. Every time I&#x27;m done with the brush I rinse it out, then turn it on while applying it to a dry towel which dries it pretty thoroughly, then I put on the little plastic cap and screw the head off (it&#x27;s easier with the cap on) and place the handle back in the charger. This doesn&#x27;t seem to have damaged the delicate head.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, ordered it in the morning, received it in the afternoon. This is the real Clarisonic replacement brush head, vibrates in the outer ring, spins in the center. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I must admit I waffled back &amp; forth about the Clairsonic, but now would not be w/o it!  The choice of brush heads is wonderful and allows for differences in skin from day to day. Sometimes my skin is more delicate, after a facial. I can change my brush to the softest, and have a great &#x27;spa experience&#x27; right here st home.  My wrinkles appear less, and friends always ask what I&#x27;ve been doing to my skin...It&#x27;s radiant!  I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> These fit VERY snugly into the Clarisonic.  They don&#x27;t seem like the right fit.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the legitimate item. (not a cheap knock-off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads fit perfectly to my wife&#x27;s Mia2. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Fit perfectly on my Clarisonic Mia. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my clarisonic for over 5 years.  Love the product, and always use the delicate heads.  No complaints.  Usually can get about 3 months of daily use out of a head before replacing.  I&#x27;m sure the manufacturer recommends replacing more frequently . . .after all I would if I were the manuf!!  Bristles don&#x27;t fray or become split.  No complaints</li>
            <li> Good for tender areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic for 6 years and it&#x27;s a great product! When I&#x27;m consistent with using it my skin looks brighter and feels smoother. (Do make sure you use a cleanser with salicylic acid otherwise you&#x27;re just pushing bacteria around your face, said my Dermatologist. I found this to be true.)  I have extremely sensitive skin that burns, becomes irritated, and breaks out easily. I&#x27;ve never had an issue Delicate Skin Clarisonic Brush Head. All the brushes for Clarisonic are great but Clarisonic Brush for Delicate Skin is perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> These work fine. Priced a lot less than buyingn direct.</li>
            <li> Original part and high quality.</li>
            <li> nice brush heads and a decent price.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed in these replacement heads. I have the Clarisonic Mia, and the original head felt as if it provided a deeper cleansing of my skin. Next time I will not get the heads for delicate skin for my Mia.</li>
            <li> My girl friend loves the Clarsonic. I can see the difference in her sink. It is worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They are authentic Clarisonic, so I pay a little more for them, but they are worth it. They hold up, fit perfectly, and ship timely. I will buy them again when I need them.</li>
            <li> Not sure these were authentic or new. Strange odor and appeared to have been gently used! Tossed them into the trash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t anticipate any problem with returning this item, but it&#x27;s a hassle.  Many of us use amazon for convenience, and returning an item is a hassle.  The inner circle on the brush didn&#x27;t rotate when attached to my unit. (My old brush head continues to work beautifully).</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering the delicate brushes after reading the reviews of getting fake products, etc. However, I decided to take a chance and order from Amazon as the seller. We got exactly what we were hoping for... an authentic product, packaged in a Clarisonic box. Excellent product at an excellent price!</li>
            <li> These are the best for the most sensitive skin. Completely cleared my teenagers skin within 2 weeks of using. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> To hard for delicate skin!</li>
            <li> Just as advertised; for sensitive skin.  It takes a few times to break it in a bit, so hang in there.&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Clarisonic, I&#x27;ve gotten noticeably smoother, healthier looking skin.  And another benefit:&lt;br /&gt; you use less products as you&#x27;re not putting make-up or moisturizers on dead skin cells, so they last longer..&lt;br /&gt;and look more even-toned.  :  D</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works great</li>
            <li> a gift to refreshen the gift of the Clarisonic itself of a year ago.....they came very timely.....packaged well.....work great...daughter is delighted....</li>
            <li> I will not live a day without my MIA2 and these brush heads are perfect for keeping on hand so that I do not have to worry about running out of them! Because of my rosacea, I prefer to use the delicate brushes. You can&#x27;t beat this price - I know as I looked all over the internet! :)</li>
            <li> Love this Clarisonic system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of Clarisonic products--they are way too rough on my skin and even with the delicate brush, I break out all over.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it kept my face super clean, left my face smooth and mosturized. Though sometimes when my skin got sensitive, it irritated my skin, I&#x27;ll stop using it for few days, but generally it keeps my face away from pimples and blackheads. It&#x27;s noticeable that my pores are becoming smaller and less visible now.</li>
            <li> I *think* I finally found my brush head match.  After 2 years of using mainly the deep pore cleansing heads and the acne heads, I noticed this option.  I think I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one (am intrigued by the cashmere brush however). For combo skin like mine - zits and wrinkles, oily and dry areas - this brush head feels the best so far!</li>
            <li> I love Clarisonic,I love this brush,They make my skin is getting better and better</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  I was able to quickly attach them to my MIA &amp; I was in business!  I really like the texture of the brushes for &amp;#34;Delicate&amp;#34;  skin; they&#x27;re  perfect for pampering my over 60 face.  I didn&#x27;t want to chance buying generic brushes.  The brushes appear to be the real thing with the Clarisonic label on the box. I&#x27;ll most assuredly place a repeat order.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to replace my almost 5 month old original &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; skin brush. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but as far as I can tell- they are genuine Clarisonic products AND the description &amp;#34;Twin-pack&amp;#34; is just what it seems to be. (Why yes, there are two in the package!!) I chose the option offered by Amazon after reading a few reviews indicating trouble with 3rd party sellers.</li>
            <li> I love my Mia, I&#x27;m so grateful there are brusheads for delicate skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave it red after I wash my face. Perfect for my very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and cheaper than in the stores since it was the dual pack.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic Has been part of my face cleansing for 4 years. I love that this little machine can clean my skin so well. I use the Clarisonic brush heads for delicate skin, and I try to purchase them every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delicate brushes do get my skin clean, and they do feel good. I use the Clarisonic for 3-4 minutes every evening, and it gets rid of all my make-up, dirt and grime collected during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must be careful and not order they generic brush heads. Most do not fit the Clarisonic, and are not the same quality. Once again, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 08-13-14</li>
            <li> Great bargain! I like the delicate brush head as I have sensitive but oily skin and occasionally rosacea outbreaks. I clean the brushes once a week with antibacterial soap to clean and prolong the brush life. Will purchase again when it&#x27;s time to replace these.</li>
            <li> Functions as described.</li>
            <li> Works well with my ultra sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I was getting a knock off but these fit the Clarisonic perfectly and work well.</li>
