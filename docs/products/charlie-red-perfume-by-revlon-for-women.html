            <li>I&#x27;M GLAD I DID</li>
            <li>I love, love the scent.  </li>
            <li>It lasts for about 6-8 hours a day, and becomes more of a close &amp;#34;skin-scent&amp;#34; after the 4/5 hour mark.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>Pleased w/ purchase.</li>

            <li>and I love the smell</li>
            <li>It seems I got what I paid for, nothing more.</li>
            <li>I only buy the best for her.and</li>
            <li>Charlie has always been one of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of it.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent..</li>
            <li>it reminds me of the way my mommy use to smell :)</li>
            <li>Love this perfume, just wish they still sold it in retail locations.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>And love the compliments that I get from everyone.  </li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for many years and it is my favorite</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this item upon the reviews I read, but I haven&#x27;t learned to love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe you&#x27;ll love it?</li>
            <li>While initially very strong, it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>but smeal is very strong and feels like a cheap quality perfume.  </li>
            <li>I loved it when it first came out</li>
            <li>and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is a bit strong at first, but settles into a nice sexy perfume.</li>
            <li>but it was easy.</li>
            <li>It used to be so easy to run into CVS and grab a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like strong smelling scents</li>
            <li>Charlie Red smells absolutely beautiful</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t fine it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Perfume bottle was not packed well though it arrived in one piece fortunately.</li>
            <li>Charlie for that price is cheap.</li>
            <li>THE AROMA IS LIGHT AND AIRY........</li>
            <li>Actually, it is a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>Any scent is completely subjective, of course, but I even spray this in the room when my girl isn&#x27;t around, it smells so good.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it right on time.</li>
            <li>but this is the original.</li>
            <li>please, if you&#x27;re not going to sell something original, make the reservation or do not sell</li>
            <li>I save my fancy stuff for Church and special occasions</li>
            <li>It arrived the night before around 8 pm, which I thought was pretty great since the estimated time of arrival was the following week.</li>
            <li>it was in my childhood , the choice was very restricted in those days and if we wanted to by a good one we could find it &amp;#34;under the stalls&amp;#34; , in a double or more price.</li>
            <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>Good for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I have looked everywhere to find this particular perfume and haven&#x27;t been able to find it til now.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>Charlie Red is my most favorite toilette spray ever.</li>
            <li>The scent is mostly for older persons.</li>
            <li>Great price, and really like the red.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Came quickly too.</li>
            <li>But once it settles in, the smell stays well into the next morning and leaves me with a very sexy musky scent.  </li>
            <li>She can SMELL GOOD FOR A LONG TIME!</li>
            <li>Old time favorite.</li>
            <li>She had never used the Red version, so she really liked receiving it.</li>
            <li>nice to present to any one</li>
            <li>Love love Charlie red, smell stays with u all day, even working up a sweat, can&#x27;t find it in any store, thanks amazon</li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>That is indeed a thought worth considering...</li>
            <li>Charlie Red is also a fantastic fragrance love it ...</li>
            <li>but I think this one may be my favorite out of them all since it is a lot lighter then the original Blue box Charlie.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Red out of curiosity &amp; I like it better than the original scent.  </li>
            <li>the price was right</li>
            <li>so this nice, light fragrance was just right for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>I love this soft gentle lingering smell of Charlie</li>
            <li>I think its too strong and if you spray more than maybe one time, it could really mess you up.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>; TRIED FOR THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li>I put i love it only because that is what my mom said when she opened her package of perfume.  </li>
            <li>This perfume came in really pretty packaging, bt</li>
            <li>My grandmother was the first person to give it to me and I have been wearing it ever sense.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t make perfume like Charlie any more scent last forever</li>
            <li>and I am so glad to get it at such a price.</li>
            <li>I used to love Charlie Red, but I think my body chemistry must have changed, because it</li>
            <li>I was very happy and actually pleasantly surprised that the bottle was larger than I expected.</li>
            <li>I also purchased Charlie White one of my summer time favorite fragrances...</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and getting the same for less than what they charge for in the departmental store was amazing.</li>
            <li>I dont agree with the positive reviewers at all.</li>
            <li>I like pretty much all of the Charlies</li>
            <li>im not sure what the difference is but regardless my mother loved it.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest (as my father would probably too) to buying from them if they are looking for something similar.</li>
            <li>This bottle will last a good long time!</li>
            <li>Me, not so much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to amazon prime</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>I switched over from a very floral yet very musky perfume that became discontinued.</li>
            <li>Very Good,Reynaldo Licea</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for her, and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>very chip smell, it remembered me the fragranses sold in the shops in komunistic period.</li>
            <li>Personally, I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>she wants me to buy her more.i</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Really like this fragrance</li>
            <li>I have used other Charlie perfumes and love them.</li>
            <li>At the time I needed a few more items to get my cart above the dollar amount to get free shipping</li>
            <li>The only con is how strong it can be when first applied (and I only need to spray it once throughout my neck/chest area).  </li>
            <li>It smells for a much older woman, nothing for a 20&#x27;s group.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, but use sparingly.</li>
            <li>I just like this so much and am so glad to be able to get this although I am afraid it won&#x27;t be forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more, in the near future!</li>
            <li>He ran through a few ideas and this one seemed to be great as he was stating that this item is becoming rather difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so if you want the smell to REALLY have an impact, spray all your pulse points and it&#x27;ll last a good 12 hours.</li>
            <li>The sweat smell reminds her that one of her cousins has given the exact same thing 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>I was leary at first about receiving fragile stuff thru mail &amp; online</li>
            <li>I love all the charlie fragrances they smell very expensive without breaking the bank, I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also little hints of honey and peaches, so the sweetness is very nice, but not overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s too light and doesn&#x27;t last very long even with using a LOT.</li>
            <li>Evoking a sense of carnations and warmth...almost as if one has entered a most beautiful room which is filled with winter flowers, and has escaped the chilling cold outside.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and was half the price I usually pay at the mall (on the rare occasion it is available at the mall).</li>
            <li>Thanks for having my standard favorite hard to find.  </li>
            <li>i like it in the frosted bottle, not the clear glass bottle though</li>
            <li>Charlie is an old perfume.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my sister that likes &#x27;old school&#x27; colognes.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this perfume for an elder person not for teenagers or young folks.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like this one,  doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great casual scent!</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend both Charlie Red and white for a classic soft fragrance.....</li>
            <li>This is the first and last time I ever use CHARLIE RED by Revlon.  </li>
            <li>but it came in a clear bottle and the liquid was yellow .</li>
            <li>Tough it would be fine for teenagers but old babe like me</li>
            <li>I always feel silly purchasing this scent, because my grandfather was the one who originally gifted it to me as a young girl - in a xmas gift set.  </li>
            <li>I opened the packaging the main perfume box was crushed and came with</li>
            <li>This is a classic and hard to find thanks again.  </li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I think the seller did an excellent job overall!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products and favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this scent is her favorite because she wears it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GLAD I DID</li>
            <li> I love, love the scent.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for about 6-8 hours a day, and becomes more of a close &amp;#34;skin-scent&amp;#34; after the 4/5 hour mark.</li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> Pleased w/ purchase.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s just what I love.  </li>
            <li> CHARLIE RED IS THE BEST TO M!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got some for my wife and another woman friend of ours..........strong perfume, but really smells great.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell</li>
            <li> It seems I got what I paid for, nothing more.</li>
            <li> I only buy the best for her.and</li>
            <li> Charlie has always been one of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of it.  </li>
            <li> Love this scent..</li>
            <li> it reminds me of the way my mommy use to smell :)</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, just wish they still sold it in retail locations.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> And love the compliments that I get from everyone.  </li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for many years and it is my favorite</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she will love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item upon the reviews I read, but I haven&#x27;t learned to love it.</li>
            <li> Maybe you&#x27;ll love it?</li>
            <li> While initially very strong, it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> but smeal is very strong and feels like a cheap quality perfume.  </li>
            <li> I loved it when it first came out</li>
            <li> and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is a bit strong at first, but settles into a nice sexy perfume.</li>
            <li> but it was easy.</li>
            <li> It used to be so easy to run into CVS and grab a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like strong smelling scents</li>
            <li> Charlie Red smells absolutely beautiful</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t fine it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Perfume bottle was not packed well though it arrived in one piece fortunately.</li>
            <li> Charlie for that price is cheap.</li>
            <li> THE AROMA IS LIGHT AND AIRY........</li>
            <li> Actually, it is a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Any scent is completely subjective, of course, but I even spray this in the room when my girl isn&#x27;t around, it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I was able to get it right on time.</li>
            <li> but this is the original.</li>
            <li> please, if you&#x27;re not going to sell something original, make the reservation or do not sell</li>
            <li> I save my fancy stuff for Church and special occasions</li>
            <li> It arrived the night before around 8 pm, which I thought was pretty great since the estimated time of arrival was the following week.</li>
            <li> it was in my childhood , the choice was very restricted in those days and if we wanted to by a good one we could find it &amp;#34;under the stalls&amp;#34; , in a double or more price.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> Good for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere to find this particular perfume and haven&#x27;t been able to find it til now.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> Charlie Red is my most favorite toilette spray ever.</li>
            <li> The scent is mostly for older persons.</li>
            <li> Great price, and really like the red.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Came quickly too.</li>
            <li> But once it settles in, the smell stays well into the next morning and leaves me with a very sexy musky scent.  </li>
            <li> She can SMELL GOOD FOR A LONG TIME!</li>
            <li> Old time favorite.</li>
            <li> She had never used the Red version, so she really liked receiving it.</li>
            <li> nice to present to any one</li>
            <li> Love love Charlie red, smell stays with u all day, even working up a sweat, can&#x27;t find it in any store, thanks amazon</li>
            <li> Worth buying.</li>
            <li> That is indeed a thought worth considering...</li>
            <li> Charlie Red is also a fantastic fragrance love it ...</li>
            <li> but I think this one may be my favorite out of them all since it is a lot lighter then the original Blue box Charlie.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Red out of curiosity &amp; I like it better than the original scent.  </li>
            <li> the price was right</li>
            <li> so this nice, light fragrance was just right for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I love this soft gentle lingering smell of Charlie</li>
            <li> I think its too strong and if you spray more than maybe one time, it could really mess you up.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> ; TRIED FOR THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li> I put i love it only because that is what my mom said when she opened her package of perfume.  </li>
            <li> This perfume came in really pretty packaging, bt</li>
            <li> My grandmother was the first person to give it to me and I have been wearing it ever sense.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t make perfume like Charlie any more scent last forever</li>
            <li> and I am so glad to get it at such a price.</li>
            <li> I used to love Charlie Red, but I think my body chemistry must have changed, because it</li>
            <li> I was very happy and actually pleasantly surprised that the bottle was larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I also purchased Charlie White one of my summer time favorite fragrances...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and getting the same for less than what they charge for in the departmental store was amazing.</li>
            <li> I dont agree with the positive reviewers at all.</li>
            <li> I like pretty much all of the Charlies</li>
            <li> im not sure what the difference is but regardless my mother loved it.</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest (as my father would probably too) to buying from them if they are looking for something similar.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a good long time!</li>
            <li> Me, not so much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to amazon prime</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> I switched over from a very floral yet very musky perfume that became discontinued.</li>
            <li> Very Good,Reynaldo Licea</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for her, and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> very chip smell, it remembered me the fragranses sold in the shops in komunistic period.</li>
            <li> Personally, I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> she wants me to buy her more.i</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Really like this fragrance</li>
            <li> I have used other Charlie perfumes and love them.</li>
            <li> At the time I needed a few more items to get my cart above the dollar amount to get free shipping</li>
            <li> The only con is how strong it can be when first applied (and I only need to spray it once throughout my neck/chest area).  </li>
            <li> It smells for a much older woman, nothing for a 20&#x27;s group.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, but use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I just like this so much and am so glad to be able to get this although I am afraid it won&#x27;t be forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more, in the near future!</li>
            <li> He ran through a few ideas and this one seemed to be great as he was stating that this item is becoming rather difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so if you want the smell to REALLY have an impact, spray all your pulse points and it&#x27;ll last a good 12 hours.</li>
            <li> The sweat smell reminds her that one of her cousins has given the exact same thing 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I was leary at first about receiving fragile stuff thru mail &amp; online</li>
            <li> I love all the charlie fragrances they smell very expensive without breaking the bank, I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also little hints of honey and peaches, so the sweetness is very nice, but not overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s too light and doesn&#x27;t last very long even with using a LOT.</li>
            <li> Evoking a sense of carnations and warmth...almost as if one has entered a most beautiful room which is filled with winter flowers, and has escaped the chilling cold outside.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and was half the price I usually pay at the mall (on the rare occasion it is available at the mall).</li>
            <li> Thanks for having my standard favorite hard to find.  </li>
            <li> i like it in the frosted bottle, not the clear glass bottle though</li>
            <li> Charlie is an old perfume.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister that likes &#x27;old school&#x27; colognes.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this perfume for an elder person not for teenagers or young folks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like this one,  doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great casual scent!</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend both Charlie Red and white for a classic soft fragrance.....</li>
            <li> This is the first and last time I ever use CHARLIE RED by Revlon.  </li>
            <li> but it came in a clear bottle and the liquid was yellow .</li>
            <li> Tough it would be fine for teenagers but old babe like me</li>
            <li> I always feel silly purchasing this scent, because my grandfather was the one who originally gifted it to me as a young girl - in a xmas gift set.  </li>
            <li> I opened the packaging the main perfume box was crushed and came with</li>
            <li> This is a classic and hard to find thanks again.  </li>
            <li> Distinctive and long lasting but not for me.</li>
            <li> I know Charlie Red smell, i have been using it for long...</li>
            <li> for the price this stays on all day long</li>
            <li> I used to really love this scent!  :(</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not expensive and a little nostalgic, but the fact that I get compliments - on a high frequency says a lot.  </li>
            <li> Sad you can&#x27;t hardly find this in stores any more,  the only scent I&#x27;ll wear.  </li>
            <li> But, although the scent is not too bad, it is a very cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> The scent smells like a subtle, soft powder.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am not sure if the quality of this brand has changed or the specific product which i purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li> You get a big bottle for a small price.</li>
            <li> It stays for a long time, at least 10 hrs.  </li>
            <li> Also, the contents of the perfume bottle was little less than what it should have been.</li>
            <li> i purchased this as a gift to my close family member who was a big fan of charlie and used it in past, some how i got a negative feedback on the quality this time.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not original.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding this in stores, but like the fragrance for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of them to give some friends as a gift</li>
            <li> not cheap smelling.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is not overwhelmingly strong.</li>
            <li> this is not authentic.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to add.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> This gave me a serious headache.</li>
            <li> the item is arrive the box is not good</li>
            <li> I hate that it&#x27;s getting harder to find &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; each year, so consider stocking up a little if you become a fan too.</li>
            <li> However, I am not happy with what Amazon sent me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So sad about that, so I will have to try another</li>
            <li> as he had used Used See by, I can say it&#x27;s a fake!</li>
            <li> bad amazon keeps misleading stuff.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is not for pussycats.</li>
            <li> very hard to find and was what she was wanting!!!</li>

            <li> very refreshing sent, bought for wife as a gift, she loves it as well as i do. i would buy it again</li>
            <li> I gave this as a surprise gift to my wife just one day before our magic kingdom vacation. Thanks to amazon prime I was able to get it right on time. The sweat smell reminds her that one of her cousins has given the exact same thing 20 years ago. I am glad she really liked it.</li>
            <li> NICE FRAGRANCE. THANK YOU SELLER. &amp;#34;CHARLIE RED&amp;#34; TRIED FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT IS NICE, BUT MY FAVORITE REMAINS &amp;#34;CHARLIE BLUE.&amp;#34; I COMBINE THEM FOR AN INTERESTING CHANGE. I LIKE THE SPICEINESS RATHER THAN THE LIGHTER FLORAL FRAGRANCE OF &amp;#34;CHARLIE RED.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The best of the Charlie line!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me for Valentine&#x27;s Day. I wore it when we started dating 10 years ago. It arrived the night before around 8 pm, which I thought was pretty great since the estimated time of arrival was the following week. It smells wonderful, if you like like florally scents. It&#x27;s a great casual scent!</li>
            <li> Thank you for carrying this cologne! It was a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my best friend and I received it in time and she was overjoyed!</li>
            <li> Just gave it out to my sibling. I don&#x27;t really like it. Tough it would be fine for teenagers but old babe like me</li>
            <li> I am often complimented on my perfume.  Charlie Red has been my signature scent for 15+ years.  I love it and am extremely happy with the product and service.  Delivery was timely and the bottles (glass) arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister that likes &#x27;old school&#x27; colognes.  She had never used the Red version, so she really liked receiving it. It arrived on time, too.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell at all, as he had used Used See by, I can say it&#x27;s a fake! please, if you&#x27;re not going to sell something original, make the reservation or do not sell</li>
            <li> I switched over from a very floral yet very musky perfume that became discontinued. This scent replaces that one perfectly. My only wish was that it lasted longer on the skin. While initially very strong, it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and I have not had any reaction to the skin with it.</li>
            <li> I put i love it only because that is what my mom said when she opened her package of perfume.  she loves this stuff and wanted some so as a good son i bought some for her. It arrived at the house when i told her it would so everything was great and she loved her gift.</li>
            <li> This perfume came in really pretty packaging, bt it smells like sweat, soap, and grandmas! I dont agree with the positive reviewers at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas gift.  Could not find this , her favorite Charlie perfume in any store.  The price was so great I ordered 3.  She can SMELL GOOD FOR A LONG TIME!</li>
            <li> I save my fancy stuff for Church and special occasions so this nice, light fragrance was just right for everyday wear. Price and shipping service were great!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and undamaged. But, although the scent is not too bad, it is a very cheap perfume. It has a undertone of like a plastic chemically smell. Probably a drying agent. This gave me a serious headache.</li>
            <li> what a smell ! nice to present to any one</li>
            <li> Charlie Red is my most favorite toilette spray ever. My grandmother was the first person to give it to me and I have been wearing it ever sense. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love all the charlie fragrances they smell very expensive without breaking the bank, I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> Light and great fragrance</li>
            <li> Love love Charlie red, smell stays with u all day, even working up a sweat, can&#x27;t find it in any store, thanks amazon</li>
            <li> This is definitely not original. I know Charlie Red smell, i have been using it for long...this is not authentic. The bottle i received also does not look like the picture. What is received is a transparent bottle with yellow liquid.instead of a frosted bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad amazon keeps misleading stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father as he was looking to get my mother something nice for her at Christmas. At the time I needed a few more items to get my cart above the dollar amount to get free shipping so I figured I would ask him. He ran through a few ideas and this one seemed to be great as he was stating that this item is becoming rather difficult to find in stores. He also told me that the pricing was great and considering we got this item with free shipping (and no tax) it was a steal! Also the items came beautiful packed and were crisp when opened by my mother on Christmas. As they say happy wife happy life and I think the seller did an excellent job overall! I would strongly suggest (as my father would probably too) to buying from them if they are looking for something similar.</li>
            <li> I just like this so much and am so glad to be able to get this although I am afraid it won&#x27;t be forever.</li>
            <li> Very Good,Reynaldo Licea</li>
            <li> Excellent, Thank you,</li>
            <li> What can I say? This is one of my favorite products and favorite fragrances. Yes, to say I love it is the truth!!</li>
            <li> Charlie for that price is cheap. Smells good. Would recommend this perfume for an elder person not for teenagers or young folks. The scent is mostly for older persons.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for her, and she absolutely loves it.  I&#x27;m guessing this scent is her favorite because she wears it every day.</li>
            <li> for the price this stays on all day long and it smells pretty good. I even bought one for my mom</li>
            <li> This perfume smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> i purchased this as a gift to my close family member who was a big fan of charlie and used it in past, some how i got a negative feedback on the quality this time. i had purchased both Charlie Red  and Charlie Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am not sure if the quality of this brand has changed or the specific product which i purchased from amazon.</li>
            <li> THE AROMA IS LIGHT AND AIRY........I TOOK A CHANCE BUYING IT , BUT I&#x27;M GLAD I DID......GOT A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS ........</li>
            <li> I have loved Charlie since I was a teenager and I&#x27;m well into my 40&#x27;s!  I thought I&#x27;d try one of the newer Charlies in the line with the Red.  I love, love the scent.  However, it&#x27;s too light and doesn&#x27;t last very long even with using a LOT.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, like a powdery and sweet tuberose/gardenia bouquet. There&#x27;s also little hints of honey and peaches, so the sweetness is very nice, but not overwhelmingly so. It lasts for about 6-8 hours a day, and becomes more of a close &amp;#34;skin-scent&amp;#34; after the 4/5 hour mark. A little goes a long way, so if you want the smell to REALLY have an impact, spray all your pulse points and it&#x27;ll last a good 12 hours. Very great price, it&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> smell is much different</li>
            <li> Bought for charity.  Smells ok.  Not sure what else to add.  If you like Charlie the price seemed alright to me.</li>
            <li> Took care of the problem real good, I like the seller curteous nature.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering... Pleased w/ purchase. 😎</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and getting the same for less than what they charge for in the departmental store was amazing.</li>
            <li> Any scent is completely subjective, of course, but I even spray this in the room when my girl isn&#x27;t around, it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it bday gift</li>
            <li> very hard to find and was what she was wanting!!!</li>
            <li> Charlie what can I say ? I&#x27;ve been wearing Charlie from the age of 17 i&#x27;am now 56 always get compliments when I wear it they don&#x27;t make perfume like Charlie any more scent last forever ❤️</li>
            <li> WOULD BY THIS ANY TIME AND WEAR THIS PARFUM  ANY WHERE. WOULD TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS  PRODUCT. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> This is the first and last time I ever use CHARLIE RED by Revlon.  There is, to me, no fragrance that is worthwhile mentioning.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having my standard favorite hard to find.  This is a classic and hard to find thanks again.  Just love it</li>
            <li> I remember this  product back  home  in  asia  and  this is  the  perfume I gave  to  my  girlfriend  now  this  perfume reminds  me  of  my  girlfriend that  now  is  my  wife hahahaa  ( she&#x27;s so  happy about this  product ) thanks</li>
            <li> I used to wear this product years ago and never forgot the smell of it. However, it seems that something has change in the formula because it doesn&#x27;t smell quite the same is it did before.</li>
            <li> Bought this to give to friends but smeal is very strong and feels like a cheap quality perfume.  Bottle  and cap is not so great.</li>
            <li> Worth buying. Good price also smells great.  Fragrance is not overwhelmingly strong. It&#x27;s just what I love.  I love this soft gentle lingering smell of Charlie</li>
            <li> CHARLIE RED IS THE BEST TO M!!!!!! IT&#x27;S CHARLIE BY REVLON, AT IT&#x27;S BEST SCENT EVER. I LOVE IT!! IT&#x27;S LIKE I GOT HEAVEN&#x27;S BEST SCENT HERE ON EARTH ON MY DRESSER. THANK YOU REVLON, A JOB WELL DONE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got some for my wife and another woman friend of ours..........strong perfume, but really smells great. I highly recommend this, but use sparingly.</li>
            <li> the price was right and I love the smell</li>
            <li> My daughter favorite !!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume,its best smellin perf in the world! I was leary at first about receiving fragile stuff thru mail &amp; online but it was easy.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding this in stores, but like the fragrance for everyday wear. Price was good, too.</li>
            <li> i like it but&lt;br /&gt;when i the item is arrive the box is not good&lt;br /&gt;next time do a proper raft so the item not look frm the trash.</li>
            <li> very good, on time, excelent product</li>
            <li> I have used Charlie since in came out over 40 years ago.  Great price, and really like the red.</li>
            <li> I always feel silly purchasing this scent, because my grandfather was the one who originally gifted it to me as a young girl - in a xmas gift set.  I don&#x27;t like strong smelling scents and I can&#x27;t go into most beauty and candle shops because of it, but this has been perfect for me for years.  I know it&#x27;s not expensive and a little nostalgic, but the fact that I get compliments - on a high frequency says a lot.  I hate that it&#x27;s getting harder to find &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; each year, so consider stocking up a little if you become a fan too.</li>
            <li> Needed a gift and she loved it .. So win win for me .. Smells good and price is good.</li>
            <li> very chip smell, it remembered me the fragranses sold in the shops in komunistic period. it was in my childhood , the choice was very restricted in those days and if we wanted to by a good one we could find it &amp;#34;under the stalls&amp;#34; , in a double or more price.</li>
            <li> The charlie red i imagined would be like the picture posted... but it came in a clear bottle and the liquid was yellow . im not sure what the difference is but regardless my mother loved it. but she loves anything from charlies line.</li>
            <li> Charlie Red...a most warm and fuzzy scent: Evoking a sense of carnations and warmth...almost as if one has entered a most beautiful room which is filled with winter flowers, and has escaped the chilling cold outside. Too bad it is not for pussycats. Pussycats like warm and fuzzy. Perhaps, they can create one just for pussycats and name it Charlie-Chat. That is indeed a thought worth considering...a most purr-fect thought! I do believe that I shall pen a letter to Revlon.</li>
            <li> Personally, I really didn&#x27;t like the smell. I think its too strong and if you spray more than maybe one time, it could really mess you up. I think what I got smells like a very cheap perfume. Actually, it is a cheap perfume. It seems I got what I paid for, nothing more. I would never recommend this perfume to any body I know. I bought a few of them to give some friends as a gift but I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t give them to any friend.</li>
            <li> I only buy the best for her.and she wants me to buy her more.i even bought her a second bottle.</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite scents and the cheapest prices for it is on amazon!</li>
            <li> It was a great deal with a great price. I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more, in the near future!</li>
            <li> Delivered timely. Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> Charlie has always been one of my favorite fragrances and I am so glad to get it at such a price.</li>
            <li> This smells great on me. Price is great too!!</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume.  It used to be so easy to run into CVS and grab a bottle.  I searched and search everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find even a trial size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing price for 3.4 oz!  This bottle will last a good long time!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved the fragrance.  It is one I use and knew it wouldn&#x27;t be too fragrant for a teenager.</li>
            <li> as i wrote about the charlie blue would suggest the red as a kiss getter and,never mind. great perfume. not cheap smelling. perfect gift for wife or girlfriend.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them. thanks</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of it.  It stays for a long time, at least 10 hrs.  For the price I got it, I would say that it is a great buy.  Good for daily use.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Really like this fragrance</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this fragrance. Wanted to try something different. I am happy I ordered this smells very good and fresh. You get a big bottle for a small price. Will order this again. Shipping was quick. Very satisfied with this product and service thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this scent..I.get a  lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I used to love Charlie Red, but I think my body chemistry must have changed, because it&lt;br /&gt;just doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; on me anymore.  So sad about that, so I will have to try another&lt;br /&gt;perfume.  I used to really love this scent!  :(</li>
            <li> i like charlie red it reminds me of the way my mommy use to smell :) **i like it in the frosted bottle, not the clear glass bottle though</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. Good quality.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in the store. This was a great price for the size of the bottle. smells great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like this one,  doesn&#x27;t last,won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, just wish they still sold it in retail locations.</li>
            <li> It was Excellent. Nice doing business with you. Keep up the good works. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Sad you can&#x27;t hardly find this in stores any more,  the only scent I&#x27;ll wear.  Love, love, love it.  Came quickly too.</li>
            <li> And love the compliments that I get from everyone.  I been wearing this for years.  Please don&#x27;t every discontinue this!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I was very happy and actually pleasantly surprised that the bottle was larger than I expected. I have used this perfume for many years and it is my favorite</li>
            <li> This arrived today and it&#x27;s perfect!! My daughter will be so happy because this is a gift for her 😃</li>
            <li> This product was at my door in 4 days.  It was a great price and the perfume was thicker like an oil so it stays on longer.  Will defiantly order again.</li>
            <li> Charlie Red is also a fantastic fragrance love it ... I also purchased Charlie White one of my summer time favorite fragrances... Charlie Red smells absolutely beautiful i would highly recommend both Charlie Red and white for a classic soft fragrance.....</li>
            <li> Bought it as an gift. Looks great.</li>
            <li> Great perfume for an even better price !</li>
            <li> The perfume smell is good. However, I am not happy with what Amazon sent me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the packaging the main perfume box was crushed and came with it&#x27;s mouth open. Also, the contents of the perfume bottle was little less than what it should have been. Seems like someone had used it earlier and may have returned it and Amazon shipped that returned bottle to me.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because the scent is not my liking. I have used other Charlie perfumes and love them. Amazon has a good return policy but I did not return will give it away.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t fine it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my granddaughter.  I&#x27;m sure she will love it. I always have.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: came in on time. Thank you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  I think when I ordered this product, I was thinking of another white or blue.</li>
            <li> My grandmother used to wear Charlie, so I tend to have a bottle on hand for days that she is on my mind &amp; I would like to smell her.  I decided to try the Red out of curiosity &amp; I like it better than the original scent.  It is a bit strong at first, but settles into a nice sexy perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought this item upon the reviews I read, but I haven&#x27;t learned to love it. The scent smells like a subtle, soft powder. It smells for a much older woman, nothing for a 20&#x27;s group. It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s not so great either. I&#x27;m just not a fan. But, hey. Maybe you&#x27;ll love it?</li>
