    <ol>
            <li>Though I still think this is the best root boost to get.</li>
            <li>LOL,  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they had to go and change a good thing.</li>
            <li>Yes, 4 days of gorgeous volume, now I used it everytime</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Not as effective on my roots either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant, light scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my hair, this product delivers what it promises.  </li>
            <li>She will probably order more when it is finished.</li>
            <li>This root boost spray gives my fine hair body and lift.</li>
            <li>;, then how was it able to get shipped too me in the first place?   </li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair look greasy, irritated my scalp and did not give my hair more body, i.e., &amp;#34;Boost my roots&amp;#34; for more than a short time.</li>
            <li>This product is way way better in the blue original container.</li>
            <li>As a result, it flattens out pretty quickly from the weight.</li>
            <li>This new bottle went right into the garbage after three attempts.</li>
            <li>my hair is so much fuller than before.</li>
            <li>This has a smell but it fades fast.</li>
            <li>But this truly works, gave me so much volume</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to do never had this much hair</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and she loves this product.</li>
            <li>Adds great volume to my thin hair.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really do it for me.</li>
            <li>After trying dozens of root boosters, I&#x27;ve found the one that really works for me.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS NOT RETURNABLE so unless you have used it before and love it, my suggestion is DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>Does not work as well as the old version.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend trying this as the price, in my opinion, is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Whether I blow dry alone or decide to use hot rollers I still get the same effects.</li>
            <li>ok, not great.  </li>
            <li>I have tried various root boost sprays and I can&#x27;t tell that this one is doing much of anything to help increase the volume of my&lt;br /&gt;hair.&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the other reviews</li>

            <li> ok, not great.  </li>
            <li> I have tried various root boost sprays and I can&#x27;t tell that this one is doing much of anything to help increase the volume of my&lt;br /&gt;hair.&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> but then it tames down to a normal height.</li>
            <li> an essential for those who have flat hair like me.  </li>
            <li> after i blow dry it , it is really big, almost too big.</li>
            <li> i can wash it less frequently now and my hair doesnt get oily.</li>
            <li> The product also came with a broken lid that actually had a huge chunk missing, the remaining lid was taped on, therefore if I did like the product, I couldn&#x27;t travel with it for fear of it being accidentally sprayed into my bag.</li>
            <li> This root boost gives my hair that extra lift it needs without weighing it down or making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I had purchased hot rollers to see if that would work on my very thin and lifeless hair, searching for volumizing products to use with the rollers, I found 10 and decided on this one mainly because I saw a youtube video on the hot rollers and the girl used this product; though skeptical since I have used other products before with no true results.  </li>
            <li> i spray it on the roots and flip my hair and spary the bottom and then blow dry it upside down.</li>
            <li> It helps to blow hair dry upside down.</li>
            <li> The spray barely comes out and the product hardly sizzles out of the can.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get anything that isn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair stiff, crunchy, or sticky, and provides plenty of volume.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what all the rave reviews were about, this product worked...</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t help my hair hardly at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it is fairly thick.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is if you haven&#x27;t used this product and base your choice simply upon the rave reviews (which I now doubt) DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
            <li> Sorry they changed it as I have used it for years</li>
            <li> You can feel it in your hair but not as bad as others I have tried</li>

            <li> this stuff is amazing. my hair is so much fuller than before. after i blow dry it , it is really big, almost too big. but then it tames down to a normal height. i spray it on the roots and flip my hair and spary the bottom and then blow dry it upside down. it doesnt leave my hair oily at all. i can wash it less frequently now and my hair doesnt get oily. this stuff works wonders. an essential for those who have flat hair like me.  snooki must use this stuff for her poof.</li>
            <li> This has a smell but it fades fast. Does not work as well as the old version. Though I still think this is the best root boost to get. You can feel it in your hair but not as bad as others I have tried and it does hold up all day.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it is fairly thick. As a result, it flattens out pretty quickly from the weight. This root boost gives my hair that extra lift it needs without weighing it down or making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Did not like the product. I tried to return it but the date passed of the return option. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT RETURNABLE so unless you have used it before and love it, my suggestion is DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! As I ordered this product I did not see any statement that this product could not be returned. When I contacted Amazon with a return request, I was informed that it could not be returned because it was a &amp;#34;HAZARDOUS MATERIAL&amp;#34;. If it could not be returned because it was considered a &amp;#34;HAZARDOUS MATERIAL&amp;#34;, then how was it able to get shipped too me in the first place?   This product made my hair look greasy, irritated my scalp and did not give my hair more body, i.e., &amp;#34;Boost my roots&amp;#34; for more than a short time. My suggestion is if you haven&#x27;t used this product and base your choice simply upon the rave reviews (which I now doubt) DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  The product also came with a broken lid that actually had a huge chunk missing, the remaining lid was taped on, therefore if I did like the product, I couldn&#x27;t travel with it for fear of it being accidentally sprayed into my bag. If I could give this product and my experience zero stars I would.</li>
            <li> This product has changed, although the description stated it was a mousse , it is not  I do not like this spray and will not use it or buy again. Sorry they changed it as I have used it for years</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have short hair and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get anything that isn&#x27;t too heavy</li>
            <li> I am not sure what all the rave reviews were about, this product worked...ok, not great.  I won&#x27;t be buying anymore.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my hair, this product delivers what it promises.  I had purchased hot rollers to see if that would work on my very thin and lifeless hair, searching for volumizing products to use with the rollers, I found 10 and decided on this one mainly because I saw a youtube video on the hot rollers and the girl used this product; though skeptical since I have used other products before with no true results.  But this truly works, gave me so much volume I didn&#x27;t know what to do never had this much hair LOL,  and it didn&#x27;t just last one day, it lasted 4 days.  Yes, 4 days of gorgeous volume, now I used it everytime I wash my hair.  Whether I blow dry alone or decide to use hot rollers I still get the same effects.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and find the product quite favorable. It does help me to style my hair and hide the places thinning out.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my sister. It arrived fast and she loves this product. She will probably order more when it is finished.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  It helped with volume for the hair.  I will buy it again.  It helps to blow hair dry upside down.</li>
            <li> I use this everytime I wash my hair.  Adds great volume to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> This root boost spray gives my fine hair body and lift. Love it !</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair. I am always looking for something to give my hair a boost. This product didn&#x27;t really do it for me.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this ten stars.  I&#x27;ve got medium/fine, short (above the shoulders), color-treated hair.  After trying dozens of root boosters, I&#x27;ve found the one that really works for me. This is the ONLY root boost/volumizer that I will use.  It does not make my hair stiff, crunchy, or sticky, and provides plenty of volume.  It&#x27;s got a pleasant, light scent and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the volume that I want.  I would definitely recommend trying this as the price, in my opinion, is reasonable.</li>
