            <li>I love that I can do precise lines when I&#x27;m filling in my eyebrows 😊</li>
            <li>Great product that&#x27;s long lasting and the color is a perfect match for my brows..</li>
            <li>it is a bit pricy, you can certainly get good quality brushes for less, but this one perfect</li>
            <li>makes it so easy to blend</li>
            <li>Great product overall :)</li>
            <li>the best eyebrows brush its makes everything very smoth and natural and easy</li>
            <li>but this angled brush is better than my tried and true Japonesque one.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for dip down by anastasia!</li>
            <li>, it works really well to produce a nice arch.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing, but the price is way too much here.</li>
            <li>It is also fairly easy to clean and manage.</li>
            <li>brush is nice, but did not like the gel too much</li>
            <li>I love this brush, Now i can draw my eyebrows early and it&#x27;s given me a nice shape.</li>
            <li>The corkscrew-like brush is very useful, too.  </li>
            <li>(you can wipe away mistakes quickly and easily) but once it does, it&#x27;s there until you wash it off.  </li>
            <li>All the reviews were right!</li>
            <li>Love this brush, it make my work as a make up artist much easier.</li>
            <li>Being able to transition from brushing to shading is very convenient when trying to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the most important thing to have when it comes get your brows done</li>
            <li>Fabulous! Works very well with the pomade worth every penny&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very slim in profile and rather stiff, which is the perfect combination.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great - the brush end is very fine, so it can create thin lines.</li>
            <li>Perfect for eyebrows very firm bristles to make straight lines.</li>
            <li>I use with Anastasia&#x27;s dip brow pomade and is capable of drawing fine lines.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>and I feel it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It helps to create a more natural looking brow.</li>
            <li>I love it ..very specific and detailed brush</li>
            <li>Definitely worth $18</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Work as good as any other.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>Amazing, can&#x27;t believe I went so long without it .</li>
            <li>Thin and precise for great application.</li>
            <li>If I should use just too much pomade, I use the spoolie to fan the color out and a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>With the ULTA version I had to be so very gentle in order to blend.</li>
            <li>Received very fast.</li>
            <li>I actually like this quite a lot better, its easier to be exact with it and leaves a good smooth, thick line .</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Got it when it first came out</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Superb brush that is small enough to handle the tiniest details.  </li>
            <li>It is super precise and the spoolie end makes it easy to tame your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my Anastasia Dipbrow but knew that just any old brush wouldn&#x27;t have it working at its full potential...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and having the brush at the end is an extra bonus.</li>
            <li>The angled brush is so easy to handle and draw the outline above the brow, then gentle brush in the lower part.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a brush and works fine with the Dipbrow Pomade.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to say about this product expect that it does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li>real techinques eyebrow brushes</li>
            <li>Absolute must-have.</li>
            <li>I really like it and don&#x27;t know how I got along without it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>Applies product very well.</li>
            <li>and they work really well together.</li>
            <li>It works really well with the pomade.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>It helps to shape my eyebrows really well.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, helps create precise and thin contouring lined and blends the color well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and glide the product right on.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend so much money on a particular brush</li>
            <li>and it has held up pretty well this far</li>
            <li>Great product, took a little longer to ship than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like $18 at Ulta and Sephora, I highly recommend you check it out there before buying it here.</li>
            <li>For what it is the price seems high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality brush</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it you are buying the Dipbrow.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>That would be worth the extra star.  </li>
            <li>It has a brush on one end, and a fine pencil on the other end, which enables you to draw on life like brows and do expert outlines for your brows.</li>
            <li>In live with this brush.</li>
            <li>I bought the ULTA version first to save money, but now that I have this one, I can never go back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pencil and powders with limited success.  </li>
            <li>When comparing this one with my friend&#x27;s, the bristles on her mini (the #7 brush) are a tiny bit firmer and more tightly packed, so they make a cleaner line.</li>
            <li>With this brush you still want to be gentle of course, but I can press so much harder and the brush really controls the color.</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft and let&#x27;s you put on the eyebrow color (Anastasia&#x27;s dip brow)</li>
            <li>That way you can blend the color and make you eyebrows look natural</li>
            <li>so lightly, so you can build it up, and it doesn&#x27;t just give you a big dark streak like the ULTA version was doing.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because the price is too high by about 6 bucks.  </li>
            <li>Pencils never look quite right either and don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>Slim angled brush lays down believable color onto the skin, little twirly brush smooths and grooms.</li>
            <li>but it works better than other brushes I had in the past.</li>
            <li>It picks up enough product, the bristles arent too stiff or flimsy, just right.</li>
            <li>You just need a little bit, and the color is solid and pretty.</li>
            <li>The basic Sephora eyebrow brush I was using before this was much wider and thicker and at first I thought this one would be too thin.</li>

            <li> I feel like an ARTISTE now when I&#x27;m applying :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with my purchase. .</li>
            <li> Love using this brush to apply my Anastasia brow powder .</li>

            <li> Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush</li>
            <li> I really love the Dipbrow product,  </li>
            <li> It helps refine and fill in my too-sparse brows making them looking more polished and defined.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush...even out eyebrow pencil marks with ease.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> It also comes in a plastic protector which I keep mine in to keep it safe in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I do love this brush:-)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ...</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush and the duo ends.  </li>
            <li> A good brush really does make a difference!</li>
            <li> I love that I can do precise lines when I&#x27;m filling in my eyebrows 😊</li>
            <li> Great product that&#x27;s long lasting and the color is a perfect match for my brows..</li>
            <li> it is a bit pricy, you can certainly get good quality brushes for less, but this one perfect</li>
            <li> makes it so easy to blend</li>
            <li> Great product overall :)</li>
            <li> the best eyebrows brush its makes everything very smoth and natural and easy</li>
            <li> but this angled brush is better than my tried and true Japonesque one.  </li>
            <li> Perfect size for dip down by anastasia!</li>
            <li> , it works really well to produce a nice arch.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, but the price is way too much here.</li>
            <li> It is also fairly easy to clean and manage.</li>
            <li> brush is nice, but did not like the gel too much</li>
            <li> I love this brush, Now i can draw my eyebrows early and it&#x27;s given me a nice shape.</li>
            <li> The corkscrew-like brush is very useful, too.  </li>
            <li> (you can wipe away mistakes quickly and easily) but once it does, it&#x27;s there until you wash it off.  </li>
            <li> All the reviews were right!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it make my work as a make up artist much easier.</li>
            <li> Being able to transition from brushing to shading is very convenient when trying to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the most important thing to have when it comes get your brows done</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Works very well with the pomade worth every penny&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slim in profile and rather stiff, which is the perfect combination.  </li>
            <li> This brush is great - the brush end is very fine, so it can create thin lines.</li>
            <li> Perfect for eyebrows very firm bristles to make straight lines.</li>
            <li> I use with Anastasia&#x27;s dip brow pomade and is capable of drawing fine lines.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> and I feel it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It helps to create a more natural looking brow.</li>
            <li> I love it ..very specific and detailed brush</li>
            <li> Definitely worth $18</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Work as good as any other.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Amazing, can&#x27;t believe I went so long without it .</li>
            <li> Thin and precise for great application.</li>
            <li> If I should use just too much pomade, I use the spoolie to fan the color out and a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> With the ULTA version I had to be so very gentle in order to blend.</li>
            <li> Received very fast.</li>
            <li> I actually like this quite a lot better, its easier to be exact with it and leaves a good smooth, thick line .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Got it when it first came out</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Superb brush that is small enough to handle the tiniest details.  </li>
            <li> It is super precise and the spoolie end makes it easy to tame your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Anastasia Dipbrow but knew that just any old brush wouldn&#x27;t have it working at its full potential...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and having the brush at the end is an extra bonus.</li>
            <li> The angled brush is so easy to handle and draw the outline above the brow, then gentle brush in the lower part.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a brush and works fine with the Dipbrow Pomade.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say about this product expect that it does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> real techinques eyebrow brushes</li>
            <li> Absolute must-have.</li>
            <li> I really like it and don&#x27;t know how I got along without it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> Applies product very well.</li>
            <li> and they work really well together.</li>
            <li> It works really well with the pomade.  </li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> It helps to shape my eyebrows really well.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, helps create precise and thin contouring lined and blends the color well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and glide the product right on.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much money on a particular brush</li>
            <li> and it has held up pretty well this far</li>
            <li> Great product, took a little longer to ship than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like $18 at Ulta and Sephora, I highly recommend you check it out there before buying it here.</li>
            <li> For what it is the price seems high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality brush</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it you are buying the Dipbrow.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> That would be worth the extra star.  </li>
            <li> It has a brush on one end, and a fine pencil on the other end, which enables you to draw on life like brows and do expert outlines for your brows.</li>
            <li> In live with this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought the ULTA version first to save money, but now that I have this one, I can never go back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pencil and powders with limited success.  </li>
            <li> When comparing this one with my friend&#x27;s, the bristles on her mini (the #7 brush) are a tiny bit firmer and more tightly packed, so they make a cleaner line.</li>
            <li> With this brush you still want to be gentle of course, but I can press so much harder and the brush really controls the color.</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft and let&#x27;s you put on the eyebrow color (Anastasia&#x27;s dip brow)</li>
            <li> That way you can blend the color and make you eyebrows look natural</li>
            <li> so lightly, so you can build it up, and it doesn&#x27;t just give you a big dark streak like the ULTA version was doing.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because the price is too high by about 6 bucks.  </li>
            <li> Pencils never look quite right either and don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Slim angled brush lays down believable color onto the skin, little twirly brush smooths and grooms.</li>
            <li> but it works better than other brushes I had in the past.</li>
            <li> It picks up enough product, the bristles arent too stiff or flimsy, just right.</li>
            <li> You just need a little bit, and the color is solid and pretty.</li>
            <li> The basic Sephora eyebrow brush I was using before this was much wider and thicker and at first I thought this one would be too thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and precise!</li>
            <li> The one downside is that the angled side oftentimes felt a little too soft as I was applying product to my eyebrows to fill them in.</li>
            <li> This brush is to soft and small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed with this brush...</li>
            <li> The bristles are very stiff and narrowly packed so it really helps with precision.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very noticeable</li>
            <li> Went to the sephora store and was told the brush was not real</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Not in humidity or any other scenario I can think of.  </li>
            <li> The angled brush is SO small making the precision of imitating tiny brow hairs effortless.</li>
            <li> For $18.00 it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I had to get it because the sigma E65 wasn&#x27;t thin enough to keep the product on my brows for long.</li>
            <li> Anastasia products won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> I wish it was slightly stiffer on both the brush and</li>
            <li> This is the brush I previously recommended with my Anastasia pomade purchase.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to start with a little pomade and brush in the direction of the brow hairs.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to set</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, but I wish it was thinner</li>
            <li> It is firm but not too stiff.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have one yet, you&#x27;re missing out!</li>
            <li> brush was just a bit too small</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the other, mascara-wand type end; I don&#x27;t have enough eyebrow hair to use it :(</li>
            <li> This might have to do with the fact that my eyebrows are fairly thick, nonetheless, it does the job well.</li>
            <li> I always keep it in the case it came in and still the thin brush head has fallen off.</li>
            <li> and it finally took a crap today.</li>
            <li> But I could never get a truly thin line with it because it&#x27;s designed to work with powdered brow products.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed I order this brush with high expectations and when it arrived it was broken!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with eyebrows, and I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone who has them!</li>
            <li> In the end, this frustrated me</li>
            <li> Bought the brush to use with the dipbrow (which I hated).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a really good brush and I&#x27;m happy with it. However, I would recommend getting the mini instead if you&#x27;re using it for the powder. When comparing this one with my friend&#x27;s, the bristles on her mini (the #7 brush) are a tiny bit firmer and more tightly packed, so they make a cleaner line. It&#x27;s not very noticeable but I would have wanted the hair on bristles of this brush to be tighter towards the ends.</li>
            <li> Gonna take a lot if practice to get a hang of it but it&#x27;s worth a try. Just like an artist learns how to master a paintbrush so it is with this one.....</li>
            <li> Great product, took a little longer to ship than I expected.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Works very well with the pomade worth every penny&lt;br /&gt; Check them out</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for applying Anastasia dipbrow pomade. The basic Sephora eyebrow brush I was using before this was much wider and thicker and at first I thought this one would be too thin. I actually like this quite a lot better, its easier to be exact with it and leaves a good smooth, thick line . I especially like the way its angled, it works really well to produce a nice arch. All in all it is a bit pricy, you can certainly get good quality brushes for less, but this one perfect and I feel it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It is super precise and Great brow brush! love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Anastasia Dipbrow but knew that just any old brush wouldn&#x27;t have it working at its full potential... because of the Dipbrow&#x27;s mousse-like texture. So when I viewed this brush online I had to try it. It is the PERFECT tool for my Dipbrow!!! It&#x27;s very thin and precise! I feel like an ARTISTE now when I&#x27;m applying :) I can&#x27;t comment on the other, mascara-wand type end; I don&#x27;t have enough eyebrow hair to use it :(</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say about this product expect that it does what it is intended to do. It&#x27;s a brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It helps to create a more natural looking brow. It&#x27;s easy to use and having the brush at the end is an extra bonus.</li>
            <li> I love it ..very specific and detailed brush</li>
            <li> Love it. Best eyebrow brush I have every used. Definitely worth $18</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, but the price is way too much here. It&#x27;s like $18 at Ulta and Sephora, I highly recommend you check it out there before buying it here.</li>
            <li> the perfect brow brush.  The necessary accompaniment to the dipbrow gel from Anastasia.  It&#x27;s light, easy to use, and the spooly is perfect for blending the gel into the brow.  Great tool, a must have for brow gel/pomade.</li>
            <li> Best brush for my brows! Use it with my dipbrow pomade comes  out flawless everytime</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed with this brush...I always keep it in the case it came in and still the thin brush head has fallen off. For the price, you would expect better quality!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Love it</li>
            <li> Daughter had this and was heartbroken when she lost it. Requested a replacement for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, great control. Worth the price</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying make up on the eyebrows.  Very precise.</li>
            <li> Best brush you can use to fill in brows; love it.</li>
            <li> This quality of the brush is befitting of the price. It is a good size and it works well. It is also fairly easy to clean and manage. Overall, I am very happy with it. The one downside is that the angled side oftentimes felt a little too soft as I was applying product to my eyebrows to fill them in. This might have to do with the fact that my eyebrows are fairly thick, nonetheless, it does the job well.</li>
            <li> This pencil is awesome. It has a brush on one end, and a fine pencil on the other end, which enables you to draw on life like brows and do expert outlines for your brows. It stays all day, &amp; I trust it..</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>

            <li> This brush is beyond awesome!!!!! I use with Anastasia&#x27;s dip brow pomade and is capable of drawing fine lines. Definitely recommend for those that have to draw on eyebrows. I have also used the brush with appling the pomade as eyeliner which also works excellent!! Great buy!!</li>
            <li> A must have with the Dipbrow pomade (which I LOVE!!!).</li>

            <li> In live with this brush. This is pretty much the most important thing to have when it comes get your brows done</li>
            <li> Loved this brush while it lasted. Got it when it first came out and it finally took a crap today. All the bristles came out. I&#x27;m going to try Tarte&#x27;s now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type the type that would NEVER spend over $10 on a makeup product. However, this is my only exception. Best brush ever!</li>

            <li> Perfect size for dip down by anastasia!</li>
            <li> I have been using a brush from my Beauty shop.  I will be going back to it.  This brush is to soft and small.  For $18.00 it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush to transform eyebrows that are not quite in &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s two ends are genius for&lt;br /&gt;exactly the right touches for a perfectly shaped brow!  You can tell it was thought through leaving&lt;br /&gt;it easy for anyone to use!</li>
            <li> My favorite angled brush ever!</li>
            <li> Went to the sephora store and was told the brush was not real</li>
            <li> For what it is the price seems high. Overall, it is a brush and works fine with the Dipbrow Pomade.</li>
            <li> Handy applicator for applying dip brow color.  I wish it was slightly stiffer on both the brush and the spooly ends.  That would be worth the extra star.  Other than that, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> very handy, the grip and angle very amazing!</li>
            <li> Nice brush, helps create precise and thin contouring lined and blends the color well</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Best eyebrows of my life</li>
            <li> I love this brush, Now i can draw my eyebrows early and it&#x27;s given me a nice shape. Brilliant</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s the best eyebrow brush/fine tip brush I have ever used. Goes great with the Anastasia Beverly Hills dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li> Great! Applies dip brow perfectly</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift and the recipient won&#x27;t shut up about how amazing this brush truly is! She tried it on me and I noticed a difference right away. This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Absolute must-have. I use both ends of this brush with my Anastasia Dip Brow Pomade and it makes me so happy. I&#x27;m obsessed with eyebrows, and I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone who has them!</li>
            <li> makes it so easy to blend</li>
            <li> Great product that&#x27;s long lasting and the color is a perfect match for my brows..I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with my purchase. .</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This brush is a must when applying Anastasia&#x27;s dip brow pomade. It makes the eyebrow makeup go on flawlessly and in no time</li>
            <li> This brush is like heaven for my eyebrows! A good brush really does make a difference!</li>
            <li> I loveeeee this brush . It does its job perfectly!</li>
            <li> Everyone definitely needs this brush! This is the best brush I have every used!</li>
            <li> I use this to do my eyebrows. Works great!</li>
            <li> The best eyebrow brush</li>
            <li> Works great with the dip brow which I also rated 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The best! Perfect width for a smooth precise application</li>
            <li> I love this brush with my brow pomade, like everyone else says this works great with it. I was hesitant to spend so much money on a particular brush but I had to get it because the sigma E65 wasn&#x27;t thin enough to keep the product on my brows for long. Great product overall :)</li>
            <li> Love using this brush to apply my Anastasia brow powder . I love that it&#x27;s a duo purpose brush and it has held up pretty well this far</li>
            <li> i use this brush every day and it works excellent. Perfect for putting the powder on my brows.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Works very well! I use it with my Anastasia Beverly Hills Dip Brow product.</li>
            <li> This is the brush I previously recommended with my Anastasia pomade purchase.  They work beautifully together.  Just remember to start with a little pomade and brush in the direction of the brow hairs.  If I should use just too much pomade, I use the spoolie to fan the color out and a more natural look.  Another excellent product for brows.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  All the reviews were right!</li>
            <li> Love this brush it&#x27;s soft and glide the product right on.  I recommend this to all makeup artists and makeup lovers.</li>
            <li> I tried using the Ardell version of this brush but the angled brush was so flimsy so I gave in and made this purchase. I do not regret it! Best brow decision ever!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it but this angled brush is better than my tried and true Japonesque one.  I ordered this brush because I needed to draw a finer line with the Anastasia Dipbrow pomade.  I really love the Dipbrow product,  It helps refine and fill in my too-sparse brows making them looking more polished and defined.  The pomade simply doesn&#x27;t budge.  Not in humidity or any other scenario I can think of.  It takes a few minutes to set (you can wipe away mistakes quickly and easily) but once it does, it&#x27;s there until you wash it off.  I&#x27;ve tried pencil and powders with limited success.  Powders wear away during the day and change color because my skin is oily and that&#x27;s just what happens.  Pencils never look quite right either and don&#x27;t last very long.  I&#x27;ve been using Dipbrow for a year now and would never use anything else.  This brush is essential.  It&#x27;s very slim in profile and rather stiff, which is the perfect combination.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money for this brush so I used my Japonesque brush instead. But I could never get a truly thin line with it because it&#x27;s designed to work with powdered brow products.  In the end, this frustrated me so I coughed up the cash and bought this brush.  I really like it and don&#x27;t know how I got along without it.  I highly recommend it.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because the price is too high by about 6 bucks.  Otherwise, I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it make my work as a make up artist much easier. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Awesome brush does the job</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. I use it with Anastasia BH Dip Brow. Applies product very well. It is firm but not too stiff. It&#x27;s a high quality brush and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect partner for Dipbrow Pomade.  Slim angled brush lays down believable color onto the skin, little twirly brush smooths and grooms.</li>
            <li> Superb brush that is small enough to handle the tiniest details.  The spiral side separates the brow well.</li>
            <li> I just tried on today. It is a great product. You just need a little bit, and the color is solid and pretty.</li>
            <li> I thought this was just an overpriced name brand, but this product is seriously superior in quality! I bought the ULTA version first to save money, but now that I have this one, I can never go back. The brush is so soft and let&#x27;s you put on the eyebrow color (Anastasia&#x27;s dip brow) so lightly, so you can build it up, and it doesn&#x27;t just give you a big dark streak like the ULTA version was doing. With the ULTA version I had to be so very gentle in order to blend. With this brush you still want to be gentle of course, but I can press so much harder and the brush really controls the color. That way you can blend the color and make you eyebrows look natural</li>
            <li> This brush is great - the brush end is very fine, so it can create thin lines. The spooly end is bendable and great for using with dipbrow.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush for brows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but my cheaper brand works just as good</li>
            <li> Love this brush...even out eyebrow pencil marks with ease.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s my favorite eyebrow brush and works great with the Anastasia dipbrow pomade.  It achieves nice precise lines and the spoolie works great for blending.</li>
            <li> Nice brush but way too pricey</li>
            <li> Work as good as any other.</li>
            <li> I really liked this pencil, it lived up to the hype. Being able to transition from brushing to shading is very convenient when trying to do my eyebrows. I would highly recommend it you are buying the Dipbrow. It also comes in a plastic protector which I keep mine in to keep it safe in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> This is the brush specifically for the dip brow pomade. Let me tell you it makes a HUGE difference! The angled brush is SO small making the precision of imitating tiny brow hairs effortless. I truly suggest this brush to anyone using the Anastasia Beverly Hills Dip Brow Pomade!</li>
            <li> Bought the brush to use with the dipbrow (which I hated). I do love this brush:-) It picks up enough product, the bristles arent too stiff or flimsy, just right. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me. I love it.I finally found the perfect eyebrow brush. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush was recommended to come with the Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade.  The angled brush is so easy to handle and draw the outline above the brow, then gentle brush in the lower part.  The corkscrew-like brush is very useful, too.  See my review on the Dipbrow Pomade.  They both arrived at my door in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow brush I&#x27;ve ever had! The bristles are very stiff and narrowly packed so it really helps with precision.  Bought this with the Anastasia Dipbrow and they work really well together.</li>
            <li> the best eyebrows brush its makes everything very smoth and natural and easy</li>
            <li> Good product. I use this everyday, but I wish it was thinner but it works better than other brushes I had in the past. When I order another one I will order it thinner.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush! Anastasia products won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> Very happy. Received very fast. Will def order again 💜</li>
            <li> Great precision and quality! Absolutely love this product. It is the only one I&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing...I have been using a generic brand one for my eyebrows and boy I wish I would of purchaed this one ages ago. It is super precise and the spoolie end makes it easy to tame your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Amazing !! LOVE IT ...</li>
            <li> spooley fell off after a month..but brush works great</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this.  It works really well with the pomade.  Perfect angle and easy to use.  Great quality and ease of appliation.  I am so happy about this product.</li>

            <li> I love this tool it works wonders my eyebrows look amazing!</li>
            <li> The brush is just perfect for applying the dipbrow pomade. Flawless application.</li>
