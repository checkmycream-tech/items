            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I would layer both the lotion and the perfume (and sometimes the body wash too), but the lotion was by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I find the lotion is just right in strength of scent.</li>
            <li>The spray smells a bit like alcohol when first applied, so I prefer the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I had so many people ask me what I was wearing whenever I had this lotion on (which was daily).  </li>

            <li>The Lovely scent is beautifully subtle and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>It is subtle, and leaves one wanting more.  </li>
            <li>Over the past several years I have sampled many spring/summer fragrances.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic and not overwhelming.      </li>
            <li>Totally unfair to the consumers who have loved this product for so long, and now we have to pay through the nose for it?!  </li>
            <li>Same as my old standard.  </li>
            <li>When the price comes down to a reasonable rate, let me know.</li>

            <li> The scent is \\&quot;lovely\\&quot; but not long-lasting.  You have to keep applying it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I buy it on Amazon because the price is great and it arrives so quickly.  Lovely is a light flowery fragrance and whenever I wear it people comment on how wonderful I smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the gift set in the past with the eau de parfum spray and body lotion, and didn&#x27;t care for the spray too much, but loved the body lotion.  Maybe the spray was too strong for me but the body lotion is very very lovely, and it lasts all day, I could still smell it at night when I changed my clothes before bedtime. It even seems to smell better as the day goes on.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Over the past several years I have sampled many spring/summer fragrances.  A coworker gave me \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; as a birthday gift.  I continually receive compliments on this soft floral fragrance.  The spray smells a bit like alcohol when first applied, so I prefer the lotion.  I would recommend \\&quot;Lovely\\&quot; to women who enjoy an understated fragrance.</li>

            <li> Sarah Jessica Parker Lovely body lotion is a beautiful, long lasting scent lotion.  It has a floral, sweet smelling scent that goes so wonderfully with the Lovely Parfum.  What a total shame that this product is discontinued (or so I have heard).</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years and now that it is not available in the stores they are selling it for 80 dollars?  Regular price is 34.  Rip off!</li>
            <li> The body lotion Lovely has a great clean scent, however it does not stay with you for long. It is priced high for the quality of the lotion and longevity of the scent.Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker, again nice clean scent but does not last.</li>

            <li> The only thing better than the perfume is the lotion! Fast shipping and it came well packaged. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments when wearing this fragrance than any other. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s discontinued!!! Please bring it back!</li>
            <li> My fav but cannot find anymore.</li>
            <li> Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker is a wonderful clean fragrance and lasts all day.  I receive compliments everywhere I go and especially while standing in line at the grocery store or just shopping.  I do wish they made the shower gel in the 6.7 size it is so nice to be able to layer the fragrance.  I love ordering though Amazon because they can be trusted and the product always arrives in good shape and on time.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe a vendor would advertise Lovely Lotion for $186.00.  Last year I only paid about 20.00.  TALK ABOUT INFLATION!  When the price comes down to a reasonable rate, let me know.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is lovely.  It&#x27;s hard to find now, which is sad.  Same as my old standard.  But diehard fans can usually locate their discontinued favorites here.</li>
            <li> Please bring this lotion back!!!!  I had so many people ask me what I was wearing whenever I had this lotion on (which was daily).  I have tried to find lotions that are similar in scent and I cannot duplicate this one.  I would layer both the lotion and the perfume (and sometimes the body wash too), but the lotion was by far my favorite.  It is just a clean, fresh, smell that brought so many compliments.  Amazon, can you help us get this lotion back at a reasonable price???!!!</li>
            <li> I am constantly complimented on my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;.  I find the lotion is just right in strength of scent. It is subtle, and leaves one wanting more.  Many times, from both men and women, I been told \\&quot;You smell great!  What are you wearing?\\&quot;  I am down to my last one.............PLEASE, PLEASE make it available again!</li>
