    <ol>
            <li>Works amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>but this is the best one I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After my 144 hour trial period, I wasn&#x27;t too terribly impressed</li>
            <li>handled that perfectly.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked this good in 20 years!</li>
            <li>I still use this product and my skin continues to do great with it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for cleaning face and shaving; smooth feel.</li>
            <li>I had tried a sample of this product and was very impressed with the results, that is why I bought the full sized tube.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve figured out what works best for me to do is to gently (and</li>
            <li>One Murad product I tried that was particularly effective for my acne was the Murad Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel.  </li>
            <li>but it also isn&#x27;t as effective.    </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there..</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll give it one more week and then update my review to see if there is any improvement.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and my skin is more even</li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect balance with this Murad product.</li>
            <li>I swiftly found a Sephora and bought some more</li>
            <li>but indeed my acne was better.</li>
            <li>I love my skin and will continue this product.</li>
            <li>so what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li>not longer need concealer and only wear a light foundation because my skin on it&#x27;s own is looking really smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li>true!</li>
            <li>After using half the bottle, I have to say I am pleasantly impressed.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how quickly it begins working!</li>
            <li>You just need a light layer on your skin for it to do its job.</li>
            <li>works great for my teenage daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Skin felt good and not dry.</li>
            <li>Great product and shipped as expected.</li>
            <li>also fast shipping:)</li>
            <li>gentle on skin, love it.</li>
            <li>It made me break out more than ever, and didn&#x27;t really help at all.</li>
            <li>(Luckily I didn&#x27;t start taking it).</li>
            <li>I no longer get breakouts and rarely get any pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I rarely get any pimples and when I do it</li>
            <li>and now I rarely breaking out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but this stuff is worth it.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I received wasn&#x27;t too full</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I follow the instructions and wash my face with it every morning and night and right now</li>
            <li>Do not use over acne medication since it causes your face to burn when mixed or put on top of one another.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well</li>
            <li>I figured with such potent products that they would be working faster.</li>
            <li>Absolutely noticed a difference after the first day of using this product.</li>
            <li>I have found that in the winter I need a light moisturizer because my skin dries out more (not sure if this is because of the product or my skin).  </li>
            <li>Very high quality product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear up my acne over night, but it did get rid of a lot of the smaller issues over night, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any more large break outs since I&#x27;ve been using it either.</li>
            <li>Especially this huge price difference between Amazon and Sephora or Ulta.</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>The product was very helpful in clearing my skin.      </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Just be gentle and apply this stuff</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference using this face cream.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Good mattifier, but felt like sunscreen since it was so thick and smelled like it too.</li>
            <li>First I use the Clarifying Cleanser to get a clean start, I pat my face with a towel (doesn&#x27;t have to be 100% dry)</li>
            <li>I have used Murad Acne Clearing products for the past year and my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>That being said, everyone&#x27;s skin is unique and this is only my personal experience, so take this review for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference almost immediately, and in just 3 days my acne was cleared up completely!!</li>
            <li>After trying everything under the sun I finally found the right products for my skin.</li>
            <li>The new product just doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>I first saw this product as a sephora sampler for a three day trial to &amp;#34;see the 72 hour difference&amp;#34; and the lady actually gave me two packs because the sample promotion was over.</li>
            <li>It works a little bit, not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li>Helps my skin stay clear...</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m completely clear, which I haven&#x27;t been in years.</li>
            <li>Used for a month didn&#x27;t really notice a different.</li>
            <li>I had used the Murad Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel and it was the only product to actually clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m back to clear.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I get the deep cystic acne and it is relentless.</li>
            <li>My acne didn&#x27;t get better, or worse, and it didn&#x27;t shorten the lifespan of my pimples.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and watery instead, which feels much cleaner and traps less oil.</li>
            <li>Granted, it doesn&#x27;t burn for the first few minutes after application like the Exfoliating Gel</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I hate acne, but I also don&#x27;t want to spend 30 minutes making sure that Benzoyl Peroxide is absorbed</li>
            <li> For something so expensive, I expected it to do more.</li>
            <li> But I returned it as it did not clear up my skin as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> No matter what other brands I have tried, I always come back to Murad.    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just little tiny bumps rather than red acne.</li>
            <li> I mean gently) poke the bump with a small sewing needle (after I&#x27;ve washed my face) to open it up then put the Acne Clearing Solution on it.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for the entire range, but so well worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff contains Salicylic Acid, but isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; like some of the other products out there.</li>
            <li> My two big pimples were gone and life wasn&#x27;t so hard with acne</li>
            <li> It seems to go down faster this way.</li>
            <li> less than a week</li>
            <li> It shrinks my boil-like acne bumps down faster than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past (and trust me, I&#x27;ve used A LOT of products).</li>
            <li> Actually made me breakout worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with acne since a was a teenager</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> It made my pores appear much small and also cleared up side cheek acne that I&#x27;ve had a problem with forever.</li>
            <li> Acne no more.</li>
            <li> skin is combination dry and oily and it suffered from random breakouts.</li>
            <li> I will give it a couple of stars for the shipper, and for the fact that it didn&#x27;t negatively affect my skin.</li>
            <li> And they work alright, but a tad slow.</li>
            <li> When I turned 25 it got way worse, and I panicked.</li>
            <li> I was braking out every day with horrible cystic acne and it was leaving giant scars all over my cheeks and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stains/bleaches hair/towels/clothes and is dangerous if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I hate Benzoyl Peroxide!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst zit medicine ever.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good mattifier, but felt like sunscreen since it was so thick and smelled like it too. Decen hydration for oily skin. Do not use over acne medication since it causes your face to burn when mixed or put on top of one another.</li>
            <li> true! you do see results within couple days!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well but I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there..</li>
            <li> Works amazing!!!! Love this stuff also fast shipping:)</li>
            <li> Love this product! Would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with Murad&#x27;s Acne Clarifying Cleanser and their Clarifying Wipes. And they work alright, but a tad slow. I figured with such potent products that they would be working faster. But I&#x27;ll give it one more week and then update my review to see if there is any improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I pair it with the murad face wash and my skin has never been clearer. You just need a light layer on your skin for it to do its job. I tried multiple different brands before this but this is the best one I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is combination dry and oily and it suffered from random breakouts. I no longer get breakouts and rarely get any pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I still use this product and my skin continues to do great with it.  I have found that in the winter I need a light moisturizer because my skin dries out more (not sure if this is because of the product or my skin).  I rarely get any pimples and when I do it is often because I have not used this on my face the night before.  I only apply once a day after I wash my face</li>
            <li> works great for my teenage daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> This does not work at all for me. I had used the Murad Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel and it was the only product to actually clear up my skin. Why did they replace it with this? It does absolutely nothing for my skin. My pores are back to being clogged. I have tried 3 containers of this clearing solution and will not be purchasing another.</li>
            <li> Absolutely noticed a difference after the first day of using this product. It made my pores appear much small and also cleared up side cheek acne that I&#x27;ve had a problem with forever. I wouldn&#x27;t even go a day without it now.</li>
            <li> This (along with the Clarifying Cleanser) has been my saving grace. It shrinks my boil-like acne bumps down faster than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past (and trust me, I&#x27;ve used A LOT of products). I&#x27;ve figured out what works best for me to do is to gently (and I mean gently) poke the bump with a small sewing needle (after I&#x27;ve washed my face) to open it up then put the Acne Clearing Solution on it. It seems to go down faster this way.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away.  I use this along with the clarifying cleanser, spot treatment and the oil-control mattifier moisturizer with spf 15.  It didn&#x27;t clear up my acne over night, but it did get rid of a lot of the smaller issues over night, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any more large break outs since I&#x27;ve been using it either.</li>
            <li> I have used Murad Acne Clearing products for the past year and my skin looks and feels amazing. After trying everything under the sun I finally found the right products for my skin.</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample of this product and was very impressed with the results, that is why I bought the full sized tube.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Acne no more. Very expensive for the entire range, but so well worth it. My skin has never looked this good in 20 years!</li>
            <li> This stuff saved my skin! I was braking out every day with horrible cystic acne and it was leaving giant scars all over my cheeks and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In less than a week I started noticing my skin clearing up and now I rarely breaking out and my skin is more even and the scars are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not longer need concealer and only wear a light foundation because my skin on it&#x27;s own is looking really smooth and beautiful. I swear by this stuff now! It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li> gentle on skin, love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Helps my skin stay clear...</li>
            <li> Works for us. 3rd reorder.  Doesn&#x27;t bleach the heck out of everything either.</li>
            <li> Actually made me breakout worse.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped as expected.</li>
            <li> Very high quality product. Skin felt good and not dry. But I returned it as it did not clear up my skin as I had hoped. This was my last resort before trying medication.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for almost 20 years.  No matter what other brands I have tried, I always come back to Murad.    One Murad product I tried that was particularly effective for my acne was the Murad Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel.  The product was very helpful in clearing my skin.      Murad discontinued the product to replace it with the Acne Clearing Solution.  The new product just doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Granted, it doesn&#x27;t burn for the first few minutes after application like the Exfoliating Gel did but it also isn&#x27;t as effective.    Please Murad, bring back the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel!!</li>
            <li> It works a little bit, not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but this stuff is worth it. I&#x27;ve had trouble with acne since a was a teenager (I&#x27;m now 27). When I turned 25 it got way worse, and I panicked. I bought every type of treatment you can imagine and even got prescribed Accutane (Luckily I didn&#x27;t start taking it). I hate acne, but I also don&#x27;t want to spend 30 minutes making sure that Benzoyl Peroxide is absorbed and I get a moisterizer to combat the inflamation/burning as a result. I hate Benzoyl Peroxide!! It stains/bleaches hair/towels/clothes and is dangerous if you ask me. I finally found the perfect balance with this Murad product. First I use the Clarifying Cleanser to get a clean start, I pat my face with a towel (doesn&#x27;t have to be 100% dry), then I apply this Clearing Solution all over my face and leave it there all day. I do the same thing before going to bed. I try to do it at 12-hour intervals for regularity. If I go swimming or get sweaty and take a shower, no problem; just re-apply. This stuff contains Salicylic Acid, but isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; like some of the other products out there. It&#x27;s clear and watery instead, which feels much cleaner and traps less oil. This stuff really works. Naturally, I get the deep cystic acne and it is relentless. Now I&#x27;m completely clear, which I haven&#x27;t been in years. Just be gentle and apply this stuff and it&#x27;ll do the trick. If you feel your skin still looks too oily try the Oil-Control Mattifier afterwards. I know this stuff works because I went travelling recently and lost my travel-size bottles for about 5 days. After the 3rd day, I started breaking out again and got several deep cystic zits. I swiftly found a Sephora and bought some more and now I&#x27;m back to clear. Yay! Try it.</li>
            <li> Excellent for cleaning face and shaving; smooth feel.</li>
            <li> I will give it a couple of stars for the shipper, and for the fact that it didn&#x27;t negatively affect my skin. I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference using this face cream. My acne didn&#x27;t get better, or worse, and it didn&#x27;t shorten the lifespan of my pimples. For something so expensive, I expected it to do more.</li>
            <li> All I gotta say is this actually works. I first saw this product as a sephora sampler for a three day trial to &amp;#34;see the 72 hour difference&amp;#34; and the lady actually gave me two packs because the sample promotion was over. After my 144 hour trial period, I wasn&#x27;t too terribly impressed but indeed my acne was better. My two big pimples were gone and life wasn&#x27;t so hard with acne haha. So I went and purchased this product on Amazon. The first bottle I received wasn&#x27;t too full but that&#x27;s an issue with the seller and Amazon handled that perfectly. After using half the bottle, I have to say I am pleasantly impressed. I follow the instructions and wash my face with it every morning and night and right now, my skin is just experiencing the &amp;#34;purging stage&amp;#34; where the yucky stuff gets out and it&#x27;s just little tiny bumps rather than red acne. I love my skin and will continue this product. Especially this huge price difference between Amazon and Sephora or Ulta. This product works so what more can I ask for? This coming from someone who has tried proactive and Amway&#x27;s line of acne cleansers.</li>
            <li> It made me break out more than ever, and didn&#x27;t really help at all. That being said, everyone&#x27;s skin is unique and this is only my personal experience, so take this review for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This is the worst zit medicine ever.  I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for a month now on the same spot and the spot is still there! Washing face at night. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 and I got this as a sample from Sephora.  I use it in the T-zone and it helps keeps the blackheads away.  Would recommend to anyone needing some extra control.</li>
            <li> Used for a month didn&#x27;t really notice a different.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how quickly it begins working! I noticed the difference almost immediately, and in just 3 days my acne was cleared up completely!!</li>
