            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>but it is very close.  </li>
            <li>But for a lot of ailments it worked very well indeed, fast and without fuss.  </li>
            <li>they heal really fast...</li>
            <li>The salve drew out infections and healed sore&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li>thanks for always fulfilling my needs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It costs more than the average salve</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really rate until I see what incredients are listed and try the new version.</li>
            <li>we shall  see what the new one  holds</li>
            <li>Forget the entire shelf of first aid creams at the store and buy this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the same exact formula as the old stuff</li>

            <li>Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;This was used when I was a little girl - and it&#x27;s very hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li>I haven&#x60;t been able to find it in our local stores lately, then I tried Amazon and presto</li>
            <li>Very disapointed in the last jars from several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I find the same incredients as the very old  salve being in the newest jar I will buy</li>
            <li>It is in an area that is hard to keep clean if you get my meaning.  </li>

            <li> Price is a little much, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Symans Salve has been used by my family for years.  It is a great skin healer for cuts, scratches, ect.  I haven&#x60;t been able to find it in our local stores lately, then I tried Amazon and presto I can get it! Thanks a lot. John Hays</li>
            <li> Love this salve...just have had for the last50 years</li>
            <li> I grew up with sayman salve.... my mom put in on any and every ow-ie big or small.  I&#x27;ve used it for the last 40 years or so.  Since then it&#x27;s harder and harder to find.  But I can find online.  I actually bought this batch to restock my mom&#x27;s supply.  She can no-longer find it locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on chapped lips, sore/red noses(during allergy season), cuts, burns, scrapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Saymans salve is an excellent product. An all-purpose remedy, it&#x27;s been in use by my family for four generations, beginning with my great grandmother. I was happy to  learn that the product is available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this on wounds. It is hard to find Sayman Salve now, the stores just don&#x27;t carry it. It costs more than the average salve but it works!! Heals scrapes, gashes, &amp; burns leaving little to no scars. Works to improve older wounds too! The tongue on my lace-up shoes and my bra shoulder strap leaves dark rub marks, Sayman removes the abrasions by using it everyday. I&#x27;m sticking with what works. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is by far our go to ointment when ever we have a burn, cut, scrape or any other first aid need. I was originally&lt;br /&gt;given this to use by my sister-in-law over 20 years ago and I have used it ever since.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and found it be the most effective salve or ointment to cure skin eruptions or blemishes</li>
            <li> The best medicated salve on the market!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 50 years.  It is great for cuts, burns, cracks on fingers in winter and chapped hands.</li>
            <li> My family has used this for generations. My father has skin lupus and this is the only stuff that helps!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend.  She has been using it for years and loves it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Originally found this product at a retail store and purchase it to relieve a itchy rash.  It cured the rash and stopped the itching.  Since then have used it for a variety of things and it has proven to be very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years &amp; nothing compares to it. It doesn&#x27;t sting, burn, or anything else when applied to the affective area. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My grandmother introduced me to this product many years ago.  There was a time when you could order it in the drugstores, but that has changed.  I am just so pleased that it is still available.  I am a senior and still love this product. I have never found anything to match it.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it. Excellent balm for sunburn. Takes away the sting and overnight, the color recedes too. Great product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I grew up using this stuff for 40 years and I&#x27;m puzzled why you cant no longer get it locally.  I had a cut that would not heal for close to a year, so I found this and I&#x27;m currently treating it.  It is in an area that is hard to keep clean if you get my meaning.  So it needs a cream that stays put and gives a chance to heal.  They just don&#x27;t sell stuff like this at the pharmacy.  This isn&#x27;t the same exact formula as the old stuff but it is very close.  You have to wash twice with soap to remove it, exactly what you need if you want to protect a small wound that keeps opening or a burn.  Forget the entire shelf of first aid creams at the store and buy this stuff.  Glad I found it my wound already feels better and is no longer scarring and ripping.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the same formula as you are use to.  It is not even manufactured by Lee Pharmaceuticals.  The name has been bought out and who knows what changes the manufacturer made to the formula.  Buy at own risk!!!</li>
            <li> I was visiting a friend who gave me this product to try.&lt;br /&gt;My hands were very dry and irritated as they often are.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using the salve my hands are healing and more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many products but if I continue to have the results I&#x27;m having with this one I will continue to purchase Saymans Salve only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I was a child and my Mother had it in her medicine cabinet.  It is very mild yet effective for scrapes and burns.</li>
            <li> It was not what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> My Grandmother sold Sayman Salve back in the 1940&#x27;s Our family has been a supporter of their products since then . We have always been satisfied with their.products.and was supprised to find it on amazon</li>
            <li> Expensive stuff, but we always had it in the medicine cabinet when I was a kid. It serves as kind of an all-purpose first aid cream. I have a suspicion that there has been a formula change-possibly removing the camphor- thereby somewhat reducing its usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;I am unaware, however, of any other all purpose cream of this type that I like as well as this stuff.</li>
            <li> My family used this for decades, starting with my great grandmother.  My grandmother, with five children, depended on it, and her children kept up the tradition and passed it on to my cousins and me.  I used it for my family, including my son, for years--then suddenly it desappeared from the market, and I miss it because it was good for so many things, cuts, scrapes, bug bites, blisters--the list went on and on.  The camphor smell was strong at first-but you knew you were putting medicine on whatever ailed you.  And the scent, once the salve was applied, settled down quickly and faded away.,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It almost always helped. It wasn&#x27;t glamorous, fragrant, or fashionable.  But for a lot of ailments it worked very well indeed, fast and without fuss.  We trusted and used  it for five generations in my family, and I wish someone would bring it back.  Heck, I&#x27;d buy it by the case!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she was disappointed because it already expires next year.&lt;br /&gt;The larger size had a longer expiration date.  I would like to exchange for a newer jar....</li>
            <li> this produce is amazing... takes the pain out of inflamed zits and sores ...they heal really fast...even my teen children use it by choise</li>
            <li> You will not find anything better,use this for sunburn, burns,scratches,rashes,etc,etc.absolutely the only product we use.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;This was used when I was a little girl - and it&#x27;s very hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great item.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the price was cheaper.</li>
            <li> My dad had an old jar of sayman salve.  It was used for all.  The salve drew out infections and healed sore&#x27;s fast. The active incredients were camphor, zinc oxide, boric acid, hexachlorophene, lanolin and petrolatum.  I still have a little left from this old jar, I use it sparringly BECAUSE IT WORKS AND WORKS WELL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years later my dad bought another jar active ingredients zinc oxide, camphor and preservative (quaternium-15) in a petrolatum, lanolin and propylene glycol base.  There is a difference between the then and later as it doesn&#x27;t work as well. It feels like hand lotion more than healing like it use too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I find the same incredients as the very old  salve being in the newest jar I will buy several otherwise I&#x27;ll  just go buy hand lotion.  Very disapointed in the last jars from several years ago.  we shall  see what the new one  holds so I can&#x27;t really rate until I see what incredients are listed and try the new version.</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to purchase Sayman Salve again even though the price has skyrocketed. There is absolutely no substitute for this salve as anyone who has lived in the South will attest.</li>
            <li> When I was a little boy (6 or 7) and was learning to ride a bicycle, I was always crashing and burning skinning my knees,elbows palms and back of my hands. The skinned places would just start healing and scab over and then I would flex my knee or elbow and it would start bleeding and the healing process would have to start over again. My Granny introduced me to Saymans salve which keeps the skinned places soft and flexible and allow the healing process to continue without a problem. I will turn 80 years young this summer and I have introduced family members, friends, and everyone that has ever experienced a problem healing area to Saymans salve with the same great results. I usually let them use mine and they are so impressed that they want their own jar. We used to be able to get it from Walgreens, but they can&#x27;t even order it any longer. Yay Amazon!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks for always fulfilling my needs.&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully, Warren Blackketter</li>
