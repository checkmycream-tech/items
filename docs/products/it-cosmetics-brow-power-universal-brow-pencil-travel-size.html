            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Colors are nice, but will not recommend.</li>

            <li>Cannot say enough great things about it.</li>
            <li>The brow pencil is great but the container itself is too short..</li>
            <li>Always have had to fill in my brows all my life and this is the one that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have it artificially filled in.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>product was delivered on time and in original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does work nicely and works for all hair colors, but wow, $24.00 for a travel size pencil??</li>
            <li>I even checked their website &amp; this is what they sell as a \\&quot;full size\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Received my first one free at a cancer seminar on how to apply makeup while under chemo.  </li>
            <li>my first try!</li>
            <li>When I do use this one up, I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>When looking for new products to try, Ipsy has been the best match for me, but when they get you hooked on a product you can sometimes get in trouble with the cost.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It Cosmetic Brow Power Universal Eyebrow Pencil is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m golden blog de and</li>
            <li>it goes on easily, looks natural, and stays in place all day.</li>
            <li>An order from them takes only a few days, postage free over a certain amount, and the product arrives well and beautifully</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried my back if hand yet to see if it&#x27;s ok for dryer skin&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is smudge proof and that I can make it as light or as dark as I please.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brow powders and never found one that actually matched my brow color.</li>
            <li>Most were too dark or too light.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pleased overall.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use (due to</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s why I am so happy with this purchase and the cost being less than brand name stores such as Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>These cosmeticis  are really awesome..and</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s compact size), goes on smoothly matching my natural brow color nicely with using very little soft strokes.</li>
            <li>and I personally find this eyebrow pencil extraordinary.</li>
            <li>the box, is an instruction guide for a quick and simple guide for shaped brows.</li>
            <li>The shade is universal, which is quite rare, you can transform shade by applying lighter or darker strokes to match your hair color.</li>
            <li>does last all day, and sometimes, if I&#x27;m naughty and don&#x27;t take off my makeup at night, I&#x27;m still good the next morning.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow pencil is definitely universal because it goes with absolutely any skin and hair color.</li>
            <li>The oval shaped tip creates natural looking brows, and it is perfect for thin brows(my case) or thick brows.</li>
            <li>This is actually my natural brow color.</li>
            <li>The price is worth it to me because I don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so I know it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and staying power is unbelievable!</li>
            <li>My once dark shapely brows have changed to salt and pepper with a weird texture, so I&#x27;m happy to say this pencil can restore a bit of youth.</li>
            <li>No regrets in ordering this product.</li>
            <li>But one suggestion but 2 this way when you run out which is a guessing game because you turn and more comes up so u cannot see so when u use ur backup</li>
            <li>This brow pencil beats my Anastasia and other high brand ones.</li>
            <li>This pencil really does look natural and it&#x27;s hard to make it look over done.</li>

            <li> It can be used to math the lightest to darkest eyebrows, just by how how light or hard you press down while filling in your eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Good product, makes your brows look thicker and even, but very disappointing size for the price.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I will be sticking with this for the long haul.</li>
            <li> works as advertised, my brows are brown with a few white hairs mixed in -</li>
            <li> Used product one time and only swiveled up a little.</li>
            <li> I wet the brush dip in eyeshadow  </li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow pencil I use and because of the lack of eyebrows, I rely heavily on it.  </li>
            <li> This eyebrow brush is pricey but works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I lost brows due to chemotherapy treatments.</li>
            <li> This was donated with other make up items from companies.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other brow pencil.</li>
            <li> do I have to draw half end of brows on due to sickness was vack</li>
            <li> Too dark</li>
            <li> even though I have dark brown hair - I just put it on a bit darker.</li>
            <li> Yet it comes off as any other liner I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> When before using other pencils I&#x27;d b finding myself redoing them over and over!</li>
            <li> Again I will never order cosmetics from Amazon because they seem a little cheaper than other places</li>
            <li> half come in</li>
            <li> The pencil was half size and it broke within two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I can also use dbf, but that&#x27;s a slightly blonder color.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been using a little( cheaper)</li>
            <li> Recieved the pencil 2 days before leaving for vacation &amp; was wondering why it was so small compared to all the other ones</li>
            <li> my brown eyeshadow with a little brush on angle kinda stiff</li>
            <li> Not easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I received it in two days and it came with a small nail gift.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this eye brow pwncil..it is not like how it is advertised on HSN.</li>
            <li> This was given to me in the past by my sister who bought it from QVC.  </li>
            <li> I purchased(at least 6) from QVC).  </li>
            <li> When I received this today, I couldn&#x27;t believe how small this brow pencil was!</li>
            <li> u want to keep thin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it fell out and if so , poorly made.</li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> This is the perfect brow pencil! My once dark shapely brows have changed to salt and pepper with a weird texture, so I&#x27;m happy to say this pencil can restore a bit of youth.</li>
            <li> The only brow pencil I use I&#x27;m golden blog de and color u use with the amount of pressure u use. But one suggestion but 2 this way when you run out which is a guessing game because you turn and more comes up so u cannot see so when u use ur backup the I reorder another so ur never caught without your brows. And now the darker brow is in style do I have to draw half end of brows on due to sickness was vack but o ly half come in so I&#x27;ve been using a little( cheaper) my brown eyeshadow with a little brush on angle kinda stiff I wet the brush dip in eyeshadow  I follow my It brow pencil basically the front part the end u want to keep thin.  That&#x27;s the way I&#x27;ve been doing my brows I&#x27;ve gotten compliments and barely my own brows lol shhhhhh</li>
            <li> This stuff is good. Only thing is I was under the assumption that the liner wouldn&#x27;t rub off as I use it for eyebrow inhancement. Yet it comes off as any other liner I&#x27;ve used! However I like how it Gos on. I get the perfect brow my first try! When before using other pencils I&#x27;d b finding myself redoing them over and over! When I seen it advertised on qvc the model used it on the back of her wrist and rubbed the hell out of it when nothing came off on camera I was sold hoping it would dobthecsane for my eyebrows! Yet I also have oily skin so it rubbed off my eye brows if I rub it. Haven&#x27;t tried my back if hand yet to see if it&#x27;s ok for dryer skin&#x27;</li>
            <li> Used product one time and only swiveled up a little. Next time I went to use it there was no pencil. Maybe it fell out and if so , poorly made.</li>
            <li> I had heard so many great things about this brow product! I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it and hopefully find my holy grail brow pencil. When I received this today, I couldn&#x27;t believe how small this brow pencil was! It does work nicely and works for all hair colors, but wow, $24.00 for a travel size pencil?? I even checked their website &amp; this is what they sell as a \\&quot;full size\\&quot;. Good product, makes your brows look thicker and even, but very disappointing size for the price. I&#x27;ve purchased other IT Cosmetics items and been very happy but I won&#x27;t repurchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow pencil I use and because of the lack of eyebrows, I rely heavily on it.  it goes on easily, looks natural, and stays in place all day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and really like it.  Since, I could not find it in local stores, I bought online from a different vendor.  The pencil was half size and it broke within two weeks of use.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is my second pencil!  Water proof &amp; easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I received this pencil in a birchbox bag and I fell in love with it. I decided to order it from here and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier. Amazing service! I received it in two days and it came with a small nail gift. I will be ordering it again from here only the price and service was excellent. This brow pencil beats my Anastasia and other high brand ones. It goes on so nice and smooth. It compliments all hair colors and the brush fills it in perfectly.  Cannot say enough great things about it. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These cosmeticis  are really awesome..and muchless eexpensive than I was paying a catalog for! ALSO....the shipping speed was phenomenal!</li>
            <li> This product is as amazing. I went on the IT cosmetics website &amp; watched the video on how to use it.  It&#x27;s very  easy to use and my eyebrows look great!</li>
            <li> When looking for new products to try, Ipsy has been the best match for me, but when they get you hooked on a product you can sometimes get in trouble with the cost.&lt;br /&gt;The It Cosmetic Brow Power Universal Eyebrow Pencil is amazing. It can be used to math the lightest to darkest eyebrows, just by how how light or hard you press down while filling in your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I am so happy with this purchase and the cost being less than brand name stores such as Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered on time and in original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I am very Happy with this product!!!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow brush is pricey but works extremely well. I lost brows due to chemotherapy treatments. Give it a try</li>
            <li> The brow pencil is great but the container itself is too short.. Not easy to hold. I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> will order again.  The best brow pencil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this eye brow pwncil..it is not like how it is advertised on HSN.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my brows!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made for fair hair/skinned girls. Too dark</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed the IT cosmetics line and I personally find this eyebrow pencil extraordinary. I love the fact that it is smudge proof and that I can make it as light or as dark as I please. This eyebrow pencil is definitely universal because it goes with absolutely any skin and hair color. Great product!</li>
            <li> Watch for this coming..they are up and coming! I have tried many brow powders and never found one that actually matched my brow color. Most were too dark or too light. But this one is perfect! Finally, it lasts all day too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brow pencil. I had permanent makeup done to my eyebrows, but it has since faded.  I still have to fill in and touch up and this is the best pencil I&#x27;ve used! Love it!</li>
            <li> This was given to me in the past by my sister who bought it from QVC.  It was a longer exterior stick, and that&#x27;s what I was expecting. This one is a &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34;, although the actual length of the liner is the same and so is the brush.  The weight is the same? The shorter length of the stick actually makes it easier to carry in my cosmetic bag.  I&#x27;m very impressed with the quick delivery time. So I&#x27;m pleased overall.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I searched for years looking for a brow pencil to fill in my sparse brows, without making me look like a clown. This pencil does everything you could hope for! It&#x27;s very easy to use (due to it&#x27;s compact size), goes on smoothly matching my natural brow color nicely with using very little soft strokes. What I like most about it is that it LASTS! By the end of the day, I still look like I have an expression on my face. :) The price is worth it to me because I don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so I know it&#x27;s going to last me a long time. When I do use this one up, I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I reach for this every morning and am happy with it.  Good color even though I have dark brown hair - I just put it on a bit darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been using this pencil for a while now and I have to say that I will be sticking with this for the long haul. Always have had to fill in my brows all my life and this is the one that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have it artificially filled in. Easy to use, and staying power is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> works as advertised, my brows are brown with a few white hairs mixed in - this fills the &amp;#34;blanks&amp;#34; in the appearance and covers the white when you use a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; hand with application and use the brush end to finish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is helping my brow to grow back.... I feel like I lost my brow instead....&lt;br /&gt;Colors are nice, but will not recommend.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product. It arrived in great condition (seemed new). Arrived in original packaging with directions! No regrets in ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Received my first one free at a cancer seminar on how to apply makeup while under chemo.  This was donated with other make up items from companies.  I liked the product and then bought another one.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> used it for the first time today. So far so good. Great. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This pencil really does look natural and it&#x27;s hard to make it look over done. Easy to use and great color</li>
            <li> perfect color, easy to use</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other brow pencil.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best brow power eyebrow pencil I have found. The IT company is superb. An order from them takes only a few days, postage free over a certain amount, and the product arrives well and beautifully packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pencil comes in a set of two. The oval shaped tip creates natural looking brows, and it is perfect for thin brows(my case) or thick brows. The formula is waterproof and smudge resistant. The shade is universal, which is quite rare, you can transform shade by applying lighter or darker strokes to match your hair color. On the opposite side is a spooled brush to give your brows au finishing touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the box, is an instruction guide for a quick and simple guide for shaped brows. This works, and I now have the best shaped brows to fit my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 04-03-15</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for me when my stylist gets my red hair the correct color! It&#x27;s one of the ways I can tell immediately. This is actually my natural brow color. I can also use dbf, but that&#x27;s a slightly blonder color. This one is my best color, and it (no pun intended!!!) does last all day, and sometimes, if I&#x27;m naughty and don&#x27;t take off my makeup at night, I&#x27;m still good the next morning. Great product!</li>
            <li> bought this item...love it. Bought and read this book also here on amazon and love it too! check it out as well! XO!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Chain-Mail-Diaries-Shasta-Scott-ebook/dp/B00NY7871A/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1421184929&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;the+chain+mail+diaries+shasta+scott</li>
            <li> Recieved the pencil 2 days before leaving for vacation &amp; was wondering why it was so small compared to all the other ones I purchased(at least 6) from QVC).  Then I read the packing &amp; saw I was sent a travel size pencil. I did not order a travel size nor did I pay for a travel size.  I always order a 2 pack from QVC &amp; pay around $30 w/shipping.  I paid $14.98 for one TRIAL size w/shipping. I got ripped off &amp; there is not address where to return it &amp; I will probably have to pay to ship it back.  Again I will never order cosmetics from Amazon because they seem a little cheaper than other places but you get smaller sizes of the products you purchased &amp; then to add shipping on. Horrible.</li>
