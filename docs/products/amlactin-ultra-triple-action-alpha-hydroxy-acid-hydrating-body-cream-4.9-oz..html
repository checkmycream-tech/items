            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>It is truly remarkable ...</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>All have used it have loved it.</li>
            <li>Best hand cream available.</li>
            <li>Really good lotion.  </li>
            <li>The product came on time and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>, so I know it&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li>Amlactin is also good to use on the feet to prevent scaliness and cracking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Lac-Hydrin Five for almost 30 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>There has to be something that smells and works just as good out there.</li>
            <li>The arrival of the product was as stated and it came in good shape.  </li>
            <li>The skin gets a good hidratation without being oily.</li>
            <li>It is really good</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I even tried Korea Italy towels after reading so many great things about them from others with KP - nothing groundbreaking.</li>
            <li>am very satisfied with the lotion.</li>
            <li>Everything I tried did a great job hiding/making my skin look more hydrated but the results would wash off after each shower...</li>
            <li>This product is so much better!</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought Amlactin Ultra!  </li>
            <li>All my clients are aware of the results and are impressed.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but that quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>This cream is better than many hand lotions I have tried, but not as good as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This Amlactin Ultra product is super great.  </li>
            <li>It was amazing for our Grand Canyon trip.</li>
            <li>works ok, not as effective as i was hoping for though.  </li>
            <li>The best thing I&#x27;ve used it for is a facial moisturizer - it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, many products and so far this is the best.  </li>
            <li>Cleared up my keratosis pilaris quickly!!</li>
            <li>I continued the Amlactin treatment and his feet are now very smooth with no sign that he ever had plantar warts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good quick delivery from supplier.</li>
            <li>Amlactin does the job better.</li>
            <li>Glad it was recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell ammonia, just a stinky cream that takes many hours to dissipate.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not fully satisfied with the lotion I moved on to the now discontinued 12% Moisturizing Body Cream.</li>
            <li>I found it to be better for hydration than the 12% formula.</li>
            <li>It does keep my skin looking good (fresh) and it does seem to keep my KP at bay though not as well as the discontinued 12%</li>
            <li>Works better than the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Legs looked smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li>after many prescription drugs, treatments..</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>He is quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>He likes it better than the Amlactin lotion.</li>
            <li>Wow, what an incredible difference it has made in just 4 days of using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried loads of different products on the market, but this one has given me the best results for my skin.</li>
            <li>Others have had better results with their KP when using AmLactin, so it could just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which would have been ok if it worked.</li>
            <li>It felt like there was a layer of slime sitting on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>The Ultra is not greasy at all, and seems to help the bumps just as well, while offering more moisturizing power.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>like this version better than the Amlactin XL because it absorbs into the skin quicker</li>
            <li>When we go to wound care conferences, we often go to the Amlactin booth and pick up as many samples as we can get our hands on.</li>
            <li>They have many products.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the lables.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My feet look so much better</li>
            <li>I would recommend this because my feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li>This lotion is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>for the KP on my arms - and this not only works the best</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It works okay on my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will still buy the lotion because you get so much more of it.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;Guess product is okay</li>
            <li>Love it---</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil seems better</li>
            <li>I also started using it on my legs just for hydration and love it.  </li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t look greasy or shiny; it has more of a matte finish.</li>
            <li>I like it as well as my favorite Eucerin.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>My experience with ordering through Amazon could not have been better.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- clearer more eventoned skin&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Excellent care for dry skin</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer for dry climates.  </li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used to combat dry scaly legs.</li>
            <li>The best thing I&#x27;ve found for *extremely* dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is the best lotion for dry skin (and bruising from blood thinners) that I have ever encountered.  </li>
            <li>this is a wonderful cream for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>For very dry skin this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth, non-greasy feel of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But surprise with this product - within a week my fingers looked like normal fingers - no cracks, no peeling skin...quite remarkable.  </li>
            <li>Also is great for sensitive skin with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and the company was fair in price and fast to deliver</li>
            <li>I saw continued evening of my skin tone, better hydration, and significant improvement in my KP.</li>
            <li>easy to apply with the flip cap.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my  2 yr old grand daughter who has fairly severe eczema.</li>
            <li>If you do not like strong smell in you lotion, you should try this one.</li>
            <li>After prescribing many products, including special prescriptions from a formulary pharmacy, my dermatologist suggested I try this for my foot pustular and placque psoriasis.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it mostly on his back and says it is very effective.  </li>
            <li>Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this new formulation is quite as good</li>
            <li>I received this in the mail very quickly, even for a holiday weekend and free shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many creams for my dry skin and this works the absolute best...</li>
            <li>My legs are now smooth &amp; I wear shorts all the time.</li>
            <li>But I wish the 12% cream was still available.</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much I am continuing it.</li>
            <li>It is really amazing stuff at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li>ALL Amlactin products are fantastic.....</li>
            <li>All of their lotions are available over-the-counter.</li>
            <li>I bought Amlactin Ultra... as this may sound cliche&#x27;...</li>
            <li>However, I order the fragrance free product and I wish I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Two applications of this cream and my problem heels are smooth and healed.</li>
            <li>My 64 year old  heard this product was good from a friend</li>
            <li>but I will stick with it because I don&#x27;t have anything better to use right now.</li>
            <li>Great lotion and a much better price than other sites.</li>
            <li>This body cream was very moisturizing but the scent was very strong and lasted all day, also making my clothes smell that way.</li>
            <li>This worked ok, but I can&#x27;t quite tell if it really helped get rid of my KP on its own, because I used this in combination with a shower scrub, pure coconut oil and sun exposure</li>
            <li>I really like the way it soften my skin and the nice light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Not sticky on skin like original Amlactin.</li>
            <li>Still waiting for significant results after having it for almost a month though</li>
            <li>I used to get the original formula Amlactin</li>
            <li>The KP on my legs has faded significantly within the 3 days I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>Many people complain about the smell but this product isn&#x27;t made to smell pretty.</li>
            <li>I did not buy my Amlactin here, but I love this cream so much on my first try</li>
            <li>but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>so that makes it worth it!</li>
            <li>Would recommend to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth the premium price!</li>
            <li>oh well, it&#x27;s worth it to not have itchy skin!</li>
            <li>This is great stuff for dry hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my dermatologist, and I like it.</li>
            <li>Using Amlactin, according to directions on the product, is a great way to get rid of scaley, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product to use for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>She said to use twice a day on clean skin.</li>
            <li>Plus Amazons price is the best so far, this product is $5 more in your average convenient store.</li>
            <li>Nothing special though.</li>
            <li>and I think they have a special preparation for that purpose.</li>
            <li>This is great for very dry, cracked ares of skin.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this product, very effective for his dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My sister (who has amazing skin) touched my arms and was like \\&quot;WOW what did you do?!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want my feet to stay nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for a good moisturizing cream for my feet especially that does that and is not sticky......</li>
            <li>They seem not to buy him as much so for that I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for your entire foot.</li>
            <li>The product itself is a good lotion for the overall body.</li>
            <li>I am sure that an adult would be able to use it more frequently.</li>
            <li>I have been using the AmLactin 12 % Moisturizing Lotion which is very good for dry skin, but I&#x27;m here to tell that this AmLactin Ultra Triple Action Alpha Hydroxy Acid Hydrating Body Cream is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Either way it dissipates rather quickly.</li>
            <li>can vouch for this product not only be effective but makes the skin look smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>The dermatologist i go to recommended this, turns out i have a mild form of eczema</li>
            <li>It worked so well, so quickly I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in the first 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is a nice cream for my heels but have found better results with other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a strong believer that moisturizing your skin can cure a large amount of ailments that we all deal with (acne, KP, etc.).</li>
            <li>After using this consistently for 1-2 weeks, I enjoyed the benefits for another 1-2 weeks before I really had to reapply.</li>
            <li>Good for dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>but this is the REAL DEAL !!</li>
            <li>The AmLactin Ultra Triple Action Alpha Hydroxy Acid Hydrating Body Cream is very effective on very dry skin and strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is really good for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>this lotion does a superior job lubricating my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted the one I had tested and will not order the fragrance free again.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth even though I am a very outdoor person</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it and, after finishing off one tube, I&#x27;m convinced that this product is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>The thickness makes it a bit harder to rub throughout the skin, but it&#x27;s still good.  </li>
            <li>The lotion arrived in good shape as I expected that it would.  </li>
            <li>Still worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the great news is that I tried this lotion on my 12 year old son&#x27;s plantar warts that were on the sole of one foot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and this is coming from someone who has tried every lotion out there for severe dry skin and keratosis.</li>
            <li>The best dry skin cream I have ever used on my desert dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for a long time and love it!  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended AmLactin and he was right.</li>
            <li>I would probably try these first before the amlactin, since it&#x27;s a more health conscious option.</li>
            <li>After that, the skin on my hands is fresh, new, smooth, and healed.</li>
            <li>Yes, but the most important thing - for those of us who suffer from severe dry skin and psoriasis or eczema - IT</li>
            <li>try to only buy things that are Prime eligible, but was pleased with how quickly this was delivered this shipper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not a miracle cure, but it is effective treatment for extremely dry and bumpy skin.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Product arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>very very runny.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and this lotion does an amazing job of keeping my skin from feeling like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>When I ran out, I went to buy more only to discover that it had been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have to say it works pretty damn well.</li>
            <li>We were quite pleased with our purchase from Mr. Medical.  </li>
            <li>Just be certain you are getting the right Amlactin product.    </li>
            <li>I have tried so many lotions from simple unscented moisturizers, Dermasil, to Corn Huskers lotion and Noxzema.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in my life since the age of 12 that my arms and legs are silky</li>
            <li>First of all, no problems with the supplier.  </li>
            <li>first creme I have used that has made a real difference in my kp!</li>
            <li>The AmLactin Ultra Triple Action Alpha Hydroxy Acid Hydrating Body Cream is creamy, but not oily, it&#x27;s leaves your skin feeling so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff personally</li>
            <li>It keeps my feet feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many creams and lotions that are supposed to work for extreme situations and, although they helped some, nothing ever made a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>I had first tried this cream at my doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>and it definitely makes my arms more touchable.  </li>
            <li>It does leave a bit of a greasy feel at first but dissipates soon after.</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just the moisture</li>
            <li>/&gt;(this is my first amazon review ever..)</li>
            <li>I can only use it at night but worked great to get rid of dry, bumpy skin.</li>
            <li>Very thick lotion, would be good for feet but its greasy!</li>
            <li>not a strong scent, which is good.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has the most complete selection of AmLactin products that I have found so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe but just one day after my first use my arm and leg skin was soft and sores were able to start healing on their own.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost, highly recommend if nothing else has worked for you.</li>
            <li>After the first application, my skin already felt so much smoother and softer, and the flakiness immediately went away.</li>
            <li>I used this lotion with a barrier cream on top and with in a couple days my hands were back to normal.</li>
            <li>My hands love to get dry and crack.</li>
            <li>I had very mild keratosis pilaris on my arms but moderate-severe on the back of my thighs and it handled both.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried vaseline, ponds dry skin cream, drinking more water, EVOO and NOTHING helped.</li>
            <li>My daughter says that it does work, but it is so strong that it stings her hands, so she has to mix this lotion with another lotion to use it and then only a couple of days a week.</li>
            <li>That said, I have only noticed it being strong WHILE I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin---this makes it smooth as a babys butt!</li>
            <li>No odor, very creamy.</li>
            <li>This worked really well for me - even after just one application to my feet and legs.</li>
            <li>He has chemical burns which do not respond to regular lotion or creams, this cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Tops all high priced creams/lotions on the market today!</li>
            <li>This cream is really &amp;#34;the cream of the crop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This really works to soften skin and&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>I just found out about this product and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>and this really helped with that.</li>
            <li>feet, very moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I expected more for the price....</li>
            <li>The smell is slightly unusual but dissipates withing minutes...should not deter from purchasing.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>It is especially good for preventing the ends of fingers from splitting when the weather is cold.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps keep the skin nourished.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my orthopedics Dr.</li>
            <li>It really had made a difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Her hands look and feel much better!We</li>
            <li>Was recommended to me by a Dermatologist and has proved to very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>if I could (boys don&#x27;t really care for lotion</li>
            <li>Nothing has really worked until this.  </li>
            <li>and if it does, it goes in the garbage, not matter how much the cost.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li>but I really did not like the smell.  </li>
            <li>Product really helps.  </li>
            <li>the AHA (alpha-hydroxy acid) really helps keep the skin supple.</li>
            <li>how much percentage alpha hydroxy acid added ?</li>
            <li>Hasnt helped much at all.</li>
            <li>The Amlactin really smooths your skin.  </li>
            <li>Really softens them.</li>
            <li>I highly endorse!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell it really works.  </li>
            <li>The smell is minimal and I don&#x27;t even notice it any more.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>This product was suggested by our dermatologist and really works.</li>
            <li>The lotion is much smoother.</li>
            <li>Used Amlactin as a prescription many years ago and decided to try again after readying other reviews&lt;br /&gt;particularly</li>
            <li>It has a strong odor but certainly works for very dry skin, bothered with redness and rash.  </li>
            <li>I will use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Sounds like a commercial, but definitely true.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described, heals dry skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>My husband is a podiatrist and was writing prescriptions for Amlactin for his patients with severely dry skin before it was available over-the-counter.</li>
            <li>An older Amlactin Product called amlactin 12% moisturizing cream</li>
            <li>When triggered, it feels like my skin has gotten tight as shoe leather, inflamed and with a mighty burning fire!  </li>
            <li>Recommend it highly</li>
            <li>Since then it can be purchased without a prescription, but he still recommends it highly and gives samples of it to his patients.</li>
            <li>Makes your hands very smooth and will last for a long time without reapplying.</li>
            <li>It worked a little better in every way.</li>
            <li>It seems a little more creamy than the XL.</li>
            <li>One of the only products that consistently heals my cracked hands!</li>
            <li>I think this really helps keeping my skin young looking.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the extra cash compared to the cheaper lotions like Eucerin.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly if you are looking for a true solution to dry skin.</li>
            <li>After only two days of use, my skin is responding nicely and is much less itchy because it&#x27;s retaining moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly new Amlactin user</li>
            <li>have found a new product,that we will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Been searching for a lotion that would help with super dry, patchy &amp; brown spots on my legs.</li>
            <li>I have been using Amlactin lotion for over 10 years, back in the day with it was only available by prescription.  </li>
            <li>i usually apply it in 2 applications because it gets absorbed so quickly.  </li>
            <li>but my skin was smoother and clear in two days!</li>
            <li>This is the FIRST product I have found that actually works on my condition.</li>
            <li>We use this on our feet and it makes them soft!</li>
            <li>my KP was completely GONE!</li>
            <li>No other product has come close to producing the smoothness of my skin that this particular Amlactin product has accomplished.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even here, where the altitude is high, the sun hot and the climate dry.</li>
            <li>Now aged on top of that there was flaky and crappie, dry skin.</li>
            <li>It feels heavy going on, but absorbs quickly and really helps the appearance of lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>When you live in Wisconsin, your skin during the winter gets pretty dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li>clearly it</li>
            <li>The doctors have tried everything to clear it up and it never clears up.  </li>
            <li>I use this before I go to bed at night and wake up with silky soft hands.</li>
            <li>Too early for resultsvv</li>
            <li>The ends of my fingers were cracked with the winter weather, but they are now soft and healed.</li>
            <li>Amlactin is the ONLY thing that works for me, and it works fast.</li>
            <li>Buff and them put this on before bed, feet will be soft in the am.</li>
            <li>This cream is gentle enough for me to use on my face!  </li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>Our dermatologist recommended this for my 7 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I use this product to keep my feet soft.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t gone away completely, and I did stop applying for awhile</li>
            <li>I use it every night and it helps so much with moisturizing, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old and people are always asking me what I do to keep my skin so young looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now committed to using it everywhere to keep my skin soft and touchable</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re at all self conscious about the way your skin looks or feels (as I was)</li>
            <li>and like it very much for dry skin.</li>
            <li>creams help our dry skin very much.</li>
            <li>and they got bumpier again, but quickly went back down after a few more applications.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST SAMPLE PACKET ALMOST HEALED MY DRY SKIN</li>
            <li>It really works to clear up dry skin, not just cover it.  </li>
            <li>That way it has been absorbed into the skin and my hands are dry enough to handle a racquet and not slip.</li>
            <li>The cream applies white, but takes awhile to rub in the skin even though it is not thick.</li>
            <li>Not sure why it said scent free.</li>
            <li>My first experience was with the Amlactin 12% Moisturizing Lotion beginning roughly 5 months ago.</li>
            <li>It is thick and soothing so it works good on the tight shoe leather feeling</li>
            <li>Seems to be working very well for dry arms.</li>
            <li>My legs have more recently been effected while i have had KP on my arms for at least 7 years.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a shot if you&#x27;re running out of options, but I am slightly bothered by the smell.  </li>
            <li>This is no foo-foo cream, this is the real deal with ingredients formerly allowed only by prescription.</li>
            <li>Thick, heavy cream - good for feet.</li>
            <li>It is marketed as fragrance free, but has  definite slightly unpleasant odor that doesn&#x27;t dissipate for two or more hours.  </li>
            <li>I saw instant results in this patients skin from crocodile to baby soft!</li>
            <li>It helps my hands like no other and I suffer from dermatitis.</li>
            <li>it moistens like no other</li>
            <li>She also says that it does have a slight odor to it, but not bad enough to quit using it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really thick, but works fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be nice if it were odorless, but the active ingredients do have something of an odor, but at least there are no sensitizing or offensive fragrances</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that I slather it on daily during dry season and use up the tubes too quickly since it is relatively pricey used that way.</li>
            <li>I bought it to treat keratosis pilaris as well as hyperpigmentation marks left from old spots.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a nurse &amp; my husband &amp; I are both members of the American Professional Wound Care Association.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone with extremely dry, peel skin, or with KP.</li>
            <li>I had dry skin, especially on my forearms, probably caused by spending so much time on the golf course.</li>
            <li>With regular use, skin is soft and moisturized for much longer than other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using it since the KP became less obvious, and have continued to use LUSH buffy body butter (as a scrub) and pure coconut oil after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for a couple of years now and highly recommend it to anyone with very dry hands.</li>
            <li>It is VERY thick, not like a regular lotion or even most body butters.</li>
            <li>no dry skin...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for people with vascular disease, diabetes, and other disorders which cause dry skin, including disorders such as hypothyroidism and just plain dry skin due to weather, sun exposure or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Naturally my hands get very dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>I also have KP on my legs, but the cream didn&#x27;t really seem to have any effect on those stubborn little bumps.</li>
            <li>It really has helped me with the little cracks that seem to be never ending and hurt.</li>

            <li> Really good lotion.  </li>
            <li> The product came on time and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> , so I know it&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li> Amlactin is also good to use on the feet to prevent scaliness and cracking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Lac-Hydrin Five for almost 30 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> There has to be something that smells and works just as good out there.</li>
            <li> The arrival of the product was as stated and it came in good shape.  </li>
            <li> The skin gets a good hidratation without being oily.</li>
            <li> It is really good</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I even tried Korea Italy towels after reading so many great things about them from others with KP - nothing groundbreaking.</li>
            <li> am very satisfied with the lotion.</li>
            <li> Everything I tried did a great job hiding/making my skin look more hydrated but the results would wash off after each shower...</li>
            <li> This product is so much better!</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought Amlactin Ultra!  </li>
            <li> All my clients are aware of the results and are impressed.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great, but that quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> This cream is better than many hand lotions I have tried, but not as good as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This Amlactin Ultra product is super great.  </li>
            <li> It was amazing for our Grand Canyon trip.</li>
            <li> works ok, not as effective as i was hoping for though.  </li>
            <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve used it for is a facial moisturizer - it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many, many products and so far this is the best.  </li>
            <li> Cleared up my keratosis pilaris quickly!!</li>
            <li> I continued the Amlactin treatment and his feet are now very smooth with no sign that he ever had plantar warts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good quick delivery from supplier.</li>
            <li> Amlactin does the job better.</li>
            <li> Glad it was recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell ammonia, just a stinky cream that takes many hours to dissipate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not fully satisfied with the lotion I moved on to the now discontinued 12% Moisturizing Body Cream.</li>
            <li> I found it to be better for hydration than the 12% formula.</li>
            <li> It does keep my skin looking good (fresh) and it does seem to keep my KP at bay though not as well as the discontinued 12%</li>
            <li> Works better than the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Legs looked smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li> after many prescription drugs, treatments..</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> He is quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> He likes it better than the Amlactin lotion.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an incredible difference it has made in just 4 days of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried loads of different products on the market, but this one has given me the best results for my skin.</li>
            <li> Others have had better results with their KP when using AmLactin, so it could just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which would have been ok if it worked.</li>
            <li> It felt like there was a layer of slime sitting on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> The Ultra is not greasy at all, and seems to help the bumps just as well, while offering more moisturizing power.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> like this version better than the Amlactin XL because it absorbs into the skin quicker</li>
            <li> When we go to wound care conferences, we often go to the Amlactin booth and pick up as many samples as we can get our hands on.</li>
            <li> They have many products.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the lables.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> My feet look so much better</li>
            <li> I would recommend this because my feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> for the KP on my arms - and this not only works the best</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It works okay on my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will still buy the lotion because you get so much more of it.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> /&gt;Guess product is okay</li>
            <li> Love it---</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil seems better</li>
            <li> I also started using it on my legs just for hydration and love it.  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t look greasy or shiny; it has more of a matte finish.</li>
            <li> I like it as well as my favorite Eucerin.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My experience with ordering through Amazon could not have been better.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- clearer more eventoned skin&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Excellent care for dry skin</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer for dry climates.  </li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used to combat dry scaly legs.</li>
            <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve found for *extremely* dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is the best lotion for dry skin (and bruising from blood thinners) that I have ever encountered.  </li>
            <li> this is a wonderful cream for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> For very dry skin this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth, non-greasy feel of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But surprise with this product - within a week my fingers looked like normal fingers - no cracks, no peeling skin...quite remarkable.  </li>
            <li> Also is great for sensitive skin with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and the company was fair in price and fast to deliver</li>
            <li> I saw continued evening of my skin tone, better hydration, and significant improvement in my KP.</li>
            <li> easy to apply with the flip cap.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my  2 yr old grand daughter who has fairly severe eczema.</li>
            <li> If you do not like strong smell in you lotion, you should try this one.</li>
            <li> After prescribing many products, including special prescriptions from a formulary pharmacy, my dermatologist suggested I try this for my foot pustular and placque psoriasis.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it mostly on his back and says it is very effective.  </li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this new formulation is quite as good</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail very quickly, even for a holiday weekend and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams for my dry skin and this works the absolute best...</li>
            <li> My legs are now smooth &amp; I wear shorts all the time.</li>
            <li> But I wish the 12% cream was still available.</li>
            <li> and I liked it so much I am continuing it.</li>
            <li> It is really amazing stuff at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li> ALL Amlactin products are fantastic.....</li>
            <li> All of their lotions are available over-the-counter.</li>
            <li> I bought Amlactin Ultra... as this may sound cliche&#x27;...</li>
            <li> However, I order the fragrance free product and I wish I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Two applications of this cream and my problem heels are smooth and healed.</li>
            <li> My 64 year old  heard this product was good from a friend</li>
            <li> but I will stick with it because I don&#x27;t have anything better to use right now.</li>
            <li> Great lotion and a much better price than other sites.</li>
            <li> This body cream was very moisturizing but the scent was very strong and lasted all day, also making my clothes smell that way.</li>
            <li> This worked ok, but I can&#x27;t quite tell if it really helped get rid of my KP on its own, because I used this in combination with a shower scrub, pure coconut oil and sun exposure</li>
            <li> I really like the way it soften my skin and the nice light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Not sticky on skin like original Amlactin.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for significant results after having it for almost a month though</li>
            <li> I used to get the original formula Amlactin</li>
            <li> The KP on my legs has faded significantly within the 3 days I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Many people complain about the smell but this product isn&#x27;t made to smell pretty.</li>
            <li> I did not buy my Amlactin here, but I love this cream so much on my first try</li>
            <li> but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> so that makes it worth it!</li>
            <li> Would recommend to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth the premium price!</li>
            <li> oh well, it&#x27;s worth it to not have itchy skin!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for dry hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my dermatologist, and I like it.</li>
            <li> Using Amlactin, according to directions on the product, is a great way to get rid of scaley, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product to use for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> She said to use twice a day on clean skin.</li>
            <li> Plus Amazons price is the best so far, this product is $5 more in your average convenient store.</li>
            <li> Nothing special though.</li>
            <li> and I think they have a special preparation for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This is great for very dry, cracked ares of skin.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product, very effective for his dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My sister (who has amazing skin) touched my arms and was like \\&quot;WOW what did you do?!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want my feet to stay nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for a good moisturizing cream for my feet especially that does that and is not sticky......</li>
            <li> They seem not to buy him as much so for that I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good for your entire foot.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a good lotion for the overall body.</li>
            <li> I am sure that an adult would be able to use it more frequently.</li>
            <li> I have been using the AmLactin 12 % Moisturizing Lotion which is very good for dry skin, but I&#x27;m here to tell that this AmLactin Ultra Triple Action Alpha Hydroxy Acid Hydrating Body Cream is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Either way it dissipates rather quickly.</li>
            <li> can vouch for this product not only be effective but makes the skin look smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> The dermatologist i go to recommended this, turns out i have a mild form of eczema</li>
            <li> It worked so well, so quickly I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in the first 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a nice cream for my heels but have found better results with other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a strong believer that moisturizing your skin can cure a large amount of ailments that we all deal with (acne, KP, etc.).</li>
            <li> After using this consistently for 1-2 weeks, I enjoyed the benefits for another 1-2 weeks before I really had to reapply.</li>
            <li> Good for dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> but this is the REAL DEAL !!</li>
            <li> The AmLactin Ultra Triple Action Alpha Hydroxy Acid Hydrating Body Cream is very effective on very dry skin and strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is really good for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> this lotion does a superior job lubricating my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted the one I had tested and will not order the fragrance free again.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth even though I am a very outdoor person</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it and, after finishing off one tube, I&#x27;m convinced that this product is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> The thickness makes it a bit harder to rub throughout the skin, but it&#x27;s still good.  </li>
            <li> The lotion arrived in good shape as I expected that it would.  </li>
            <li> Still worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the great news is that I tried this lotion on my 12 year old son&#x27;s plantar warts that were on the sole of one foot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and this is coming from someone who has tried every lotion out there for severe dry skin and keratosis.</li>
            <li> The best dry skin cream I have ever used on my desert dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and love it!  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended AmLactin and he was right.</li>
            <li> I would probably try these first before the amlactin, since it&#x27;s a more health conscious option.</li>
            <li> After that, the skin on my hands is fresh, new, smooth, and healed.</li>
            <li> Yes, but the most important thing - for those of us who suffer from severe dry skin and psoriasis or eczema - IT</li>
            <li> try to only buy things that are Prime eligible, but was pleased with how quickly this was delivered this shipper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not a miracle cure, but it is effective treatment for extremely dry and bumpy skin.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> very very runny.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and this lotion does an amazing job of keeping my skin from feeling like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> When I ran out, I went to buy more only to discover that it had been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have to say it works pretty damn well.</li>
            <li> We were quite pleased with our purchase from Mr. Medical.  </li>
            <li> Just be certain you are getting the right Amlactin product.    </li>
            <li> I have tried so many lotions from simple unscented moisturizers, Dermasil, to Corn Huskers lotion and Noxzema.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in my life since the age of 12 that my arms and legs are silky</li>
            <li> First of all, no problems with the supplier.  </li>
            <li> first creme I have used that has made a real difference in my kp!</li>
            <li> The AmLactin Ultra Triple Action Alpha Hydroxy Acid Hydrating Body Cream is creamy, but not oily, it&#x27;s leaves your skin feeling so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff personally</li>
            <li> It keeps my feet feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many creams and lotions that are supposed to work for extreme situations and, although they helped some, nothing ever made a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> I had first tried this cream at my doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> and it definitely makes my arms more touchable.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a bit of a greasy feel at first but dissipates soon after.</li>
            <li> Pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just the moisture</li>
            <li> /&gt;(this is my first amazon review ever..)</li>
            <li> I can only use it at night but worked great to get rid of dry, bumpy skin.</li>
            <li> Very thick lotion, would be good for feet but its greasy!</li>
            <li> not a strong scent, which is good.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has the most complete selection of AmLactin products that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe but just one day after my first use my arm and leg skin was soft and sores were able to start healing on their own.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost, highly recommend if nothing else has worked for you.</li>
            <li> After the first application, my skin already felt so much smoother and softer, and the flakiness immediately went away.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion with a barrier cream on top and with in a couple days my hands were back to normal.</li>
            <li> My hands love to get dry and crack.</li>
            <li> I had very mild keratosis pilaris on my arms but moderate-severe on the back of my thighs and it handled both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried vaseline, ponds dry skin cream, drinking more water, EVOO and NOTHING helped.</li>
            <li> My daughter says that it does work, but it is so strong that it stings her hands, so she has to mix this lotion with another lotion to use it and then only a couple of days a week.</li>
            <li> That said, I have only noticed it being strong WHILE I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin---this makes it smooth as a babys butt!</li>
            <li> No odor, very creamy.</li>
            <li> This worked really well for me - even after just one application to my feet and legs.</li>
            <li> He has chemical burns which do not respond to regular lotion or creams, this cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Tops all high priced creams/lotions on the market today!</li>
            <li> This cream is really &amp;#34;the cream of the crop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This really works to soften skin and&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> I just found out about this product and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li> and this really helped with that.</li>
            <li> feet, very moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I expected more for the price....</li>
            <li> The smell is slightly unusual but dissipates withing minutes...should not deter from purchasing.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> It is especially good for preventing the ends of fingers from splitting when the weather is cold.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps keep the skin nourished.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my orthopedics Dr.</li>
            <li> It really had made a difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Her hands look and feel much better!We</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by a Dermatologist and has proved to very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> if I could (boys don&#x27;t really care for lotion</li>
            <li> Nothing has really worked until this.  </li>
            <li> and if it does, it goes in the garbage, not matter how much the cost.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> but I really did not like the smell.  </li>
            <li> Product really helps.  </li>
            <li> the AHA (alpha-hydroxy acid) really helps keep the skin supple.</li>
            <li> how much percentage alpha hydroxy acid added ?</li>
            <li> Hasnt helped much at all.</li>
            <li> The Amlactin really smooths your skin.  </li>
            <li> Really softens them.</li>
            <li> I highly endorse!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell it really works.  </li>
            <li> The smell is minimal and I don&#x27;t even notice it any more.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> This product was suggested by our dermatologist and really works.</li>
            <li> The lotion is much smoother.</li>
            <li> Used Amlactin as a prescription many years ago and decided to try again after readying other reviews&lt;br /&gt;particularly</li>
            <li> It has a strong odor but certainly works for very dry skin, bothered with redness and rash.  </li>
            <li> I will use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a commercial, but definitely true.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described, heals dry skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> My husband is a podiatrist and was writing prescriptions for Amlactin for his patients with severely dry skin before it was available over-the-counter.</li>
            <li> An older Amlactin Product called amlactin 12% moisturizing cream</li>
            <li> When triggered, it feels like my skin has gotten tight as shoe leather, inflamed and with a mighty burning fire!  </li>
            <li> Recommend it highly</li>
            <li> Since then it can be purchased without a prescription, but he still recommends it highly and gives samples of it to his patients.</li>
            <li> Makes your hands very smooth and will last for a long time without reapplying.</li>
            <li> It worked a little better in every way.</li>
            <li> It seems a little more creamy than the XL.</li>
            <li> One of the only products that consistently heals my cracked hands!</li>
            <li> I think this really helps keeping my skin young looking.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the extra cash compared to the cheaper lotions like Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly if you are looking for a true solution to dry skin.</li>
            <li> After only two days of use, my skin is responding nicely and is much less itchy because it&#x27;s retaining moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly new Amlactin user</li>
            <li> have found a new product,that we will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Been searching for a lotion that would help with super dry, patchy &amp; brown spots on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have been using Amlactin lotion for over 10 years, back in the day with it was only available by prescription.  </li>
            <li> i usually apply it in 2 applications because it gets absorbed so quickly.  </li>
            <li> but my skin was smoother and clear in two days!</li>
            <li> This is the FIRST product I have found that actually works on my condition.</li>
            <li> We use this on our feet and it makes them soft!</li>
            <li> my KP was completely GONE!</li>
            <li> No other product has come close to producing the smoothness of my skin that this particular Amlactin product has accomplished.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even here, where the altitude is high, the sun hot and the climate dry.</li>
            <li> Now aged on top of that there was flaky and crappie, dry skin.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy going on, but absorbs quickly and really helps the appearance of lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> When you live in Wisconsin, your skin during the winter gets pretty dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> clearly it</li>
            <li> The doctors have tried everything to clear it up and it never clears up.  </li>
            <li> I use this before I go to bed at night and wake up with silky soft hands.</li>
            <li> Too early for resultsvv</li>
            <li> The ends of my fingers were cracked with the winter weather, but they are now soft and healed.</li>
            <li> Amlactin is the ONLY thing that works for me, and it works fast.</li>
            <li> Buff and them put this on before bed, feet will be soft in the am.</li>
            <li> This cream is gentle enough for me to use on my face!  </li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft.  </li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended this for my 7 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I use this product to keep my feet soft.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t gone away completely, and I did stop applying for awhile</li>
            <li> I use it every night and it helps so much with moisturizing, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and people are always asking me what I do to keep my skin so young looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now committed to using it everywhere to keep my skin soft and touchable</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re at all self conscious about the way your skin looks or feels (as I was)</li>
            <li> and like it very much for dry skin.</li>
            <li> creams help our dry skin very much.</li>
            <li> and they got bumpier again, but quickly went back down after a few more applications.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST SAMPLE PACKET ALMOST HEALED MY DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> It really works to clear up dry skin, not just cover it.  </li>
            <li> That way it has been absorbed into the skin and my hands are dry enough to handle a racquet and not slip.</li>
            <li> The cream applies white, but takes awhile to rub in the skin even though it is not thick.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it said scent free.</li>
            <li> My first experience was with the Amlactin 12% Moisturizing Lotion beginning roughly 5 months ago.</li>
            <li> It is thick and soothing so it works good on the tight shoe leather feeling</li>
            <li> Seems to be working very well for dry arms.</li>
            <li> My legs have more recently been effected while i have had KP on my arms for at least 7 years.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth a shot if you&#x27;re running out of options, but I am slightly bothered by the smell.  </li>
            <li> This is no foo-foo cream, this is the real deal with ingredients formerly allowed only by prescription.</li>
            <li> Thick, heavy cream - good for feet.</li>
            <li> It is marketed as fragrance free, but has  definite slightly unpleasant odor that doesn&#x27;t dissipate for two or more hours.  </li>
            <li> I saw instant results in this patients skin from crocodile to baby soft!</li>
            <li> It helps my hands like no other and I suffer from dermatitis.</li>
            <li> it moistens like no other</li>
            <li> She also says that it does have a slight odor to it, but not bad enough to quit using it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really thick, but works fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would be nice if it were odorless, but the active ingredients do have something of an odor, but at least there are no sensitizing or offensive fragrances</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that I slather it on daily during dry season and use up the tubes too quickly since it is relatively pricey used that way.</li>
            <li> I bought it to treat keratosis pilaris as well as hyperpigmentation marks left from old spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a nurse &amp; my husband &amp; I are both members of the American Professional Wound Care Association.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone with extremely dry, peel skin, or with KP.</li>
            <li> I had dry skin, especially on my forearms, probably caused by spending so much time on the golf course.</li>
            <li> With regular use, skin is soft and moisturized for much longer than other lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using it since the KP became less obvious, and have continued to use LUSH buffy body butter (as a scrub) and pure coconut oil after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years now and highly recommend it to anyone with very dry hands.</li>
            <li> It is VERY thick, not like a regular lotion or even most body butters.</li>
            <li> no dry skin...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for people with vascular disease, diabetes, and other disorders which cause dry skin, including disorders such as hypothyroidism and just plain dry skin due to weather, sun exposure or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Naturally my hands get very dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I also have KP on my legs, but the cream didn&#x27;t really seem to have any effect on those stubborn little bumps.</li>
            <li> It really has helped me with the little cracks that seem to be never ending and hurt.</li>
            <li> It is thick but is absorbed and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Previous to using this product, only Tanning would be effective but not a ideal solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention that I bought this for 15 dollars on Amazon and it is a few dollars more expensive at the three other stores that I looked at first.</li>
            <li> I use it for dry skin but also as an occasional facial mask.  </li>
            <li> Amlactin essentially gets rid of it...as long as you keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually slightly stung on the first few applications, you can feel it going deep into the layers.  </li>
            <li> Have some dark brown spots that are fading also with the use of Amlactin Ultra, the above mentioned are history right now after using this twice a day as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot imagine how I feel right now after years of hiding my skin and afraid of human touch because of those bumps, all I can say now is</li>
            <li> In addition, this product keeps the skin hydrated for a very long period of time (it should last 24 hours if you apply twice a day, as it recommends).</li>
            <li> have bought probably every product on the market over the years (I&#x27;ve had this for over 10 years), and while some things clear it up slightly it always returns.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I used it for several consecutive days, and my dry skin went away.</li>
            <li> It not only treats the dry skin, but seems to heal it too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 25 years old, black,</li>
            <li> He was left with a rather rough looking sole of his foot.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to apply this stuff while your skin wet or simply stick to the regular AmLactin, that is what I will be doing.</li>
            <li> Very thick cream, so be careful if walking right after application, I usually use it right before I intend to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Only had to use it for several days to get rid of the extreme dryness.  </li>
            <li> not a fan of this stuff at all its very heavy and feels like you put a layer of straight vasline on .. does not aborb well either ... and doesnt even help dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> That being said it honestly doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
            <li> In that time I noticed a lightening of the dark spots and general evening of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t seem to linger quite as long as with the lotion</li>
            <li> Like that it keeps my skin moisturized for a long time.  </li>
            <li> , I had been told by a skin doctor to purchase this product to fluff off extra unwanted skin cells</li>
            <li> I will see how long I can stand it.</li>
            <li> worth noting that the smell of this product is not attractive.</li>
            <li> Also, Amlactin can be a little sticky when you first apply it, so I usually apply it at night.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only been able to get him to use it once because of the bad smell.</li>
            <li> Also helps with flaking dry Winter skin.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended it to a patient of mine with severe dry skin.</li>
            <li> I went looking for Amlactin XL - which is a product I have used for years - on my doctor&#x27;s recommendation for extremely dry skin on my arms.  </li>
            <li> My heels were crackers and toes were dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin and this cream helps keep it moisturized and from feeling parched.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cream that will help your dry skin..</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it works to help my dry hands.  </li>
            <li> My hands became so dry and cracked it would hurt to move my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I also had these dry marks by my mouth that wouldn&#x27;t go away</li>
            <li> My hands can be dry, flaky, cracked, and bleeding ,and one use of this will heal them almost instantaneously.</li>
            <li> I have particularly dry feet and have tried every product on the market.</li>
            <li> HELPS WITH MY DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my dermatologist to use this cream for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t just moisturize dry skin, it heals it.  </li>
            <li> It also works on dry cracked heels, etc.  </li>
            <li> This lotion was recommeded to me by my doctor to help with my dry skin on my heels, thumbs and fingertips.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to relieve a severe dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for Amlactin and decided to try yet another product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> have severely dry and itchy skin on the palms, wrist and sometimes the inside of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> It is so intensely dry and itchy</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin on my fingers; the skin would peel, itch, crack, bleed.  </li>
            <li> I use it specifically on my feet which have a tendency to get dry.  </li>
            <li> Aging, dry skin on my arms and legs caused itching and scratching.</li>
            <li> I teach tennis and my hands are always Dry and cracked and peeling.</li>
            <li> it does not ever dry sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s not easy for me to apply because it is thick, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I keep going back because nothing else calms it down like Amlactin.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit and therefore it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry cracked feet and have tried everything, this is for you!  </li>
            <li> (all of which seem to help my KP be less obvious.  </li>
            <li> and I only need a little bit on where I get my dry skin and BAM, it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> and I do get little red bumps all over, but the pain/burning only lasts a minute and the redness goes down after about an hour or two.</li>
            <li> works well on very dry skin</li>
            <li> The skin on my legs is very dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very, VERY dry...</li>
            <li> I had very unflattering dry spots that were like little dots on my skin, after just a few days they began to disappear and after a few weeks are almost gone.</li>
            <li> This product actually made my dark spots darker!</li>
            <li> What can I say other than this product  hydrates my aging dry skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> I think I have tried every other lotion and creme which is supposed to help dry skin - not one worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive compared to similar products, but it really works well.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working well, we&#x27;ll see when the container is empty.</li>
            <li> sadly you do need to keep at it for quiet a while and the cracks do come back if you do not change habits and completely stop using it</li>
            <li> Rough feet?</li>
            <li> It actually retextures your skin and can do it within a few days.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no fragrance, it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky at all either.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Amlactin for a particularly rough area on my elbow and it improved the appearance and feel in just one day.  </li>
            <li> After only a few days the area was almost</li>
            <li> After only using it for a few days I can already feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I spent years googling \\&quot;KP</li>
            <li> hence, there was no real improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little does go a long way though</li>
            <li> My skin, which is not sensitive, stung a little after application.</li>
            <li> watch out, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things where a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the x3 expensive DERMAdoctor, KP duty because it does not give the results as quick or as noticeable</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores and this was cheaper than any other place we found on e internet</li>
            <li> other creams seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> She has small bumps on the back of her arms.  </li>
            <li> Others share by other lotions and creams but they didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Not a pretty sight.  </li>
            <li> it conjunction with another cream and switch off (the other one has salicylic acid).</li>
            <li> Pricey, but it only takes a small dab of the product to get results.</li>
            <li> , just popped up in the last few years or so, he recommended this lotion and its doing wonders, no more dry irritated skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways!!</li>
            <li> This cream has strong bad smell.</li>
            <li> It is not filled with fragrances that actually dry out your skin so it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t losing a star for smelling like ammonia since that is one of the active ingredients, and</li>
            <li> I had a skin rash and dry skin on my elbows; wearing this overnight for a few days healed all of it.  </li>
            <li> I tried every over the counter lotion anyone recommended with no success.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to buy this cream but after reading the reviews decided to try it (still skeptical)</li>
            <li> you should definitely try this product for at least a week.</li>
            <li> all, I like this product enough so that I won&#x27;t be forced to switch brands.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t really attest to the efficacy of this product yet for my KP, but for those of you wondering what the smell is like, I would compare it to stale black licorice.  </li>
            <li> I am never wasting another dime on any other hand cream!</li>
            <li> A little pricey compared to other well known brands you see on store shelves.</li>
            <li> but to much lessor extent) deep fissures that were painful and probably would have bleed if not for this product.</li>
            <li> Have to say it definitely moisturizes, but the smell , thank God it is subtle, is horrendous , smells like vomit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but a little dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my face, even though it burns a little.</li>
            <li> It takes a little elbow grease to get it all rubbed in</li>
            <li> so glad I found it, because my skin was painful!  </li>
            <li> I think the cream is a little pricey for the quantity</li>
            <li> this has lactic acid in it, and it burns a little if I put it on after I shave.  </li>
            <li> the little dark bumps on my arms, legs, and butt were disintegrating!</li>
            <li> product was described as the only product to get rid of Keratosis Pilaris (looks like red chicken skin bumps) often on the backs of arms and legs that I&#x27;ve battled since a kid.  </li>
            <li> so I have to wash my hands a lot, and with harsh soaps.</li>
            <li> , I am still using it for a few days a month</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this product on my feet 2X per day, my heels were no longer cracked and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin no longer dried up almost immediately after application and remained moist.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been discontinued and after reading all the glowing reports of the AmLactin Triple Action Hydrating Body Cream, I decided to buy some.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that is has a slightly sour smell, but I will take decreased foot pain over the thousands of rosy or mintly smelling creams that leave me limping.</li>
            <li> Amlactin hand cream with the green cap which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> but because it takes much longer to absorb into my skin it smells bad for longer.  </li>
            <li> No more stocking that are torn because of cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday of my life!</li>
            <li> No more rubbing vaseline on my hands every night and putting them in socks to trap the moisture (a trick that&#x27;s been recommended from my dermatologist).</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in my skin bumps after just a few days!</li>
            <li> There were 7 small pea sized holes and calloused skin where the warts used to be.  </li>
            <li> I love that my Dermatologist loves this cream, but it has the worst &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; smell ever.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic difference in my very dry skin on my legs.</li>
            <li> The base of the tube split the first time I squeezed it.</li>
            <li> She has keratosis pilaris, and everything I&#x27;ve found said that it&#x27;s pretty permanent, not to mention annoying.</li>
            <li> Do not use on broken skin - it has a slight acid that will sting.  </li>
            <li> itchiness at bay,  Thick but</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy and needs to be used 2x a day for a while, at night with socks.</li>
            <li> and it is not as thick.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I SUFFERED for a LONG time from stupid dry skin</li>
            <li> I have serious issues with my heels.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is too thick and it smells just as bad as regular AmLactin</li>
            <li> My husband suffers with very, very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Be aware some terrible seller return policy (15% re-stocking fee&lt;br /&gt;minimum) before you buy it.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t get rid of all of the effects of KP, but combined with exfoliation, it cut down on my chicken skin after a month or two of use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend everyone with painful dry skin to try it.</li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> It works well on my very bad and chronic dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and smells bad.</li>
            <li> Amlactin Ultra moisturizing cream is expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it does work.</li>
            <li> I knew he was looking at an uncomfortable experience.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find in any drug store, so went onto Amazon...</li>
            <li> This lotion stinks.  </li>
            <li> Also, I felt it had an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> My heels and feet were in bad shape, so I began researching products.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my arms but hate it bc of the greedy feeling.</li>
            <li> I also noted it is sticky, which can be annoying.</li>
            <li> The stickiness is annoying (it never seems to fully absorb) and the ammonia smell is strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hated using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the horrible blood blisters I used to get</li>
            <li> This stuff smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> The smell, and yes, it is a smell, and not &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; as one reviewer stated, was so awful that I had to wash my hands!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m awaiting the AmLactin LOTION which I hope doesn&#x27;t have that awful smell</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not a fan of this stuff at all its very heavy and feels like you put a layer of straight vasline on .. does not aborb well either ... and doesnt even help dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse so I have to wash my hands a lot, and with harsh soaps. Naturally my hands get very dry and cracked. I use this before I go to bed at night and wake up with silky soft hands. Don&#x27;t be put off by the smell. It is not filled with fragrances that actually dry out your skin so it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; smell. But that&#x27;s not what I am looking for. I have used this for a couple of years now and highly recommend it to anyone with very dry hands. I can&#x27;t say what it would be like as a body lotion though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my  2 yr old grand daughter who has fairly severe eczema. My daughter says that it does work, but it is so strong that it stings her hands, so she has to mix this lotion with another lotion to use it and then only a couple of days a week. I am sure that an adult would be able to use it more frequently. She also says that it does have a slight odor to it, but not bad enough to quit using it.</li>
            <li> Arrived at packaged. No odor, very creamy. I was noticeably softer the next morning. Husband reports it feels like I shaved....my shoulders. I&#x27;ve never had hair on my shoulders.... 5 stars</li>
            <li> This is a good product. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but that quickly dissipates. Although it says it is a body cream, I do also use it on my face where I see the best results. It feels heavy going on, but absorbs quickly and really helps the appearance of lines and wrinkles. Also helps with flaking dry Winter skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent care for dry skin</li>
            <li> Very thick lotion, would be good for feet but its greasy! I bought it for my arms but hate it bc of the greedy feeling.</li>
            <li> works well on very dry skin</li>
            <li> Not sticky on skin like original Amlactin. Too early for resultsvv</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer for dry climates.  Do not use on broken skin - it has a slight acid that will sting.  It was amazing for our Grand Canyon trip.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. A dermatologist recommended it to a patient of mine with severe dry skin. I saw instant results in this patients skin from crocodile to baby soft! Of course, I ordered it for myself. I love the smooth, non-greasy feel of this moisturizer. It leaves my skin feeling like I have had a paraffin wrap.</li>
            <li> This worked really well for me - even after just one application to my feet and legs. My dermatologist recommended it and, after finishing off one tube, I&#x27;m convinced that this product is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I went looking for Amlactin XL - which is a product I have used for years - on my doctor&#x27;s recommendation for extremely dry skin on my arms.  I also use it on my feet.  I guess they have changed the named from XL to Ultra (I guess? ) - but this seems to be the same product.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> The only foot cream you&#x27;ll ever need ! Laurie&#x27;s LIkes</li>
            <li> Amlactin is the best cream my husband has used on his hands.  He has chemical burns which do not respond to regular lotion or creams, this cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li> For very dry skin this is a wonderful product. Before I used Amlactin I had to use cream that required a prescription. Amlactin does the job better.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working well, we&#x27;ll see when the container is empty.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist gave me samples. It helped my feet so wonderfully. My heels were crackers and toes were dry and cracked. The samples made such a difference that I knew I had to buy the Amlactin myself. I received it 2 days ago and using it already. I want my feet to stay nice and soft. I will order again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used to combat dry scaly legs.</li>
            <li> This is great for very dry, cracked ares of skin. A little goes a long way. Not greasy. No fragrance.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested I get AmLactin cream and it works wonderful.  I have given several tubes away to my friends that have cracked heels.  All have used it have loved it. It burns a bit if you have cracked skin but soon stops. No more stocking that are torn because of cracked heels.</li>
            <li> not a strong scent, which is good.  works ok, not as effective as i was hoping for though.  a little does go a long way though</li>
            <li> Been searching for a lotion that would help with super dry, patchy &amp; brown spots on my legs. Glad it was recommended by my doctor. My legs are now smooth &amp; I wear shorts all the time. If you appy this after shower after you shower &amp; before going to bed, you will see great results. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69 and have been looking for years years for the cream that would take my bumpy skin away. Now aged on top of that there was flaky and crappie, dry skin. Have some dark brown spots that are fading also with the use of Amlactin Ultra, the above mentioned are history right now after using this twice a day as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot imagine how I feel right now after years of hiding my skin and afraid of human touch because of those bumps, all I can say now is Thank You and please can you make larger containers!</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin and this cream helps keep it moisturized and from feeling parched.  However, I cannot use it because of the smell.  Some reviews said it has an ammonia smell.  I don&#x27;t smell ammonia, just a stinky cream that takes many hours to dissipate.  The cream applies white, but takes awhile to rub in the skin even though it is not thick. I also noted it is sticky, which can be annoying.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cream that will help your dry skin..you&#x27;ve found it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly new Amlactin user but I&#x27;ve grown to like it quite a bit. My first experience was with the Amlactin 12% Moisturizing Lotion beginning roughly 5 months ago. I bought it to treat keratosis pilaris as well as hyperpigmentation marks left from old spots. The 14.1 oz bottle lasted 2 months of daily use. In that time I noticed a lightening of the dark spots and general evening of my skin tone. But no improvement with my KP. The stickiness is annoying (it never seems to fully absorb) and the ammonia smell is strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not fully satisfied with the lotion I moved on to the now discontinued 12% Moisturizing Body Cream. As I understand it, it is the same formula as the 12% lotion in a different form. That said, my results were quite different. I bought 2 4.9 oz tubes and each lasted about 1 month. I saw continued evening of my skin tone, better hydration, and significant improvement in my KP. The smell didn&#x27;t seem to linger quite as long as with the lotion and I felt no stickiness with the cream. It worked a little better in every way. When I ran out, I went to buy more only to discover that it had been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amlactin Ultra Hydrating Body Cream replaces the 12% Body Cream and the XL lotion (which I didn&#x27;t use). Amlactin Ultra is essentially the same formula as the XL lotion, in a thicker (cream) form. It is very thick but it spreads and absorbs well. I&#x27;d say that the smell lasts longer than either the 12% lotion or cream but it does eventually go away. I found it to be better for hydration than the 12% formula. It does keep my skin looking good (fresh) and it does seem to keep my KP at bay though not as well as the discontinued 12% cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I like this product enough so that I won&#x27;t be forced to switch brands. But I wish the 12% cream was still available.</li>
            <li> After prescribing many products, including special prescriptions from a formulary pharmacy, my dermatologist suggested I try this for my foot pustular and placque psoriasis. I keep going back because nothing else calms it down like Amlactin.  Switched from Amlactin to Amlactin Ultra and put it on before bed time with cotton socks.  It does the best job of any product I have ever used, prescription or over-the-counter.  I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, but if you have problems on your hands or feet and nothing else works, apply this cream and cover with socks or gloves, it may be the lifesaver it has been for me. I don&#x27;t get the horrible blood blisters I used to get and although I still have psoriasis, it is not noticeable as it was for years.</li>
            <li> The best dry skin cream I have ever used on my desert dry skin.  Tops all high priced creams/lotions on the market today!</li>
            <li> Like that it keeps my skin moisturized for a long time.  The thickness makes it a bit harder to rub throughout the skin, but it&#x27;s still good.  Still waiting for significant results after having it for almost a month though</li>
            <li> What can I say other than this product  hydrates my aging dry skin on my face.  Who would have thought it would be a great face cream, but the doctor recommended it for pre skin peel and I liked it so much I am continuing it.</li>
            <li> This cream is really &amp;#34;the cream of the crop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream available.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> This really works to soften skin and&lt;br /&gt;Keep itchiness at bay,  Thick but&lt;br /&gt;Rubs in well.  Recommend it highly&lt;br /&gt;🐱</li>
            <li> I had dry skin, especially on my forearms, probably caused by spending so much time on the golf course. My dermatologist recommended AmLactin and he was right. I used it for several consecutive days, and my dry skin went away. Now I use it whenever I think about it, which might be once every couple of weeks, and the flakes have not returned. It not only treats the dry skin, but seems to heal it too. It&#x27;s quite expensive compared to similar products, but it really works well.</li>
            <li> I used to get the original formula Amlactin and it worked great on my eczema.  I don&#x27;t think this new formulation is quite as good but I will stick with it because I don&#x27;t have anything better to use right now.</li>
            <li> Works better than the lotion.  Only had to use it for several days to get rid of the extreme dryness.  Legs looked smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li> The base of the tube split the first time I squeezed it. Now it dispenses from that end. The product itself works.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it works to help my dry hands.  After I had a baby, I started washing my hands ALL THE TIME.  My hands became so dry and cracked it would hurt to move my fingers.  I used this lotion with a barrier cream on top and with in a couple days my hands were back to normal.</li>
            <li> Really good lotion.  Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> The lotion arrived in perfect condition and was just what I needed. I will likely order again when I run out</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some. Seems to work well. Non greasy</li>
            <li> Cured my psoriasis on the palms of my hands...after many prescription drugs, treatments..$$$  this cured it! I use it everyday of my life!</li>
            <li> I just found out about this product and it has worked very well. I&#x27;m a strong believer that moisturizing your skin can cure a large amount of ailments that we all deal with (acne, KP, etc.). Not only does this moisturize but the lactic acid dissolves unwanted substances that might be causing your flaky skin, kp, acne, etc. The KP on my legs has faded significantly within the 3 days I&#x27;ve been using it. The ones on my arm are still there but I will give it time and see what happens. My legs have more recently been effected while i have had KP on my arms for at least 7 years. I&#x27;m guessing that is why there is a difference but who knows? I also had these dry marks by my mouth that wouldn&#x27;t go away and this really helped with that. Oh i also recommend using this product at night and putting vaseline oil over the amlactin. Many people complain about the smell but this product isn&#x27;t made to smell pretty. It&#x27;s made to hydrate severely dehydrated skin. I have to say it works pretty damn well. That being said it honestly doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. I kinda like it. Either way it dissipates rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve found for *extremely* dry skin.  Used regularly it keeps my hands and cuticles, and feet, very moisturized.  I never shower without slathering it on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for the skin. We couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores and this was cheaper than any other place we found on e internet</li>
            <li> Searched for this product after reading an article &amp;#34;top drugstore miracles&amp;#34; and found it on amazon because I have not seen it sold in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was described as the only product to get rid of Keratosis Pilaris (looks like red chicken skin bumps) often on the backs of arms and legs that I&#x27;ve battled since a kid.  Previous to using this product, only Tanning would be effective but not a ideal solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can vouch for this product not only be effective but makes the skin look smooth and hydrated.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the x3 expensive DERMAdoctor, KP duty because it does not give the results as quick or as noticeable</li>
            <li> The lotion arrived in good shape as I expected that it would.  It is the same product I have purchased from a local drug store before and about the same price when you count shipping.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended to us by our dermatologist.  It is the best lotion for dry skin (and bruising from blood thinners) that I have ever encountered.  It is thick but is absorbed and not greasy.  We love it.</li>
            <li> We were quite pleased with our purchase from Mr. Medical.  It arrived well within the estimated time of delivery.  This product was recommended by my husband&#x27;s dermatologist for itching.  My husband uses it mostly on his back and says it is very effective.  He is quite pleased with it.  He likes it better than the Amlactin lotion.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very fast. This is the thicker version of the lotion. I had been told about it at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office. Wow, what an incredible difference it has made in just 4 days of using it.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands and this lotion was a godsend.</li>
            <li> The skin on my legs is very dry and flaky. I&#x27;ve tried loads of different products on the market, but this one has given me the best results for my skin. After the first application, my skin already felt so much smoother and softer, and the flakiness immediately went away. In addition, this product keeps the skin hydrated for a very long period of time (it should last 24 hours if you apply twice a day, as it recommends). I also have KP on my legs, but the cream didn&#x27;t really seem to have any effect on those stubborn little bumps. Others have had better results with their KP when using AmLactin, so it could just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d give it a 4/5 stars. It&#x27;s rather pricey for the 5 ounces or so that you get, imo.</li>
            <li> Great for diagnosed Ickthyosis--not contagious, but annoying and inherited.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist i go to recommended this, turns out i have a mild form of eczema, just popped up in the last few years or so, he recommended this lotion and its doing wonders, no more dry irritated skin. Plus Amazons price is the best so far, this product is $5 more in your average convenient store.</li>
            <li> This worked ok, but I can&#x27;t quite tell if it really helped get rid of my KP on its own, because I used this in combination with a shower scrub, pure coconut oil and sun exposure (all of which seem to help my KP be less obvious.  I think it&#x27;s worth a shot if you&#x27;re running out of options, but I am slightly bothered by the smell.  I have stopped using it since the KP became less obvious, and have continued to use LUSH buffy body butter (as a scrub) and pure coconut oil after a shower.  I would probably try these first before the amlactin, since it&#x27;s a more health conscious option.</li>
            <li> Hi there, I have or should I say had severely cracked heal skin, it has (still does but to much lessor extent) deep fissures that were painful and probably would have bleed if not for this product. I had already tried Heal Tastic for over a year but it not do the trick. An older Amlactin Product called amlactin 12% moisturizing cream also did not work and was rather smelly which would have been ok if it worked. But stuff is the answer. It is thick and creamy and needs to be used 2x a day for a while, at night with socks. But after a short I saw a vast improvement and one that lasts. Just be certain you are getting the right Amlactin product.    update... sadly you do need to keep at it for quiet a while and the cracks do come back if you do not change habits and completely stop using it, I am still using it for a few days a month</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product, very effective for his dry skin.  Good quick delivery from supplier.</li>
            <li> Chose this body cream because of husband&#x27;s recommendation. It is expensive but worth the extra money. The ends of my fingers were cracked with the winter weather, but they are now soft and healed.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders. Use daily.</li>
            <li> I expected more for the price....other creams seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have any specific skin diseases, I have suffered from chapped hands my entire life, even in the summer. My hands love to get dry and crack. I have tried so many lotions from simple unscented moisturizers, Dermasil, to Corn Huskers lotion and Noxzema. Amlactin is the ONLY thing that works for me, and it works fast. No more rubbing vaseline on my hands every night and putting them in socks to trap the moisture (a trick that&#x27;s been recommended from my dermatologist). My hands can be dry, flaky, cracked, and bleeding ,and one use of this will heal them almost instantaneously. The only downside is that if you have any open cuts, it burns. In fact, this lotion burns my hands every time I use and I do get little red bumps all over, but the pain/burning only lasts a minute and the redness goes down after about an hour or two. After that, the skin on my hands is fresh, new, smooth, and healed. It&#x27;s truly a miracle lotion.</li>
            <li> Best foo cream for cracked feet. Rough feet? Buff and them put this on before bed, feet will be soft in the am. Very thick cream, so be careful if walking right after application, I usually use it right before I intend to fall asleep. Contains Alpha Hydroxy which gently eats away at the  dead skin</li>
            <li> I was using regular Amlactin lotion to help reduce red bumps from keratosis pelaris (KP). It helped, but it was so greasy I hated using it. It felt like there was a layer of slime sitting on top of my skin. This product is so much better! The Ultra is not greasy at all, and seems to help the bumps just as well, while offering more moisturizing power. I would highly recommend this for anyone with extremely dry, peel skin, or with KP. This won&#x27;t get rid of all of the effects of KP, but combined with exfoliation, it cut down on my chicken skin after a month or two of use.</li>
            <li> Week in - already seeing great results!</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris and have been trying to find a solution for years. I had tried countless moisturizing products and exfoliation products. I even tried Korea Italy towels after reading so many great things about them from others with KP - nothing groundbreaking. After about 3-4 days of using AmLactin, the results were drastic. This is the FIRST product I have found that actually works on my condition. This is the first time in my life since the age of 12 that my arms and legs are silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth noting that the smell of this product is not attractive. It isn&#x27;t losing a star for smelling like ammonia since that is one of the active ingredients, and clearly it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a miracle cure, but it is effective treatment for extremely dry and bumpy skin.  After using this consistently for 1-2 weeks, I enjoyed the benefits for another 1-2 weeks before I really had to reapply.</li>
            <li> Great product...non greasy ...no dry skin...amazing for feet too!  The smell is slightly unusual but dissipates withing minutes...should not deter from purchasing.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is wonderful!  Makes your hands very smooth and will last for a long time without reapplying. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have particularly dry feet and have tried every product on the market. This cream works like a charm. Really like it.</li>
            <li> real nice, nourishing body cream.</li>
            <li> This is no foo-foo cream, this is the real deal with ingredients formerly allowed only by prescription. It helps the driest of skin with proven hydrating agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice if it were odorless, but the active ingredients do have something of an odor, but at least there are no sensitizing or offensive fragrances added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extra bang for your buck, put it on damp skin and sleep in cotton socks or gloves.</li>
            <li> My pharmacist recommended this. I love it. The only drawback is that I slather it on daily during dry season and use up the tubes too quickly since it is relatively pricey used that way. Still worth it.</li>
            <li> First of all, no problems with the supplier.  The product came on time and in good shape.  I was looking forward to using it to help correct a skin problem.  But after three days of use I just couldn&#x27;t get used to the smell.  It is marketed as fragrance free, but has  definite slightly unpleasant odor that doesn&#x27;t dissipate for two or more hours.  I would like to try it again if this problem could be corrected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really thick, but works fine.  Nothing special though.</li>
            <li> Amlactin is the best cream/lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It was recommended by my dermatologist. It actually retextures your skin and can do it within a few days. I even use it on my face, even though it burns a little. I know it&#x27;s from the lactic acid, so I know it&#x27;s good for me. Sometimes I use Amlactin in conjunction with a creamier product. Also, Amlactin can be a little sticky when you first apply it, so I usually apply it at night.</li>
            <li> first creme I have used that has made a real difference in my kp!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD CREAM.  HELPS WITH MY DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Noticeable difference in my skin bumps after just a few days! I love it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed Amlactin lotion for me for a skin problem I once had.  Now that it is sold over-the-counter I get it all the time.  I only use it on my hands though.  It is especially good for preventing the ends of fingers from splitting when the weather is cold.  Amlactin is also good to use on the feet to prevent scaliness and cracking and I think they have a special preparation for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my dermatologist to use this cream for dry skin.  It does have a bit of smell, but I use it once a week and it really helps keep the skin nourished.</li>
            <li> Amlactin Ultra moisturizing cream is expensive. Yes, but the most important thing - for those of us who suffer from severe dry skin and psoriasis or eczema - IT WORKS! With regular use, skin is soft and moisturized for much longer than other lotions I have tried. I recommend it highly if you are looking for a true solution to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my orthopedics Dr. I have been using the AmLactin 12 % Moisturizing Lotion which is very good for dry skin, but I&#x27;m here to tell that this AmLactin Ultra Triple Action Alpha Hydroxy Acid Hydrating Body Cream is fantastic.  The AmLactin Ultra Triple Action Alpha Hydroxy Acid Hydrating Body Cream is creamy, but not oily, it&#x27;s leaves your skin feeling so smooth and silky.  The AmLactin Ultra Triple Action Alpha Hydroxy Acid Hydrating Body Cream is very effective on very dry skin and strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great lotion and a much better price than other sites.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells terrible.  I dont know how well it might work because I cant stand the scent.  Not sure why it said scent free.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for dry hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my dermatologist, and I like it.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my dermatologist. Both forearms had peeling skin and this product corrects that.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the lotion.</li>
            <li> My skin, which is not sensitive, stung a little after application. Also, I felt it had an unpleasant smell. Maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> Highly excellent product and seller.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Been using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist.  It is really amazing stuff at a very affordable price.  I use it for dry skin but also as an occasional facial mask.  It doesn&#x27;t just moisturize dry skin, it heals it.  I had a skin rash and dry skin on my elbows; wearing this overnight for a few days healed all of it.  It also works on dry cracked heels, etc.  This is a great all around product to keep around.</li>
            <li> The best hand lotion on the face of the earth!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product. As described.</li>
            <li> My husband is a podiatrist and was writing prescriptions for Amlactin for his patients with severely dry skin before it was available over-the-counter. Since then it can be purchased without a prescription, but he still recommends it highly and gives samples of it to his patients. I LOVE this stuff personally and so does he. We have a ton of it and never run out. it&#x27;s great for people with vascular disease, diabetes, and other disorders which cause dry skin, including disorders such as hypothyroidism and just plain dry skin due to weather, sun exposure or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this version better than the Amlactin XL because it absorbs into the skin quicker and it is not as thick. It seems a little more creamy than the XL. ALL Amlactin products are fantastic.....just depends on what you are wanting or using it for. The lotion, of course, absorbs the fastest. My husband &amp; I especially like to use Amlactin on our hands. It keeps my fingernails from being brittle, as I do have hypothyroidism. Its a great after sun lotion too, to prevent the peeling you often get. I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a nurse &amp; my husband &amp; I are both members of the American Professional Wound Care Association. When we go to wound care conferences, we often go to the Amlactin booth and pick up as many samples as we can get our hands on. They have many products. All of their lotions are available over-the-counter. No.....we are not paid endorsers.....just big fans of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Perfect aid for my eczema</li>
            <li> This cream has strong bad smell. Be aware some terrible seller return policy (15% re-stocking fee&lt;br /&gt;minimum) before you buy it.</li>
            <li> very very runny. don&amp;#34;t know if was suppose too be or not.</li>
            <li> Good for dry itchy skin. Stay out of the sun!!</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommeded to me by my doctor to help with my dry skin on my heels, thumbs and fingertips. My skin is very dry and this lotion does an amazing job of keeping my skin from feeling like sandpaper. It really has helped me with the little cracks that seem to be never ending and hurt. I apply this lotion twice daily and put on my socks after applying to my feet. It really had made a difference.</li>
            <li> This cream is gentle enough for me to use on my face!  There is absolutely no fragrance, it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky at all either.  My skin has never felt so soft.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to relieve a severe dry skin problem. It is a miracle cream IMO. It worked so well, so quickly I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. Watch where and who you purchase it from. Make sure you read the lables. Amlactin makes a variety of different products for all kinds of skin conditions. There is a big difference between cream and lotion  The price for this product should be around  $15. Some places are selling this for $29+. Some Big Box drugstores also carry some AmLactin products,but not all of them. Amazon has the most complete selection of AmLactin products that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Using Amlactin, according to directions on the product, is a great way to get rid of scaley, dry skin.  I noticed a huge difference in the first 24 hrs. of use.  I hope I can buy and use it forever!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It helps my hands like no other and I suffer from dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it does work. My feet look so much better I am happy.  I plan on switching to this product.</li>
            <li> This cream is better than many hand lotions I have tried, but not as good as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Amlactin hand cream with the green cap which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> My wife has eczema on her hands and this lotion clears it up within days! Her hands look and feel much better!We have found a new product,that we will continue to buy.Shipping from Amazon Prime,this is a hit!!!</li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic difference in my very dry skin on my legs. I had very unflattering dry spots that were like little dots on my skin, after just a few days they began to disappear and after a few weeks are almost gone. Just two times a day is enough to see a change</li>
            <li> OH MY GOD IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I SUFFERED for a LONG time from stupid dry skin, I had a couple rashes in two spots on my arms because I would unknowingly scratch my arms in my sleep.  My doctor prescribed me some anti fungal cream for the rash and it didn&#x27;t work.  Hydrocortizone didn&#x27;t work.  I happened to be at a pharmacy that had samples of this lotion and I was desperate, willing to try anything, so I stuffed my purse full of them.  THE FIRST SAMPLE PACKET ALMOST HEALED MY DRY SKIN OH MY GOD.  I IMMEDIATELY ordered this bottle and I only need a little bit on where I get my dry skin and BAM, it&#x27;s gone.  I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT.  I AM STOKED!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband suffers with very, very dry skin.  He doesn&#x27;t like any fragrance and doesn&#x27;t like the oily feeling some lotions give you.  He loves this product and there was a noticeable change to his skin almost immeidatley.  It keeps my feet feeling soft and smooth.  A product we both can use.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a while and like it very much for dry skin. Was recommended to me by a Dermatologist and has proved to very satisfactory. It&#x27;s the best that I have found. Will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use for dry skin.  It only takes a little bit and therefore it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This was recommended and it has really helped my dried out skin. I would recommend this because my feet feel so much better.I had know problem with the product or the deller. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many creams and lotions that are supposed to work for extreme situations and, although they helped some, nothing ever made a significant difference.  My dermatologist recommended Amlactin for a particularly rough area on my elbow and it improved the appearance and feel in just one day.  After only a few days the area was almost gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to only buy things that are Prime eligible, but was pleased with how quickly this was delivered this shipper.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I must say. I am always on the hunt for a good moisturizing cream for my feet especially that does that and is not sticky......this fits the bill, finally.</li>
            <li> I have serious issues with my heels.  I feel like this is a nice cream for my heels but have found better results with other products.</li>
            <li> This lotion stinks.  After applying it, I was so grossed out by the ammonia stink of pee, I had to immediately scrub off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended this for my 7 year old daughter.  She has small bumps on the back of her arms.  It cured it and we only have to use it about 2-3 times a week!</li>
            <li> My heels and feet were in bad shape, so I began researching products.  I read the reviews for Amlactin and decided to try yet another product for dry skin.  I am glad I bought Amlactin Ultra!  This lotion is fantastic!  Within a few days of using this product on my feet 2X per day, my heels were no longer cracked and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the great news is that I tried this lotion on my 12 year old son&#x27;s plantar warts that were on the sole of one foot.  Warts supposedly respond to acid, so I tried OTC wart removal treatments on my son&#x27;s plantar warts.  These products did not help at all.  My next stop was a podiatrist but my son had 7 plantar warts.  I knew he was looking at an uncomfortable experience.  Amlactin has Alpha-Hydroxy Acid as an ingredient and is also a very good moisturizer.  I decided to try Amlactin Ultra on my son&#x27;s feet.  I applied the lotion 2X per day if I could (boys don&#x27;t really care for lotion so I did my best).  Within a short time (maybe 5 days), my son said that the product was working.  The warts began to peel and fell out.  He was left with a rather rough looking sole of his foot.  There were 7 small pea sized holes and calloused skin where the warts used to be.  I continued the Amlactin treatment and his feet are now very smooth with no sign that he ever had plantar warts.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Amlactin Ultra.</li>
            <li> Nothing has really worked until this.  Others share by other lotions and creams but they didn&#x27;t work.  This ultra cream works for our entire family.  My mom tried it with same challenges and buys this now only.</li>
            <li> This product actually made my dark spots darker! I took before and after pictures just to see if my condition would improve but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I did not buy my Amlactin here, but I love this cream so much on my first try I felt compelled to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I have severely dry and itchy skin on the palms, wrist and sometimes the inside of my fingers.  The doctors have tried everything to clear it up and it never clears up.  It is so intensely dry and itchy I scratch it in my sleep and sometimes open up cracks.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought probably every product on the market over the years (I&#x27;ve had this for over 10 years), and while some things clear it up slightly it always returns.&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought Amlactin Ultra... as this may sound cliche&#x27;... after two applications in the same day I saw NOTICEABLE difference.  My skin no longer dried up almost immediately after application and remained moist.  It actually slightly stung on the first few applications, you can feel it going deep into the layers.  After only two days of use, my skin is responding nicely and is much less itchy because it&#x27;s retaining moisture.</li>
            <li> Great for body cream.  I have used this for a long time and love it!  Arrived quickly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail very quickly, even for a holiday weekend and free shipping. After only using it for a few days I can already feel a difference. Not to mention that I bought this for 15 dollars on Amazon and it is a few dollars more expensive at the three other stores that I looked at first. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and this is coming from someone who has tried every lotion out there for severe dry skin and keratosis. I think it&#x27;s worth the extra cash compared to the cheaper lotions like Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  My dermatologist suggested this product 2 years ago and I have been using it ever since.  I recommended it to 2 of my close friends who now use it as well.  it moistens like no other I every tried.&lt;br /&gt;A Great product,</li>
            <li> Rather pricey,compared to local pharmacies</li>
            <li> Cleared up my keratosis pilaris quickly!! It is VERY thick, not like a regular lotion or even most body butters. It takes a little elbow grease to get it all rubbed in but it is worth it! I had very mild keratosis pilaris on my arms but moderate-severe on the back of my thighs and it handled both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams for my dry skin and this works the absolute best...I&#x27;m so glad I found it, because my skin was painful!  I would recommend everyone with painful dry skin to try it.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin on my fingers; the skin would peel, itch, crack, bleed.  Not a pretty sight.  A friend recommended this product and I of course tried it.  I think I have tried every other lotion and creme which is supposed to help dry skin - not one worked. But surprise with this product - within a week my fingers looked like normal fingers - no cracks, no peeling skin...quite remarkable.  Now I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I had first tried this cream at my doctor&#x27;s office.  they were giving away samples. I really like the way it soften my skin and the nice light fresh scent. When I found it at Amazon and read the reviews, I went ahead and order it.  However, I order the fragrance free product and I wish I didn&#x27;t.  I really wanted the one I had tested and will not order the fragrance free again. I do however, recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This body cream was very moisturizing but the scent was very strong and lasted all day, also making my clothes smell that way. I can only use it at night but worked great to get rid of dry, bumpy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Lac-Hydrin Five for almost 30 years and loved it.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been discontinued and after reading all the glowing reports of the AmLactin Triple Action Hydrating Body Cream, I decided to buy some.  The smell, and yes, it is a smell, and not &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; as one reviewer stated, was so awful that I had to wash my hands!  I&#x27;m awaiting the AmLactin LOTION which I hope doesn&#x27;t have that awful smell and if it does, it goes in the garbage, not matter how much the cost.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> Used Amlactin as a prescription many years ago and decided to try again after readying other reviews&lt;br /&gt;particularly with postive results for aging skin and brittle, splitting nails. THANK YOU!! The results started to show&lt;br /&gt;in about 5 days; and, now my husband is using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of creams, lotions, scrubs, etc. for the KP on my arms - and this not only works the best but my skin was smoother and clear in two days! Amazing stuff. I&#x27;m an Amlactin user for life!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and neck at night and am always complimented on my beautiful skin.  I think this really helps keeping my skin young looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son but I&#x27;ve only been able to get him to use it once because of the bad smell.</li>
            <li> Both the pump version and cream version of Amlactin are in our house.&lt;br /&gt;This creams help our dry skin very much. Even here, where the altitude is high, the sun hot and the climate dry.</li>
            <li> Have used it before for years. Love it.</li>
            <li> I got the cream when promised.  It works okay on my skin but I really did not like the smell.  I use it on my feet--well away from my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple weeks and I see no change in my skin, I had been told by a skin doctor to purchase this product to fluff off extra unwanted skin cells</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday. Put on my arms and bottom of feet last night. Have to say it definitely moisturizes, but the smell , thank God it is subtle, is horrendous , smells like vomit. I will see how long I can stand it. There has to be something that smells and works just as good out there.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream for dryness.  Product really helps.  Use it every day as well. Big difference since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry cracked feet and have tried everything, this is for you!  Sounds like a commercial, but definitely true.  I have tried many, many products and so far this is the best.  The only negative is that is has a slightly sour smell, but I will take decreased foot pain over the thousands of rosy or mintly smelling creams that leave me limping.</li>
            <li> This Amlactin Ultra product is super great.  I use it specifically on my feet which have a tendency to get dry.  No other product has come close to producing the smoothness of my skin that this particular Amlactin product has accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;Very, very happy and I happily recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands what seems like a million times a day. This has helped keep my skin supple  ad has prevented the dreaded &#x27;cracks&#x27; .</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works on my cracked skin in the winter!</li>
            <li> I use this product to keep my feet soft. the AHA (alpha-hydroxy acid) really helps keep the skin supple. I find it works best after bath/shower or if you have just exfoliated your feet.</li>
            <li> I have been using Amlactin lotion for over 10 years, back in the day with it was only available by prescription.  Saw the cream advertised and thought I would try it. I have severe eczema and trying to keep it under control, especially in the winter is a daily battle. When triggered, it feels like my skin has gotten tight as shoe leather, inflamed and with a mighty burning fire!  Amlactin lotion is one product that I know of that can put out the burning fire. I was hoping the cream would do the same and it does. It is thick and soothing so it works good on the tight shoe leather feeling also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still buy the lotion because you get so much more of it.  I think the cream is a little pricey for the quantity but it does put out the fire and it definitely stays on longer... okay so that makes it worth it! Just use it in moderation!</li>
            <li> I read online to try this lotion to get rid of the bumpy skin on my daughter&#x27;s arms. She has keratosis pilaris, and everything I&#x27;ve found said that it&#x27;s pretty permanent, not to mention annoying. This lotion works wonders to minimize the bumps! A couple of applications and there&#x27;s a drastic difference in how her arms feel. It hasn&#x27;t gone away completely, and I did stop applying for awhile and they got bumpier again, but quickly went back down after a few more applications.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t state percentage  how much percentage alpha hydroxy acid added ? Does anyone else  have a clue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess product is okay but why no info on AHA percentage? 2%, 5%, 10%??</li>
            <li> Love it---I have very dry skin---this makes it smooth as a babys butt!</li>
            <li> Thick, heavy cream - good for feet.</li>
            <li> Our pediatric drrmatologist recommended this for our sons keratosis. She said to use twice a day on clean skin. After about a month of use we noticed the redness and roughness has subdued but he still definitely has the bumps there. They seem not to buy him as much so for that I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Hasnt helped much at all.</li>
            <li> Aging, dry skin on my arms and legs caused itching and scratching. I tried every over the counter lotion anyone recommended with no success. Finally I searched on-line and ordered Amtracin. It&#x27;s hard to believe but just one day after my first use my arm and leg skin was soft and sores were able to start healing on their own.  I use it immediately after my shower when my skin is moist.</li>
            <li> I started using this a couple of winters ago.  When you live in Wisconsin, your skin during the winter gets pretty dry and flaky.  The Amlactin really smooths your skin.  It is great in the summer too--I use it on my feet after wearing sandals for a while.  Really softens them.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended to me by my Dermatologist for my hands and arms.  I use it every night and it helps so much with moisturizing, especially in the winter.  I have tried a lot of \\&quot;so called\\&quot; hydrating creams, but this one tops them all.  I highly endorse!</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful cream for extremely dry skin. and the company was fair in price and fast to deliver</li>
            <li> I am never wasting another dime on any other hand cream! Heard about this on Dr. Oz.. AmLactin cream... I was unable to find in any drug store, so went onto Amazon... And read reviews and purchased this one... A little goes a long ways!! It is truly remarkable ...I have never went through winter season, without tops of my hands not bleeding and chapped no matter what I bought. I wasted so much money...before but this is the REAL DEAL !!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell it really works.  Jojoba oil seems better</li>
            <li> This product is the only one I&#x27;ve found that heals and prevents cracks in your heels and it&#x27;s good for your entire foot.</li>
            <li> I started using it for my KP and it definitely makes my arms more touchable.  I also started using it on my legs just for hydration and love it.  The best thing I&#x27;ve used it for is a facial moisturizer - it&#x27;s amazing.  It&#x27;s thick but a little dab goes a long way.  My face doesn&#x27;t look greasy or shiny; it has more of a matte finish. The smell is minimal and I don&#x27;t even notice it any more.  I&#x27;m 60 years old and people are always asking me what I do to keep my skin so young looking.  My skin looks smooth even though I am a very outdoor person and I&#x27;ve lived in some of the driest climates.  Before the ultra, I used the XL and before that, I can&#x27;t remember what they called it.  I think I like the ultra the best.  I will use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> watch out, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years, since my dermatologist recommended it for keratitis.  My wife and I both use it and we like it and will probably keep using it.</li>
            <li> My 64 year old  heard this product was good from a friend so we bought it. I like it as well as my favorite Eucerin.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for your legs and feet.&lt;br /&gt;My podiatrist reoommended this product.  It&lt;br /&gt;is easy to apply with the flip cap.</li>
            <li> One of the only products that consistently heals my cracked hands! Would recommend to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth the premium price!</li>
            <li> Smells terrible. Works great</li>
            <li> I love that my Dermatologist loves this cream, but it has the worst &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; smell ever.  My skin is very, VERY dry...this has lactic acid in it, and it burns a little if I put it on after I shave.  I don&#x27;t mind, though, because I notice that it does work at softening my skin.  I use it it conjunction with another cream and switch off (the other one has salicylic acid).</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Exactly as described, heals dry skin quickly.  Fast delivery.  A+++ Seller.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic.  It really works to clear up dry skin, not just cover it.  Also is great for sensitive skin with no fragrance.  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I will only use Amlactin for my hands. I teach tennis and my hands are always Dry and cracked and peeling. They never healed until I started useing Amlactin Lotion as well as the tube of Amlactin Hydrating Body Cream. All my clients are aware of the results and are impressed. This stuff actually moistens my hands and keeps them moist . I put it on 10 minutes before I teach. That way it has been absorbed into the skin and my hands are dry enough to handle a racquet and not slip. The skin is moist but not oily.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to buy this cream but after reading the reviews decided to try it (still skeptical) but I have to say I am a convert. Along with some adjustments in my diet, my skin is back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (about a month). Great product.</li>
            <li> Amlactin is THE BEST for making those terrible and embarrassing bumps on your arms go away   I had those bumps since I was a kid.  I&#x27;m 44 now and I wish I had this when I was a kid.  I only have to apply it once a day, in the morning.  It is a miracle and was suggested by my Dermatologist.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  Be dedicated to using it and I believe you&#x27;ll feel the same.</li>
            <li> We use this on our feet and it makes them soft!</li>
            <li> My experience with ordering through Amazon could not have been better. The arrival of the product was as stated and it came in good shape.  The product itself is a good lotion for the overall body. It has a strong odor but certainly works for very dry skin, bothered with redness and rash.  The odor goes away.  This product was suggested by our dermatologist and really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and smells bad. The lotion is much smoother.</li>
            <li> This is really good for very dry skin. Isn&#x27;t sticky. Worth the cost, highly recommend if nothing else has worked for you.</li>
            <li> My dematologist recommended this item. It works well on my very bad and chronic dry skin. I use it pimarily on my hands. It does leave a bit of a greasy feel at first but dissipates soon after. A little pricey compared to other well known brands you see on store shelves.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t really attest to the efficacy of this product yet for my KP, but for those of you wondering what the smell is like, I would compare it to stale black licorice.  That said, I have only noticed it being strong WHILE I put it on.  I had my husband smell it within 30min and the only reason he could even smell it was because he put his nose on my arm.  From about 2-3 inches away, he couldn&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things where a little goes a long way.  Doc recommended this and it works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is too thick and it smells just as bad as regular AmLactin but because it takes much longer to absorb into my skin it smells bad for longer.  My advice is to apply this stuff while your skin wet or simply stick to the regular AmLactin, that is what I will be doing.</li>
            <li> Amlactin is the best lotion I have found to treat skin on my legs and arms that have gotten dryer after my 70th birthday. I have recommended it to several of my friends.</li>
            <li> I used to have cracking skin on my heels. Two applications of this cream and my problem heels are smooth and healed. Can&#x27;t say enough about the results. Pricey, but it only takes a small dab of the product to get results. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> this lotion does a superior job lubricating my very dry skin.  i usually apply it in 2 applications because it gets absorbed so quickly.  it does not ever dry sticky.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not easy for me to apply because it is thick, but it is worth it.  Pretty pricey. oh well, it&#x27;s worth it to not have itchy skin!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working very well for dry arms.</li>
            <li> If you do not like strong smell in you lotion, you should try this one. The skin gets a good hidratation without being oily. It is really good</li>
            <li> If the title of this review sounds like you, look no further! I spent years googling \\&quot;KP cures\\&quot; and nothing...until I found AMlactin! &#x3D;)  I started using twice a day as the package directs and after about 4 days of use I noticed&lt;br /&gt;- clearer more eventoned skin&lt;br /&gt;- no flakiness&lt;br /&gt;- lighter knees, elbows and scars&lt;br /&gt;- the little dark bumps on my arms, legs, and butt were disintegrating! At first I thought it was just the moisture but then as I looked at the bumps they were actually disappearing.  Within 3 week of using on arms only (twice/day for a week, once a day for maintenance...stopped using on legs and butt because I wanted to see what it would do to my arms) my KP was completely GONE! My sister (who has amazing skin) touched my arms and was like \\&quot;WOW what did you do?!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 25 years old, black, and I&#x27;ve had KP (keratosis pilaris) since I was about 12 or so. I&#x27;ve tried vaseline, ponds dry skin cream, drinking more water, EVOO and NOTHING helped. Everything I tried did a great job hiding/making my skin look more hydrated but the results would wash off after each shower...hence, there was no real improvement in my skin. Amlactin essentially gets rid of it...as long as you keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that after I stopped using the product, the KP came back over time.  I&#x27;m now committed to using it everywhere to keep my skin soft and touchable FOREVER lol.  If you&#x27;re at all self conscious about the way your skin looks or feels (as I was) you should definitely try this product for at least a week. Trust me, it&#x27;s worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(this is my first amazon review ever..)</li>
