            <li>My dentist said she had never seen one as nice and was very impressed with it&#x27;s style and functionality.</li>
            <li>Good ideal but</li>

            <li>I think this is good for storage and travel.</li>

            <li>Still size is good</li>
            <li>The container is a nice size.  </li>
            <li>and it can be nicely cleaned.  </li>

            <li>It will be nice for traveling</li>
            <li>Nice to look at and easy to use .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this case.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s really cheap!</li>
            <li>Otherwise ok.</li>
            <li>if I yank the top off, I&#x27;ll spill all of the contents into the sink.  </li>
            <li>Love this case.  </li>
            <li>The top clips on and does not depend on frail, plastic hinges.</li>
            <li>I have checked many time for a hole or crack</li>
            <li>Will let you know more after the trip.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for travel thinking it would be a more compact solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thew top is not hinged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special, but works and is nice for the price and is roomy.</li>
            <li>It arrived as described and works exactly as you would expect it to - no surprises - and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>There are many types on the market, but this one by Archtek is easy to handle, store and carry.</li>
            <li>Perfect... even better than what I expected!!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something that was easy to store my brush and dentures together</li>
            <li>but it seems fine.</li>
            <li>He likes it just fine.  </li>
            <li>What could be better than a place to keep my special toothbrush, and clean my dentures overnight.  </li>
            <li>that my brush will fit in.</li>
            <li>It seems like it would fit both without the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It comes with a denture brush but also fit the brush we had.</li>
            <li>I had to put dentures into my original container to rinse and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As for cleaning, I&#x27;ll be using the original container from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>New to dentures and wanted something unobtrusive yet effective for cleaning.</li>
            <li>This product is not for someone with a full set of dentures.  </li>
            <li>and they said that it was good (especially for the price).</li>
            <li>It has a nice secure black top which keeps the dentures and partials out of sight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size to carry a full-sized denture toothbrush, toothpaste (a smaller tube), and my mouthguard (or at least the top or bottom denture).</li>
            <li>Just the right size and made of durable materials.</li>
            <li>case is very large, the lid does not seal and it leaks.</li>
            <li>The container is nice looking, but its hard to take the top off, as well as the drain piece.  </li>
            <li>I have multiple cases and another cleaning kit/denture bath that I keep at home, so I usually find this one perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>The idea of having the extra drain piece is appealing, but it wasn&#x27;t executed that well in this product.</li>
            <li>but It would have been even better if the lid would come off a bit easier as it tends to splatter water when you open it to take the dentures out.</li>
            <li>one positive is that it may be sanitary for holding everything in place.</li>
            <li>this is an unexpectedly large device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>detailed and specific.</li>
            <li>detailed and specific.</li>
            <li>detailed and specific.</li>
            <li>Very satisfactory and well used since purchasing the kit.</li>
            <li>My denture storage and cleaning kit, has been very helpful, compact for carrying on trips.</li>
            <li>was very disturbed by the Shallowness; needs to be twice but</li>
            <li>The case may be fine for storage as long as you have plenty of space.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Small profile is also nice for storage.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the unit I was previously using for years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Plus, I am able to completely dry the entire container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised by this high quality case.</li>
            <li>Only the lower denture or partial can fit in the space provided, with or without the liner in the cup.  </li>
            <li>She was going to check it out and possibly recommend to her patients because of its reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li>But this item was offered with a storage &amp; cleaning kit for the same price as a decent toothbrush alone.  </li>
            <li>Thus, opening it when filled means you get cleaning solution all over the place, not what you need on an always too small hotel sink top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the unit is what it is as advertised; sturdy; large enough for other travel dental &amp;#34;things&amp;#34;; priced reasonable.</li>
            <li>I gave one start because the case was not as expected, too large and bulky.</li>
            <li>However, there&#x27;s barely enough room for adding water for soaking dentures completely in the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>It barely holds and covers my dentures with the water and cleaning tablet.</li>
            <li>I only wanted to order this special type toothbrush for cleaning my dentures, &#x27;cause it was not available to me locally.  </li>
            <li>It is much nicer than I expected!  </li>
            <li>It is a little large for my purpose</li>

            <li> Unless you can completely dry the entire container, there&#x27;s going to be bacteria and eventually mold growing under the drainage tray.</li>
            <li> This denture case is not deep enough and leaks when lid is closed.  </li>
            <li> but it is hard to rate at this time because I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s huge and very poorly made</li>
            <li> Other people didn&#x27;t like that it was hard to remove the tray part, but I don&#x27;t really mind that and haven&#x27;t tried to.</li>
            <li> and when I go to empty it and rinse the dentures the water is half gone and its wet under it.</li>
            <li> much bigger than I envisioned and was not able to return.  </li>
            <li> Only problem I have had is it is hard to click closed.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, and I don&#x27;t think my dentures are larger than average.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight indentation in the curved part where, you can pop out the tray.</li>
            <li> My dentist always comments about the small size, which makes it harder for him to work on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shape is a little akward.</li>
            <li> I have always hated the usual denture storage cases but this one is durable and a nice heavy plastic.  </li>
            <li> I still think it should be a little deeper.</li>
            <li> Also, make the drainage tray a little easier to remove.</li>
            <li> it was way bigger not happy with it than I thought</li>
            <li> Messy not helpful and assisting..</li>
            <li> Brush tips are firm and seem resilient.</li>
            <li> It is attached to the bottom by firm latches.</li>
            <li> At least that drainage tray has a little lip that snaps in the container, leaving about half an inch for draining and drying.</li>
            <li> This is not healthy.</li>
            <li> Sorry I got I actually threw it out.</li>
            <li> Not able to use at all.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a toothbrush</li>
            <li> This was a real piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Flattens out to a thin size which makes storage, i.e., packing decisions a snap.</li>
            <li> To my disappointment, I found it hard rinsing the solution from the container, plus spilling the solution.</li>
            <li> It does not snap close so it useless to travel with.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid</li>
            <li> And the design is horrible.</li>

            <li> I have been looking for something that was easy to store my brush and dentures together this was a great idea. Only problem I have had is it is hard to click closed.</li>
            <li> The case may be fine for storage as long as you have plenty of space.&lt;br /&gt;The case is very large, the lid does not seal and it leaks. I bought this in hopes to travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I go somewhere, the dentures are a pain as the containers leak. It is hard to find a toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;holder that my brush will fit in. I thought this would be a great idea to keep them together.</li>
            <li> I really love this case. It&#x27;s the perfect size to carry a full-sized denture toothbrush, toothpaste (a smaller tube), and my mouthguard (or at least the top or bottom denture). It seems like it would fit both without the toothpaste. Other people didn&#x27;t like that it was hard to remove the tray part, but I don&#x27;t really mind that and haven&#x27;t tried to. I have multiple cases and another cleaning kit/denture bath that I keep at home, so I usually find this one perfect for travel. Plus it&#x27;s really cheap! It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The container is a nice size.  Only draw back is the shape. The shape is a little akward. Otherwise ok.</li>
            <li> Nice to look at and easy to use .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?</li>
            <li> I have always hated the usual denture storage cases but this one is durable and a nice heavy plastic.  It has a nice secure black top which keeps the dentures and partials out of sight and it can be nicely cleaned.  It is deep enough for the denture but they do have to rest side-by-side for the lid to close if you have an upper and a lower.</li>
            <li> The container is nice looking, but its hard to take the top off, as well as the drain piece.  I&#x27;m afraid if I yank the top off, I&#x27;ll spill all of the contents into the sink.  The idea of having the extra drain piece is appealing, but it wasn&#x27;t executed that well in this product.</li>
            <li> it was way bigger not happy with it than I thought and there is no receipt inside to return it please help me thank you</li>
            <li> Works great for travel! I like the concept of the brush being cleaned/sanitized along with your dentures.</li>
            <li> I think this is good for storage and travel. I like that it has a place for the brush. However, there&#x27;s barely enough room for adding water for soaking dentures completely in the cleaning solution. To my disappointment, I found it hard rinsing the solution from the container, plus spilling the solution. I had to put dentures into my original container to rinse and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to remove the drainage tray, but it simply won&#x27;t come out. Unless you can completely dry the entire container, there&#x27;s going to be bacteria and eventually mold growing under the drainage tray. This is not healthy. I&#x27;ll use this for travel to hold the brush and cleaning tablets. As for cleaning, I&#x27;ll be using the original container from the drugstore. At least that drainage tray has a little lip that snaps in the container, leaving about half an inch for draining and drying. Plus, I am able to completely dry the entire container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This container may look nice, but I think it needs improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally figured out how to remove the drainage tray. There&#x27;s a slight indentation in the curved part where, you can pop out the tray. I like using this for travel because it holds the brush as well as cleaning tablets (wrapped) .  I still think it should be a little deeper. It barely holds and covers my dentures with the water and cleaning tablet. I have a small mouth, and I don&#x27;t think my dentures are larger than average. My dentist always comments about the small size, which makes it harder for him to work on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still feel improvements are needed such as making it deeper and have instructions on how to remove the drainage tray. Also, make the drainage tray a little easier to remove.</li>
            <li> Mom has looked for something like this for a long while and never found one locally.  She loves this.</li>
            <li> Great product for travelling if you are a denture wearer.  Just the right size and made of durable materials.</li>
            <li> This product is not for someone with a full set of dentures.  Only the lower denture or partial can fit in the space provided, with or without the liner in the cup.  I will be returning these denture cups.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory and well used since purchasing the kit.</li>
            <li> I only wanted to order this special type toothbrush for cleaning my dentures, &#x27;cause it was not available to me locally.  But this item was offered with a storage &amp; cleaning kit for the same price as a decent toothbrush alone.  What could be better than a place to keep my special toothbrush, and clean my dentures overnight.  WHAT A BARGAIN!</li>
            <li> Perfect... even better than what I expected!!</li>
            <li> My denture storage and cleaning kit, has been very helpful, compact for carrying on trips. There are many types on the market, but this one by Archtek is easy to handle, store and carry.</li>
            <li> the unit is what it is as advertised; sturdy; large enough for other travel dental &amp;#34;things&amp;#34;; priced reasonable. (this is my 2nd review submission)</li>
            <li> Hubby likes it for travel, great item.</li>
            <li> It is a little large for my purpose but I can make it work.  It does not snap close so it useless to travel with.  It seems to be made fairly well but it is hard to rate at this time because I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li> Messy not helpful and assisting..one positive is that it may be sanitary for holding everything in place.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than the unit I was previously using for years. Made well and looks good. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It will be nice for traveling</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend and they said that it was good (especially for the price). A+++ seller.  Will do business with again</li>
            <li> much bigger than I envisioned and was not able to return.  Donated as I could not use; I viewed this as unfavorable</li>
            <li> This was a real piece of crap. Sorry I got I actually threw it out. It leaks it&#x27;s huge and very poorly made</li>
            <li> Big but well designed.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the case I had was one of those cheapy ones you get at the dentist.  Within a week it wouldn&#x27;t close properly.  Love this case.  The top clips on and does not depend on frail, plastic hinges.</li>
            <li> I gave one start because the case was not as expected, too large and bulky.</li>
            <li> Good idea, but It would have been even better if the lid would come off a bit easier as it tends to splatter water when you open it to take the dentures out.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by this high quality case. It comes with a denture brush but also fit the brush we had. A very nice case.</li>
            <li> This denture case is not deep enough and leaks when lid is closed.  When you fill with enough water to cover dentures, it overflows.</li>
            <li> The storage is a perfect size for me and the brush is good but what the heck is with this container! It sits undisturbed for 4 to 6 hours bathing the dentures and when I go to empty it and rinse the dentures the water is half gone and its wet under it. I have checked many time for a hole or crack but it seems fine. Is it foaming over I can&#x27;t tell and there are no precautions saying this will happen, I am still wondering cause it doesn&#x27;t happen all the time. Still size is good and I like it just have to keep a face cloth wrapped around it.</li>
            <li> I use it in my backpack and a toiletry kit too.  Flattens out to a thin size which makes storage, i.e., packing decisions a snap.</li>
            <li> It looks like it&#x27;s perfect for what I want.  I&#x27;m going on a trip and I wanted a container that would keep what I need in it.  This looks perfect to me.  Will let you know more after the trip.</li>
            <li> Excellent case and brush.  My dentist said she had never seen one as nice and was very impressed with it&#x27;s style and functionality. She was going to check it out and possibly recommend to her patients because of its reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li> It arrived as described and works exactly as you would expect it to - no surprises - and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Too big and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> It is much nicer than I expected!  What a wonderful surprise!  Can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product  well made</li>
            <li> Bought this for hubby and he uses it for his travels.  He likes it just fine.  It&#x27;s nothing special, but works and is nice for the price and is roomy.</li>
            <li> Good ideal but was very disturbed by the Shallowness; needs to be twice but the depth.&lt;br /&gt;I tossed it. Not able to use at all.</li>
            <li> New to dentures and wanted something unobtrusive yet effective for cleaning. This fits the bill solidly. Shape is great for holding uppers and lowers together. Small profile is also nice for storage. Brush tips are firm and seem resilient. So happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> works great seals well</li>
            <li> Purchased this for travel thinking it would be a more compact solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Wrong. this is an unexpectedly large device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  And the design is horrible. Thew top is not hinged. It is attached to the bottom by firm latches. Thus, opening it when filled means you get cleaning solution all over the place, not what you need on an always too small hotel sink top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
