            <li>I LOVE Naturoli :D</li>
            <li>Most people I&#x27;ve asked get the best results from whatever shampoo they use if they keep it under two minutes.</li>

            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>It smells good and lathers well.  </li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>I have used NaturOli Soap Nuts Shampoo before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>and I feel good about the chemicals I am NOT putting on my hair.</li>

            <li>My hair was beautiful and healthy before using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smells great, has a normal shampoo consistency and creates an excellent foam with just about a nickle sized amount (I use it as body wash as well).  </li>
            <li>It is very healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>

            <li>I have tried sooooo many shampoos!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using for about 6 months, and she has been so much better since the switch!</li>
            <li>&quot;  This shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked amazing when I was finished, beautiful, full of life</li>
            <li>My wife and I both noticed an amazing difference after just one use.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>It also lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>No scent, nice suds...</li>
            <li>Soap nuts shampoo hasn&#x27;t impressed me a whole lot yet.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells kind of like mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Really nice product.</li>
            <li>I use the conditioner too, but honestly don&#x27;t even need to use it.</li>
            <li>and I have really liked it...</li>
            <li>I used to make my own soapnut shampoo years ago.</li>
            <li>Also, I like the fact my hair stays nice for days.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would use more product than I have to in an effort to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s good volume and my hair looks so healthy.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s good volume and my hair looks so healthy.  </li>
            <li>The product still foams nicely</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spend this kind of money on shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, so gentle.</li>
            <li>I heard about soap nuts but wanted to try pre-made shampoo before getting into making my own (to rule out user error).</li>
            <li>so I can make my own from the nuts.</li>
            <li>Good for most hair.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, this shampoo performs quite nicely in that</li>
            <li>To my surprise, this shampoo performs quite nicely in that</li>
            <li>She asked if I had changed my shampoo, and wanted to know what kind I was using.</li>
            <li>I love to get great results while supporting a great company.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo, mild and neutral to my scalp.</li>
            <li>More companies need to be more like NaturOli!  </li>
            <li>Soap Nut/Soapberry Shampoo has been our best natural shampoo choice yet!</li>
            <li>I switched to this from WEN, which I used for 4 years and my hair was healthy and amazing.</li>
            <li>Excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And, best of all, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>but when it comes to healthy alternatives in this category, this is by far the best..</li>
            <li>The extracts provided here are nourishing, ginseng and green tea, olive leaf and water cress, but of greatest importance are hair tonic ingredients used successfully for shine and scalp health</li>
            <li>I am genuinely pleased by the results of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of allergies and problems with most shampoos; not this one.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product - it smells nice and feels good when you are applying it.  </li>
            <li>Thank You :-))</li>
            <li>all of which caused even more irritation, until I discovered both the Soap Nuts and Dandrene shampoos.</li>
            <li>I love both of these shampoos.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I have never been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I want to love this product.</li>
            <li>Basically, I spend most of my money on conditioners, wash out and leave-in, not</li>
            <li>and my hair just looks much better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The detox takes more than a week.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s better not to wash hair too often..)  </li>
            <li>My hair is much more manageable doing it this way, but I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying this shampoo for myself again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I was looking for a healthy balance for my hair and scalp.</li>

            <li>THANK YOU FOR MAKING SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>until I got my latest bottle.  </li>
            <li>I noticed in my latest bottle that it&#x27;s quite runny this time around.  </li>
            <li>I have to use much more than before to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>Once this bottle is out, I might give them one more try.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>My kids love it too</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because it gives my hair volume</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Soap Nut formulas are among an increasing number of &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or, rather, chemically safe shampoos and body care products.</li>
            <li>Just reading the ingredients lets you know how safe it will be (in terms of avoiding cancer)</li>
            <li>First off, I noticed that the dime-size amount I use to wash my hair was successful in covering my scalp and coating the hair shaft of every strand.</li>
            <li>I make sure I eat well.  </li>

            <li>Going to try scalp massages and peppermint oil to stimulate better circulation to my head.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;sulfate-free&amp;#34; shampoos that I have tried take more product to create a lather than this product.</li>
            <li>The grays are better behaved</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>after about a week of using this product i did notice some more body to my hair.  </li>
            <li>i also love that it is practically scent-free..</li>
            <li>i am sure adding all-natural fragrance oil wouldnt change its effectiveness..</li>
            <li>However...I do love EXREME 18X for laundry (1 pump in pre-wash and 2 pumps in detergent cup).</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It made my hair lighter and more lifted at the roots.</li>
            <li>My hair feels like it has more volumn since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>I did read where many who use this product were able to discontinue use of a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I must say I have not been able to do that  </li>
            <li>The more I use it, the happier and healthier my hair feels.</li>
            <li>has been subpar, with the exception of the Organix line, which has been a bit more satisfying.</li>
            <li>My hair is incredibly shiny, soft, and manageable.</li>

            <li>What more could a man ask for?</li>
            <li>I was able to comb my hair and brush it.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy and will buy again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I guess.</li>
            <li>my daughter and i have shiny smooth hair after using this luxurious shampoo!</li>
            <li>This product lathered a bit more than what I am used to when using chemical free products, which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>While my hair is course, it is thinning up top -</li>
            <li>but it feels healthy and is manageable.  </li>
            <li>Low toxicity, and great for my hair!</li>
            <li>and it looks so healthy even though still damp.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Maybe, it would be okay for shorter hair or thinner hair.</li>
            <li>it gets better with prolong use.  </li>

            <li>&quot; in this product that even show up on EWG&#x27;s list are Citric acid, Guar Gum and Aloe Vera, none of which most people would consider toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>or so my hair became much more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She also said I should always make sure to buy a shampoo that is specifically made for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>At this point we should know that all the things we apply in our bodies are somehow absorbed and that&#x27;s exactly why I consider this a very good shampoo.</li>
            <li>There is no problem at all with getting your hair nice and clean with this.</li>
            <li>I love having the chance to clean my hair without all the chemistry!  </li>
            <li>It does need 2 latherings, but leaves hair feeling very clean and silky.</li>

            <li>I used it one time, and after shampooing my hair twice, it turned out very clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this shampoo, based on the company&#x27;s excellent reputation and all the positive reviews.</li>

            <li>My hair feels so soft and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>EWG&#x27;s skindeep website gives it a score of 2, which is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say about this is that you get a good amount of shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed reading about this shampoo and the other reviewers seemed to love it.</li>
            <li>However, there is an off label use for this that has really surprised me and made me very, very, and I&#x27;m going for it, VERY happy.</li>
            <li>BUT...it&#x27;s more important to me that my Hair is CLEAN withOUT chemicals!</li>

            <li>If this works for your hair type than I think it&#x27;s great since it&#x27;s so natural</li>
            <li>my sensitive scalp is happy.</li>
            <li>So far, I feel this will be a great product.</li>
            <li>Another great attribute is that you don&#x27;t need conditioner, your hair will be soft and shiny without it.</li>
            <li>New to and Loving this Product BRAND!     </li>
            <li>Tiny bottle and huge number of loads, am hoping for excellent and clean results on that product too.</li>
            <li>Fortunately once the &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; phase is over my hair becomes shiny, smooth and most importantly OIL FREE!</li>
            <li>This washes out easily, and my hair is never greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard reviews that say it&#x27;s still cleaning even if it&#x27;s not lathering, but it sure didn&#x27;t clean for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should have used a lot more to get my hair fully clean</li>
            <li>The shampoo rinses out easily.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the hair feeling clean; I was hoping for a bit more moisture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After using the shampoo for some time, I began to notice my salon-colored hair losing it&#x27;s color very quickly, after two to three washes.</li>
            <li>Everything they say is true, and better.</li>
            <li>I have fine and curly hair and always need conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly fine with my hair..</li>
            <li>Twice works fine, but three times is a charm.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinning shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used almost all of the first bottle I bought and have been more than pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s not a problem for you, this may be a fine product.  </li>
            <li>Stock up because it goes quickly!</li>
            <li>The gray ones are wiry and stick out like tangled porcupine quills, which looks really bizarre considering the fact that the rest of my hair is baby fine.  </li>
            <li>I have had a time finding a shampoo with little or no scent and this is perfect!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is, by far, the best natural shampoo I have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of them.</li>
            <li>That is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>It also conditions the hair and leaves it tangle free.</li>
            <li>My hair was actually squeaky-clean (some people may like that), and I had great difficulty brushing after showering.</li>
            <li>We had been using Dr. Bronners but my kids could not stand the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; feel of that soap - with the Soap Nut Shampoo your skin and hair feel smooth.</li>
            <li>this is a replacement in USA for chem free treatment, my wife and daughter both are insisted me to write this review in Amazon, &amp;#34;ordered&amp;#34; me to rate 5 star.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s both gentle and effective in cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>Twenty dollars may seem a bit steep for a shampoo, but I feel that it is justified in that it replaces the need for a conditioner</li>
            <li>Is it because it&#x27;s sulfate free?</li>
            <li>I NEVER get compliments on my hair, and a week after starting this, a friend told me how great my hair looks on a day when all I did was wash and air</li>
            <li>I NEVER get compliments on my hair, and a week after starting this, a friend told me how great my hair looks on a day when all I did was wash and air</li>
            <li>overall i am happy and will purchase again.    </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Please feel free to ask questions.</li>
            <li>I solved that by decanting the shampoo into a cheap ketchup-style squeeze bottle from the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li>Lauryl Glucoside (a sugar based soap which I understand is the primary soap in the  California Baby line)    </li>
            <li>It is gluten free and uses no funky chemicals.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy how my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I think the cheap one was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fragrance free, no allergens and toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>I swim almost every day from April to November in an over-chlorinated pool and need a shampoo that can get the chlorine out and de-tangle my hair so that it feels smooth.  </li>
            <li>I swim almost every day from April to November in an over-chlorinated pool and need a shampoo that can get the chlorine out and de-tangle my hair so that it feels smooth.  </li>
            <li>I understand this is a temporary solution good for detoxifying and then a natural shampoo is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My scalp is so dry and itchy and my hair is very fly away and unmanageable and I think I am also losing more hair than normal when drying/styling.</li>
            <li>It would be very easy to create your own signature scent by adding any number/variety of essential</li>
            <li>so I continued to use it to see what happened as I was not loosing a significant amount of hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE JULY 17, 2013:  I have since switched shampoo and within 5 days of switching I stopped loosing a significant amount of hair strands.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Naturoli shampoo out of desperation, even though it cost more than what I&#x27;m normally willing to pay for a hair product.    </li>
            <li>I am excited about this shampoo</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have found this shampoo and experience</li>
            <li>Whenever Shampoo/Conditioner and has been happy with that brand, which scores 2 out of 10 for toxicity on EWG&#x27;s website and is also a little more affordable when bought at a grocery store.  </li>

            <li>It leaves hair clean shinny</li>
            <li>My hair feels CLEAN...</li>
            <li>like clarifying clean.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo, but was more concentrated when purchased directly from the companies website.  </li>
            <li>just clean.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather at all, and my hair did not feel clean after washing with it.  </li>
            <li>shampoo lathers, gets squeaky clean and hair</li>
            <li>Clothes are clean and have no smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done hours of research trying to find a safe, effective product that still left my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>GREAT for my sons dry scalp</li>
            <li>shampoo is naturally moisture-rich, and I do need more product to get my hair clean with it, because it is not as detergent- like as most shampoos.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves your hair feeling clean and doesnt strip your hair of nutrients.</li>
            <li>The scent is just enough to make it pleasant without being too fragrant.</li>
            <li>This stuff works well, gives your hair a clean, full feel and without residue.  </li>
            <li>It was okay in the beginning, my hair was clean, my scalp don&#x27;t itch as much, my dandruff wasn&#x27;t too flaky anymore.</li>
            <li>I also have finally settled on a good soap too,</li>
            <li>It has gotten very slightly better with being one gigantic mat after washing, but not by much.</li>
            <li>Does it really get better?</li>
            <li>I think my hair just does not do well with soaps of any kind, even if they are natural.</li>
            <li>It blows out full, but</li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length, healthy hair and my routine is to thoroughly brush my hair before showering/washing it, then gently brush out tangles after my shower.</li>
            <li>This shampoo could not be more natural, clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I wanted to switch to an all natural shampoo, so I made my own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use many hair products, but it really does feel like the one that I use is cleaned out when I use this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I found that to be true.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found neither to be true.</li>
            <li>This is an effective all natural shampoo based on my one time use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, a nice side effect: I&#x27;ve received praise on how soft my beard is since I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>From the description of this shampoo, I thought it would be good because I would not have to use multiple conditioners.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind using a conditioner later to get a good feel.</li>
            <li>Almost no products get a zero or a ten, and this product scored a 1 out of 10, which is about as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the softness and shine of my hair is returning as well; it still becomes tangled but not nearly as bad as when I was using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair has more volume, much less frizz, and feels good.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use haircolor, this would my first recommendation easily.  </li>
            <li>It lathers just fine for me, and my hair wasn&#x27;t tangled at all even after the first time use.</li>
            <li>I tried to find a conditioner to use with this product, but each one I tried they would either leave my hair tangled or super oily.</li>
            <li>Lathers up really nicely, mild, unnoticeable smell.  </li>
            <li>The three lead actives in this cleanser work together to mildly cleanse hair without stripping it (if used appropriately, that is to say, by someone who knows how to wash hair properly, which most people don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>so while I waited for more to be in stock I purchased more of this NaturOli shampoo and the very same day I use it, my scalp is on fire!</li>
            <li>My hair adjusted to using it quite quickly</li>
            <li>A very nice product if you are trying to keep away from sulphates and other chemicals.</li>
            <li>I feel cleaner and its nice not relying on so many other chemicals to achieve this feeling.</li>
            <li>This is good if you are fragrance free due to asthma, MCS, or migraines.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m down to washing twice a week and have never been so happy.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, not fly-away and didn&#x27;t strip my hair which is very fine and color treated.</li>
            <li>After using the shampoo, it was really the first time that my hair had more volume, shine, and didn&#x27;t get oily as quickly.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of cleaning the hair without stripping it so dry it is unmanageable</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that dries out easily.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>First of all it smells clean . . .</li>
            <li>Even though the label says normal to dry,  it&#x27;s best for normal hair types.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and it has worked great.  </li>
            <li>I used it only on my scalp and it was amazing and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>short this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>this is the most natural shampoo I can find.</li>
            <li>NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! -</li>
            <li>The  price is worth it to me, since I know that there is nothing harmful to me, or the environment in this</li>
            <li>NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! -</li>
            <li>During the two times I have used NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo, I have lost more hair than I can believe.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t worth going bald.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Just know, if you haven&#x27;t detoxed your hair away from chemical products prior to using this shampoo (I did it with my own homemade shampoo)</li>
            <li>Overall a nice product thought.</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>constantly this feels nice.....</li>
            <li>This all-natural shampoo is amazing, has that fabulous NATURAL soapy foam, and I have absolutely no fear that I&#x27;m touching or exposing my system to toxins.</li>
            <li>Tried all kinds of natural products and truly love this one plus</li>
            <li>Love that it is totally natural.</li>
            <li>I am trying to go natural/organic/chemical free with as many of our products as possible.  </li>
            <li>the market they are appealing to likes things all natural.</li>
            <li>I am confident that I am using a truly natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Too many shampoo brands brag how soft and manageable our hair will be if we use their product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad having chosen this natural product.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t use any conditioner, and my hair is soft and shiny and has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>love this shampoo for my naturally curly/dry/coarse hair</li>
            <li>It is a natural product and I love it for that.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural, and I feel that it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I used to have beautiful healthy, low maintenance hair with a lot of body that had a slight wave to it</li>
            <li>I have very fine, oily hair, and this has given it a lot more body (probably because it&#x27;s not weighed down by all the so-called &amp;#34;volumizing products&amp;#34; I was using before.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels kind of stiff, like a broom :-)</li>
            <li>Product has no bad smells (smells like nothing really) and lathers up really quick.    </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any smell only a very light one in the bottle not bad.</li>
            <li>As for my hair it feels soft, clean, and light.    </li>
            <li>After using sulfate-free shampoos for more than a year, I still have to remind myself that lather doesn&#x27;t equal clean.</li>
            <li>I tend to use it every other day and that&#x27;s a good balance for me.     </li>
            <li>I think I chose the right formula.  </li>
            <li>I suppose you could say unscented, but that isn&#x27;t right either.  </li>
            <li>A comb runs right through it after washing with no problem.</li>
            <li>I tried this hoping it could be a more cost effective alternative to my usual cleansing product (Wen).</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel really clean, but my hairstylist said it was stripping too much of the color.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fairly good and soft that sometimes I can barely feel it.</li>
            <li>But this shampoo really feels like it balances the oils of my scalp and makes my hair clean.</li>
            <li>And It really makes my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>It styled very easily and held the style all day without any extra product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and clean!</li>
            <li>All soaps I have tried really eat up my skin and dry it out good.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, greying hair and , before using this shampoo, had to use two different products to give my hair some volume and manageability.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of dry.</li>
            <li>I am very concerned about toxins in my environment, and I like feeling healthy and natural in all my health and beauty products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m definitely trying the dish soap and recommending soap nut berries for effective and gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li>i find that while i am able to comb while wet, i still use a light weight leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>one complaint is that there isn&#x27;t a handy dispenser type top.</li>
            <li>This product smells good and is a nice consistency, however it did tend to make my hair feel a little dry.</li>
            <li>After about 3 uses, my scalp felt wonderful, and no more itching!!!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that it would foam up that easily, but it does lather really fast and a lot better than some of the other shampoos I was using.</li>
            <li>For the first week, I followed the directions for the Soap Nut Shampoo and then followed with the Dandrene.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;First thing that I have found that really really works!  </li>
            <li>But since this is my first sulfate-free shampoo, I realize my hair likes it</li>
            <li>washing my hair first thing, rinsing, then putting conditioner on my hair and leaving it on through my shower.</li>
            <li>But my hair is nicer, more like it was back in the day.</li>
            <li>I am hoping after the initial detox period to be able to go longer.</li>
            <li>I really like them all!     </li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>A small blob of this shampoo really works into a great foam.  </li>
            <li>I love the cleansing agent: it definitely works to remove sebum and dirt</li>
            <li>Read further if you want more information and don&#x27;t if all you wanted to know is what the off label use is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My scalp feels better, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about all the foaming chemicals in regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I switched to DevaCurl products, and the problem was gone with my first shampoo.  </li>
            <li>i have tried so many different types of shampoo in the past..including shampoo bars..</li>
            <li>The bottle was exactly as represented online and packaged well (actually, more packing than I would&#x27;ve thought necessary).</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried dozens and I&#x27;d definitely put this in the top 5.</li>
            <li>First, however, I used a clay detox on my hair (</li>
            <li>I did some searching for an easier solution that was completely chemical free and came across this product.  </li>
            <li>I went without a conditioner for the first two weeks</li>
            <li>The $20 price tag seems steep at first, but most people who use this product (including me) do not need conditioner, so that offsets the initial sticker shock</li>
            <li>a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not a fan of this product after the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li>but went along with it, and sure enough after a week</li>
            <li>but went along with it, and sure enough after a week</li>
            <li>I did have to condition my hair afterward because my hair is on the dry side, so I used aloe vera gel from my plant and emu oil (left it in, did not rinse it out) and used a boar hair bristle brush after, and my hair came out looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to give my fine hair a little more body.  </li>
            <li>The most helpful thing I can offer is to read lots of reviews before you buy, and take each review with a large grain of salt if the person&#x27;s hair type is different than yours.  </li>
            <li>I will try and update this in a few weeks if anything changes but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>With my fine textured hair, I generally have to sacrifice softness for volume, but that was not the case here.  </li>
            <li>really do love this shampoo not just for the low toxin level but because it really cleans my hair without over drying.</li>
            <li>It was not a big lather, but a gentle justenough lather, which tickled me since most homemade shampoos don&#x27;t lather because of the lack of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>The coconut milk and gel mixture was better as a conditioner (left my hair very greasy), so I added emu oil and put it on the ends as a conditioner</li>
            <li>The price may be high, but the shampoo is worth it.</li>
            <li>I loved WEN, but it&#x27;s not that pure, and I fell in love with a henna hair color that unfortunately WEN strips out.</li>
            <li>It leaves a little rough feel to the hair after use, which might not be a good thing to many people, but that reminds me of using soap nuts which gives lather to hair, but still feels not so moisturised.</li>
            <li>I had read all those positive reviews and decided to buy the product.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo even with no conditioner for my long curly hair.</li>
            <li>I even did the whole detox phase that it recommends to do when you first use it.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder blade length, color treated blonde hair, with a bit of a natural wave, not thin, nice body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few months now, and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo every other day, and it really leaves my hair (which is oily) feeling very clean!  </li>
            <li>Hair is clean and soft, and does not tangle as much as it used to.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a nice texture without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>While this shampoo does make my hair soft, I don&#x27;t think that it works any better than my other chemical free shampoo, which is cheaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having read many reviews prior to using, I made sure my hair was very wet before applying the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>And this has a nice but slight smell to it.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t contain the unnatural ingredients that most shampoos do, but it seems to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>And, the hair near my scalp gets SUPER oily now every 2-3 days, whereas with WEN it never did.</li>
            <li>, my hair has more body after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this if you are looking for an easy, all-natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Gives tons of volume and keeps my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>If you have washed your hair only once you need to go easy on the conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is now actually more dry.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say my hair is super soft by any means</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair, and since I cut my hair, started using this, and silicone free conditioner, my hair has been healthier and softer!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not at all appropriate for dry hair and sensitive/dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I love my NaturOli but hadn&#x27;t tried it for dry hair since mine runs oily.  </li>
            <li>After that I tried a few homemade products, first being a mixture of pure organic coconut milk and 100% aloe vera gel (which I retrieved from my own aloe plant).  </li>
            <li>I am certain this is because I have removed chemicals from my haircare products for months now, so I am done with the detox.  </li>
            <li>I accepted large chunks of skin in my hairbrush after a shower.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work well on certain hair types/lengths and not as well on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, even with my long thin hair that is normally fly away</li>
            <li>But after a few weeks of sea salt, honey, cider vinegar and coconut oil, I LOVE the effect of this shampoo!</li>
            <li>After becoming aware of this health issues from generic products it makes you wonder how it&#x27;s even legal for companies to sell products that have a high risk of triggering cancer or whatever else it might do.    </li>
            <li>but by next day they are fine.</li>
            <li>You can imagine my trepidation at using this product after reading the negative reviews but there were more positive detailed reviews</li>
            <li>When I first started the no-shampoo route, I did a TON of research and then started making my own products of raw and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo is the first time I have gone without conditioner!</li>
            <li>She thinks it&#x27;s stress, but I&#x27;m a very laid-back person and the main source of stress in my life has been my shedding hair!</li>
            <li>So, if you have acne, maybe try this as a way to clear it up and certainly switch to a different shampoo and conditioner, even if it isn&#x27;t this brand, as shampoos and conditioners cause acne more than your pillowcase or dog ever</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving this a four start rating instead of five is because my hair had a lot of static and was a little more frizzy than I was used to with the honey mixture.  </li>
            <li>I think they are an amazing company and have outstanding products, but unfortunately, this shampoo did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>I feel badly saying this, as I really wanted to be wowed and fall in love with this, since NaturOli is such a wonderful company.</li>
            <li>So coupling it with the Soap Nuts shampoo has really worked well for me.</li>
            <li>Very cleansing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>No SLS really makes the difference.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is really gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t lather as much as a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo because of the lack of SLS.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t use conditioners with it WITHOUT getting an oily scalp.</li>
            <li>and sometimes it really hurts to brush it after washing.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the non toxic  benefits of this shampoo, my hair stopped falling out so much when I wash it.  </li>
            <li>Even after I gently removed ALL tangles, the brush STILL didn&#x27;t want to go through my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair\\&quot; really worked wonders for my hair</li>
            <li>I really like this Shampoo</li>
            <li>After using it for awhile I really like it.</li>
            <li>I actually really like scent in my shampoo</li>
            <li>but, rather, I was using too much, too often).</li>
            <li>(I thought I had rosacea) but has a healthy pink glow</li>
            <li>Work water all over the scalp for about two minutes, gently massaging your scalp.</li>
            <li>so I can work it in evenly without using too much.</li>
            <li>It didnt really do much to my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the formulation for normal/dry hair, even though my hair used to be very oily, because it seemed like it once it started turning gray, its chemistry had changed.  </li>
            <li>everyone needs to know that this shampoo really works..</li>
            <li>I really advise you to try this.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to comb through it with a wide toothed comb (ditched brushes years ago) and did not have to use conditioner, leave in or otherwise.  </li>
            <li>If you happened to need conditioner, you would not need much, and I would suggest using a leave in rather than a rinse out.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo, it lathers and cleans well but doesn&#x27;t overdry your hair.</li>
            <li>I try to not comb or yank it too much.</li>
            <li>it really cleans the hair and leaves it shiny</li>
            <li>Leaves it clean and not dry.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they figured out how to make a non-toxic shampoo that replicates a highly toxic one!  </li>
            <li>It has a floral scent, relatively light, but still enough to set off allergies.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The real test though for me was, could this shampoo handle chlorine?  </li>
            <li>for my wife, who has much longer hair than me, she switched to Kiss My Face</li>
            <li>/&gt;The real test though for me was, could this shampoo handle chlorine?  </li>
            <li>for my wife, who has much longer hair than me, she switched to Kiss My Face</li>
            <li>really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, overall it was an okay product, but I think I want to try another natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>And then, about two weeks later, I noticed a fifth benefit, my favorite one by far, when I saw that my forehead was clearing up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different \\&quot;natural shampoos\\</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried handfuls of various shampoos, each time heading more towards natural choices.</li>
            <li>Third, my hair dried and was clean and soft but not stiff or dingy the way it is when I use a pure castile soap and also not too fly away and frizzy like when I use a Paul Mitchell detergent shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other natural products and spent a lot of money trying to find a good natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t stink or leave my hair so matted that I cannot get a brush through it.  </li>
            <li>This is a more expensive but super easy to use alternative.</li>
            <li>My hair is much fuller using this product, and I notice a significant difference in the amount of hair I lose daily.</li>
            <li>Good to add other oils to such as Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce much foam but the necessary amount to get you a clean scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the fact, that the shampoo is organic and not like all the other shampoos that have chemicals and cause itching of the scalp.</li>
            <li>So, if you color your hair, you might want to stick with your normal shampoo!</li>
            <li>It foams nicely, rinsing out easily and there is very little amount needed to shampoo my long 14&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The hair loss is starting to be more apparent.  </li>
            <li>I could cry to long silky and fine.</li>
            <li>It takes about a week to get use to the extra conditioning while still giving you that clean feel.</li>
            <li>and my capillaries are starting to fade such that I don&#x27;t have so many fine red lines on my face upon close inspection.</li>
            <li>The only reason not to give it five stars is that it says one does not need conditioner, and I think that is true if one has straight hair, but as a curly haired girl, I still use a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>Clean is the only way to describe the smell.</li>
            <li>I get huge red itchy flaky bumps when using normal shampoo and hairsprays</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, so I was used to using a volumizing shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li>Massage it into a later, quickly but gently, with the goal of cleansing your scalp.</li>
            <li>because normal to oily dries my hair out too much.  </li>
            <li>This is the first all natural shampoo I have tried and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>My hair was extremely soft and shiny after the first use.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair soft and silky, very shiny, I have very way hair and this shampoo makes my hair straight,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tear as easily when dry, now, but it&#x27;s never returned to normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this shampoo does rinse clean, make my hair soft and shiny, last quite a while, and lather really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had tried washing my face more, washing my face less, sleeping on my back to keep my face away from the pillow, not letting my dogs lick my face, what feels like hundreds so is probably more like fifty or sixty different face and hair products and nothing helped.</li>
            <li>my hair combs easily when wet after the shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I have been able to cut the amount of conditioner I use in half.  </li>
            <li>but I have lost enough hair such that I have to wrap my pony tail holder one more time around than I used to.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to wait to write my review until after I had used this for a steady 3 months</li>
            <li>My hair does better with a cleansing conditioner that cleans with essential oils only and no soap.</li>
            <li>I used to have the mindset for shampoos that the more expensive the better.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a sulfate-free shampoo that didn&#x27;t have water as the main ingredient.</li>
            <li>and I was able to run a wide tooth comb through it with ease which really surprised me.  </li>
            <li>The Environmental Working Group Skin Deep website rates various cosmetics on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being most toxic.  </li>
            <li>SO far so good only problem is slight static adding a slight poof of body to my hair, but it is November in Myrtle Beach</li>
            <li>I would also highly recommend the Soap Nuts Soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This shampoo tended to make my hair a little more ... poofy, but it&#x27;s probably the cleanest rinsing shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before my first wash, I used a clarifying shampoo to remove the silicones from my other shampoo which I gladly have given away and the next day set to using this.</li>
            <li>I do seem to be using a little more of it than I&#x27;d like to (at t his price)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave much of a scent in your hair, but that&#x27;s what a natural shampoo is.</li>
            <li>Wash with the minimum amount of shampoo needed to clean my hair so as to not over dry.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like it so far and plan to skip washing some days when my hair gets equilibrated.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really even need to condition afterwards, My hair is soft and workable.</li>
            <li>NaturOil really makes my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>You can see my review for the &#x27;Normal to Oily&#x27; formula here:</li>
            <li>Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Oily Hair</li>
            <li>Is this a normal detox?</li>
            <li>I finally gave up and went back to WEN, and with more hot oil treatments, my hair is massively improved, now.</li>
            <li>My hair has never returned to normal.</li>
            <li>I will only continue to use products that are superior to my usual brands and I expect I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li>What I try to do is buy it directly with one of their coupons and that helps with the price plus they usually give samples which is a nice touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though my hair gets oily, I got the normal version because I shampoo</li>
            <li>It was every bit as harsh as most non-organic products.</li>
            <li>and I am always glad to find products that do not contain harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>and I wish they did have a separate conditioner for long, frequently heat- styled hair, but I just ordered their Moroccan oil, so I hope that will help to maintain my ends in combination with another brand&#x27;s light rinse-out conditioner.</li>
            <li>For reference: I&#x27;m a man with normal medium-length hair</li>
            <li>I was slightly skeptical at first about soap nuts but after giving it a try it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>It is normal to see hair strands from time to time, but before I switched from products using harsh detergents I was noticing more hair loss.</li>
            <li>it does the job just as good as the store brand shampoo without all of the unnecessary harmful chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li>And all of our hair is clean soft and conditioned and looks health without being over conditioned or flat or sticky or goopy.</li>
            <li>It lathers up into a rich thick lather and leaves my hair clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This works fine and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as &#x27;stripped&#x27; as it does when I use other sulfate shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I have natural &#x27;coily&#x27; hair and was looking for a sulfate free shampoo that didn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li>After a week less hair is falling out and no chunks of scalp in my brush.my scalp still itches and needs more time to heal completely.</li>
            <li>I have coarse gray hair and from the very first time of use my hair came out soft and shiny with no yellowing.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil in conditioners left me a mess (causes oil plugs) and detergents over-dried my skin causing runaway oil production in my own oil glands to compensate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update after about a month of using this product, as it&#x27;s hard to give a full fair review after just a few shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, hair if anyone feels that is relevant.</li>
            <li>I have tried other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li>;) I just thought I would share my results as one has to be really careful when they are using dandruff shampoos but also have to be equally careful that they are not adding more build-up to the scalp that fungus can feed off of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fragrance free due to health issues</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried Ojon, Argan and Jojoba), and my hair still is brittle, breaking, falling out, and super dry.</li>
            <li>My skin is just really sensitive to certain fragrances, chemicals and even oatmeal, which I recently dumped for my wife&#x27;s pure olive oil soap.</li>
            <li>I switched to the shampoo for dry hair, bought the serum (which works great), treat it extra carefully when wet and do weekly hot oil treatments</li>
            <li>I have fine but thick hair so its very finicky and doesn&#x27;t take much to tangle.</li>
            <li>So, I went back to using my wife&#x27;s Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap and after using it for a few months I noticed my skin was not drying out any more.</li>
            <li>(A vented brush without a ton of bristles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this shampoo many ways: lots of shampoo, leaving it on my hair through the shower, very little shampoo, rinsing it out immediately after washing.</li>
            <li>Within the first two weeks I noticed a vast difference and by the end of 3-4 weeks, using both products, all my scalp problems were gone and have remained gone since then.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a number of hot oil treatments and been using a deep conditioning shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my hair feel thicker more manageable and also my hair has no more frizz at all&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>The only flip side is my hair tangles a lot easier the first day.</li>
            <li>and now I am aware of the products I use daily.</li>
            <li>I just bought my second bottle after finishing my first in about 3 months.  </li>

            <li>I used a small amount of shampoo and had to add a bit more to get the lather I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I always had really pretty hair until recently.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>My daughter had pretty severe eczema, but I stopped using regular laundry detergent, fabric softener, and shampoo.</li>
            <li>I tried different face wash and face lotion and that helped (organic/natural), but I still had dry skin mostly on my forehead, but around my face in general after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>This is a new product for me also, but so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work right away, but it wasn&#x27;t long that I realized that I didn&#x27;t need a conditional anymore.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and not at all oily or fine after using this shampoo so I may need to add the serum or some argon oil later.  </li>
            <li>My waves weren&#x27;t consistent enough to wear it natural.</li>
            <li>She too has a very sensitive scalp (frequent itchiness) and seems to  have no problems if she sticks to the soap</li>
            <li>And, yet, somehow, this formula is free and clear of all known irritants and allergens, which means it won&#x27;t drip down your forehead causing comedones and ruining your appearance.</li>
            <li>very fine, flat, straight hair and regular shampoos and conditioners seemed to always weigh it down, even ones specifically for volume.  </li>
            <li>For the steep price, I expect it to not be watered down this significantly.  </li>
            <li>I have fine brown hair and it has never been color treated or heavily styled.  </li>
            <li>I started using &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; the first week of</li>
            <li>I dont really understand their classifications of normal to dry or normal to oily.</li>
            <li>I took a chance and began using this as my face wash having used a simple soap for years and found that, after another two weeks, the low level of olive oil in this and the different cleansing agents had pulled the oil to the surface in a series of very mild breakouts</li>
            <li>Overall, though, it does get my scalp and hair clean, and seems to keep it healthier, and that bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It may be a natural soap, but I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s actually stripping my hair.</li>
            <li>I cannot use this product daily, though, it strips too much from my hair: I needed extra conditioner and my scalp felt tight the more often I used it.</li>
            <li>Scalp to mid-shaft is fine, but the lower half and ends seems to have been bombed!</li>
            <li>Little to no dandruff left! :)</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical of this shampoo noting that every shampoo company says their is the best.  </li>
            <li>It cleans deeply but gently, has no scent, and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I had dandruff problems before using this, and since some of the reviews said it helped clear up their scalp, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>My scalp is still itching some, but I expect that to clear up in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have always been sensitive to detergents.  </li>
            <li>But it is much easier to find low toxicity conditioners that work.</li>
            <li>So thus began my quest for a natural cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is completely natural and that is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li>The product is made with all natural ingredients and the company is dedicated to promoting health and well-being instead of image.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it took my hair nearly a month before completely detoxing.   </li>
            <li>I have also turned my daughter and 5 year old granddaughter on to it</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this shampoo and the bottle has lasted my long hair about two months.</li>
            <li>so I am looking for something natural as I also get color treatments every 12-16 weeks.</li>
            <li>I can wear my hair natural without needing to do anything besides brush it.</li>
            <li>Soap nuts have a natural foam that comes out of them, so that&#x27;s probably what the foam is from.</li>
            <li>The burning feeling has completely stopped.</li>
            <li>Been looking for all natural products to replace those with chemicals throughout my house.  </li>
            <li>so far no problems considering it</li>
            <li>is all natural</li>
            <li>All natural.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a soft almost odor-less smell, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...</li>
            <li>Lately I was thinking of going back to soapnut shampoo and was pleased to find a ready made organic soapnut shampoo.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars instead of one because I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to shower nearly as often as I used to.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and it helps with bleached hair.</li>
            <li>When I started using this shampoo there was a considerable decrease in dropping hair.</li>
            <li>and it ends up soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>and it ends up soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I do not need a conditioner after I shampoo with it so far</li>
            <li>and my hair feels soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the difference already, it is keeping my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It immediately made my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>I have always been a natural girl, but have been moving away from chemicals in my household for over a year now.  </li>
            <li>But finally I got up the courage to do it, and that&#x27;s when this product really started to work.</li>
            <li>&quot; and this is the one shampoo I&#x27;ve found that has completely resolved all of my issues.  </li>
            <li>I use organic, natural, fragrance-free beauty products always and pay attention to what the Environmental Working Group says.  </li>
            <li>Lost clumps of hair and hair lost life completely as if I washed it with some detergent....</li>
            <li>All I wanted was an all natural shampoo, which I believe this is.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s probably not just a feeling, since the spots I used to have on my shoulders have completely disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so we are looking for a natural solution.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair soft with no build up</li>
            <li>I would recommend pairing with an all natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care that some of the ingredients are organic, but I do care they are all completely natural.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants to use an organic product that is earth-friendly...</li>
            <li>I use no conditioner, just this product, and my hair feels so natural and light everyday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny and thick-  and looks extremely healthy for a 59 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone who is having dry scalp issues or just wants to avoid harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>(no worse than what I was fighting already) and left my pores clean and tight.</li>
            <li>For me a big bonus was there is not a strong smell to it as I am allergic to so many scents used even in natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very clean, but it also feels dry and is extremely tangled.</li>
            <li>but I do roll my hair on large velcro rollers and then flat iron</li>
            <li>the &#x27;Normal to Dry&#x27; formula works really well for</li>
            <li>This was the first natural shampoo that I have used and it was pretty good although for someone like me with wavy, thick, long hair my hair was hard to manage.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shampoo, received it yesterday, used it this morning and lo and behold, my hair is back to normal!</li>
            <li>At first I didnt like it felt like when I washed my hair that it tangled and felt dry.</li>
            <li>It takes some time to get use to since it seems at first that your hair seems dry and tangly</li>
            <li>The key to getting this right is, as with all products, start with less and remember that less usually is more which body care products.</li>
            <li>After the first week I have continued using the Soap Nuts Shampoo daily and then have only been using the Dandrene as maintenance on Wednesday and Sunday nights.</li>
            <li>I only started to use a sulfate-free shampoo recently and tried Wen first.</li>
            <li>Well luckily I looked at reviews for my previous shampoo I&#x27;ve been using for years and someone posted the toxicity rating from this site [...]    </li>
            <li>I stuck with it and held off on the conditioner and by day 5 it seems like my hair must have gone through a detox or something because day 5 brushing seemed much easier than first few days</li>
            <li>While this soap is better, it does dry out my skin a little.</li>
            <li>Just FYI this type of shampoo will not stop male pattern baldness caused by high DHEA.</li>
            <li>Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; at the same time.</li>
            <li>If you want to know the difference between the action of synthetic detergents/ surfactants (&amp;#34;surface active agents&amp;#34;) and natural SOAP (&amp;</li>
            <li>I do not believe I would be getting the same results if I had just used one or the other, as the Dandrene can dry your scalp out more if you are over using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but I&#x27;ve noticed that foaming action from chemicals \\&quot;looks\\&quot; different than foaming action created from naturally occurring ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Plus, even though I continue to blow- out straight all the time, my natural wavy/curl texture has come back after using it for a short period.</li>
            <li>I got a bottle for my very picky, (and whiny about giving up her products) daughter to try on her long color treated hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just careful the first time I comb through it</li>
            <li>I always had very dry scalp that itched constantly and was red pretty much all the time.</li>
            <li>I have the challenge of getting my scalp clean without drying my ends out by excessive exposure to shampoo, and also that will allow my hair to have natural</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair and could never go a day without washing it because it would get too oily.</li>
            <li>It is thick and dilutes well, I feel it is a good value for how little I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; every day and only use the  &amp;#34;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; every Wednesday and now Saturday nights rather than on Sunday&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I wish they had a conditioner that was very moisturizing to the dry ends of your hair.</li>
            <li>whole family has since switched to Carina Organics Uncented Nature&#x27;s Blends Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and Nature&#x27;s Blends Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Basically, commercial shampoos strip away your natural oils, so when you stop using them, your hair overproduces your natural oils.</li>
            <li>and my hair is so shiny and not dry and soft and not falling out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m usually a &amp;#34;rinse maniac&amp;#34; and I spend a long time scrubbing under running water to make sure I got rid of all the soap.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate the lack of added fragrance, as I am very sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders Moisturizing somewhat stopped the itching, but not the flaking, which was a major source of embarrassment.</li>
            <li>(guessing sulfate allergy if not other ingredients also).  </li>
            <li>but I have no other option.  </li>
            <li>I dyed my hair for years and lived through about 20 years of perms to make my hair look full and thick, which it isn&#x27;t, so to make up for years of damage, it made sense to find something that would gently cleanse my hair without damaging it further.  </li>
            <li>I find that, though I am using this as a shampoo, it is a very effective facial cleanser and, on the occasion that my tantrum-prone crazy skin acts up, it lends itself to blending.</li>
            <li>I found their hand and body soaps, facial creams and other body care to be unusable, including their normal to oily version of this very shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In comparison, most shampoo/conditioner brands advertised on television seem to score about 4 or 5 (moderately toxic) on EWG&#x27;s scale because they contain fragrances that can cause allergies and various chemicals that are hard to pronounce like Methylchloroisothiazolinone or DMDM Hydantoin, and of course</li>
            <li>It is nice and squeaky clean and a subtle shine, but it looks out of control !!!!  </li>
            <li>I am surprised how clean it keeps the hair for such a plain simple shampoo.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back to my old Matrix shampoo and my scalp is at least free form itching.</li>
            <li>far the results are the same.</li>
            <li>But it also Doesn&#x27;t make natural blonde hair darker either.</li>
            <li>NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo is terrific!</li>
            <li>I use a deep conditioner about once a month, and my hair is always soft.    </li>
            <li>I only wash my hair a couple of times a week but condition nearly every day.</li>
            <li>I use it if I want extra soft hair.</li>
            <li>My hair air dries so soft, bouncy and shiny, though I can say that it&#x27;s definitely not helping with hair loss.  </li>
            <li>My hair air dries so soft, bouncy and shiny, though I can say that it&#x27;s definitely not helping with hair loss.  </li>
            <li>and it actually felt soft.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s literally the only natural shampoo that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>and I decided I needed to go natural to get the shine and beauty back to my hair.</li>
            <li>Over the past two years I have done much damage by bleaching and coloring and of course hot flat irons and blow drying.</li>
            <li>To me there is dry, normal or oily.</li>
            <li>Even though my hair and scalp tend to be oily, but the NaturOli shampoo for \\&quot;Normal to Dry</li>
            <li>I normally let my hair air dry</li>
            <li>I normally let my hair air dry</li>
            <li>As I don&#x27;t have any medical condition that can contribute to hair loss, and considering the hair loss stopped when I switched shampoo, it is reasonable to conclude that this shampoo made me loose my hair.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately that is largely because there is a huge industry wrecking us.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other shampoo products, but I feel that the NaturOli shampoo really did the trick.</li>
            <li>I would use it every other day, but even after one day washing, my hair gets very oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this and all the other products made by this manufacturer, you can really see the results literally with each passing day it is used.</li>
            <li>If your hair is still oily, use a little more and work it on the hair a few moments longer.</li>
            <li>The formula used to be a thick, rich formula.   </li>
            <li>Although the bottle states no conditioner needed, we do because the 8 yr old has middle of the back length hair.</li>
            <li>Since switching to this shampoo my face does not dry out anywhere close to how it used to.  </li>
            <li>However combing through my hair when it was wet was pretty tough as it seemed too squeaky clean if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>tend to have oily hair and after a day of not washing I get flaky and itchy - with most any other shampoo - expensive and not expensive.</li>
            <li>It took a little time to work the lather into my hair, but it was not difficult.</li>
            <li>I have one pimple right now, small, barely visible, instead of too manyto count.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my NaturOli Soap Nut/Soapberry Shampoo for normal to dry hair last night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to decrease the amount of random chemicals and things that I use in my everyday life, and I am happy to find a shampoo with low toxicity.  </li>
            <li>Also, if it helps any, I have red, course hair that is curly and frizzy in some areas and completely straight in other areas.  </li>
            <li>: I have extremely long hair that&#x27;s not real thick and dyed.  </li>
            <li>Then add a small amount (dime sized for shorter hair and a quarter at most for longer hair, unless it is halfway down your back) to your palm.</li>
            <li>Have tried many other shampoos with very little results!</li>
            <li>Once hair is rinsed, it won&#x27;t be dry unless you left the shampoo on too long or used too much.</li>
            <li>Using it daily will make your hair oily, not dry!</li>
            <li>Normal to Dry formula uses a soap nut powder base (where nut is a misleading term because soap nuts are actually berries) and an olive oil castile soap alongside a lathering cleanser (lauryl glucoside) which is very mild and light.</li>
            <li>And because my hair is not dry and tangled after shampooing, I only use a leave in conditioner for styling.</li>
            <li>I really love that this shampoo is free of all the bad stuff in conventional shampoos.</li>
            <li>A little organic pure cocoa butter, shea butter or coconut oil works too.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of regular shampoo but what always ends up happening is my hair becomes weighed down, oily and dull looking.</li>
            <li>The detox phase happens because your hair became accustomed to being scrubbed clean and dried out due to commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li>I personally just let my hair dry naturally and then comb it out later because it is easier that way</li>
            <li>If that becomes much of a problem there are simple solutions, like mixing up a little coconut oil and ginger to rub into your scalp, or running your hands through your hair after you put on a tiny bit of hand cream.  </li>
            <li>Anytime someone switches from typical shampoo to chemical free or completely raw and organic methods of cleansing their hair, you have to understand the detox period.  </li>
            <li>I read almost all the reviews good and bad about this product and decided to take the plunge and purchase.  </li>

            <li> I thought it was a good idea to try this product because of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> The company sounds awesome, and I just knew I was gonna love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so I could be fair with the results.</li>
            <li> and I am totally delighted.  </li>
            <li> so my review is separated into good and not so good, as follows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using a good conditioner with this shampoo:</li>
            <li> The lathering was good.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> It smells good and lathers well.  </li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> I have used NaturOli Soap Nuts Shampoo before and loved it.  </li>
            <li> and I feel good about the chemicals I am NOT putting on my hair.</li>
            <li> It was good for detoxifying</li>
            <li> Works good, I have frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Worked good on my hair.</li>

            <li> My Face product is a good fallback.</li>
            <li> My hair was beautiful and healthy before using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells great, has a normal shampoo consistency and creates an excellent foam with just about a nickle sized amount (I use it as body wash as well).  </li>
            <li> It is very healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> how much more damaged it may be by then!</li>

            <li> so they and I will ordering more!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> It is magic!</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many shampoos!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using for about 6 months, and she has been so much better since the switch!</li>
            <li> &quot;  This shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked amazing when I was finished, beautiful, full of life</li>
            <li> My wife and I both noticed an amazing difference after just one use.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> It also lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li> No scent, nice suds...</li>
            <li> Soap nuts shampoo hasn&#x27;t impressed me a whole lot yet.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells kind of like mushrooms.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner too, but honestly don&#x27;t even need to use it.</li>
            <li> and I have really liked it...</li>
            <li> I used to make my own soapnut shampoo years ago.</li>
            <li> Also, I like the fact my hair stays nice for days.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would use more product than I have to in an effort to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s good volume and my hair looks so healthy.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s good volume and my hair looks so healthy.  </li>
            <li> The product still foams nicely</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend this kind of money on shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful, so gentle.</li>
            <li> I heard about soap nuts but wanted to try pre-made shampoo before getting into making my own (to rule out user error).</li>
            <li> so I can make my own from the nuts.</li>
            <li> Good for most hair.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this shampoo performs quite nicely in that</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this shampoo performs quite nicely in that</li>
            <li> She asked if I had changed my shampoo, and wanted to know what kind I was using.</li>
            <li> I love to get great results while supporting a great company.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and looks great.  </li>
            <li> Great shampoo, mild and neutral to my scalp.</li>
            <li> More companies need to be more like NaturOli!  </li>
            <li> Soap Nut/Soapberry Shampoo has been our best natural shampoo choice yet!</li>
            <li> I switched to this from WEN, which I used for 4 years and my hair was healthy and amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And, best of all, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> but when it comes to healthy alternatives in this category, this is by far the best..</li>
            <li> The extracts provided here are nourishing, ginseng and green tea, olive leaf and water cress, but of greatest importance are hair tonic ingredients used successfully for shine and scalp health</li>
            <li> I am genuinely pleased by the results of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of allergies and problems with most shampoos; not this one.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product - it smells nice and feels good when you are applying it.  </li>
            <li> Thank You :-))</li>
            <li> all of which caused even more irritation, until I discovered both the Soap Nuts and Dandrene shampoos.</li>
            <li> I love both of these shampoos.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> and I have never been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I want to love this product.</li>
            <li> Basically, I spend most of my money on conditioners, wash out and leave-in, not</li>
            <li> and my hair just looks much better.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The detox takes more than a week.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s better not to wash hair too often..)  </li>
            <li> My hair is much more manageable doing it this way, but I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying this shampoo for myself again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I was looking for a healthy balance for my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a wonderful shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> THANK YOU FOR MAKING SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> until I got my latest bottle.  </li>
            <li> I noticed in my latest bottle that it&#x27;s quite runny this time around.  </li>
            <li> I have to use much more than before to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> Once this bottle is out, I might give them one more try.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> My kids love it too</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because it gives my hair volume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Soap Nut formulas are among an increasing number of &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or, rather, chemically safe shampoos and body care products.</li>
            <li> Just reading the ingredients lets you know how safe it will be (in terms of avoiding cancer)</li>
            <li> First off, I noticed that the dime-size amount I use to wash my hair was successful in covering my scalp and coating the hair shaft of every strand.</li>

            <li> Going to try scalp massages and peppermint oil to stimulate better circulation to my head.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sulfate-free&amp;#34; shampoos that I have tried take more product to create a lather than this product.</li>
            <li> The grays are better behaved</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> after about a week of using this product i did notice some more body to my hair.  </li>
            <li> i also love that it is practically scent-free..</li>
            <li> i am sure adding all-natural fragrance oil wouldnt change its effectiveness..</li>
            <li> However...I do love EXREME 18X for laundry (1 pump in pre-wash and 2 pumps in detergent cup).</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It made my hair lighter and more lifted at the roots.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like it has more volumn since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I did read where many who use this product were able to discontinue use of a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I must say I have not been able to do that  </li>
            <li> The more I use it, the happier and healthier my hair feels.</li>
            <li> has been subpar, with the exception of the Organix line, which has been a bit more satisfying.</li>
            <li> My hair is incredibly shiny, soft, and manageable.</li>

            <li> use Neutrogena&#x27;s Tar Dandruff shampoo just to make sure I have no flakes.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> What more could a man ask for?</li>
            <li> I was able to comb my hair and brush it.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I guess.</li>
            <li> my daughter and i have shiny smooth hair after using this luxurious shampoo!</li>
            <li> This product lathered a bit more than what I am used to when using chemical free products, which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li> While my hair is course, it is thinning up top -</li>
            <li> but it feels healthy and is manageable.  </li>
            <li> Low toxicity, and great for my hair!</li>
            <li> and it looks so healthy even though still damp.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Maybe, it would be okay for shorter hair or thinner hair.</li>
            <li> it gets better with prolong use.  </li>
            <li> Buying two more bottles to stock up :-)</li>
            <li> &quot; in this product that even show up on EWG&#x27;s list are Citric acid, Guar Gum and Aloe Vera, none of which most people would consider toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or so my hair became much more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or so my hair became much more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She also said I should always make sure to buy a shampoo that is specifically made for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> At this point we should know that all the things we apply in our bodies are somehow absorbed and that&#x27;s exactly why I consider this a very good shampoo.</li>
            <li> There is no problem at all with getting your hair nice and clean with this.</li>
            <li> I love having the chance to clean my hair without all the chemistry!  </li>
            <li> It does need 2 latherings, but leaves hair feeling very clean and silky.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I used it one time, and after shampooing my hair twice, it turned out very clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this shampoo, based on the company&#x27;s excellent reputation and all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shampoo for not just chemical allergies or allergies of any kind, but for everyone who wants to use something healthy for your hair!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> EWG&#x27;s skindeep website gives it a score of 2, which is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say about this is that you get a good amount of shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed reading about this shampoo and the other reviewers seemed to love it.</li>
            <li> However, there is an off label use for this that has really surprised me and made me very, very, and I&#x27;m going for it, VERY happy.</li>
            <li> BUT...it&#x27;s more important to me that my Hair is CLEAN withOUT chemicals!</li>
            <li> Its all natural and is just a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> my hair looks great and feels soft.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need conditioner, just the all natural shampoo and your hair will feel and look great.  </li>
            <li> Our clients who are gluten free love this product when they forget their shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> If this works for your hair type than I think it&#x27;s great since it&#x27;s so natural</li>
            <li> my sensitive scalp is happy.</li>
            <li> So far, I feel this will be a great product.</li>
            <li> Another great attribute is that you don&#x27;t need conditioner, your hair will be soft and shiny without it.</li>
            <li> New to and Loving this Product BRAND!     </li>
            <li> Tiny bottle and huge number of loads, am hoping for excellent and clean results on that product too.</li>
            <li> Fortunately once the &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; phase is over my hair becomes shiny, smooth and most importantly OIL FREE!</li>
            <li> This washes out easily, and my hair is never greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard reviews that say it&#x27;s still cleaning even if it&#x27;s not lathering, but it sure didn&#x27;t clean for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have used a lot more to get my hair fully clean</li>
            <li> The shampoo rinses out easily.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the hair feeling clean; I was hoping for a bit more moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After using the shampoo for some time, I began to notice my salon-colored hair losing it&#x27;s color very quickly, after two to three washes.</li>
            <li> Everything they say is true, and better.</li>
            <li> I have fine and curly hair and always need conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly fine with my hair..</li>
            <li> Twice works fine, but three times is a charm.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinning shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used almost all of the first bottle I bought and have been more than pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s not a problem for you, this may be a fine product.  </li>
            <li> Stock up because it goes quickly!</li>
            <li> The gray ones are wiry and stick out like tangled porcupine quills, which looks really bizarre considering the fact that the rest of my hair is baby fine.  </li>
            <li> I have had a time finding a shampoo with little or no scent and this is perfect!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is, by far, the best natural shampoo I have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of them.</li>
            <li> That is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> It also conditions the hair and leaves it tangle free.</li>
            <li> My hair was actually squeaky-clean (some people may like that), and I had great difficulty brushing after showering.</li>
            <li> We had been using Dr. Bronners but my kids could not stand the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; feel of that soap - with the Soap Nut Shampoo your skin and hair feel smooth.</li>
            <li> this is a replacement in USA for chem free treatment, my wife and daughter both are insisted me to write this review in Amazon, &amp;#34;ordered&amp;#34; me to rate 5 star.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s both gentle and effective in cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> Twenty dollars may seem a bit steep for a shampoo, but I feel that it is justified in that it replaces the need for a conditioner</li>
            <li> Is it because it&#x27;s sulfate free?</li>
            <li> I NEVER get compliments on my hair, and a week after starting this, a friend told me how great my hair looks on a day when all I did was wash and air</li>
            <li> I NEVER get compliments on my hair, and a week after starting this, a friend told me how great my hair looks on a day when all I did was wash and air</li>
            <li> overall i am happy and will purchase again.    </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Please feel free to ask questions.</li>
            <li> I solved that by decanting the shampoo into a cheap ketchup-style squeeze bottle from the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> Lauryl Glucoside (a sugar based soap which I understand is the primary soap in the  California Baby line)    </li>
            <li> It is gluten free and uses no funky chemicals.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I think the cheap one was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fragrance free, no allergens and toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> I swim almost every day from April to November in an over-chlorinated pool and need a shampoo that can get the chlorine out and de-tangle my hair so that it feels smooth.  </li>
            <li> I swim almost every day from April to November in an over-chlorinated pool and need a shampoo that can get the chlorine out and de-tangle my hair so that it feels smooth.  </li>
            <li> I understand this is a temporary solution good for detoxifying and then a natural shampoo is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My scalp is so dry and itchy and my hair is very fly away and unmanageable and I think I am also losing more hair than normal when drying/styling.</li>
            <li> It would be very easy to create your own signature scent by adding any number/variety of essential</li>
            <li> so I continued to use it to see what happened as I was not loosing a significant amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE JULY 17, 2013:  I have since switched shampoo and within 5 days of switching I stopped loosing a significant amount of hair strands.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Naturoli shampoo out of desperation, even though it cost more than what I&#x27;m normally willing to pay for a hair product.    </li>
            <li> I am excited about this shampoo</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found this shampoo and experience</li>
            <li> Whenever Shampoo/Conditioner and has been happy with that brand, which scores 2 out of 10 for toxicity on EWG&#x27;s website and is also a little more affordable when bought at a grocery store.  </li>

            <li> It leaves hair clean shinny</li>
            <li> My hair feels CLEAN...</li>
            <li> like clarifying clean.  </li>
            <li> I love the shampoo, but was more concentrated when purchased directly from the companies website.  </li>
            <li> just clean.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather at all, and my hair did not feel clean after washing with it.  </li>
            <li> shampoo lathers, gets squeaky clean and hair</li>
            <li> Clothes are clean and have no smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done hours of research trying to find a safe, effective product that still left my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> GREAT for my sons dry scalp</li>
            <li> shampoo is naturally moisture-rich, and I do need more product to get my hair clean with it, because it is not as detergent- like as most shampoos.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves your hair feeling clean and doesnt strip your hair of nutrients.</li>
            <li> The scent is just enough to make it pleasant without being too fragrant.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well, gives your hair a clean, full feel and without residue.  </li>
            <li> It was okay in the beginning, my hair was clean, my scalp don&#x27;t itch as much, my dandruff wasn&#x27;t too flaky anymore.</li>
            <li> I also have finally settled on a good soap too,</li>
            <li> It has gotten very slightly better with being one gigantic mat after washing, but not by much.</li>
            <li> Does it really get better?</li>
            <li> I think my hair just does not do well with soaps of any kind, even if they are natural.</li>
            <li> It blows out full, but</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length, healthy hair and my routine is to thoroughly brush my hair before showering/washing it, then gently brush out tangles after my shower.</li>
            <li> This shampoo could not be more natural, clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to an all natural shampoo, so I made my own.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use many hair products, but it really does feel like the one that I use is cleaned out when I use this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and I found that to be true.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found neither to be true.</li>
            <li> This is an effective all natural shampoo based on my one time use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, a nice side effect: I&#x27;ve received praise on how soft my beard is since I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> From the description of this shampoo, I thought it would be good because I would not have to use multiple conditioners.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind using a conditioner later to get a good feel.</li>
            <li> Almost no products get a zero or a ten, and this product scored a 1 out of 10, which is about as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the softness and shine of my hair is returning as well; it still becomes tangled but not nearly as bad as when I was using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair has more volume, much less frizz, and feels good.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use haircolor, this would my first recommendation easily.  </li>
            <li> It lathers just fine for me, and my hair wasn&#x27;t tangled at all even after the first time use.</li>
            <li> I tried to find a conditioner to use with this product, but each one I tried they would either leave my hair tangled or super oily.</li>
            <li> Lathers up really nicely, mild, unnoticeable smell.  </li>
            <li> The three lead actives in this cleanser work together to mildly cleanse hair without stripping it (if used appropriately, that is to say, by someone who knows how to wash hair properly, which most people don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so while I waited for more to be in stock I purchased more of this NaturOli shampoo and the very same day I use it, my scalp is on fire!</li>
            <li> My hair adjusted to using it quite quickly</li>
            <li> A very nice product if you are trying to keep away from sulphates and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> I feel cleaner and its nice not relying on so many other chemicals to achieve this feeling.</li>
            <li> This is good if you are fragrance free due to asthma, MCS, or migraines.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to washing twice a week and have never been so happy.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, not fly-away and didn&#x27;t strip my hair which is very fine and color treated.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo, it was really the first time that my hair had more volume, shine, and didn&#x27;t get oily as quickly.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning the hair without stripping it so dry it is unmanageable</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that dries out easily.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> First of all it smells clean . . .</li>
            <li> Even though the label says normal to dry,  it&#x27;s best for normal hair types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and it has worked great.  </li>
            <li> I used it only on my scalp and it was amazing and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> short this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> this is the most natural shampoo I can find.</li>
            <li> NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! -</li>
            <li> The  price is worth it to me, since I know that there is nothing harmful to me, or the environment in this</li>
            <li> NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! -</li>
            <li> During the two times I have used NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo, I have lost more hair than I can believe.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t worth going bald.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Just know, if you haven&#x27;t detoxed your hair away from chemical products prior to using this shampoo (I did it with my own homemade shampoo)</li>
            <li> Overall a nice product thought.</li>
            <li> but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> constantly this feels nice.....</li>
            <li> This all-natural shampoo is amazing, has that fabulous NATURAL soapy foam, and I have absolutely no fear that I&#x27;m touching or exposing my system to toxins.</li>
            <li> Tried all kinds of natural products and truly love this one plus</li>
            <li> Love that it is totally natural.</li>
            <li> I am trying to go natural/organic/chemical free with as many of our products as possible.  </li>
            <li> the market they are appealing to likes things all natural.</li>
            <li> I am confident that I am using a truly natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Too many shampoo brands brag how soft and manageable our hair will be if we use their product.  </li>
            <li> I am glad having chosen this natural product.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t use any conditioner, and my hair is soft and shiny and has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> love this shampoo for my naturally curly/dry/coarse hair</li>
            <li> It is a natural product and I love it for that.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural, and I feel that it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I used to have beautiful healthy, low maintenance hair with a lot of body that had a slight wave to it</li>
            <li> I have very fine, oily hair, and this has given it a lot more body (probably because it&#x27;s not weighed down by all the so-called &amp;#34;volumizing products&amp;#34; I was using before.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels kind of stiff, like a broom :-)</li>
            <li> Product has no bad smells (smells like nothing really) and lathers up really quick.    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any smell only a very light one in the bottle not bad.</li>
            <li> As for my hair it feels soft, clean, and light.    </li>
            <li> After using sulfate-free shampoos for more than a year, I still have to remind myself that lather doesn&#x27;t equal clean.</li>
            <li> I tend to use it every other day and that&#x27;s a good balance for me.     </li>
            <li> I think I chose the right formula.  </li>
            <li> I suppose you could say unscented, but that isn&#x27;t right either.  </li>
            <li> A comb runs right through it after washing with no problem.</li>
            <li> I tried this hoping it could be a more cost effective alternative to my usual cleansing product (Wen).</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel really clean, but my hairstylist said it was stripping too much of the color.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fairly good and soft that sometimes I can barely feel it.</li>
            <li> But this shampoo really feels like it balances the oils of my scalp and makes my hair clean.</li>
            <li> And It really makes my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> It styled very easily and held the style all day without any extra product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and clean!</li>
            <li> All soaps I have tried really eat up my skin and dry it out good.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, greying hair and , before using this shampoo, had to use two different products to give my hair some volume and manageability.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of dry.</li>
            <li> I am very concerned about toxins in my environment, and I like feeling healthy and natural in all my health and beauty products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely trying the dish soap and recommending soap nut berries for effective and gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li> i find that while i am able to comb while wet, i still use a light weight leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> one complaint is that there isn&#x27;t a handy dispenser type top.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and is a nice consistency, however it did tend to make my hair feel a little dry.</li>
            <li> After about 3 uses, my scalp felt wonderful, and no more itching!!!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that it would foam up that easily, but it does lather really fast and a lot better than some of the other shampoos I was using.</li>
            <li> For the first week, I followed the directions for the Soap Nut Shampoo and then followed with the Dandrene.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;First thing that I have found that really really works!  </li>
            <li> But since this is my first sulfate-free shampoo, I realize my hair likes it</li>
            <li> washing my hair first thing, rinsing, then putting conditioner on my hair and leaving it on through my shower.</li>
            <li> But my hair is nicer, more like it was back in the day.</li>
            <li> I am hoping after the initial detox period to be able to go longer.</li>
            <li> I really like them all!     </li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> A small blob of this shampoo really works into a great foam.  </li>
            <li> I love the cleansing agent: it definitely works to remove sebum and dirt</li>
            <li> Read further if you want more information and don&#x27;t if all you wanted to know is what the off label use is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My scalp feels better, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about all the foaming chemicals in regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I switched to DevaCurl products, and the problem was gone with my first shampoo.  </li>
            <li> i have tried so many different types of shampoo in the past..including shampoo bars..</li>
            <li> The bottle was exactly as represented online and packaged well (actually, more packing than I would&#x27;ve thought necessary).</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried dozens and I&#x27;d definitely put this in the top 5.</li>
            <li> First, however, I used a clay detox on my hair (</li>
            <li> I did some searching for an easier solution that was completely chemical free and came across this product.  </li>
            <li> I went without a conditioner for the first two weeks</li>
            <li> The $20 price tag seems steep at first, but most people who use this product (including me) do not need conditioner, so that offsets the initial sticker shock</li>
            <li> a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not a fan of this product after the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li> but went along with it, and sure enough after a week</li>
            <li> but went along with it, and sure enough after a week</li>
            <li> I did have to condition my hair afterward because my hair is on the dry side, so I used aloe vera gel from my plant and emu oil (left it in, did not rinse it out) and used a boar hair bristle brush after, and my hair came out looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to give my fine hair a little more body.  </li>
            <li> The most helpful thing I can offer is to read lots of reviews before you buy, and take each review with a large grain of salt if the person&#x27;s hair type is different than yours.  </li>
            <li> I will try and update this in a few weeks if anything changes but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> With my fine textured hair, I generally have to sacrifice softness for volume, but that was not the case here.  </li>
            <li> really do love this shampoo not just for the low toxin level but because it really cleans my hair without over drying.</li>
            <li> It was not a big lather, but a gentle justenough lather, which tickled me since most homemade shampoos don&#x27;t lather because of the lack of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> The coconut milk and gel mixture was better as a conditioner (left my hair very greasy), so I added emu oil and put it on the ends as a conditioner</li>
            <li> The price may be high, but the shampoo is worth it.</li>
            <li> I loved WEN, but it&#x27;s not that pure, and I fell in love with a henna hair color that unfortunately WEN strips out.</li>
            <li> It leaves a little rough feel to the hair after use, which might not be a good thing to many people, but that reminds me of using soap nuts which gives lather to hair, but still feels not so moisturised.</li>
            <li> I had read all those positive reviews and decided to buy the product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo even with no conditioner for my long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I even did the whole detox phase that it recommends to do when you first use it.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder blade length, color treated blonde hair, with a bit of a natural wave, not thin, nice body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few months now, and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo every other day, and it really leaves my hair (which is oily) feeling very clean!  </li>
            <li> Hair is clean and soft, and does not tangle as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a nice texture without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> While this shampoo does make my hair soft, I don&#x27;t think that it works any better than my other chemical free shampoo, which is cheaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having read many reviews prior to using, I made sure my hair was very wet before applying the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> And this has a nice but slight smell to it.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t contain the unnatural ingredients that most shampoos do, but it seems to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> And, the hair near my scalp gets SUPER oily now every 2-3 days, whereas with WEN it never did.</li>
            <li> , my hair has more body after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this if you are looking for an easy, all-natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Gives tons of volume and keeps my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> If you have washed your hair only once you need to go easy on the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is now actually more dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my hair is super soft by any means</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair, and since I cut my hair, started using this, and silicone free conditioner, my hair has been healthier and softer!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not at all appropriate for dry hair and sensitive/dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I love my NaturOli but hadn&#x27;t tried it for dry hair since mine runs oily.  </li>
            <li> After that I tried a few homemade products, first being a mixture of pure organic coconut milk and 100% aloe vera gel (which I retrieved from my own aloe plant).  </li>
            <li> I am certain this is because I have removed chemicals from my haircare products for months now, so I am done with the detox.  </li>
            <li> I accepted large chunks of skin in my hairbrush after a shower.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well on certain hair types/lengths and not as well on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, even with my long thin hair that is normally fly away</li>
            <li> But after a few weeks of sea salt, honey, cider vinegar and coconut oil, I LOVE the effect of this shampoo!</li>
            <li> After becoming aware of this health issues from generic products it makes you wonder how it&#x27;s even legal for companies to sell products that have a high risk of triggering cancer or whatever else it might do.    </li>
            <li> but by next day they are fine.</li>
            <li> You can imagine my trepidation at using this product after reading the negative reviews but there were more positive detailed reviews</li>
            <li> When I first started the no-shampoo route, I did a TON of research and then started making my own products of raw and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo is the first time I have gone without conditioner!</li>
            <li> She thinks it&#x27;s stress, but I&#x27;m a very laid-back person and the main source of stress in my life has been my shedding hair!</li>
            <li> So, if you have acne, maybe try this as a way to clear it up and certainly switch to a different shampoo and conditioner, even if it isn&#x27;t this brand, as shampoos and conditioners cause acne more than your pillowcase or dog ever</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this a four start rating instead of five is because my hair had a lot of static and was a little more frizzy than I was used to with the honey mixture.  </li>
            <li> I think they are an amazing company and have outstanding products, but unfortunately, this shampoo did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I feel badly saying this, as I really wanted to be wowed and fall in love with this, since NaturOli is such a wonderful company.</li>
            <li> So coupling it with the Soap Nuts shampoo has really worked well for me.</li>
            <li> Very cleansing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> No SLS really makes the difference.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is really gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t lather as much as a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo because of the lack of SLS.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t use conditioners with it WITHOUT getting an oily scalp.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it really hurts to brush it after washing.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the non toxic  benefits of this shampoo, my hair stopped falling out so much when I wash it.  </li>
            <li> Even after I gently removed ALL tangles, the brush STILL didn&#x27;t want to go through my hair.</li>
            <li> Hair\\&quot; really worked wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> I really like this Shampoo</li>
            <li> After using it for awhile I really like it.</li>
            <li> I actually really like scent in my shampoo</li>
            <li> but, rather, I was using too much, too often).</li>
            <li> (I thought I had rosacea) but has a healthy pink glow</li>
            <li> Work water all over the scalp for about two minutes, gently massaging your scalp.</li>
            <li> so I can work it in evenly without using too much.</li>
            <li> It didnt really do much to my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the formulation for normal/dry hair, even though my hair used to be very oily, because it seemed like it once it started turning gray, its chemistry had changed.  </li>
            <li> everyone needs to know that this shampoo really works..</li>
            <li> I really advise you to try this.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to comb through it with a wide toothed comb (ditched brushes years ago) and did not have to use conditioner, leave in or otherwise.  </li>
            <li> If you happened to need conditioner, you would not need much, and I would suggest using a leave in rather than a rinse out.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, it lathers and cleans well but doesn&#x27;t overdry your hair.</li>
            <li> I try to not comb or yank it too much.</li>
            <li> it really cleans the hair and leaves it shiny</li>
            <li> Leaves it clean and not dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they figured out how to make a non-toxic shampoo that replicates a highly toxic one!  </li>
            <li> It has a floral scent, relatively light, but still enough to set off allergies.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The real test though for me was, could this shampoo handle chlorine?  </li>
            <li> for my wife, who has much longer hair than me, she switched to Kiss My Face</li>
            <li> /&gt;The real test though for me was, could this shampoo handle chlorine?  </li>
            <li> for my wife, who has much longer hair than me, she switched to Kiss My Face</li>
            <li> really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, overall it was an okay product, but I think I want to try another natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> And then, about two weeks later, I noticed a fifth benefit, my favorite one by far, when I saw that my forehead was clearing up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different \\&quot;natural shampoos\\</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried handfuls of various shampoos, each time heading more towards natural choices.</li>
            <li> Third, my hair dried and was clean and soft but not stiff or dingy the way it is when I use a pure castile soap and also not too fly away and frizzy like when I use a Paul Mitchell detergent shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other natural products and spent a lot of money trying to find a good natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t stink or leave my hair so matted that I cannot get a brush through it.  </li>
            <li> This is a more expensive but super easy to use alternative.</li>
            <li> My hair is much fuller using this product, and I notice a significant difference in the amount of hair I lose daily.</li>
            <li> Good to add other oils to such as Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce much foam but the necessary amount to get you a clean scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the fact, that the shampoo is organic and not like all the other shampoos that have chemicals and cause itching of the scalp.</li>
            <li> So, if you color your hair, you might want to stick with your normal shampoo!</li>
            <li> It foams nicely, rinsing out easily and there is very little amount needed to shampoo my long 14&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The hair loss is starting to be more apparent.  </li>
            <li> I could cry to long silky and fine.</li>
            <li> It takes about a week to get use to the extra conditioning while still giving you that clean feel.</li>
            <li> and my capillaries are starting to fade such that I don&#x27;t have so many fine red lines on my face upon close inspection.</li>
            <li> The only reason not to give it five stars is that it says one does not need conditioner, and I think that is true if one has straight hair, but as a curly haired girl, I still use a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Clean is the only way to describe the smell.</li>
            <li> I get huge red itchy flaky bumps when using normal shampoo and hairsprays</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, so I was used to using a volumizing shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> Massage it into a later, quickly but gently, with the goal of cleansing your scalp.</li>
            <li> because normal to oily dries my hair out too much.  </li>
            <li> This is the first all natural shampoo I have tried and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> My hair was extremely soft and shiny after the first use.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft and silky, very shiny, I have very way hair and this shampoo makes my hair straight,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tear as easily when dry, now, but it&#x27;s never returned to normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this shampoo does rinse clean, make my hair soft and shiny, last quite a while, and lather really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had tried washing my face more, washing my face less, sleeping on my back to keep my face away from the pillow, not letting my dogs lick my face, what feels like hundreds so is probably more like fifty or sixty different face and hair products and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> my hair combs easily when wet after the shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I have been able to cut the amount of conditioner I use in half.  </li>
            <li> but I have lost enough hair such that I have to wrap my pony tail holder one more time around than I used to.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write my review until after I had used this for a steady 3 months</li>
            <li> My hair does better with a cleansing conditioner that cleans with essential oils only and no soap.</li>
            <li> I used to have the mindset for shampoos that the more expensive the better.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a sulfate-free shampoo that didn&#x27;t have water as the main ingredient.</li>
            <li> and I was able to run a wide tooth comb through it with ease which really surprised me.  </li>
            <li> The Environmental Working Group Skin Deep website rates various cosmetics on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being most toxic.  </li>
            <li> SO far so good only problem is slight static adding a slight poof of body to my hair, but it is November in Myrtle Beach</li>
            <li> I would also highly recommend the Soap Nuts Soap.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This shampoo tended to make my hair a little more ... poofy, but it&#x27;s probably the cleanest rinsing shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before my first wash, I used a clarifying shampoo to remove the silicones from my other shampoo which I gladly have given away and the next day set to using this.</li>
            <li> I do seem to be using a little more of it than I&#x27;d like to (at t his price)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave much of a scent in your hair, but that&#x27;s what a natural shampoo is.</li>
            <li> Wash with the minimum amount of shampoo needed to clean my hair so as to not over dry.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like it so far and plan to skip washing some days when my hair gets equilibrated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really even need to condition afterwards, My hair is soft and workable.</li>
            <li> NaturOil really makes my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> You can see my review for the &#x27;Normal to Oily&#x27; formula here:</li>
            <li> Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Oily Hair</li>
            <li> Is this a normal detox?</li>
            <li> I finally gave up and went back to WEN, and with more hot oil treatments, my hair is massively improved, now.</li>
            <li> My hair has never returned to normal.</li>
            <li> I will only continue to use products that are superior to my usual brands and I expect I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> What I try to do is buy it directly with one of their coupons and that helps with the price plus they usually give samples which is a nice touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though my hair gets oily, I got the normal version because I shampoo</li>
            <li> It was every bit as harsh as most non-organic products.</li>
            <li> and I am always glad to find products that do not contain harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> and I wish they did have a separate conditioner for long, frequently heat- styled hair, but I just ordered their Moroccan oil, so I hope that will help to maintain my ends in combination with another brand&#x27;s light rinse-out conditioner.</li>
            <li> For reference: I&#x27;m a man with normal medium-length hair</li>
            <li> I was slightly skeptical at first about soap nuts but after giving it a try it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> It is normal to see hair strands from time to time, but before I switched from products using harsh detergents I was noticing more hair loss.</li>
            <li> it does the job just as good as the store brand shampoo without all of the unnecessary harmful chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li> And all of our hair is clean soft and conditioned and looks health without being over conditioned or flat or sticky or goopy.</li>
            <li> It lathers up into a rich thick lather and leaves my hair clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This works fine and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as &#x27;stripped&#x27; as it does when I use other sulfate shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have natural &#x27;coily&#x27; hair and was looking for a sulfate free shampoo that didn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> After a week less hair is falling out and no chunks of scalp in my brush.my scalp still itches and needs more time to heal completely.</li>
            <li> I have coarse gray hair and from the very first time of use my hair came out soft and shiny with no yellowing.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil in conditioners left me a mess (causes oil plugs) and detergents over-dried my skin causing runaway oil production in my own oil glands to compensate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update after about a month of using this product, as it&#x27;s hard to give a full fair review after just a few shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, hair if anyone feels that is relevant.</li>
            <li> I have tried other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li> ;) I just thought I would share my results as one has to be really careful when they are using dandruff shampoos but also have to be equally careful that they are not adding more build-up to the scalp that fungus can feed off of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fragrance free due to health issues</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried Ojon, Argan and Jojoba), and my hair still is brittle, breaking, falling out, and super dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is just really sensitive to certain fragrances, chemicals and even oatmeal, which I recently dumped for my wife&#x27;s pure olive oil soap.</li>
            <li> I switched to the shampoo for dry hair, bought the serum (which works great), treat it extra carefully when wet and do weekly hot oil treatments</li>
            <li> I have fine but thick hair so its very finicky and doesn&#x27;t take much to tangle.</li>
            <li> So, I went back to using my wife&#x27;s Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap and after using it for a few months I noticed my skin was not drying out any more.</li>
            <li> (A vented brush without a ton of bristles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this shampoo many ways: lots of shampoo, leaving it on my hair through the shower, very little shampoo, rinsing it out immediately after washing.</li>
            <li> Within the first two weeks I noticed a vast difference and by the end of 3-4 weeks, using both products, all my scalp problems were gone and have remained gone since then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a number of hot oil treatments and been using a deep conditioning shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes my hair feel thicker more manageable and also my hair has no more frizz at all&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The only flip side is my hair tangles a lot easier the first day.</li>
            <li> and now I am aware of the products I use daily.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle after finishing my first in about 3 months.  </li>

            <li> I used a small amount of shampoo and had to add a bit more to get the lather I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I always had really pretty hair until recently.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> My daughter had pretty severe eczema, but I stopped using regular laundry detergent, fabric softener, and shampoo.</li>
            <li> I tried different face wash and face lotion and that helped (organic/natural), but I still had dry skin mostly on my forehead, but around my face in general after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> This is a new product for me also, but so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work right away, but it wasn&#x27;t long that I realized that I didn&#x27;t need a conditional anymore.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and not at all oily or fine after using this shampoo so I may need to add the serum or some argon oil later.  </li>
            <li> My waves weren&#x27;t consistent enough to wear it natural.</li>
            <li> She too has a very sensitive scalp (frequent itchiness) and seems to  have no problems if she sticks to the soap</li>
            <li> And, yet, somehow, this formula is free and clear of all known irritants and allergens, which means it won&#x27;t drip down your forehead causing comedones and ruining your appearance.</li>
            <li> very fine, flat, straight hair and regular shampoos and conditioners seemed to always weigh it down, even ones specifically for volume.  </li>
            <li> For the steep price, I expect it to not be watered down this significantly.  </li>
            <li> I have fine brown hair and it has never been color treated or heavily styled.  </li>
            <li> I started using &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; the first week of</li>
            <li> I dont really understand their classifications of normal to dry or normal to oily.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and began using this as my face wash having used a simple soap for years and found that, after another two weeks, the low level of olive oil in this and the different cleansing agents had pulled the oil to the surface in a series of very mild breakouts</li>
            <li> Overall, though, it does get my scalp and hair clean, and seems to keep it healthier, and that bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It may be a natural soap, but I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s actually stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot use this product daily, though, it strips too much from my hair: I needed extra conditioner and my scalp felt tight the more often I used it.</li>
            <li> Scalp to mid-shaft is fine, but the lower half and ends seems to have been bombed!</li>
            <li> Little to no dandruff left! :)</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this shampoo noting that every shampoo company says their is the best.  </li>
            <li> It cleans deeply but gently, has no scent, and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I had dandruff problems before using this, and since some of the reviews said it helped clear up their scalp, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> My scalp is still itching some, but I expect that to clear up in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have always been sensitive to detergents.  </li>
            <li> But it is much easier to find low toxicity conditioners that work.</li>
            <li> So thus began my quest for a natural cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It is completely natural and that is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> The product is made with all natural ingredients and the company is dedicated to promoting health and well-being instead of image.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft and natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it took my hair nearly a month before completely detoxing.   </li>
            <li> I have also turned my daughter and 5 year old granddaughter on to it</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this shampoo and the bottle has lasted my long hair about two months.</li>
            <li> so I am looking for something natural as I also get color treatments every 12-16 weeks.</li>
            <li> I can wear my hair natural without needing to do anything besides brush it.</li>
            <li> Soap nuts have a natural foam that comes out of them, so that&#x27;s probably what the foam is from.</li>
            <li> The burning feeling has completely stopped.</li>
            <li> Been looking for all natural products to replace those with chemicals throughout my house.  </li>
            <li> so far no problems considering it</li>
            <li> is all natural</li>
            <li> All natural.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a soft almost odor-less smell, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...</li>
            <li> Lately I was thinking of going back to soapnut shampoo and was pleased to find a ready made organic soapnut shampoo.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars instead of one because I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shower nearly as often as I used to.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and it helps with bleached hair.</li>
            <li> When I started using this shampoo there was a considerable decrease in dropping hair.</li>
            <li> and it ends up soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> and it ends up soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I do not need a conditioner after I shampoo with it so far</li>
            <li> and my hair feels soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the difference already, it is keeping my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It immediately made my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> I have always been a natural girl, but have been moving away from chemicals in my household for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> But finally I got up the courage to do it, and that&#x27;s when this product really started to work.</li>
            <li> &quot; and this is the one shampoo I&#x27;ve found that has completely resolved all of my issues.  </li>
            <li> I use organic, natural, fragrance-free beauty products always and pay attention to what the Environmental Working Group says.  </li>
            <li> Lost clumps of hair and hair lost life completely as if I washed it with some detergent....</li>
            <li> All I wanted was an all natural shampoo, which I believe this is.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s probably not just a feeling, since the spots I used to have on my shoulders have completely disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so we are looking for a natural solution.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft with no build up</li>
            <li> I would recommend pairing with an all natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care that some of the ingredients are organic, but I do care they are all completely natural.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants to use an organic product that is earth-friendly...</li>
            <li> I use no conditioner, just this product, and my hair feels so natural and light everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny and thick-  and looks extremely healthy for a 59 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone who is having dry scalp issues or just wants to avoid harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> (no worse than what I was fighting already) and left my pores clean and tight.</li>
            <li> For me a big bonus was there is not a strong smell to it as I am allergic to so many scents used even in natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very clean, but it also feels dry and is extremely tangled.</li>
            <li> but I do roll my hair on large velcro rollers and then flat iron</li>
            <li> the &#x27;Normal to Dry&#x27; formula works really well for</li>
            <li> This was the first natural shampoo that I have used and it was pretty good although for someone like me with wavy, thick, long hair my hair was hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo, received it yesterday, used it this morning and lo and behold, my hair is back to normal!</li>
            <li> At first I didnt like it felt like when I washed my hair that it tangled and felt dry.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get use to since it seems at first that your hair seems dry and tangly</li>
            <li> The key to getting this right is, as with all products, start with less and remember that less usually is more which body care products.</li>
            <li> After the first week I have continued using the Soap Nuts Shampoo daily and then have only been using the Dandrene as maintenance on Wednesday and Sunday nights.</li>
            <li> I only started to use a sulfate-free shampoo recently and tried Wen first.</li>
            <li> Well luckily I looked at reviews for my previous shampoo I&#x27;ve been using for years and someone posted the toxicity rating from this site [...]    </li>
            <li> I stuck with it and held off on the conditioner and by day 5 it seems like my hair must have gone through a detox or something because day 5 brushing seemed much easier than first few days</li>
            <li> While this soap is better, it does dry out my skin a little.</li>
            <li> Just FYI this type of shampoo will not stop male pattern baldness caused by high DHEA.</li>
            <li> Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; at the same time.</li>
            <li> If you want to know the difference between the action of synthetic detergents/ surfactants (&amp;#34;surface active agents&amp;#34;) and natural SOAP (&amp;</li>
            <li> I do not believe I would be getting the same results if I had just used one or the other, as the Dandrene can dry your scalp out more if you are over using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but I&#x27;ve noticed that foaming action from chemicals \\&quot;looks\\&quot; different than foaming action created from naturally occurring ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Plus, even though I continue to blow- out straight all the time, my natural wavy/curl texture has come back after using it for a short period.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle for my very picky, (and whiny about giving up her products) daughter to try on her long color treated hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just careful the first time I comb through it</li>
            <li> I always had very dry scalp that itched constantly and was red pretty much all the time.</li>
            <li> I have the challenge of getting my scalp clean without drying my ends out by excessive exposure to shampoo, and also that will allow my hair to have natural</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair and could never go a day without washing it because it would get too oily.</li>
            <li> It is thick and dilutes well, I feel it is a good value for how little I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; every day and only use the  &amp;#34;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; every Wednesday and now Saturday nights rather than on Sunday&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a conditioner that was very moisturizing to the dry ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> whole family has since switched to Carina Organics Uncented Nature&#x27;s Blends Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and Nature&#x27;s Blends Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Basically, commercial shampoos strip away your natural oils, so when you stop using them, your hair overproduces your natural oils.</li>
            <li> and my hair is so shiny and not dry and soft and not falling out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m usually a &amp;#34;rinse maniac&amp;#34; and I spend a long time scrubbing under running water to make sure I got rid of all the soap.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the lack of added fragrance, as I am very sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders Moisturizing somewhat stopped the itching, but not the flaking, which was a major source of embarrassment.</li>
            <li> (guessing sulfate allergy if not other ingredients also).  </li>
            <li> but I have no other option.  </li>
            <li> I dyed my hair for years and lived through about 20 years of perms to make my hair look full and thick, which it isn&#x27;t, so to make up for years of damage, it made sense to find something that would gently cleanse my hair without damaging it further.  </li>
            <li> I find that, though I am using this as a shampoo, it is a very effective facial cleanser and, on the occasion that my tantrum-prone crazy skin acts up, it lends itself to blending.</li>
            <li> I found their hand and body soaps, facial creams and other body care to be unusable, including their normal to oily version of this very shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In comparison, most shampoo/conditioner brands advertised on television seem to score about 4 or 5 (moderately toxic) on EWG&#x27;s scale because they contain fragrances that can cause allergies and various chemicals that are hard to pronounce like Methylchloroisothiazolinone or DMDM Hydantoin, and of course</li>
            <li> It is nice and squeaky clean and a subtle shine, but it looks out of control !!!!  </li>
            <li> I am surprised how clean it keeps the hair for such a plain simple shampoo.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back to my old Matrix shampoo and my scalp is at least free form itching.</li>
            <li> far the results are the same.</li>
            <li> But it also Doesn&#x27;t make natural blonde hair darker either.</li>
            <li> NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo is terrific!</li>
            <li> I use a deep conditioner about once a month, and my hair is always soft.    </li>
            <li> I only wash my hair a couple of times a week but condition nearly every day.</li>
            <li> I use it if I want extra soft hair.</li>
            <li> My hair air dries so soft, bouncy and shiny, though I can say that it&#x27;s definitely not helping with hair loss.  </li>
            <li> My hair air dries so soft, bouncy and shiny, though I can say that it&#x27;s definitely not helping with hair loss.  </li>
            <li> and it actually felt soft.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s literally the only natural shampoo that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> and I decided I needed to go natural to get the shine and beauty back to my hair.</li>
            <li> Over the past two years I have done much damage by bleaching and coloring and of course hot flat irons and blow drying.</li>
            <li> To me there is dry, normal or oily.</li>
            <li> Even though my hair and scalp tend to be oily, but the NaturOli shampoo for \\&quot;Normal to Dry</li>
            <li> I normally let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I normally let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> As I don&#x27;t have any medical condition that can contribute to hair loss, and considering the hair loss stopped when I switched shampoo, it is reasonable to conclude that this shampoo made me loose my hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately that is largely because there is a huge industry wrecking us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other shampoo products, but I feel that the NaturOli shampoo really did the trick.</li>
            <li> I would use it every other day, but even after one day washing, my hair gets very oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and all the other products made by this manufacturer, you can really see the results literally with each passing day it is used.</li>
            <li> If your hair is still oily, use a little more and work it on the hair a few moments longer.</li>
            <li> The formula used to be a thick, rich formula.   </li>
            <li> Although the bottle states no conditioner needed, we do because the 8 yr old has middle of the back length hair.</li>
            <li> Since switching to this shampoo my face does not dry out anywhere close to how it used to.  </li>
            <li> However combing through my hair when it was wet was pretty tough as it seemed too squeaky clean if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> tend to have oily hair and after a day of not washing I get flaky and itchy - with most any other shampoo - expensive and not expensive.</li>
            <li> It took a little time to work the lather into my hair, but it was not difficult.</li>
            <li> I have one pimple right now, small, barely visible, instead of too manyto count.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my NaturOli Soap Nut/Soapberry Shampoo for normal to dry hair last night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to decrease the amount of random chemicals and things that I use in my everyday life, and I am happy to find a shampoo with low toxicity.  </li>
            <li> Also, if it helps any, I have red, course hair that is curly and frizzy in some areas and completely straight in other areas.  </li>
            <li> : I have extremely long hair that&#x27;s not real thick and dyed.  </li>
            <li> Then add a small amount (dime sized for shorter hair and a quarter at most for longer hair, unless it is halfway down your back) to your palm.</li>
            <li> Have tried many other shampoos with very little results!</li>
            <li> Once hair is rinsed, it won&#x27;t be dry unless you left the shampoo on too long or used too much.</li>
            <li> Using it daily will make your hair oily, not dry!</li>
            <li> Normal to Dry formula uses a soap nut powder base (where nut is a misleading term because soap nuts are actually berries) and an olive oil castile soap alongside a lathering cleanser (lauryl glucoside) which is very mild and light.</li>
            <li> And because my hair is not dry and tangled after shampooing, I only use a leave in conditioner for styling.</li>
            <li> I really love that this shampoo is free of all the bad stuff in conventional shampoos.</li>
            <li> A little organic pure cocoa butter, shea butter or coconut oil works too.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of regular shampoo but what always ends up happening is my hair becomes weighed down, oily and dull looking.</li>
            <li> The detox phase happens because your hair became accustomed to being scrubbed clean and dried out due to commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li> I personally just let my hair dry naturally and then comb it out later because it is easier that way</li>
            <li> If that becomes much of a problem there are simple solutions, like mixing up a little coconut oil and ginger to rub into your scalp, or running your hands through your hair after you put on a tiny bit of hand cream.  </li>
            <li> Anytime someone switches from typical shampoo to chemical free or completely raw and organic methods of cleansing their hair, you have to understand the detox period.  </li>
            <li> I read almost all the reviews good and bad about this product and decided to take the plunge and purchase.  </li>
            <li> I used conditioner with it for the first few months because I could not imagine washing my hair and not using conditioner, as I have long, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> When I started using this shampoo, I started to loose hair...not in clumps like some of the other reviewers mentioned, but I was definitely loosing an increased amount of strands per day compared with what I would consider normal daily strand loss.  </li>
            <li> I always allow my hair to dry naturally and was very pleasantly surprised to see my hair fall in ringlets rather than a frizzy mess</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no scent left behind, and she still gets clean.  </li>
            <li> After the first (and only) time I used it, I had the tangled, matted mess that other reviewers have mentioned, so I used a microscopic-sized bit of conditioner to get a comb through my hair.  </li>
            <li> Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Dry Hair - \\&quot;EXTREME</li>
            <li> It gets my hair super clean and doesn&#x27;t leave build up chemicals that weigh my hair down and make it feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m,also using it on face and ears in the shower, seems to clean skin well without irritating skin.</li>
            <li> but if you do not have long hair it will last you for several months.</li>
            <li> I also have oily skin which weighs down my thin head of hair and makes it look greasy if I go more than a couple days without washing</li>
            <li> shampoo does not leave any kind of weird film on my hair, doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last year I decided to look for a new shampoo without all the harsh chemicals and found this.</li>
            <li> Need very little and it lathers up very well!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I can add a drop of olive oil to my extra dry winter skin and a drop of a simple detergent cleanser when I&#x27;ve exercised into oily nightmare world.</li>
            <li> My Hair: Overly-long, deeply layered, fluffy waves, 10% gray, prone to frizz and VERY sensitive to protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I visited a curly hair salon, ready to get my hair cut shorter, but the hair stylist said the excessive tangling sounded like a product problem.  </li>
            <li> but then a whole head of frizz is not appealing either.</li>
            <li> I will never look back and never try anything again as long as these type of results continue.</li>
            <li> and we all know the damage a flat iron does</li>
            <li> My hair was slightly naturally wavy before, but it always seemed weighed down.</li>
            <li> is the only one I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t dry it...</li>
            <li> (most..) make my hair feel  dirty the next</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it makes my hair dry</li>
            <li> I can see that this product contains as limited chemicals as possible.</li>
            <li> My hair, though thin and fine due to cancer feels fluffier and appears fuller.</li>
            <li> My hair softened as it dried (naturally) and miracle of miracles, it has body!  </li>
            <li> I believe there are many people here who this shampoo worked wonders for, but I think that for long, thick, coarse hair, it&#x27;s not a good match.</li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid neuro-toxins as much as possible due to family medical history of Alzheimer&#x27;s and brain cancer.</li>
            <li> I started washing with water only every other day and using this only on alternating days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While my hair felt much lighter than before, if I hadn&#x27;t read other Amazon reviews I would have given up after a few days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While my hair felt much lighter than before, if I hadn&#x27;t read other Amazon reviews I would have given up after a few days.  </li>
            <li> I had just moved into a place that has hard water, with apparently a very high iron content.</li>
            <li> Her hair is fine and down past her shoulders, my hair is a little thicker/wavier and about to my ears.  </li>
            <li> I either got a bad batch, or they are starting to water down the formula pretty significantly.  </li>
            <li> this stuff seems to work well, doesn&#x27;t have a crazy smell like most shampoo</li>
            <li> I made this decision after carefully reviewing products as found on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database found at http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/browse.php?atatime&#x3D;50&amp;category&#x3D;shampoo&amp;order&#x3D;webscore_INC&amp;&amp;showmore&#x3D;products&amp;start&#x3D;0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> It is so soft that I am having trouble keeping my hands out of it.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this as long as they&#x27;re selling it</li>
            <li> I have lost so much hair in the past 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> This time it is a mixture of white, blond, and a few strands of my natural brown (which are increasing due to changes in diet/lifestyle).</li>
            <li> I have dry, long hair.</li>
            <li> However, like most natural companies, they make liberal use of allergens like lavender and chamomile as well as, tragically, limonene, which is a known irritant, rosemary (another irritant), horsetail (yup), random essential oils (fragrance, which is extremely irritating to skin) as well as some tree nuts like shea and coconut, all of which spell disaster for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This shampoo also lasts a while for the price, compared to other low toxicity shampoos.</li>
            <li> I went from healthy, luscious hair to sad straw hair!</li>
            <li> Sadly this shampoo does not deliver despite its gold cap lid and environmentally friendly claims.</li>
            <li> it does not change my colored hair any faster than any other shampoo including those specific for color treated hair</li>
            <li> When I was considering buying this beause of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s low toxicity rating, I read reviews tangled hair after using it until the other junk had been washed out of their hair.</li>
            <li> but once you comb your wet hair you will notice that it really isn&#x27;t that hard to comb thru.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> After switching to this shampoo, my hair doesn&#x27;t get as knotty, tangled or dry as it used to</li>
            <li> yet I have dry ends</li>
            <li> I would blow dry it straighter.</li>
            <li> I wait till my hair is almost dry and then comb through.  </li>
            <li> Since excess sebum happens from over drying your scalp it would make sense to use a shampoo for dry hair</li>
            <li> the shampoo leaves my hair dry and tangled.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also so brittle and dry now :</li>
            <li> Once dry it was frizzy and damaged looking.</li>
            <li> My son and I have dry scalps</li>
            <li> The shampoo made my hair extremely dry and irritated my scalp</li>
            <li> and it was too dry and wiry</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair and</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s wet, it still mats up like a hunk of wet straw, in a giant, unmovable mass.</li>
            <li> The only improvement would be a fragrance, which I can add by adding a few drops of essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and slightly wavy, something that hadn&#x27;t ever occurred when it was weighed down with product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this shampoo since it was all natural and didn&#x27;t have the bad chemicals,etc.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll get this again anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Overall, an overpriced, below average product.</li>
            <li> My hair length is about halfway down my back.</li>
            <li> I would say it goes about halfway down my back.  </li>
            <li> My hair was totally unmanageable and matted down after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a high lathering shampoo, which doesn&#x27;t bother me; just an f.y.i.</li>
            <li> but my scalp was still getting SO DRY and ITCHY!</li>
            <li> I know some people on the comments section mentioned I should have watered it down, but really, it&#x27;s too late now, and it was no where in the instructions that I would need to do that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dry now.</li>
            <li> My scalp was very dry with crusty patches throughout my scalp.</li>
            <li> A few of the negative reviews worried me as I have long hair that is very curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, I noticed a fourth benefit, my hair was getting dry</li>
            <li> In my experience using it for a few weeks, it can tend to dry your hair a bit, so I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with those who say you don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner with it.  </li>
            <li> These kinds of products are very hard to find, as I find products labeled hypo allergenic and baby products to be very offensive and triggers of asthma attacks.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to leave it a little tangled, especially since conditioner is not required.</li>
            <li> Actually feels a little softer.  </li>
            <li> Coincidentally, I had a little left on my hand after a shower one day and ran it through my hair as I was drying it.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair that gets very dry.</li>
            <li> doesnt dry out (like other shampoos just bleach and leave nothing on hair, cause hair breakage</li>
            <li> I purchased the NaturOli Shampoo Extreme Nut for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said it&#x27;s an expensive shampoo considering how much the actual cost of ingredients is.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to wash my hair up to three times to finally get the lather I am looking for when washing my hair.</li>
            <li> and then I have absolutely no snarls.</li>
            <li> So be careful.</li>
            <li> (Yes, I know you&#x27;re not supposed to brush wet hair</li>
            <li> I never really used products in my hair, so I don&#x27;t use them now.</li>
            <li> so I am thinking to buy some essentially oils and put a few drops in....</li>
            <li> I like to comb through with a wide toothed comb rather than trying to work the lather into the hair because it distributes evenly, coats, and makes rinsing easier.</li>
            <li> My brush is empty.</li>
            <li> Too pricey, but it did last about a few months.</li>
            <li> I think people feel like they&#x27;re losing hair because I notice when my hair is wet</li>
            <li> So when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> You do need quite a bit of it though, hair doesn&#x27;t feel silky while its wet</li>
            <li> I never really by exspensive stuff for my hair because I&#x27;ve never had to.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather which is expected since it&#x27;s botanical.</li>
            <li> My hair would mat up when wet</li>
            <li> but given the subsequent time and money savings - using less conditioner, easier to wash/style due to fewer tangles/knots, having to color less frequently - I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Second, there was no itching, tightness, watering of my eyes five minutes after the hair has been rinsed clean, or any unpleasant odor or sneezing due to allergenic fragrances.</li>
            <li> I hate strong artificial scents but this smelled pretty natural although there is definitely a scent.</li>
            <li> The first days were a bit weird, since it would make my hair &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; together while I was washing it (although it went away as soon as I got dry) but this feeling disappeared after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottles are smaller and cost the same but holy crap its worth it!</li>
            <li> It does get a little getting used to the first few washes because my hair was really hard to brush through afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use this for shampoo, obviously, but also as a face wash for horrific acne which I am pleased to write is barely noticeable at this point.</li>
            <li> It was harder to brush my hair when getting out of the shower due to tangles</li>
            <li> It was harder to brush my hair when getting out of the shower due to tangles</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin and short hair, the rest of the family ranges from so thick</li>
            <li> I made it through half a bottle for dry hair, which took 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this shampoo to be my go-to shampoo, but it really didn&#x27;t work well for me :(</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m Asian and each strand of my black hair is thick individually which helps me look like I have fuller hair than reality.  </li>
            <li> I thought at first that maybe it was just removing dead or unhealthy hair</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Just a little pricey for 16 ounces, I have long hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cold, dry winter in the desert where I live, which might be part of the reason why I miss my old conditioner a little.  </li>
            <li> that does not leave my skin flaky and itchy like all the other soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li> - \\&quot;EXTREME</li>
            <li> All the other brands I&#x27;ve tried leave my hair looking and feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was way too expensive for a shampoo</li>
            <li> Although I adore this shampoo I have a few minor gripes that I just want to air.     </li>
            <li> me,  any time I&#x27;ve used other brands  of shampoo,  </li>
            <li> Other shampoos-  </li>
            <li> The other reason why I follow with conditioner is that my hair will tangle up.</li>
            <li> I even tried a small amount in my palm and using fingertips to work it into my scalp alone, so that only rinsing it out would let it touch my hair.</li>
            <li> for other buyers.</li>
            <li> It said for optimal results use every other day</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence due to price, don&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> I bought mine in January, and I use about a penny sized amount every day (sometimes every other).</li>
            <li> I was having scalp burning from other products with added chemicals.</li>
            <li> Must have been something in the other brands of shampoo I was using that caused my problem (which I suspected).    </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> You may be wondering &amp;#34;why on and off?&amp;#34; well it is due to the price not the product itself.</li>
            <li> ( that I have not had for years using other shampoos).</li>
            <li> So, you can read any of the other reviews in order to get an idea of this as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> The slipperiness from other shampoos and conditioners seem to make it easier for my hair to \\&quot;slip\\&quot; off my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The slipperiness from other shampoos and conditioners seem to make it easier for my hair to \\&quot;slip\\&quot; off my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Contacted NaturOil again about the problem and told them that my hair is not permed or colored and that I do not use any other products on my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how it creates volume or shine or any of that other stuff girls like shampoos to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 16 oz bottle of NaturOli shampoo lasted me four months when using a generous amount every other day.  </li>
            <li> But, it is VERY minimal.</li>
            <li> For the reference, my hair is not colored with an exception of very minimal ombre highlights, wavy, shoulder-length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had less hair loss and less dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I did not experience that sticky dry mess that others have complained about.  </li>
            <li> Ok, for the first week I thought it would be another one of those shampoos that I would still have to condition like crazy afterwards just to get a brush through it, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is wishing it was too costly for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> Every shampoo that I have made and other supposedly \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos, either because of the amounts and types of ingredients or my hard water, left my hair tangled, straw like, crunchy, or greasy looking.</li>
            <li> The problem with that was I had to make the mixture each time I washed my hair, as raw honey will ferment after just a little while when mixed with water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bitter over this.</li>
            <li> I apply a little bit of leave in hair oil to the wet hair.</li>
            <li> You will notice the shampoo lather is making its way down your hair shafts but at the end,you can work it over your hair for a few moments (no more than ten seconds of actively working it through the hair).</li>
            <li> only complaint is the price.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to find this product but a little disappointed with performance.</li>
            <li> Immediately, I found my hair softening and moistening (sorry) back up into the well conditioned shine I had enjoyed with my dirty shampoos (but without the cancer causing ingredients).</li>
            <li> have long (mid-back), thin though coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> For me, it is NOT worth the price, because I still have to use the conditioners I am using now.</li>
            <li> reason I bought this shampoo is that it is the least toxic stuff I could find that actually cleans hair and rinses well.  </li>
            <li> I expected it would prevent my hair from falling so heavily.</li>
            <li> I threw most of it away, and hate that I&#x27;m out the $.</li>
            <li> (I have thick hair that goes mid-way down my back.)</li>
            <li> There are some tangles, but I had less hair loss today than with previous shampoos when I combed through (even though I was using conditioner with the other shampoos.)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong shampoo, Normal to Dry Hair, I should have ordered Normal to Oily hair.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dried, it was greasy in some parts and frizzy and unruly in other parts.</li>
            <li> I live in an area with hard water and was having serious problems with an itchy, flaking scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on three and a half years now of using this product.  </li>
            <li> Took care of slight dandruff that I had when I previously used a store-bought shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to foam like a store bought shampoo, but if you rub it in for a while, it does slightly foam.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Suave Clarifying Shampoo previously, so I think I didn&#x27;t have a lot of detoxing to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shedding less.  </li>
            <li> Now that thought seems silly because it left my hair so dry that I couldn&#x27;t even brush it while it was wet.</li>
            <li> So I decided to add some to the shampoo, about half a tablespoon to the bottle, and now every time I wash my hair, I feel as though I&#x27;m conditioning it.  </li>
            <li> and I use A LOT less</li>
            <li> Even though it is not a volumizing product, my natural bounce, and shine, too, seems to be back, in place of artificial, ruffled-cuticle volume, and silicone- enhanced</li>
            <li> It does have a slight non offensive nut fragrance, but since it&#x27;s natural and not a commercial artificial fragrance, it has not exacerbate my allergies, asthma, or COPD.  </li>
            <li> I also think it will help me grow it longer as there is less breakage and fewer split ends.  </li>
            <li> She lasted less than a week with the product and switched to something else.  </li>
            <li> I was seriously considering cutting my fine hair in a spike cut.</li>
            <li> I have very low blood pressure; I sometimes get faint or lose my vision for a few seconds if I get up too quickly from sitting/lying down and my hands and feet are always icy cold.  </li>
            <li> I have very low blood pressure; I sometimes get faint or lose my vision for a few seconds if I get up too quickly from sitting/lying down and my hands and feet are always icy cold.  </li>
            <li> but after trying it alone, I was sad to find that it stripped my hair of the natural oils just like other shampoos.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry hair, add a bit of olive oil (a small amount) or work olive oil into the strands of your hair before washing (leaving it on for a few minutes).</li>
            <li> I tried using it two days in a row and my hair looked dull and dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely try this shampoo especially if you have hard water challenges like I do!</li>
            <li> I thought at first it was just the &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34; period of the product that they advertise - however, after using it longer it just was worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> It seems to dry my hair out a bit, but is slowly helping my eczema on my scalp.</li>
            <li> and it was so expensive -- and to be blunt, the packaging wasn&#x27;t very professional.</li>
            <li> I have never had problems with tangles etc, but my scalp does tend to be a little on the greasy side</li>
            <li> Just a little creates lots of suds.</li>
            <li> and now I just get a little bit.  </li>
            <li> (just a little)</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> After a little online research, I found NaturOli shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s fragrance-free, it has a slight, almost plasticky scent but luckily, it&#x27;s not strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gone down in prince as well!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and start reading up on the ingredients and chemicals in your everyday foods and products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve stopped using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The flaking decreased substantially, but not completely--so I began to use an apple cider vinegar rinse daily, and that, in combination with this shampoo, solved my problem.     </li>
            <li> After having an allergic reaction to a few name brand shampoos, a friend of mine recommended NaturOli soapnuts shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals, but this does create some of the downsides below...</li>
            <li> I quit using it for awhile thinking I was needing to space out time between using my green tea shampoo and this one thinking the two</li>
            <li> My hair feels smoother and healthier after using his shampoo for few weeks.</li>
            <li> A few things to note:  1)</li>
            <li> My hair has been turning gray for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with the cost, but it does last me about 3 months, so I can justify it.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dried out and damaged by the sun and overstyling with heat irons and blow drying.</li>
            <li> I used this one time without any followup conditioner or serum, went ahead and blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> I tried a shower water filter, but that only seemed to make it worse.</li>
            <li> You can go a few days in between washing your hair with this stuff.</li>
            <li> After telling her about this product, she immediately told me it was stripping the color from my hair, and that it&#x27;s just too harsh for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am not a huge name product fan.</li>
            <li> Other unscented ones hardly lather.  </li>
            <li> While it cleans my hair quite well, it doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp well and nothing is worse than dirty smelly head.</li>
            <li> Definitely not easy to brush through afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to deal with that weird feeling for at least a week before the oils on my scalp adjust and start producing a normal level of sebum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It would just eventually get dirty, but it never forced sebum production like this does.</li>
            <li> For the shampoo, a 1 to 3 mixture of raw organic honey and water was the winner.  </li>
            <li> I have thick black hair.</li>
            <li> It does seem to me that I have at least 33% less hair on the floor after my shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Very little lather, wasn&#x27;t used to that&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really think of bad things for this</li>
            <li> It did work, but no more so than the olive oil soap I have resorted to.</li>
            <li> shampoo is expensive, but I find that a bottle will last me about 2 months, washing my hair about 5 times a week.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy, difficult hair (mixed race).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, I&#x27;m a lurker not a joiner.</li>
            <li> Naturally I was afraid of the \\&quot;nuts\\&quot; aspects just because I&#x27;d had a nut allergy in the past.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works as a shampoo, sure, but who cares if you have horrible acne.</li>
            <li> Then, after no more than two minutes from the application of shampoo, rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m no longer using a conditioner and this shampoo isn&#x27;t slick and slippery.  </li>
            <li> I put a small amount in a travel size bottle then dilute it with some water then use that mixture to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> and then I style as usual.</li>
            <li> By thin, I mean that I sadly don&#x27;t have much hair on my head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very common way of washing hair in my country(India)mixed with two other herbs (Amla &amp; Shikakai).</li>
            <li> (which did not mean the shampoo is bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not sure I can recommend this, at least not to those who have a tendency to get frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually post a negative review, but this did not work well AT ALL for my longer curly hair.  </li>
            <li> In the past couple of months I always wear my hair back because it looks so bad down even after washing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> I also figure if I&#x27;m shampooing my hair every day, I don&#x27;t need to hardly use any.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and used all kinds of organic and expensive products and after blow drying my hair still was straw-like.  </li>
            <li> The synthetics, even those considered &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; and derived from &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sources are dangerous chemicals that contribute enormously to skin problems, allergies,  development of asthma and environmental damage.  </li>
            <li> It seems like every natural shampoo i try, leaves me with a horribly itchy red scalp.</li>
            <li> Its ashame when it comes to what americans eat and the use of everyday products, the dangers or unhealthy chemicals that are in them.  </li>
            <li> The build-up on my scalp was thick and you could feel the scabs and ridges as you rubbed across my scalp.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have thick, shoulder length, color treated hair, that I thought was somewhat oily, but</li>
            <li> My hair is not chemically treated, but is thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair which has the tendency to get frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It is a thick formula.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m too slow and often hit one-thirty.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy-to-straight hair.</li>
            <li> All that has cleared up slowly by using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just because a person tends on the oily side day to day doesnt mean we want all of the moisture sucked from our scalp.</li>
            <li> I read every review I could find, both on Amazon and other sources, and I was still skeptical.  </li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have said, there is an adjustment period; my hair was difficult to comb through (I opted not to continue with a chemical conditioner after switching).  </li>
            <li> so the weather is cold hot cold hot/</li>
            <li> I wondered why my thick shiny hair was getting thin and dull.</li>
            <li> read some of the negative reviews on this product, and some of them also had the same experience of bad hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to be patient with the detox, but my hair is now seriously damaged</li>
            <li> But for me, it seriously and permanently damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> instead now use a shampoo from Burts Bees, it&#x27;s probably not perfect in terms of ingredients - but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair any oily mess like this did.</li>
            <li> After living in a house with whole house water purification and water softener, I was shocked when my hair started getting gummy feeling after I washed it!</li>
            <li> Although it is extremely expensive, I stopped losing hair and when I dried it, it was fuller.  </li>
            <li> no good for health</li>
            <li> few months ago, in a random train of thought, I realized that since I&#x27;m allergic to sulfites in foods (I get itchy and sneezy, throat swells up, need to take Benadryl), maybe that means my body doesn&#x27;t respond well to sulfates either.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product with lot of hopes but it left me disappointed.</li>
            <li> The only ingredient worries me is Lauryl Glucoside :(</li>
            <li> I used a clarifying shampoo and followed through with the detox but even after three weeks, all my hair felt was weighed down and dirty.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair a TANGLED crazy mess</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find a non-high-chemical shampoo that also rinses out well.  </li>
            <li> if it in fact makes a person worse off.</li>
            <li> and it has really decreased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since read that poor blood circulation can lead to poor growth and hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since read that poor blood circulation can lead to poor growth and hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have oily, thin (and thinning hair).</li>
            <li> It made everything worse.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of the fight.</li>
            <li> After rinsing my hair, I was disappointed that it had that icky crunchy and slightly tangled feeling again.  </li>
            <li> I suppose that is the scent of the natural soap nuts, and it isn&#x27;t awful, but not great either.</li>
            <li> I was near tears with how awful my hair was in this water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Then when my hair dried, I realized it smelled just plain awful.  </li>
            <li> but it was bad and has been that way for the past 18 years, probably longer.</li>
            <li> and I will give the seller benefit of the doubt they are not lying and pushing a bad batch of this stuff on the unsuspecting folks just wanting to use less artificial chemicals on their bodies.</li>
            <li> I might just choose the wrong one for my problem.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;Might be a tad bit expensive</li>
            <li> They are a bit tedious to use and needs practice to figure out how to work it.</li>
            <li> I hate to waste - I wonder if I could use it on my dog???</li>
            <li> I myself think it is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> it is too expensive to be used that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (although this leaves a weird film on my hair)</li>
            <li> Sad to say, I&#x27;ll have to return it and continue the search.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a very subtle smell to it, and it&#x27;s nothing at all unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> With Soap Nuts I can go for three or four days without my hair feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> and I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> I should have known not to buy it since they don&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;satisfaction guaranteed&amp;#34; clause or allow returns for unhappy purchasers.  </li>
            <li> But, NaturOil stopped shipping the bottle with a dispenser cap, which makes it very difficult to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about not using a conditioner</li>
            <li> (so bad I need it cut),</li>
            <li> Maybe if you start with a really bad one, this is a step up.</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly for this to be my IT shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it was so bad.  </li>
            <li> But, I was disappointed with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used soap nuts to make mine, but I didn&#x27;t like the results, and it was annoying to keep my shampoo as ice cubes in the freezer.</li>
            <li> hope we are not so idiots to believe those ads.</li>
            <li> I think this product is awful</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo ever!!!</li>
            <li> and you could see my scalp which was devastating.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is the most natural shampoo I can find. I am genuinely pleased by the results of this shampoo. This is also a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> I ditched the toxic stuff when I noticed non-male pattern hair thinning. I also have always been sensitive to detergents.  My scalp stopped itching after a month and my hair thickened up over 6 months. Just FYI this type of shampoo will not stop male pattern baldness caused by high DHEA. If you have hair thinning sue to sensitivity to detergents this should help!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have a lot of allergies and problems with most shampoos; not this one. This is great for scalp issues, too.</li>
            <li> Because I dye my hair it&#x27;s kind of dry. This shampoo tended to make my hair a little more ... poofy, but it&#x27;s probably the cleanest rinsing shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Luxurious--works as promised. I especially appreciate the lack of added fragrance, as I am very sensitive to fragrances. Good product!</li>
            <li> This was the first natural shampoo that I have used and it was pretty good although for someone like me with wavy, thick, long hair my hair was hard to manage. I tried to find a conditioner to use with this product, but each one I tried they would either leave my hair tangled or super oily. Also, when rinsing the product from my hair it would feel like my hair had been gelled together regardless of what temperature I had rinsed it out in. So, overall it was an okay product, but I think I want to try another natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had read all those positive reviews and decided to buy the product. I expected it would prevent my hair from falling so heavily. But I see no progress after using the shampoo for months. I might just choose the wrong one for my problem.</li>
            <li> JULY 2, 2013:  I have fine brown hair and it has never been color treated or heavily styled.  I have never had problems with tangles etc, but my scalp does tend to be a little on the greasy side and I need to wash my hair every day.  I really wanted to like this product - it smells nice and feels good when you are applying it.  It also lathers nicely.  When I started using this shampoo, I started to loose hair...not in clumps like some of the other reviewers mentioned, but I was definitely loosing an increased amount of strands per day compared with what I would consider normal daily strand loss.  I thought at first that maybe it was just removing dead or unhealthy hair so I continued to use it to see what happened as I was not loosing a significant amount of hair.  I am now on week number 4 and I continue to lose hair.  The hair loss is starting to be more apparent.  I do not have bald patches and my fiance does not notice a difference in the amount of hair I have (...he is not the type of guy who notices hair changes though...) but I have lost enough hair such that I have to wrap my pony tail holder one more time around than I used to.  Also, my hair becomes tangled as I rinse out the shampoo and, even with conditioner, I get knots.  I am stopping using this product and I will not purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JULY 17, 2013:  I have since switched shampoo and within 5 days of switching I stopped loosing a significant amount of hair strands.  I am now back to almost \\&quot;normal\\&quot; daily strand loss.  As I don&#x27;t have any medical condition that can contribute to hair loss, and considering the hair loss stopped when I switched shampoo, it is reasonable to conclude that this shampoo made me loose my hair.  Also, the softness and shine of my hair is returning as well; it still becomes tangled but not nearly as bad as when I was using this shampoo.  I recommend you avoid this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever found. My head has finally stopped itching. Seems I have been allergic to some of the chemicals in regular store-bought shampoos for years.</li>
            <li> I found my shampoo that tames my hair. Thank You :-))</li>
            <li> I have tried other sulfate free shampoos. This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause frizz to my hair.</li>
            <li> A MUST BUY!!  Its all natural and is just a great shampoo. No need to use conditioner with this.. If you use conditioner it just puts chemicals back into your hair.  I hope the best for this company and hope to see them grow.  More companies need to be more like NaturOli!  Its ashame when it comes to what americans eat and the use of everyday products, the dangers or unhealthy chemicals that are in them.  I&#x27;m happy to see there is still some good and caring companies out there.  Another shampoo and products you might want to check out is Kiss My Face. You can also find on amazon.   Buy this shampoo now!  Do yourself a favor and start reading up on the ingredients and chemicals in your everyday foods and products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write my review until after I had used this for a steady 3 months so I could be fair with the results. I started using &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; the first week of May. I also began using &amp;#34;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; at the same time. For the first week, I followed the directions for the Soap Nut Shampoo and then followed with the Dandrene. I did this for 7 days using both. After the first week I have continued using the Soap Nuts Shampoo daily and then have only been using the Dandrene as maintenance on Wednesday and Sunday nights. Within the first two weeks I noticed a vast difference and by the end of 3-4 weeks, using both products, all my scalp problems were gone and have remained gone since then. I always had very dry scalp that itched constantly and was red pretty much all the time. The build-up on my scalp was thick and you could feel the scabs and ridges as you rubbed across my scalp. I forget the actual medical condition I had but it was bad and has been that way for the past 18 years, probably longer. I have tried every store brand I could get my hands on and started using products found at Trader Joe&#x27;s (Jason&#x27;s, Tea Tree Oil and Citrus Shampoos) all of which caused even more irritation, until I discovered both the Soap Nuts and Dandrene shampoos. I will never look back and never try anything again as long as these type of results continue. I do not believe I would be getting the same results if I had just used one or the other, as the Dandrene can dry your scalp out more if you are over using it. So coupling it with the Soap Nuts shampoo has really worked well for me. The only itch I have now is sweat from throughout the day, but by the time I wash my scalp at night I finally have relief again. Now if only I can find something to stop me from sweating? &amp;#34;) I just thought I would share my results as one has to be really careful when they are using dandruff shampoos but also have to be equally careful that they are not adding more build-up to the scalp that fungus can feed off of. I would also highly recommend the Soap Nuts Soap. All soaps I have tried really eat up my skin and dry it out good. My skin is just really sensitive to certain fragrances, chemicals and even oatmeal, which I recently dumped for my wife&#x27;s pure olive oil soap. While this soap is better, it does dry out my skin a little. I cannot wait to try the soap Nuts Soap to see how this works. I hope this review helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE as of 05/25/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the results are the same. I have not had one flake of dandruff for over a year and not one scab on my head. I still wash the same way. I use the &amp;#34;NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Normal to Dry Hair&amp;#34; every day and only use the  &amp;#34;D.S. Laboratories Dandrene High Performance Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; every Wednesday and now Saturday nights rather than on Sunday&#x27;s. I love both of these shampoos. I also have finally settled on a good soap too, that does not leave my skin flaky and itchy like all the other soaps I have tried. After trying the Soap Nuts Soap I was not all that impressed for the price. It did work, but no more so than the olive oil soap I have resorted to. So, I went back to using my wife&#x27;s Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap and after using it for a few months I noticed my skin was not drying out any more. I now use this soap only and it seems to be working quite well with no skin irritation after using the soap. Again, I hope my brief comments are of use to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE as of 11/15/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whole family has since switched to Carina Organics Uncented Nature&#x27;s Blends Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and Nature&#x27;s Blends Deep Conditioner. I made this decision after carefully reviewing products as found on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database found at http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/browse.php?atatime&#x3D;50&amp;category&#x3D;shampoo&amp;order&#x3D;webscore_INC&amp;&amp;showmore&#x3D;products&amp;start&#x3D;0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of 09/21/2015, we are still using Carina Organics and lovin&#x27; it. This works great on all hair types.</li>
            <li> You can see my review for the &#x27;Normal to Oily&#x27; formula here: [[ASIN:B003P7VX24 NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! - Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Oily Hair - \\&quot;EXTREME Hair\\&quot; - Unscented - 16oz. Made with USDA CERTIFIED ORGANIC Soap Nuts / Soap Berries!]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, by far, the best natural shampoo I have tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of them. For reference, I have thick, shoulder length, color treated hair, that I thought was somewhat oily, but the &#x27;Normal to Dry&#x27; formula works really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is expensive, but I find that a bottle will last me about 2 months, washing my hair about 5 times a week. I do occasionally still use conditioner, but not every time I wash my hair. The  price is worth it to me, since I know that there is nothing harmful to me, or the environment in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does not leave any kind of weird film on my hair, doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this shampoo does rinse clean, make my hair soft and shiny, last quite a while, and lather really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think I&#x27;ll ever bother even trying another shampoo. I LOVE Naturoli :D</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo! Very cleansing and moisturizing. The best shampoo I have ever tried. Just a little creates lots of suds.</li>
            <li> this stuff seems to work well, doesn&#x27;t have a crazy smell like most shampoo</li>
            <li> It scores a 1 (low hazard) on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s cosmetic safety database.  It is the only one rated this low that actually rinses out of my hair.  All the other brands I&#x27;ve tried leave my hair looking and feeling greasy.  My hair is not chemically treated, but is thick and wavy.  This shampoo also lasts a while for the price, compared to other low toxicity shampoos. I do have to use a conditioner after use.  But it is much easier to find low toxicity conditioners that work. A little organic pure cocoa butter, shea butter or coconut oil works too. I just purchased my second bottle.  My husband loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  It does seem to give my fine hair a little more body.  My only complaint is wishing it was too costly for such a small bottle. I  do like that it can lather without having you to use a lot of shampoo.  Other unscented ones hardly lather.  And this has a nice but slight smell to it.  I can&#x27;t tolerate fragrances or smells but this does not bother me at all.  I wish they had a conditioner that was very moisturizing to the dry ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine and curly hair and always need conditioner. This NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo is the first time I have gone without conditioner! No scent, nice suds... my hair looks great and feels soft. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these.  It&#x27;s a great shampoo.  Made my hair feel really clean, but my hairstylist said it was stripping too much of the color.  If you don&#x27;t use haircolor, this would my first recommendation easily.  No SLS really makes the difference.  SLS is carcenogenic and just added to make shampoo, etc suds.</li>
            <li> I did not care for it.</li>
            <li> Soap nuts shampoo hasn&#x27;t impressed me a whole lot yet. I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain the unnatural ingredients that most shampoos do, but it seems to dry out my hair. I definitely need a conditioner afterward. Also, it smells kind of like mushrooms. I suppose that is the scent of the natural soap nuts, and it isn&#x27;t awful, but not great either.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic!  I have curly, frizzy, difficult hair (mixed race).  I have tried everything to wash and condition my hair for years and I have never been satisfied.  I really like this shampoo.  It cleans deeply but gently, has no scent, and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  Without using conditioner.  I have been using it since September 2014 and I am totally delighted.  I also appreciate the fact that it is organic and does not have any chemicals or dyes.</li>
            <li> I switched to this from WEN, which I used for 4 years and my hair was healthy and amazing. I loved WEN, but it&#x27;s not that pure, and I fell in love with a henna hair color that unfortunately WEN strips out. So thus began my quest for a natural cleanser.  I want to love this product. I am very concerned about toxins in my environment, and I like feeling healthy and natural in all my health and beauty products. But since I&#x27;ve started using this 4 weeks ago, I&#x27;ve lost tons of hair, have gobs of breakage (so bad I need it cut), and it&#x27;s still an unmovable mat after washing. My hair feels and acts stripped. It may be a natural soap, but I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s actually stripping my hair. It&#x27;s very dry now. I switched to the shampoo for dry hair, bought the serum (which works great), treat it extra carefully when wet and do weekly hot oil treatments (I&#x27;ve tried Ojon, Argan and Jojoba), and my hair still is brittle, breaking, falling out, and super dry. I will finish the bottle just to see if I can make it work, but I&#x27;m already thinking of going back to WEN at this point. I went from healthy, luscious hair to sad straw hair! WTH?!  I&#x27;m trying to be patient with the detox, but my hair is now seriously damaged and I&#x27;m worried. It has gotten very slightly better with being one gigantic mat after washing, but not by much. Scalp to mid-shaft is fine, but the lower half and ends seems to have been bombed! And, the hair near my scalp gets SUPER oily now every 2-3 days, whereas with WEN it never did. (It would just eventually get dirty, but it never forced sebum production like this does. Which is another indication to me that it&#x27;s stripping my hair.)  Does anyone have ideas or feedback? I&#x27;m gonna try to make it through the bottle, but at the rate it&#x27;s breaking, falling out, and splitting, I&#x27;m scared how much more damaged it may be by then! Does it really get better? Is this a normal detox? Is anyone else having these problems and figured something out? Help!  UPDATE - I finally gave up and went back to WEN, and with more hot oil treatments, my hair is massively improved, now. I still have to cut out the damaged part--about 4 inches off the length. I think my hair just does not do well with soaps of any kind, even if they are natural. My hair does better with a cleansing conditioner that cleans with essential oils only and no soap. I made it through half a bottle for dry hair, which took 6 weeks. (I have thick hair that goes mid-way down my back.) I do like their hair serum (which you have to purchase from their website) a lot, and will continue to use that for gloss and shine. And I do like the company&#x27;s laundry soap/house cleanser, but not so keen on soap nuts in my hair.  I think they are an amazing company and have outstanding products, but unfortunately, this shampoo did not work for me.  UPDATE 1/10/2012 - It&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve stopped using this shampoo. I&#x27;ve done a number of hot oil treatments and been using a deep conditioning shampoo and conditioner. My hair has never returned to normal. When it&#x27;s wet, it still mats up like a hunk of wet straw, in a giant, unmovable mass. It doesn&#x27;t tear as easily when dry, now, but it&#x27;s never returned to normal. I&#x27;m going to have to get the damaged portions cut out. My hair was beautiful and healthy before using this product. Now it&#x27;s so damaged I have to cut the damaged parts out. I&#x27;m a little bitter over this. I believe there are many people here who this shampoo worked wonders for, but I think that for long, thick, coarse hair, it&#x27;s not a good match. I was also using a superb product before hand, and my hair was in excellent shape. Maybe if you start with a really bad one, this is a step up. I know some people on the comments section mentioned I should have watered it down, but really, it&#x27;s too late now, and it was no where in the instructions that I would need to do that.  I really, really wanted to like this shampoo, based on the company&#x27;s excellent reputation and all the positive reviews. But for me, it seriously and permanently damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> AWESOME SHAMPOO. [[ASIN:B003P85MAM NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! - Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Dry Hair - \\&quot;EXTREME Hair\\&quot; - Unscented - 16oz. Made with USDA CERTIFIED ORGANIC Soap Nuts / Soap Berries!]] It doesn&#x27;t fade colored hair But it also Doesn&#x27;t make natural blonde hair darker either. It leaves hair clean shinny and my hair sparkles as does my friend&#x27;s with colored hair. It is a miracle in a bottle. It doesn&#x27;t have any smell only a very light one in the bottle not bad. And all of our hair is clean soft and conditioned and looks health without being over conditioned or flat or sticky or goopy.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the reasons I should like this shampoo. It is completely natural and that is why I ordered it. I only started to use a sulfate-free shampoo recently and tried Wen first. Although it is extremely expensive, I stopped losing hair and when I dried it, it was fuller.  During the two times I have used NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo, I have lost more hair than I can believe. I rip chunks out of my hair out while trying to comb it. My hair feels very clean, but it also feels dry and is extremely tangled. It blows out full, but geez...it isn&#x27;t worth going bald. Rather than trying to deal with the hair loss, I&#x27;m going to return the product. I wish it worked for me, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The product is made with all natural ingredients and the company is dedicated to promoting health and well-being instead of image.  You don&#x27;t need conditioner, just the all natural shampoo and your hair will feel and look great.  Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo is terrific! I have dry hair and this is shampoo is the only one I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t dry it...that said, I still use conditioner with it. Really nice product.</li>
            <li> I live in an area with hard water and was having serious problems with an itchy, flaking scalp. I tried a number of different anti-dandruff shampoos. Head and Shoulders Moisturizing somewhat stopped the itching, but not the flaking, which was a major source of embarrassment. I bought the Naturoli shampoo out of desperation, even though it cost more than what I&#x27;m normally willing to pay for a hair product.    I could tell an immediate difference. The itching stopped. The flaking decreased substantially, but not completely--so I began to use an apple cider vinegar rinse daily, and that, in combination with this shampoo, solved my problem.     This shampoo is really gentle on your hair. It does tend to leave it a little tangled, especially since conditioner is not required. It also doesn&#x27;t lather as much as a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo because of the lack of SLS. I use a deep conditioner about once a month, and my hair is always soft.    I would highly recommend this for anyone who is having dry scalp issues or just wants to avoid harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, I&#x27;m a lurker not a joiner. I tried this on a whim and after several weeks, I have to say, it&#x27;s made a big difference.  I have thick, naturally curly hair that gets very dry. I only wash my hair a couple of times a week but condition nearly every day. I also have some premature gray hair that I dye regularly with Loreal, every 6 weeks.  Basically, I spend most of my money on conditioners, wash out and leave-in, not shampoo.  After switching to this shampoo, my hair doesn&#x27;t get as knotty, tangled or dry as it used to and my hair just looks much better.  As a result, the amount of wash-out and leave-in conditioner I use has dropped substantially as it&#x27;s no longer necessary.    Also, my Loreal hair color now lasts about 9 weeks.  At first I thought it was way too expensive for a shampoo but given the subsequent time and money savings - using less conditioner, easier to wash/style due to fewer tangles/knots, having to color less frequently - I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  It makes my hair feel so soft and natural like I have not felt it in years!  I do not even use any conditioner.  I personally just let my hair dry naturally and then comb it out later because it is easier that way and then I have absolutely no snarls.</li>
            <li> After having an allergic reaction to a few name brand shampoos, a friend of mine recommended NaturOli soapnuts shampoo. Naturally I was afraid of the \\&quot;nuts\\&quot; aspects just because I&#x27;d had a nut allergy in the past. Thankfully I tried and I&#x27;l never use another shampoo again. My hair is soft and slightly wavy, something that hadn&#x27;t ever occurred when it was weighed down with product. I get compliments on the shininess of my hair all the time. Although I adore this shampoo I have a few minor gripes that I just want to air.     1. The detox takes more than a week. I&#x27;d say it took my hair nearly a month before completely detoxing.   2. You really can&#x27;t use conditioners with it WITHOUT getting an oily scalp. It&#x27;s this or not this.   3. It makes my hair a TANGLED crazy mess and sometimes it really hurts to brush it after washing.   4. Using it daily will make your hair oily, not dry! So be careful. I tend to use it every other day and that&#x27;s a good balance for me.     Over all, if you have allergies like me, I totally recommend this shampoo. It&#x27;s gone down in prince as well! Stock up because it goes quickly!</li>
            <li> I love this!  I use it for shampoo and for body soap - my hair feels great after using it!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, even with my long thin hair that is normally fly away I have no need to use a creme rinse with this shampoo.  I have also turned my daughter and 5 year old granddaughter on to it so they and I will ordering more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a swimmer and have tried every shampoo known that says it will \\&quot;get the chlorine out.\\&quot;  This shampoo is amazing.  My hair has never felt so clean and soft. It also conditions the hair and leaves it tangle free.</li>
            <li> I did noyt like how it made my hair feel.  Using it in my laundry.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;First thing that I have found that really really works!  Have tried many other shampoos with very little results! After about 3 uses, my scalp felt wonderful, and no more itching!!!  Need very little and it lathers up very well!&amp;#34;  Will continue with this!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on three and a half years now of using this product.  I use the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;  because normal to oily dries my hair out too much.  I have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me,  any time I&#x27;ve used other brands  of shampoo,  I get build up on my hair and it feels dirtier faster.  With Soap Nuts I can go for three or four days without my hair feeling dirty. (it&#x27;s better not to wash hair too often..)  It gets my hair super clean and doesn&#x27;t leave build up chemicals that weigh my hair down and make it feel dirty.  Other shampoos-  (most..) make my hair feel  dirty the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the non toxic  benefits of this shampoo, my hair stopped falling out so much when I wash it.  I used to get handfuls and now I just get a little bit.  It&#x27;s shiny and thick-  and looks extremely healthy for a 59 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- My experience is that you do need conditioner with this shampoo. (just a little)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this shampoo and the bottle has lasted my long hair about two months. I have thick hair which has the tendency to get frizzy. I couldn&#x27;t really think of bad things for this so my review is separated into good and not so good, as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;- I have reason to believe it has removed some of the build up in my hair over the last two months. It feels cleaner and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;- Took care of slight dandruff that I had when I previously used a store-bought shampoo. Little to no dandruff left! :)&lt;br /&gt;- The shampoo doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals, but this does create some of the downsides below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so good:&lt;br /&gt;- Although it&#x27;s fragrance-free, it has a slight, almost plasticky scent but luckily, it&#x27;s not strong. Because of this, I prefer to use conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;- The other reason why I follow with conditioner is that my hair will tangle up. Definitely not easy to brush through afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;- My hair has gotten progressively frizzier and puffy even when it isn&#x27;t that humid out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll get this again anytime soon. If I do, I&#x27;ll probably use it intermittently with another shampoo. I&#x27;m also not sure I can recommend this, at least not to those who have a tendency to get frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural &#x27;coily&#x27; hair and was looking for a sulfate free shampoo that didn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  This works fine and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as &#x27;stripped&#x27; as it does when I use other sulfate shampoos.  Actually feels a little softer.  Lathers up really nicely, mild, unnoticeable smell.  Oh, that&#x27;s probably because its UNSCENTED!  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the price.  But since this is my first sulfate-free shampoo, I realize my hair likes it and I&#x27;ll continue to use and experiment with different brands.  But again, no complaints with this product.</li>
            <li> ...but after trying it alone, I was sad to find that it stripped my hair of the natural oils just like other shampoos. I have shoulder-length, healthy hair and my routine is to thoroughly brush my hair before showering/washing it, then gently brush out tangles after my shower. (Yes, I know you&#x27;re not supposed to brush wet hair, I do it anyway; can&#x27;t stand tangled hair.) My hair was actually squeaky-clean (some people may like that), and I had great difficulty brushing after showering. Even after I gently removed ALL tangles, the brush STILL didn&#x27;t want to go through my hair. (A vented brush without a ton of bristles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this shampoo many ways: lots of shampoo, leaving it on my hair through the shower, very little shampoo, rinsing it out immediately after washing. I even tried a small amount in my palm and using fingertips to work it into my scalp alone, so that only rinsing it out would let it touch my hair. It still stripped my hair where it touched it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, my hair has more body after it&#x27;s dry. I&#x27;ve started using a good conditioner with this shampoo: washing my hair first thing, rinsing, then putting conditioner on my hair and leaving it on through my shower. My hair is much more manageable doing it this way, but I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying this shampoo for myself again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note: it&#x27;s not a high lathering shampoo, which doesn&#x27;t bother me; just an f.y.i. for other buyers.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed reading about this shampoo and the other reviewers seemed to love it. I wanted so badly for this to be my IT shampoo.  I realize that people all have different body chemicals and make ups. I tend to have oily scalp if I skip a day of washing yet I have dry ends w/ fly away hair so I am looking for something natural as I also get color treatments every 12-16 weeks. I just wanted it all to balance out. I couldnt wait to use this. I hate strong artificial scents but this smelled pretty natural although there is definitely a scent. The lathering was good. I didnt notice any color srtipping. However combing through my hair when it was wet was pretty tough as it seemed too squeaky clean if that makes any sense. I tried using it two days in a row and my hair looked dull and dry. It said for optimal results use every other day but when i would my scalp would feel gunky and itch. I quit using it for awhile thinking I was needing to space out time between using my green tea shampoo and this one thinking the two may be reacting. I just tried again using it for five days. My scalp is so dry and itchy and my hair is very fly away and unmanageable and I think I am also losing more hair than normal when drying/styling. I may be allergic to one of the ingredients in this shampoo for my scalp to feel so crappy. Organic does a person no good for health if it in fact makes a person worse off. I dont really understand their classifications of normal to dry or normal to oily. To me there is dry, normal or oily. Just because a person tends on the oily side day to day doesnt mean we want all of the moisture sucked from our scalp. I was looking for a healthy balance for my hair and scalp. Sadly this shampoo does not deliver despite its gold cap lid and environmentally friendly claims. I will give it two stars since I concede I may have some allergy with an ingredient in this shampoo and I will give the seller benefit of the doubt they are not lying and pushing a bad batch of this stuff on the unsuspecting folks just wanting to use less artificial chemicals on their bodies.</li>
            <li> My hair feels smoother and healthier after using his shampoo for few weeks.</li>
            <li> This shampoo could not be more natural, clean and easy to use. I have pretty thin and short hair, the rest of the family ranges from so thick I could cry to long silky and fine. We all use this shampoo and it works beautifully. My daughter is a manic panic user, so keeping that in her hair is a nightmare. But when we use NaturOli Soap Nuts shampoo it stays longer. That is a huge plus. My hair, though thin and fine due to cancer feels fluffier and appears fuller. It does not grow hair nor does it say it does. But my hair is nicer, more like it was back in the day. I appreciate that. We are next going for the Soap Nuts liquid laundry detergent. Tiny bottle and huge number of loads, am hoping for excellent and clean results on that product too. If you are on the fence due to price, don&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t leave much of a scent in your hair, but that&#x27;s what a natural shampoo is. I bought mine in January, and I use about a penny sized amount every day (sometimes every other). I am only halfway through the bottle. A little goes a long way. I have fine hair, but a lot of it. My hair length is about halfway down my back. I wanted to switch to an all natural shampoo, so I made my own. I used soap nuts to make mine, but I didn&#x27;t like the results, and it was annoying to keep my shampoo as ice cubes in the freezer. I found this and decided to try it. It&#x27;s been GREAT! Just know, if you haven&#x27;t detoxed your hair away from chemical products prior to using this shampoo (I did it with my own homemade shampoo) then your hair will get greasy. My hair went through the detox stage for a couple of weeks. Basically, commercial shampoos strip away your natural oils, so when you stop using them, your hair overproduces your natural oils. It takes a little time to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this shampoo. I use the conditioner too, but honestly don&#x27;t even need to use it. I use it if I want extra soft hair. My hair was slightly naturally wavy before, but it always seemed weighed down. My waves weren&#x27;t consistent enough to wear it natural. I would blow dry it straighter. Now, my waves look great! I can wear my hair natural without needing to do anything besides brush it. I never really used products in my hair, so I don&#x27;t use them now. With this shampoo, a little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need a lot. It&#x27;s not going to foam like a store bought shampoo, but if you rub it in for a while, it does slightly foam. Soap nuts have a natural foam that comes out of them, so that&#x27;s probably what the foam is from. But, it is VERY minimal. This washes out easily, and my hair is never greasy. I definitely recommend this if you are looking for an easy, all-natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Even though my hair and scalp tend to be oily, but the NaturOli shampoo for \\&quot;Normal to Dry Hair\\&quot; really worked wonders for my hair (moreso than their \\&quot;Oily Hair\\&quot; shampoo).  After using the shampoo, it was really the first time that my hair had more volume, shine, and didn&#x27;t get oily as quickly.  I&#x27;ve used other shampoo products, but I feel that the NaturOli shampoo really did the trick.</li>
            <li> I have coarse gray hair and from the very first time of use my hair came out soft and shiny with no yellowing. I have ben using about 2 weeks and go about 3 days between shampood. I am hoping after the initial detox period to be able to go longer. I love it</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair feel thicker more manageable and also my hair has no more frizz at all&lt;br /&gt;Will order again</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I was having scalp burning from other products with added chemicals. The burning feeling has completely stopped. What a relief.  I have thick wavy color treated hair. I am getting great results. My hair feels so soft and looks beautiful. I will definitely buy this product again..</li>
            <li> While this shampoo does make my hair soft, I don&#x27;t think that it works any better than my other chemical free shampoo, which is cheaper. I feel badly saying this, as I really wanted to be wowed and fall in love with this, since NaturOli is such a wonderful company. Overall a nice product thought.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a combination of shampoo and face wash that doesn&#x27;t try out my face.  I tried different face wash and face lotion and that helped (organic/natural), but I still had dry skin mostly on my forehead, but around my face in general after getting out of the shower.  Since switching to this shampoo my face does not dry out anywhere close to how it used to.  Must have been something in the other brands of shampoo I was using that caused my problem (which I suspected).    Product has no bad smells (smells like nothing really) and lathers up really quick.    As for my hair it feels soft, clean, and light.    This is the first all natural shampoo I have tried and will continue to use it.  Been looking for all natural products to replace those with chemicals throughout my house.  I will only continue to use products that are superior to my usual brands and I expect I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I have dry, long hair. I think this shampoo can be drying(because of the soap nuts) and I don&#x27;t like chemical conditioners or putting stuff in my hair. So, I put tons of coconut oil on my scalp, brush my hair and let it soak in overnight. Wash with the minimum amount of shampoo needed to clean my hair so as to not over dry. I skip conditioner. Gives tons of volume and keeps my hair super soft. The only flip side is my hair tangles a lot easier the first day. I wash my hair once in 3 days. My guess is it going to last 3-4 months atleast for me.&lt;br /&gt;Might be a tad bit expensive but I think it is worth it. I grew up using soap nuts to wash my hair. They are a bit tedious to use and needs practice to figure out how to work it. This is a more expensive but super easy to use alternative.</li>
            <li> Our clients who are gluten free love this product when they forget their shampoo.</li>
            <li> New to and Loving this Product BRAND!     I just started buying NaturOil products! I really like them all!     We are bombarded with CHEMICALS constantly this feels nice..... cleans well and will be using daily!    It doesn&#x27;t lather like all togs chemical shampoos BUT...it&#x27;s more important to me that my Hair is CLEAN withOUT chemicals!</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a wonderful shampoo.  I have chemical allergies to just about everything. I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that I can use without rashes or hives.  This is the shampoo I&#x27;ve been looking for!  It lathers up into a rich thick lather and leaves my hair clean and shiny.  I&#x27;m especially glad it is unscented as anything with any kind of fragrance bothers me. I recommend this shampoo for not just chemical allergies or allergies of any kind, but for everyone who wants to use something healthy for your hair! Everything that goes on your scalp or skin goes into your blood stream ... don&#x27;t want chemicals there. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Love this product.. If you are worried about hair loss, use this one. I got great result with this. This works perfectly fine with my hair..</li>
            <li> I really like this Shampoo it&#x27;s a little pricey but it works well with my hair I have mixed hair that is frizzy and so far no problems considering it is all natural</li>
            <li> Just ordered my second bottle and my entire family now uses this shampoo. I have hypersensitivity from time to time and get sores on the nape of my neck if I use a shampoo with any trace amounts of shampoo. We had been using Dr. Bronners but my kids could not stand the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; feel of that soap - with the Soap Nut Shampoo your skin and hair feel smooth. The scent is just enough to make it pleasant without being too fragrant. Although the bottle states no conditioner needed, we do because the 8 yr old has middle of the back length hair. She too has a very sensitive scalp (frequent itchiness) and seems to  have no problems if she sticks to the soap nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am moving on to try their laundry soap nuts now. THANK YOU FOR MAKING SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product that I was looking for.  All natural.  I also figure if I&#x27;m shampooing my hair every day, I don&#x27;t need to hardly use any.  I use a dime-sized amount in my hand and then apply.  I had been using the Suave Clarifying Shampoo previously, so I think I didn&#x27;t have a lot of detoxing to do. I decided I&#x27;m not going to use any conditioner.  I wait till my hair is almost dry and then comb through.  There are some tangles, but I had less hair loss today than with previous shampoos when I combed through (even though I was using conditioner with the other shampoos.) Hopefully, it will last me several months.</li>
            <li> Updated June 12, 2015: I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo since January and I have really liked it... until I got my latest bottle.  The formula used to be a thick, rich formula.   I noticed in my latest bottle that it&#x27;s quite runny this time around.  I either got a bad batch, or they are starting to water down the formula pretty significantly.  I have to use much more than before to wash my hair.  Once this bottle is out, I might give them one more try.  If that bottle is also runny,  I will be moving on to something else.  For the steep price, I expect it to not be watered down this significantly.  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; January 28, 2015: I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and so far I really like it.  I&#x27;m trying to decrease the amount of random chemicals and things that I use in my everyday life, and I am happy to find a shampoo with low toxicity.  It is a thick formula.  A little goes a long way.  A few things to note:  1) My hair feels CLEAN... like clarifying clean.  I don&#x27;t use many hair products, but it really does feel like the one that I use is cleaned out when I use this shampoo.  2) A little goes a long way!  I have long hair. I would say it goes about halfway down my back.  A small blob of this shampoo really works into a great foam.  Note I said &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34;.  It feels lighter somehow... and smells like white wine (?!)  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> very good ingredients</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo even with no conditioner for my long curly hair. I didn&#x27;t think that it would foam up that easily, but it does lather really fast and a lot better than some of the other shampoos I was using.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but I&#x27;ve noticed that foaming action from chemicals \\&quot;looks\\&quot; different than foaming action created from naturally occurring ingredients.  This all-natural shampoo is amazing, has that fabulous NATURAL soapy foam, and I have absolutely no fear that I&#x27;m touching or exposing my system to toxins. I just love it. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I used to have the mindset for shampoos that the more expensive the better. I&#x27;m not like this at all with anything else I buy. Well luckily I looked at reviews for my previous shampoo I&#x27;ve been using for years and someone posted the toxicity rating from this site [...]    Never again will I buy that shampoo and now I am aware of the products I use daily. Everything else I&#x27;ve used is \\&quot;good\\&quot; for you and now my shampoo is too. So this shampoo will be my choice from now on with no risks of harm to myself.    After becoming aware of this health issues from generic products it makes you wonder how it&#x27;s even legal for companies to sell products that have a high risk of triggering cancer or whatever else it might do.    This shampoo has a soft almost odor-less smell, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...</li>
            <li> I have a big problem with chemicals and fragrances. This shampoo has neither.  I keep buying it because it&#x27;s the best product for my allergies and sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Great natural shampoo. Gonna get conditioner too. Tried all kinds of natural products and truly love this one plus it does not change my colored hair any faster than any other shampoo including those specific for color treated hair</li>
            <li> I used to make my own soapnut shampoo years ago. It&#x27;s a very common way of washing hair in my country(India)mixed with two other herbs (Amla &amp; Shikakai). However I gave it up because of the hassle of making the shampoo at home. Lately I was thinking of going back to soapnut shampoo and was pleased to find a ready made organic soapnut shampoo. I am on my second bottle now and I am not going back to the chemical laden ones anymore. It cleans as promised and it does lather up quite a bit for a soapnut shampoo. If you have washed your hair only once you need to go easy on the conditioner. If you have oiled your hair/applied some hair pack you need to wash your hair twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said it&#x27;s an expensive shampoo considering how much the actual cost of ingredients is.</li>
            <li> very nice product. we from India like to maintain very good hair w/out chemicals by our traditional medicines. this is a replacement in USA for chem free treatment, my wife and daughter both are insisted me to write this review in Amazon, &amp;#34;ordered&amp;#34; me to rate 5 star. even i hv tried this, as we apply coconut oil / sesame / castor oil on hairs, this shampoo retain the oil content in the hair. doesnt dry out (like other shampoos just bleach and leave nothing on hair, cause hair breakage etc) bigger corporations are coming with cement technology etc for hair...hope we are not so idiots to believe those ads. so this is very good choice</li>
            <li> I had to throw this stuff away.  My hair was totally unmanageable and matted down after shampooing.  I tried various rinses, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair. I bought this product with lot of hopes but it left me disappointed. I gave it two stars instead of one because I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. Used it for a month but I never felt that freshness in my hair after the shower. Also, it did not do anything to help my hair loss. Overall, an overpriced, below average product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid neuro-toxins as much as possible due to family medical history of Alzheimer&#x27;s and brain cancer. I was very excited to find this product but a little disappointed with performance. While it cleans my hair quite well, it doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp well and nothing is worse than dirty smelly head. I&#x27;m adding a drop of Rosemary and Peppermint oil to the shampoo so I don&#x27;t have smelly head anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on and off for over 2 years now. You may be wondering &amp;#34;why on and off?&amp;#34; well it is due to the price not the product itself. What I try to do is buy it directly with one of their coupons and that helps with the price plus they usually give samples which is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love this shampoo not just for the low toxin level but because it really cleans my hair without over drying. I love the smell of regular shampoo but what always ends up happening is my hair becomes weighed down, oily and dull looking. I have fine but thick hair so its very finicky and doesn&#x27;t take much to tangle. Fortunately once the &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; phase is over my hair becomes shiny, smooth and most importantly OIL FREE! The detox phase happens because your hair became accustomed to being scrubbed clean and dried out due to commercial shampoos. It takes about a week to get use to the extra conditioning while still giving you that clean feel. So don&#x27;t get discouraged I have to deal with that weird feeling for at least a week before the oils on my scalp adjust and start producing a normal level of sebum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I find the shampoo for oily hair too drying and that one makes my hair tangle. Since excess sebum happens from over drying your scalp it would make sense to use a shampoo for dry hair so your scalp stops over producing oil trying to make up for the moisture loss.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo, but was more concentrated when purchased directly from the companies website.  I do not have allergic reaction to this shampoo, as I do with standard commercial shampoos. It&#x27;s a bit pricy though!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other natural products and spent a lot of money trying to find a good natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t stink or leave my hair so matted that I cannot get a brush through it.  First of all it smells clean . . . not perfumed . . . just clean.  I have had a time finding a shampoo with little or no scent and this is perfect!  Ok, for the first week I thought it would be another one of those shampoos that I would still have to condition like crazy afterwards just to get a brush through it, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  I stuck with it and held off on the conditioner and by day 5 it seems like my hair must have gone through a detox or something because day 5 brushing seemed much easier than first few days and I could run my fingers through it!  I really like it so far and plan to skip washing some days when my hair gets equilibrated.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and clean! I don&#x27;t have to shower nearly as often as I used to. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love that it is totally natural. It has no added perfumes. The only thing is that it makes my hair dry but by next day they are fine. My kids love it too</li>
            <li> I am trying to go natural/organic/chemical free with as many of our products as possible.  But, I was disappointed with this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t lather at all, and my hair did not feel clean after washing with it.  I threw most of it away, and hate that I&#x27;m out the $.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because it gives my hair volume( that I have not had for years using other shampoos). Also, I like the fact my hair stays nice for days. The only ingredient worries me is Lauryl Glucoside :(</li>
            <li> I love having the chance to clean my hair without all the chemistry!  Leaves my hair very nice without stripping it of oils and colorant that I use.</li>
            <li> My Hair: Overly-long, deeply layered, fluffy waves, 10% gray, prone to frizz and VERY sensitive to protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo lathers, gets squeaky clean and hair feels &#x27;clarified&#x27;, after. I love the cleansing agent: it definitely works to remove sebum and dirt and my nails have improved since I stopped using chemicals. I cannot use this product daily, though, it strips too much from my hair: I needed extra conditioner and my scalp felt tight the more often I used it. But after a few weeks of sea salt, honey, cider vinegar and coconut oil, I LOVE the effect of this shampoo! It is thick and dilutes well, I feel it is a good value for how little I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely trying the dish soap and recommending soap nut berries for effective and gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this shampoo since it didn&#x27;t have a lot of reviews and it was so expensive -- and to be blunt, the packaging wasn&#x27;t very professional. I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance. I had been looking for a sulfate-free shampoo that didn&#x27;t have water as the main ingredient. This shampoo has been wonderful. I prefer it to the comparably costing brand that my stylist sells. It&#x27;s both gentle and effective in cleaning my hair. After using sulfate-free shampoos for more than a year, I still have to remind myself that lather doesn&#x27;t equal clean. Otherwise, I would use more product than I have to in an effort to get a good lather. (Posted by Richard&#x27;s wife)</li>
            <li> the shampoo leaves my hair dry and tangled.  I have not continued to use it and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. At this point we should know that all the things we apply in our bodies are somehow absorbed and that&#x27;s exactly why I consider this a very good shampoo. The smell is fairly good and soft that sometimes I can barely feel it. It doesn&#x27;t produce much foam but the necessary amount to get you a clean scalp.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. I used to get bumps all over my scalp and it has really decreased. At first I didnt like it felt like when I washed my hair that it tangled and felt dry. After using it for awhile I really like it. Hair is soft and it helps with bleached hair. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I actually really like scent in my shampoo so I am thinking to buy some essentially oils and put a few drops in.... but I can appreciate that a product like this chooses not to scent bc the market they are appealing to likes things all natural. This shampoo rates very good on the skindeep data website proving all the ingredients to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have oily hair and after a day of not washing I get flaky and itchy - with most any other shampoo - expensive and not expensive. But this shampoo really feels like it balances the oils of my scalp and makes my hair clean. My only complaint is that I have to wash my hair up to three times to finally get the lather I am looking for when washing my hair. It feels like it takes a while to cut through the debris. Twice works fine, but three times is a charm. I don&#x27;t really even need to condition afterwards, My hair is soft and workable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years now.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Just starting using it and it&#x27;s seems to be great for my hair. I think I still need a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I researched this item for awhile before I took the plunge and bought it.  I have to say that I am very impressed with the performance of this product.  My hair was extremely soft and shiny after the first use.  With my fine textured hair, I generally have to sacrifice softness for volume, but that was not the case here.  It styled very easily and held the style all day without any extra product.  I also noticed that my hair does not tangle as the day goes on like it used to.  I had read reviews that stated that you would not need a separate conditioner with this product and I found that to be true.  Twenty dollars may seem a bit steep for a shampoo, but I feel that it is justified in that it replaces the need for a conditioner and it does not require a lot of product per use.  I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This shampoo both cleans and detangles hair. When I started using this shampoo there was a considerable decrease in dropping hair.</li>
            <li> So, you can read any of the other reviews in order to get an idea of this as a shampoo. However, there is an off label use for this that has really surprised me and made me very, very, and I&#x27;m going for it, VERY happy. I use this for shampoo, obviously, but also as a face wash for horrific acne which I am pleased to write is barely noticeable at this point. Read further if you want more information and don&#x27;t if all you wanted to know is what the off label use is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NaturOli Soap Nut formulas are among an increasing number of &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or, rather, chemically safe shampoos and body care products. However, like most natural companies, they make liberal use of allergens like lavender and chamomile as well as, tragically, limonene, which is a known irritant, rosemary (another irritant), horsetail (yup), random essential oils (fragrance, which is extremely irritating to skin) as well as some tree nuts like shea and coconut, all of which spell disaster for acne prone skin. I found their hand and body soaps, facial creams and other body care to be unusable, including their normal to oily version of this very shampoo. And, yet, somehow, this formula is free and clear of all known irritants and allergens, which means it won&#x27;t drip down your forehead causing comedones and ruining your appearance. Just reading the ingredients lets you know how safe it will be (in terms of avoiding cancer) but a closer look also reveals its safety for acne sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Normal to Dry formula uses a soap nut powder base (where nut is a misleading term because soap nuts are actually berries) and an olive oil castile soap alongside a lathering cleanser (lauryl glucoside) which is very mild and light. The three lead actives in this cleanser work together to mildly cleanse hair without stripping it (if used appropriately, that is to say, by someone who knows how to wash hair properly, which most people don&#x27;t and I&#x27;ll cover that later). The extracts provided here are nourishing, ginseng and green tea, olive leaf and water cress, but of greatest importance are hair tonic ingredients used successfully for shine and scalp health the world over, including aloe, glycerin, hibiscus, jojoba and panthenol. Having read through this list I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it and purchased a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before my first wash, I used a clarifying shampoo to remove the silicones from my other shampoo which I gladly have given away and the next day set to using this. First off, I noticed that the dime-size amount I use to wash my hair was successful in covering my scalp and coating the hair shaft of every strand. Second, there was no itching, tightness, watering of my eyes five minutes after the hair has been rinsed clean, or any unpleasant odor or sneezing due to allergenic fragrances. Third, my hair dried and was clean and soft but not stiff or dingy the way it is when I use a pure castile soap and also not too fly away and frizzy like when I use a Paul Mitchell detergent shampoo. After a few days, I noticed a fourth benefit, my hair was getting dry (which did not mean the shampoo is bad but, rather, I was using too much, too often). I started washing with water only every other day and using this only on alternating days. Immediately, I found my hair softening and moistening (sorry) back up into the well conditioned shine I had enjoyed with my dirty shampoos (but without the cancer causing ingredients). And then, about two weeks later, I noticed a fifth benefit, my favorite one by far, when I saw that my forehead was clearing up. I took a chance and began using this as my face wash having used a simple soap for years and found that, after another two weeks, the low level of olive oil in this and the different cleansing agents had pulled the oil to the surface in a series of very mild breakouts (no worse than what I was fighting already) and left my pores clean and tight. I have one pimple right now, small, barely visible, instead of too manyto count. My face is not red (I thought I had rosacea) but has a healthy pink glow and my capillaries are starting to fade such that I don&#x27;t have so many fine red lines on my face upon close inspection. I had tried acne cleansers, benzoyl peroxide (which causes cancer) and various soaps from castile to detergent based. I had tried washing my face more, washing my face less, sleeping on my back to keep my face away from the pillow, not letting my dogs lick my face, what feels like hundreds so is probably more like fifty or sixty different face and hair products and nothing helped. Coconut oil in conditioners left me a mess (causes oil plugs) and detergents over-dried my skin causing runaway oil production in my own oil glands to compensate. This shampoo works as a shampoo, sure, but who cares if you have horrible acne. I find that, though I am using this as a shampoo, it is a very effective facial cleanser and, on the occasion that my tantrum-prone crazy skin acts up, it lends itself to blending. I can add a drop of olive oil to my extra dry winter skin and a drop of a simple detergent cleanser when I&#x27;ve exercised into oily nightmare world. So, if you have acne, maybe try this as a way to clear it up and certainly switch to a different shampoo and conditioner, even if it isn&#x27;t this brand, as shampoos and conditioners cause acne more than your pillowcase or dog ever could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to washing of hair with this shampoo, for best results, prewash with water. Work water all over the scalp for about two minutes, gently massaging your scalp. Then add a small amount (dime sized for shorter hair and a quarter at most for longer hair, unless it is halfway down your back) to your palm. using your fingers, dab the shampoo quickly in key spots around the crown of your head, on the scalp, not the hair. Massage it into a later, quickly but gently, with the goal of cleansing your scalp. You will notice the shampoo lather is making its way down your hair shafts but at the end,you can work it over your hair for a few moments (no more than ten seconds of actively working it through the hair). Then, after no more than two minutes from the application of shampoo, rinse it off. I like to comb through with a wide toothed comb rather than trying to work the lather into the hair because it distributes evenly, coats, and makes rinsing easier. Once hair is rinsed, it won&#x27;t be dry unless you left the shampoo on too long or used too much. If you have very dry hair, add a bit of olive oil (a small amount) or work olive oil into the strands of your hair before washing (leaving it on for a few minutes). I do this occasionally but mix it with aloe vera gel so I can work it in evenly without using too much. If your hair is still oily, use a little more and work it on the hair a few moments longer. The key to getting this right is, as with all products, start with less and remember that less usually is more which body care products. If you&#x27;ve ever sneezed your way through a meal with your grandmother who is covered in perfume, try to remember that this is what you are doing to your head every time you over-wash and leave your shampoo on for five minutes. I like to keep it under a minute but I&#x27;m too slow and often hit one-thirty. Most people I&#x27;ve asked get the best results from whatever shampoo they use if they keep it under two minutes. So, I hope this helped and, if you try this product, I hope it works as well for you as it has for me. I&#x27;m going to go let a dog lick my face. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle after finishing my first in about 3 months.  I tend to go about 1 or 2 days between shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (mid-back), thin though coarse hair.  By thin, I mean that I sadly don&#x27;t have much hair on my head.  You could probably tie my hair up with an elastic the size of a dime.  However, I&#x27;m Asian and each strand of my black hair is thick individually which helps me look like I have fuller hair than reality.  I also have oily skin which weighs down my thin head of hair and makes it look greasy if I go more than a couple days without washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shampoo as a \\&quot;might as well try this\\&quot; attempt to stop my hair loss.  I&#x27;ve been losing my hair for years now.  My doctor doesn&#x27;t see a medical reason why.  She thinks it&#x27;s stress, but I&#x27;m a very laid-back person and the main source of stress in my life has been my shedding hair! I&#x27;ve had thyroid tests done.  I&#x27;ve tried vitamins and supplements.  I make sure I eat well.  I get plenty of iron in my diet.  I do all the things you&#x27;re supposed to do, yet I still end up with TONS of hair swirling around after every shower (and I keep shedding for hours after).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, in a random train of thought, I realized that since I&#x27;m allergic to sulfites in foods (I get itchy and sneezy, throat swells up, need to take Benadryl), maybe that means my body doesn&#x27;t respond well to sulfates either.  I know they&#x27;re not the same thing, but they&#x27;re related and I was desperate.  I searched Amazon for a sulfate-free shampoo and found this.  Even though my hair gets oily, I got the normal version because I shampoo pretty frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months later, and I *think* I&#x27;m shedding less.  Who knows--maybe it&#x27;s just my perception and the placebo effect?  It does seem to me that I have at least 33% less hair on the floor after my shower.  Is it because it&#x27;s sulfate free? *shrugs* Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m no longer using a conditioner and this shampoo isn&#x27;t slick and slippery.  The slipperiness from other shampoos and conditioners seem to make it easier for my hair to \\&quot;slip\\&quot; off my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hair loss aside, this shampoo makes my hair look great.  As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner.  I normally let my hair air dry and it ends up soft and shiny.  There&#x27;s good volume and my hair looks so healthy.  I NEVER get compliments on my hair, and a week after starting this, a friend told me how great my hair looks on a day when all I did was wash and air dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while the jury is still out on whether or not this is helping with my hair loss, I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it leaves my hair looking great and I don&#x27;t need to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE JANUARY 2014***: I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle.  I have learned that I get the best results if I rinse and repeat with my oily hair.  My hair air dries so soft, bouncy and shiny, though I can say that it&#x27;s definitely not helping with hair loss.  The quest continues!  I&#x27;ve since read that poor blood circulation can lead to poor growth and hair loss. I have very low blood pressure; I sometimes get faint or lose my vision for a few seconds if I get up too quickly from sitting/lying down and my hands and feet are always icy cold.  Going to try scalp massages and peppermint oil to stimulate better circulation to my head.nd slippery.  The slipperiness from other shampoos and conditioners seem to make it easier for my hair to \\&quot;slip\\&quot; off my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hair loss aside, this shampoo makes my hair look great.  As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner.  I normally let my hair air dry and it ends up soft and shiny.  There&#x27;s good volume and my hair looks so healthy.  I NEVER get compliments on my hair, and a week after starting this, a friend told me how great my hair looks on a day when all I did was wash and air dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while the jury is still out on whether or not this is helping with my hair loss, I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it leaves my hair looking great and I don&#x27;t need to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE JANUARY 2014***: I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle.  I have learned that I get the best results if I rinse and repeat with my oily hair.  My hair air dries so soft, bouncy and shiny, though I can say that it&#x27;s definitely not helping with hair loss.  The quest continues!  I&#x27;ve since read that poor blood circulation can lead to poor growth and hair loss. I have very low blood pressure; I sometimes get faint or lose my vision for a few seconds if I get up too quickly from sitting/lying down and my hands and feet are always icy cold.  Going to try scalp massages and peppermint oil to stimulate better circulation to my head.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the greatest. The only reason not to give it five stars is that it says one does not need conditioner, and I think that is true if one has straight hair, but as a curly haired girl, I still use a conditioner.  My scalp feels better, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about all the foaming chemicals in regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good idea to try this product because of all the great reviews. I had dandruff problems before using this, and since some of the reviews said it helped clear up their scalp, I gave it a try. It was okay in the beginning, my hair was clean, my scalp don&#x27;t itch as much, my dandruff wasn&#x27;t too flaky anymore. However, after 4 weeks, my hair started to get so oily from using it. I would use it every other day, but even after one day washing, my hair gets very oily at the end of the day. Then the hair loss started! I have lost so much hair in the past 2 weeks! Whenever I run my fingers through my hair, I ALWAYS end up with 1-3 strands of hair on my hand. My hair is also so brittle and dry now :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the negative reviews on this product, and some of them also had the same experience of bad hair loss. I really wanted this shampoo to be my go-to shampoo, but it really didn&#x27;t work well for me :( My hair is so damaged now that I don&#x27;t know what to do now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually post a negative review, but this did not work well AT ALL for my longer curly hair.  I used it several times, and each time, I had to soak my hair in detangler afterwards in order to get it the pick through my hair.  I visited a curly hair salon, ready to get my hair cut shorter, but the hair stylist said the excessive tangling sounded like a product problem.  I switched to DevaCurl products, and the problem was gone with my first shampoo.  I hate to waste - I wonder if I could use it on my dog???</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, mild and neutral to my scalp. But, NaturOil stopped shipping the bottle with a dispenser cap, which makes it very difficult to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I tried this hoping it could be a more cost effective alternative to my usual cleansing product (Wen). Now that thought seems silly because it left my hair so dry that I couldn&#x27;t even brush it while it was wet. Once dry it was frizzy and damaged looking. I have fine, thin, hair if anyone feels that is relevant. It was every bit as harsh as most non-organic products. I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It didnt really do much to my hair. I even did the whole detox phase that it recommends to do when you first use it. My hair is now actually more dry.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have very fine, greying hair and , before using this shampoo, had to use two different products to give my hair some volume and manageability.  This shampoo is all I have to use now.  It makes my hair shine and gives it body.  I do not need a conditioner after I shampoo with it so far but I have been using it for only a week.  My hair is dry and not at all oily or fine after using this shampoo so I may need to add the serum or some argon oil later.  I also like that it has a great lather.  The &amp;#34;sulfate-free&amp;#34; shampoos that I have tried take more product to create a lather than this product. My husband is using it, also.  We are seeing if it helps his psoriasis but that will take awhile and we will post about that later..</li>
            <li> My hair has been turning gray for a few years now.  The gray ones are wiry and stick out like tangled porcupine quills, which looks really bizarre considering the fact that the rest of my hair is baby fine.  That&#x27;s why I decided to try this shampoo.  I dyed my hair for years and lived through about 20 years of perms to make my hair look full and thick, which it isn&#x27;t, so to make up for years of damage, it made sense to find something that would gently cleanse my hair without damaging it further.  After a little online research, I found NaturOli shampoo.  I bought the formulation for normal/dry hair, even though my hair used to be very oily, because it seemed like it once it started turning gray, its chemistry had changed.  I think I chose the right formula.  Around the same time, I bought some Moroccan argan oil to use on my skin.  Coincidentally, I had a little left on my hand after a shower one day and ran it through my hair as I was drying it.  The frizzies I&#x27;d lived with for years practically disappeared!  So I decided to add some to the shampoo, about half a tablespoon to the bottle, and now every time I wash my hair, I feel as though I&#x27;m conditioning it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and my hair feels soft and shiny.  The grays are better behaved and I no longer worry about baby-fine frizzies either.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product and will continue to purchase. I wouldn&#x27;t use another product on my hair.</li>
            <li> it took about a week of use before i noticed a difference.  i have very fine, flat, straight hair and regular shampoos and conditioners seemed to always weigh it down, even ones specifically for volume.  after about a week of using this product i did notice some more body to my hair.  i find that while i am able to comb while wet, i still use a light weight leave-in conditioner.  overall i am happy and will purchase again.    *****update**** i am now three-quarters finished with the bottle and i no longer need the additional leave-in spray conditioner. my hair combs easily when wet after the shampoo. my hair feels and looks healthier.  i am purchasing another bottle today.</li>
            <li> everyone needs to know that this shampoo really works..i am even going to dare and compare it to john masters, since that is what i was using before giving this a try..this makes my hair softer and shinier..i also love that it is practically scent-free..i am sure adding all-natural fragrance oil wouldnt change its effectiveness..i have tried so many different types of shampoo in the past..including shampoo bars..but when it comes to healthy alternatives in this category, this is by far the best..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard reviews that say it&#x27;s still cleaning even if it&#x27;s not lathering, but it sure didn&#x27;t clean for me. When my hair dried, it was greasy in some parts and frizzy and unruly in other parts. I will not re-order this. Maybe I should have used a lot more to get my hair fully clean but then a whole head of frizz is not appealing either. However...I do love EXREME 18X for laundry (1 pump in pre-wash and 2 pumps in detergent cup). Clothes are clean and have no smells.</li>
            <li> I did this shampoo on recommendation from MOM.  I myself think it is a bit expensive but it is organic so that is reason.&lt;br /&gt;I think my hair is healthier from using this shampoo</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is my hair type or just the shampoo but this didn&#x27;t work for me. I used a clarifying shampoo and followed through with the detox but even after three weeks, all my hair felt was weighed down and dirty. I have since returned to regular shampoos but ones without parabens, dyes, etc. The only good thing I can say about this is that you get a good amount of shampoo for the price. If this works for your hair type than I think it&#x27;s great since it&#x27;s so natural but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have thick wavy-to-straight hair.</li>
            <li> If you want to know the difference between the action of synthetic detergents/ surfactants (&amp;#34;surface active agents&amp;#34;) and natural SOAP (&amp;#34;saponified oils&amp;#34;)  on your skin (and on the environment, including especially aquatic or amphibian life -- in contact with our detergent laden sewage) check out solveeczema dot org.  The synthetics, even those considered &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; and derived from &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sources are dangerous chemicals that contribute enormously to skin problems, allergies,  development of asthma and environmental damage.  Lauryl glucoside contained in this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo is a synthetic surfactant.  After my baby was &amp;#34;miraculously&amp;#34; healed from severe eczema based on reading the info at solveeczema dot org, I will NEVER again use anything containing synthetic detergents in my house, yard, car or anywhere else.  Because I understood the difference and the danger inherent in these chemicals....</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. I&#x27;ve done hours of research trying to find a safe, effective product that still left my hair feeling clean. This one is a winner. I put a small amount in a travel size bottle then dilute it with some water then use that mixture to wash my hair. The product still foams nicely and I use A LOT less so the products lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo on and off for 3 years. Love it. A bit pricey so I can&#x27;t always afford it but I am happy with this because it is organic!</li>
            <li> Best hair care product I have ever used. My hair was falling out and I started to use this and a tiny bit of coconut oil and my hair is so shiny and not dry and soft and not falling out. My brush is empty. I really advise you to try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several weeks now. It made my hair lighter and more lifted at the roots. It gives my hair a nice texture without weighing it down. For the reference, my hair is not colored with an exception of very minimal ombre highlights, wavy, shoulder-length.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like it has more volumn since I started using it.  And It really makes my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> Too pricey, but it did last about a few months.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this shampoo since it was all natural and didn&#x27;t have the bad chemicals,etc.  I tried using this for about a month....I was not at all impressed.  My hair was SOOOO incredibly oily! I try and not wash my hair each day - but with this some days I brushed out my hair and it was so oily I had to wash it before leaving the house it was so bad.  I thought at first it was just the &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34; period of the product that they advertise - however, after using it longer it just was worse and worse.  I should have known not to buy it since they don&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;satisfaction guaranteed&amp;#34; clause or allow returns for unhappy purchasers.  I think this product is awful and I would not recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I instead now use a shampoo from Burts Bees, it&#x27;s probably not perfect in terms of ingredients - but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair any oily mess like this did.</li>
            <li> Left my hair clean and shiny. No need for cream rinse.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  I have been using it for about a month now.  It smells good and lathers well.  My hair feels clean and looks great.  I did read where many who use this product were able to discontinue use of a conditioner.  I must say I have not been able to do that  but I have been able to cut the amount of conditioner I use in half.  I am excited about this shampoo and I am always glad to find products that do not contain harsh chemicals.  I will definitely continue using NaturOil Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone who is looking for an organic and chemical-less shampoo!  It does need 2 latherings, but leaves hair feeling very clean and silky.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.. using it since one month. I noticed the difference already, it is keeping my hair soft and manageable. No conditioner needed. After the shower..I apply a little bit of leave in hair oil to the wet hair. that&#x27;s about it.. I am surprised how clean it keeps the hair for such a plain simple shampoo. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo every other day, and it really leaves my hair (which is oily) feeling very clean!  Not happy with the cost, but it does last me about 3 months, so I can justify it.</li>
            <li> I contacted NaturOil before buying they said it should work for my hair.  Received August 2nd and this product has not improved my oily hair.  Contacted NaturOil again about the problem and told them that my hair is not permed or colored and that I do not use any other products on my hair.  Still to date NaturOil WILL NOT resolve this issue with their product.  They want me to use it as a body wash.  I didn&#x27;t buy it for body wash it is too expensive to be used that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Rusan</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo. My hair has been dried out and damaged by the sun and overstyling with heat irons and blow drying. It immediately made my hair silky soft. You don&#x27;t need a conditioner, just shampoo it in rinse and repeat once and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing this. I use no conditioner, just this product, and my hair feels so natural and light everyday. I feel cleaner and its nice not relying on so many other chemicals to achieve this feeling. The more I use it, the happier and healthier my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and very clean feeling.  It&#x27;s cold, dry winter in the desert where I live, which might be part of the reason why I miss my old conditioner a little.  The label on this indicates that you don&#x27;t need conditioner when using this shampoo.  If that becomes much of a problem there are simple solutions, like mixing up a little coconut oil and ginger to rub into your scalp, or running your hands through your hair after you put on a tiny bit of hand cream.  There is no problem at all with getting your hair nice and clean with this.</li>
            <li> HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY!!! I read every review I could find, both on Amazon and other sources, and I was still skeptical.  I don&#x27;t spend this kind of money on shampoo.  I have always been a natural girl, but have been moving away from chemicals in my household for over a year now.  I have created cleaning products, detergent, and toothpaste, but could not create an acceptable shampoo.  I have fine, thinning shoulder length hair.  I started going gray at seventeen and quit coloring it for a second time a year ago.  This time it is a mixture of white, blond, and a few strands of my natural brown (which are increasing due to changes in diet/lifestyle). My hair has no body and I have to either perm it (way back in the 80&#x27;s), curl it, or add a multitude of products to get it to resemble \\&quot;full.\\&quot; Every \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo I&#x27;ve tried has been subpar, with the exception of the Organix line, which has been a bit more satisfying. Every shampoo that I have made and other supposedly \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos, either because of the amounts and types of ingredients or my hard water, left my hair tangled, straw like, crunchy, or greasy looking. My hair still looked the same after it dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my NaturOli Soap Nut/Soapberry Shampoo for normal to dry hair last night. The bottle was exactly as represented online and packaged well (actually, more packing than I would&#x27;ve thought necessary). The list of ingredients is short and I recognize every one of them.  I am confident that I am using a truly natural shampoo. Clean is the only way to describe the smell. I suppose you could say unscented, but that isn&#x27;t right either.  It would be very easy to create your own signature scent by adding any number/variety of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having read many reviews prior to using, I made sure my hair was very wet before applying the shampoo.  I used a small amount of shampoo and had to add a bit more to get the lather I wanted.  I was amazed.  It was not a big lather, but a gentle justenough lather, which tickled me since most homemade shampoos don&#x27;t lather because of the lack of chemicals.  It took a little time to work the lather into my hair, but it was not difficult. The shampoo rinses out easily.  After rinsing my hair, I was disappointed that it had that icky crunchy and slightly tangled feeling again.  However, I was able to comb through it with a wide toothed comb (ditched brushes years ago) and did not have to use conditioner, leave in or otherwise.  If you happened to need conditioner, you would not need much, and I would suggest using a leave in rather than a rinse out.  My hair softened as it dried (naturally) and miracle of miracles, it has body!  It is so soft that I am having trouble keeping my hands out of it. I am sold and will continue using this product as well as try to convert the rest of my family. I will add an update in a couple of weeks. Please feel free to ask questions.</li>
            <li> When I was considering buying this beause of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s low toxicity rating, I read reviews tangled hair after using it until the other junk had been washed out of their hair. and complaints about inadequate lathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found neither to be true. It lathers just fine for me, and my hair wasn&#x27;t tangled at all even after the first time use. I do seem to be using a little more of it than I&#x27;d like to (at t his price) -- that may account for why I&#x27;m not having lathering problems, eh??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that there isn&#x27;t a handy dispenser type top. I solved that by decanting the shampoo into a cheap ketchup-style squeeze bottle from the Dollar Store. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is an effective all natural shampoo based on my one time use. Over the years I have tried dozens and I&#x27;d definitely put this in the top 5. There is one thing you should understand though as noted on the ingredients list - There are 3 cleansers in this shampoo 1) Soap Nuts 2) Vegetable (Coconut) Soap just like a Dr Borners (I think they use olive oil soap) some people think this is just coconut oil, no it&#x27;s coconut oil converted to soap via saponification 3) Lauryl Glucoside (a sugar based soap which I understand is the primary soap in the  California Baby line)    I&#x27;m going to use it for a week and post an update.</li>
            <li> I have used NaturOli Soap Nuts Shampoo before and loved it.  This time I found it on amazon.com for the best price.  Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong shampoo, Normal to Dry Hair, I should have ordered Normal to Oily hair.  Amazon.com was understanding and let me return my used twice item and purchase the one I needed.  I&#x27;m a happy customer with great hair and I feel good about the chemicals I am NOT putting on my hair.</li>
            <li> Last year I decided to look for a new shampoo without all the harsh chemicals and found this. It has been the best shampoo ever for me. I used conditioner with it for the first few months because I could not imagine washing my hair and not using conditioner, as I have long, frizzy hair. But finally I got up the courage to do it, and that&#x27;s when this product really started to work. My hair is incredibly shiny, soft, and manageable. A comb runs right through it after washing with no problem. I&#x27;m down to washing twice a week and have never been so happy. Plus a bottle lasts for months!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this. My scalp was very dry with crusty patches throughout my scalp. All that has cleared up slowly by using this shampoo. It must have been caused by all the store bought shampoo&#x27;s and I changed brands every so often. The best part is that I don&#x27;t need a conditional using this shampoo. It didn&#x27;t work right away, but it wasn&#x27;t long that I realized that I didn&#x27;t need a conditional anymore. I&#x27;m just careful the first time I comb through it and then I style as usual.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, it lathers and cleans well but doesn&#x27;t overdry your hair. And because my hair is not dry and tangled after shampooing, I only use a leave in conditioner for styling. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product smells good and is a nice consistency, however it did tend to make my hair feel a little dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to purchase my 3rd bottle of this shampoo because I have the HARDEST time with shampoos breaking my scalp out.  I get huge red itchy flaky bumps when using normal shampoo and hairsprays (guessing sulfate allergy if not other ingredients also).  I&#x27;ve tried so many different \\&quot;natural shampoos\\&quot; and this is the one shampoo I&#x27;ve found that has completely resolved all of my issues.  I use this almost every day and some days use [[ASIN:B0006NH946 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Tea Tree, 32-Ounce]] (although this leaves a weird film on my hair) - but makes it really great when I go to do cute braids because it holds REALLY well.  I will also (maybe every 2 weeks) use Neutrogena&#x27;s Tar Dandruff shampoo just to make sure I have no flakes.  This smell repulses me so I don&#x27;t use it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that it is drying.  I do use a conditioner with it on the ends of my hair with no problems.  I know it recommends not to use conditioner.  FYI: I have extremely long hair that&#x27;s not real thick and dyed.  I do not get the \\&quot;greasies\\&quot; by the end of the day with this shampoo.  My hair honestly looks and feels the best it has in years!  I think people feel like they&#x27;re losing hair because I notice when my hair is wet it tangles quite a bit.  Hence the reason for using conditioner.  So when it&#x27;s wet I try to not comb or yank it too much.</li>
            <li> The company sounds awesome, and I just knew I was gonna love this shampoo.  I use organic, natural, fragrance-free beauty products always and pay attention to what the Environmental Working Group says.  After the first (and only) time I used it, I had the tangled, matted mess that other reviewers have mentioned, so I used a microscopic-sized bit of conditioner to get a comb through my hair.  Then when my hair dried, I realized it smelled just plain awful.  It&#x27;s an odor I call unscented scent.  To anyone who has tried a lot of unscented products, you know the smell I&#x27;m talking about.  Another reviewer called it plasticky.  For some reason, I can&#x27;t stand that smell and it bothered me even outside on a windy day.  Sad to say, I&#x27;ll have to return it and continue the search.</li>
            <li> Too many shampoo brands brag how soft and manageable our hair will be if we use their product.  This soap nut shampoo is a winner.  It actually performs they way its meant to.  I have very dry hair and used all kinds of organic and expensive products and after blow drying my hair still was straw-like.  I used this one time without any followup conditioner or serum, went ahead and blow dried my hair and it actually felt soft.  I was stunned.  I had volume,, shine and plenty of softness.  Yay a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and I would recommend it to any one! I used it one time, and after shampooing my hair twice, it turned out very clean and shiny.  I love the fact, that the shampoo is organic and not like all the other shampoos that have chemicals and cause itching of the scalp. I will definitely&lt;br /&gt;purchase it again. Thank you so much, I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> GREAT for my sons dry scalp</li>
            <li> Used it twice and I&#x27;m now throwing it away...Lost clumps of hair and hair lost life completely as if I washed it with some detergent....Worst shampoo ever!!! DON&#x27;T USE IT !!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the NaturOli Shampoo Extreme Nut for dry hair.  It leaves the hair feeling clean; I was hoping for a bit more moisture.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this shampoo is that it has no harmful chemicals. EWG&#x27;s skindeep website gives it a score of 2, which is pretty good. All I wanted was an all natural shampoo, which I believe this is.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, so I was used to using a volumizing shampoo/conditioner combo. I have the challenge of getting my scalp clean without drying my ends out by excessive exposure to shampoo, and also that will allow my hair to have natural volume.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is naturally moisture-rich, and I do need more product to get my hair clean with it, because it is not as detergent- like as most shampoos. Overall, though, it does get my scalp and hair clean, and seems to keep it healthier, and that bottle lasts a long time. Plus, even though I continue to blow- out straight all the time, my natural wavy/curl texture has come back after using it for a short period. Even though it is not a volumizing product, my natural bounce, and shine, too, seems to be back, in place of artificial, ruffled-cuticle volume, and silicone- enhanced shine.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, and I wish they did have a separate conditioner for long, frequently heat- styled hair, but I just ordered their Moroccan oil, so I hope that will help to maintain my ends in combination with another brand&#x27;s light rinse-out conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am glad having chosen this natural product. It does what it has promised.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for two months and I do not find the same result from&lt;br /&gt;A regular shampoo. It has given my color-treated hair shine and chemical-&lt;br /&gt;Free texture and cleanliness. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo since five months. I have tried lots of shampoos before but this is the best one I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;My hair fall rate has reduced. My hair looks healthy. I wash my hair everyday so I feel this is the best shampoo for me as its CHEMICAL FREE!!!</li>
            <li> For reference: I&#x27;m a man with normal medium-length hair and I wash my hair and beard every day. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but compliments for this shampoo. The first days were a bit weird, since it would make my hair &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; together while I was washing it (although it went away as soon as I got dry) but this feeling disappeared after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually a &amp;#34;rinse maniac&amp;#34; and I spend a long time scrubbing under running water to make sure I got rid of all the soap. With this shampoo however I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;m covered with a film of soap/chemical residue afterwards: everything just goes away with the water. And it&#x27;s probably not just a feeling, since the spots I used to have on my shoulders have completely disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a nice side effect: I&#x27;ve received praise on how soft my beard is since I started using this shampoo. What more could a man ask for?</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft and silky, very shiny, I have very way hair and this shampoo makes my hair straight, no need for heat. You do need quite a bit of it though, hair doesn&#x27;t feel silky while its wet but it does once it dries. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> it really cleans the hair and leaves it shiny</li>
            <li> I had just moved into a place that has hard water, with apparently a very high iron content. After living in a house with whole house water purification and water softener, I was shocked when my hair started getting gummy feeling after I washed it! Not only did it feel gummy, but I couldn&#x27;t even get a brush or comb through it. I was seriously considering cutting my fine hair in a spike cut. I tried a shower water filter, but that only seemed to make it worse. I was near tears with how awful my hair was in this water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ordered this shampoo, received it yesterday, used it this morning and lo and behold, my hair is back to normal! I had to shampoo 3 times before I got a lather in my water. I was able to comb my hair and brush it. It is now silky, bouncy and shiny again! Yayyy!!!! I&#x27;m so happy!!! My scalp is still itching some, but I expect that to clear up in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try this shampoo especially if you have hard water challenges like I do! Love this!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and it has worked great.  It smells great, has a normal shampoo consistency and creates an excellent foam with just about a nickle sized amount (I use it as body wash as well).  I&#x27;m a male with short hair so I can&#x27;t comment on how it creates volume or shine or any of that other stuff girls like shampoos to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it does the job just as good as the store brand shampoo without all of the unnecessary harmful chemicals in it.  Overall I&#x27;m very happy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, so gentle. I used it and on a lark I didn&#x27;t use conditioner, just to see how it worked. My hair was soft, not fly-away and didn&#x27;t strip my hair which is very fine and color treated. It is gluten free and uses no funky chemicals.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and all the other products made by this manufacturer, you can really see the results literally with each passing day it is used.</li>
            <li> It seems like every natural shampoo i try, leaves me with a horribly itchy red scalp. I tried this shampoo and thought it was the cure but after longer use, I realized it is causing my itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of the skin2spirit products. They started offering shampoo and since I trust all of their products. Anyway I purchased a bottle or shampoo and conditioner from skin2spirit and I swear my itchy scalp was cured! Literally the same day! The bottles are smaller and cost the same but holy crap its worth it! I ran out of my shampoo and so while I waited for more to be in stock I purchased more of this NaturOli shampoo and the very same day I use it, my scalp is on fire! A week later still itching, I finally got my skin2spirit shampoo and another miracle happened! Same day, instant relief! While I use skin2spirit shampoo, my scalp doesnt itch at all. It is magic! I have tried sooooo many shampoos!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shampoo 5 or 6 times already. It&#x27;s ok, I guess. Never tried an organic one before. I do think I need some conditioner though. My hair feels kind of stiff, like a broom :-)</li>
            <li> my daughter and i have shiny smooth hair after using this luxurious shampoo! my sensitive scalp is happy. i will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> All I use for my hair.  Leaves it clean and not dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great... it&#x27;s literally the only natural shampoo that has ever worked for me. I buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Found this product looking for a non fragrances, hypo allergenic products.  My hair has more volume, much less frizz, and feels good. It does have a slight non offensive nut fragrance, but since it&#x27;s natural and not a commercial artificial fragrance, it has not exacerbate my allergies, asthma, or COPD.  These kinds of products are very hard to find, as I find products labeled hypo allergenic and baby products to be very offensive and triggers of asthma attacks.  I use it as a bubble bath too.</li>
            <li> will continue to purchase great product</li>
            <li> I started using this product about six months ago.  As some other reviewers have said, there is an adjustment period; my hair was difficult to comb through (I opted not to continue with a chemical conditioner after switching).  However, after about 10-14 days it normalized, and I haven&#x27;t looked back since.  I still don&#x27;t use any conditioner, and my hair is soft and shiny and has never looked better.  I have very fine, oily hair, and this has given it a lot more body (probably because it&#x27;s not weighed down by all the so-called &amp;#34;volumizing products&amp;#34; I was using before.  I also think it will help me grow it longer as there is less breakage and fewer split ends.  You have to follow the directions and do the double application, which is not a big deal I don&#x27;t think.  I will continue using this as long as they&#x27;re selling it (hopefully forever!).  I love to get great results while supporting a great company.</li>
            <li> Anytime someone switches from typical shampoo to chemical free or completely raw and organic methods of cleansing their hair, you have to understand the detox period.  When I first started the no-shampoo route, I did a TON of research and then started making my own products of raw and organic ingredients.  First, however, I used a clay detox on my hair (the one I used was Morrocco Method Zen Detox), which helped in removing years of built up chemicals and impurities.  After that I tried a few homemade products, first being a mixture of pure organic coconut milk and 100% aloe vera gel (which I retrieved from my own aloe plant).  The coconut milk and gel mixture was better as a conditioner (left my hair very greasy), so I added emu oil and put it on the ends as a conditioner and it worked great.  For the shampoo, a 1 to 3 mixture of raw organic honey and water was the winner.  I used it only on my scalp and it was amazing and inexpensive.  The problem with that was I had to make the mixture each time I washed my hair, as raw honey will ferment after just a little while when mixed with water.  I did some searching for an easier solution that was completely chemical free and came across this product.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I did not experience that sticky dry mess that others have complained about.  I am certain this is because I have removed chemicals from my haircare products for months now, so I am done with the detox.  This shampoo has a very subtle smell to it, and it&#x27;s nothing at all unpleasant.  I did have to condition my hair afterward because my hair is on the dry side, so I used aloe vera gel from my plant and emu oil (left it in, did not rinse it out) and used a boar hair bristle brush after, and my hair came out looking and feeling great.  This product lathered a bit more than what I am used to when using chemical free products, which was a nice surprise.  I have also ordered the conditioner but since it was shipped separate I have not received it yet.  The only reason I am giving this a four start rating instead of five is because my hair had a lot of static and was a little more frizzy than I was used to with the honey mixture.  I&#x27;ll update after about a month of using this product, as it&#x27;s hard to give a full fair review after just a few shampoos.  Also, if it helps any, I have red, course hair that is curly and frizzy in some areas and completely straight in other areas.  While my hair is course, it is thinning up top - and I am only 32 - hence why I&#x27;ve decided to go the no chemical route...I want to maintain what I have!!  So far, I feel this will be a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo as I was fed up with all the chemicals in current hair care products. I have oily, thin (and thinning hair). I have used almost all of the first bottle I bought and have been more than pleased with the results. Does a good job of cleaning the hair without stripping it so dry it is unmanageable so I do not have to use conditioner with it. It is expensive but a little goes a long way. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I was slightly skeptical at first about soap nuts but after giving it a try it is a good product.  My hair adjusted to using it quite quickly and I typically only have to wash my hair every couple of days now.  I can&#x27;t say my hair is super soft by any means but it feels healthy and is manageable.  For me a big bonus was there is not a strong smell to it as I am allergic to so many scents used even in natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> Low toxicity, and great for my hair! My hair still itches from time to time even using this product. I think it dries it out a bit so I am considering using conditioner with it. It is a bit pricey but if you do not have long hair it will last you for several months. My hair is much fuller using this product, and I notice a significant difference in the amount of hair I lose daily. It is normal to see hair strands from time to time, but before I switched from products using harsh detergents I was noticing more hair loss. Now I may see a strand from time to time. A big improvement!</li>
            <li> I read almost all the reviews good and bad about this product and decided to take the plunge and purchase.  A few of the negative reviews worried me as I have long hair that is very curly and frizzy.  I used to have beautiful healthy, low maintenance hair with a lot of body that had a slight wave to it but after my three sons were born it changed texture. At one point I began losing a great deal of hair and it was coming out by the handful when I washed it and you could see my scalp which was devastating. After several agonizing years I was eventually diagnosed with severe hypothyroidism.  You can imagine my trepidation at using this product after reading the negative reviews but there were more positive detailed reviews and so here I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I was not expecting the results this shampoo gave my hair.  I was very skeptical about not using a conditioner but I followed the directions.  I was expecting my hair to mat up while shampooing but it did not and I was able to run a wide tooth comb through it with ease which really surprised me.  I always allow my hair to dry naturally and was very pleasantly surprised to see my hair fall in ringlets rather than a frizzy mess and it was SHINING. I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer or any styling products on my hair because of the damage my hypothyroidism has caused but I do roll my hair on large velcro rollers and then flat iron and we all know the damage a flat iron does but I have no other option.  My hair looked amazing when I was finished, beautiful, full of life and I am THRILLED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished shampooing it again and it looks so healthy even though still damp.  I am so excited to have found this shampoo and experience these great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing over and over and plan on gifting to family members</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair, and since I cut my hair, started using this, and silicone free conditioner, my hair has been healthier and softer!</li>
            <li> love this shampoo for my naturally curly/dry/coarse hair</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have been buying organic, non-toxic shampoos for about 20 years now and this is the best.  I can&#x27;t believe they figured out how to make a non-toxic shampoo that replicates a highly toxic one!  I don&#x27;t have a reason to search any further.</li>
            <li> I heard about soap nuts but wanted to try pre-made shampoo before getting into making my own (to rule out user error). My son and I have dry scalps so we are looking for a natural solution. We&#x27;ve tried handfuls of various shampoos, each time heading more towards natural choices. Our last experiment was cleansing our hair/scalp by using baking soda and water as shampoo for several months. It was good for detoxifying but we didn&#x27;t care for the straw texture it gave our hair. I understand this is a temporary solution good for detoxifying and then a natural shampoo is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NaturOli Soap Nut/Soapberry Shampoo has been our best natural shampoo choice yet! It foams nicely, rinsing out easily and there is very little amount needed to shampoo my long 14&amp;#34; locks. I&#x27;ve had less hair loss and less dry scalp. The only improvement would be a fragrance, which I can add by adding a few drops of essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product! I will be purchasing it as my &#x27;go to&#x27; shampoo!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is terrific. I have very curly hair that dries out easily. With this shampoo, I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner. Another plus is that I only have to use stay in conditioner on the ends of my hair. Can&#x27;t wait to use it up so I can make my own from the nuts.</li>
            <li> This is a new product for me also, but so far I like it.  I have only used it a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product but it&#x27;s not at all appropriate for dry hair and sensitive/dry scalp. Even though the label says normal to dry,  it&#x27;s best for normal hair types.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair soft with no build up and I can go without washing my hair for a couple of days, now. Best of all I do not have any sensitivities to it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo I have used so far. I did not have a hair loss condition before, but after using this shampoo for two months, I almost lost fifty percent of my hair. The shampoo made my hair extremely dry and irritated my scalp and I even noticed red scars on my scalp. Since I have a desire to use natural/herbal stuff rather than putting chemicals on my body and that  tempted me to buy this shampoo. Now I&#x27;m back to my old Matrix shampoo and my scalp is at least free form itching. I gave one star only because it did not strip the color from my hair otherwise would have given a zero rating.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am not a huge name product fan. I never really by exspensive stuff for my hair because I&#x27;ve never had to. I always had really pretty hair until recently. Over the past two years I have done much damage by bleaching and coloring and of course hot flat irons and blow drying. The bleaching did me in and I decided I needed to go natural to get the shine and beauty back to my hair. It&#x27;s been a process. In the past couple of months I always wear my hair back because it looks so bad down even after washing and conditioning. I&#x27;ve stopped using heat products and it helps but my scalp was still getting SO DRY and ITCHY! It was gross. I saw this shampoo and it was either this or the Kiss my Face Organics shampoo which does have a matching conditioner. I chose this since it says you don&#x27;t need anything else with it. Got it in two days on my prime membership have used it TWICE in two days and I LOVE it. SO far so good only problem is slight static adding a slight poof of body to my hair, but it is November in Myrtle Beach so the weather is cold hot cold hot/with humid air/ so no harm done. I will try and update this in a few weeks if anything changes but so far it&#x27;s great. Just a little pricey for 16 ounces, I have long hair so I use a lot of shampoo. By the way, this does lather....some of the organic shampoos I saw didn&#x27;t/</li>
            <li> Works good, I have frizzy hair so i use a organic conditioner.  It seems to dry my hair out a bit, but is slowly helping my eczema on my scalp. I&#x27;m,also using it on face and ears in the shower, seems to clean skin well without irritating skin.</li>
            <li> I really love that this shampoo is free of all the bad stuff in conventional shampoos. It does get a little getting used to the first few washes because my hair was really hard to brush through afterwards. I would recommend pairing with an all natural conditioner. I have very fine thin hair and could never go a day without washing it because it would get too oily. I skipped a day of washing my hair and I didn&#x27;t even notice. I would defiantly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I thought it was age and stress making my hair fall out. I accepted large chunks of skin in my hairbrush after a shower. I wondered why my thick shiny hair was getting thin and dull. I needed anti frizz just to get a brush through my shoulder length hair even after using conditioner. Then my wife told me preservatives in shampoo could wreck your hair and scalp. Several years ago I started using a &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner. It made everything worse. I think the cheap one was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this about a week. Everything they say is true, and better. My wife and I both noticed an amazing difference after just one use. After a week less hair is falling out and no chunks of scalp in my brush.my scalp still itches and needs more time to heal completely. I can brush my hair after a shampoo and I no longer need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short this is an amazing product. Unfortunately that is largely because there is a huge industry wrecking us.</li>
            <li> For those with allergies or sensitivities, this is not unscented as advertised.  It has a floral scent, relatively light, but still enough to set off allergies.  If that&#x27;s not a problem for you, this may be a fine product.  I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Soap nut products are great. This shampoo leaves your hair feeling clean and doesnt strip your hair of nutrients. I don&#x27;t have oily hair but use to always wash my hair daily to keep it looking radiant. You can go a few days in between washing your hair with this stuff. I also recommend soap nut dish soap and laundry soap. Fragrance free, no allergens and toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find a non-high-chemical shampoo that also rinses out well.  Burt&#x27;s Bees was great for this for a while, but then they changed their formula and it was like getting Bees Wax out of your hair.  This stuff works well, gives your hair a clean, full feel and without residue.  In my experience using it for a few weeks, it can tend to dry your hair a bit, so I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with those who say you don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner with it.  I went without a conditioner for the first two weeks and it was too dry and wiry, so I started conditioning again and I like the result.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the information about this product, I thought it would be perfect for my hair.  I could not wait to receive it.  I have shoulder blade length, color treated blonde hair, with a bit of a natural wave, not thin, nice body.  I currently use a keratin based shampoo and also get keratin treatments from my salon when I get my hair done.  It is very healthy and shiny.  I do use leave in conditions also.  From the description of this shampoo, I thought it would be good because I would not have to use multiple conditioners. I even wondered if it would leave my hair too oily (because of the description).  BUT, it is acting like a CLARIFIER on my hair.  I canNOT get a comb or my HANDS through it after washing my hair with the Soap Nuts.  It is nice and squeaky clean and a subtle shine, but it looks out of control !!!!  There is NO way I cannot use conditioners with it.  For me, it is NOT worth the price, because I still have to use the conditioners I am using now. Maybe, it would be okay for shorter hair or thinner hair. I do not know. But, I will NOT be purchasing this product again.  The Company did do a great job on Brand Messaging and Graphics, though.  It DOES pull you in....... I would think about your specific hair needs before purchasing...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo! It is amazing. I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo, and had been using desert essence coconut, but alas, that has sulfates in it still. This shampoo makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I can see that this product contains as limited chemicals as possible. It leaves a little rough feel to the hair after use, which might not be a good thing to many people, but that reminds me of using soap nuts which gives lather to hair, but still feels not so moisturised. It is a natural product and I love it for that. I don&#x27;t mind using a conditioner later to get a good feel. A very nice product if you are trying to keep away from sulphates and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> No chemicals, no fragrance. Excellent for sensitive skin. Good to add other oils to such as Tea Tree Oil. Cleans well. Will order again. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this shampoo noting that every shampoo company says their is the best.  But this one lives up to it reputation.  I have really dry hair and NaturOil really makes my hair shiny and soft.  It takes some time to get use to since it seems at first that your hair seems dry and tangly but once you comb your wet hair you will notice that it really isn&#x27;t that hard to comb thru.  it gets better with prolong use.  Another great attribute is that you don&#x27;t need conditioner, your hair will be soft and shiny without it.</li>
            <li> Started using this shampoo last week, and noticed results almost immediately. Hair is clean and soft, and does not tangle as much as it used to. Buying two more bottles to stock up :-)</li>
            <li> I am on a quest to reduce the chemicals in my life. That is all I use for shampoo. It is great.</li>
            <li> Worked good on my hair.</li>
            <li> Good for most hair. It isn&#x27;t great for oily hair. It doesn&#x27;t lather which is expected since it&#x27;s botanical.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It has no scent, lathers wonderfully, feels great on my scalp, causes no irritation, and helps my hair remain healthy. And, best of all, it&#x27;s all natural. The price may be high, but the shampoo is worth it. I don&#x27;t care that some of the ingredients are organic, but I do care they are all completely natural. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fragrance free due to health issues and so my daughter has to be too. I love my NaturOli but hadn&#x27;t tried it for dry hair since mine runs oily.  I got a bottle for my very picky, (and whiny about giving up her products) daughter to try on her long color treated hair... She loves it!!  Thank goodness! I was so tired of the fight. This is good if you are fragrance free due to asthma, MCS, or migraines.  I have all 3.</li>
            <li> My daughter had pretty severe eczema, but I stopped using regular laundry detergent, fabric softener, and shampoo. We&#x27;ve been using for about 6 months, and she has been so much better since the switch! There&#x27;s no scent left behind, and she still gets clean.  I would definitely recommend for those who have moderate eczema!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few months now, and I am very pleased with the results. My hair feels softer than ever and I do not need to use a conditioner. I love that it is natural, and I feel that it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The most helpful thing I can offer is to read lots of reviews before you buy, and take each review with a large grain of salt if the person&#x27;s hair type is different than yours.  This product seems to work well on certain hair types/lengths and not as well on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I bought and starting using this product about five months ago.  Her hair is fine and down past her shoulders, my hair is a little thicker/wavier and about to my ears.  She lasted less than a week with the product and switched to something else.  I&#x27;m still using the product and plan to continue doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bought this shampoo is that it is the least toxic stuff I could find that actually cleans hair and rinses well.  The Environmental Working Group Skin Deep website rates various cosmetics on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being most toxic.  Almost no products get a zero or a ten, and this product scored a 1 out of 10, which is about as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;toxins\\&quot; in this product that even show up on EWG&#x27;s list are Citric acid, Guar Gum and Aloe Vera, none of which most people would consider toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison, most shampoo/conditioner brands advertised on television seem to score about 4 or 5 (moderately toxic) on EWG&#x27;s scale because they contain fragrances that can cause allergies and various chemicals that are hard to pronounce like Methylchloroisothiazolinone or DMDM Hydantoin, and of course Sodium Laureth Sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One 16 oz bottle of NaturOli shampoo lasted me four months when using a generous amount every other day.  The $20 price tag seems steep at first, but most people who use this product (including me) do not need conditioner, so that offsets the initial sticker shock a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not a fan of this product after the first couple uses.  Things I didn&#x27;t like included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very little lather, wasn&#x27;t used to that&lt;br /&gt;- My hair would mat up when wet and I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through it without hair breaking off&lt;br /&gt;- It was harder to brush my hair when getting out of the shower due to tangles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hair felt much lighter than before, if I hadn&#x27;t read other Amazon reviews I would have given up after a few days.  However various reviewers had noted that the symptoms I was experiencing were just my hair \\&quot;detoxing\\&quot;.  I thought that sounded like B.S. but went along with it, and sure enough after a week or so my hair became much more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test though for me was, could this shampoo handle chlorine?  I swim almost every day from April to November in an over-chlorinated pool and need a shampoo that can get the chlorine out and de-tangle my hair so that it feels smooth.  To my surprise, this shampoo performs quite nicely in that respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my wife, who has much longer hair than me, she switched to Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo/Conditioner and has been happy with that brand, which scores 2 out of 10 for toxicity on EWG&#x27;s website and is also a little more affordable when bought at a grocery store.  If you try the NaturOli product and it isn&#x27;t your thing, the Kiss My Face product is a good fallback.ut hair breaking off&lt;br /&gt;- It was harder to brush my hair when getting out of the shower due to tangles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hair felt much lighter than before, if I hadn&#x27;t read other Amazon reviews I would have given up after a few days.

            <li> I definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants to use an organic product that is earth-friendly...it works really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using the shampoo for some time, I began to notice my salon-colored hair losing it&#x27;s color very quickly, after two to three washes. I asked my stylist what she thought the problem could be.  She asked if I had changed my shampoo, and wanted to know what kind I was using. After telling her about this product, she immediately told me it was stripping the color from my hair, and that it&#x27;s just too harsh for color-treated hair. She also said I should always make sure to buy a shampoo that is specifically made for color-treated hair. Lesson learned!  So, if you color your hair, you might want to stick with your normal shampoo!</li>
