    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is just so great!</li>
            <li>Price is extremely good considering you get 60 pads per jar!</li>
            <li>Great value for the money</li>
            <li>The ingredient list is great.</li>
            <li>They smell very nice and leave my face feeling great.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>My skin texture is greatly improved and it is holding moisture much better.</li>
            <li>I love the exfoliating pads and can see a difference in my oily/combo skin in just a week!  </li>
            <li>The price is nice.</li>
            <li>After I put on there collagen and amazing skin, smooth, soft and very very nice!</li>
            <li>Works okay.  </li>
            <li>Updated April 2014: I continue to use the pads and still love them.</li>
            <li>I love this product, also recommended it to my friends and family members.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just used up my two jars and will not be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li>Nice pads for light exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of St. Ives products and have most of them, so when I stumbled upon this one I thought why not give it a try.  </li>
            <li>; while making sure I don&#x27;t use any products that would increase my mild rosacea, so I dropped over a hundred bucks to get a Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li>After finding out that scrubs can be too harsh for your skin this was the perfect product to switch to.</li>
            <li>And they are amazing for gentle AHA exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Very effective for the prevention of nodular acne on the chin, blackheads on the nose, and any keritinic accumulations if used twice daily.</li>
            <li>Super convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>are very convenient and obviously very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking clean and tighter...</li>
            <li>and I still glow after I use the pads on my clean face before moisturizing..</li>
            <li>I have good skin to begin with, but as I ease further into my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all, and they smell nice as well.</li>
            <li>I bought them because all of the ingredients are safe to use while pregnant, but will continue to use them because I like them so much.</li>
            <li>I purchased them and after 2 weeks of using them I decided I liked them well enough to part with the Clarisonic!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It will take you a hot minute to familiarize yourself on how to separate the pads.</li>
            <li>The results were as expected (nothing drastic but nice improvement in texture).</li>
            <li>Where I noticed a huge difference was on my arms where the Origins pads were actually making sun damage spots disappear.  </li>
            <li>and it really just seems like an added step that doesn&#x27;t need to be added.  </li>
            <li>My face really seems to like the ingredients</li>
            <li>However, I do wonder sometimes about the quality of the ingredients for such a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could easily do my whole face with one pad</li>
            <li>The smell is unusual (brighter noses can detect the lactic acid) but it is not offensive.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that I do not have to use as much moisturizer as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It does gently exfoliate.</li>
            <li>However, all the pads were soaked very well and had a very soft texture.</li>
            <li>I use serums and high end creams as well as Retin A</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>They are thin, yet strong, and super saturated without being \\&quot;drippy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It has a screw-top lid that has kept the product from drying out so far.</li>
            <li>It has not dried out my skin nor broke it out.</li>
            <li>so I was interested in seeing if these pads performed as well as a more expensive pad I tried by Origins.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time with exfolliants as I have very dry mature skin and most exfolliants make it even drier and my skin takes a couple of days to pull out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Always was shopping and trying new ones.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that they would dry out by the time that I got to the end of the jar, but the last was just as moist as the first.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin (even in summer) and tend to avoid a lot of products that dry my skin even more due to their chemical formulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although, I can say that this has effectively replaced an expensive sugar scrub I was using with better results and less mess!</li>
            <li>These actually did not dry out my skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Never felt dry or tight even without moisturizer.</li>

            <li> The smell could be less noticeable.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Really works wonders to remove the dull dead skin and lightens pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li> &amp; Price:&lt;br /&gt;It is not packaged in excessive materials.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating Pads are hard to find on the store shelf.</li>
            <li> brands have enough solution in the pads for me to use them on my face, neck and forearms (though the St. Ives pads are so thin it was difficult to get just one pad at a time out of the jar).  </li>
            <li> It is the only disappointment of my purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are thin round pads.</li>
            <li> They are VERY small and thin but there is plenty of solution on them to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sad that St Ives is phasing these out.</li>
            <li> Smells weird.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say these do not measure</li>
            <li> I am still looking for an acceptable replacement for this product, since St. Ives has discontinued it. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> St Ives Exfoliating Pads provide a &amp;#34;clean canvas&amp;#34; for the application of makeup.  Leaves my skin looking clean and tighter...big reduction in the appearance of enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sad that St Ives is phasing these out. My skin loves AHAs and these pads are very convenient and obviously very easy to use. They have a slight fruity smell and can make your face tingle a little after applying. My skin texture is greatly improved and it is holding moisture much better. I had a slight purging period where I had a few pimples pop up, but now my skin has had no new breakouts with a reduction in closed comodones</li>
            <li> I am still looking for an acceptable replacement for this product, since St. Ives has discontinued it. :(</li>
            <li> I use this product because it is recommended to use with another product that I am using. Exfoliating Pads are hard to find on the store shelf.</li>
            <li> I have good skin to begin with, but as I ease further into my 30&#x27;s I want to maintain that &amp;#34;youthful glow&amp;#34; while making sure I don&#x27;t use any products that would increase my mild rosacea, so I dropped over a hundred bucks to get a Clarisonic Mia. I had no complaints with it, but when I saw these pads I was intrigued. I purchased them and after 2 weeks of using them I decided I liked them well enough to part with the Clarisonic! They don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all, and they smell nice as well. I had a moment of panic thinking they&#x27;d been discontinued when I stopped seeing them on Walmart&#x27;s shelves, but St Ives assured their Facebook fans they had no plans to stop making them. Whew!</li>
            <li> I had no idea that there were two different kinds of exfoliation: chemical and physical. After finding out that scrubs can be too harsh for your skin this was the perfect product to switch to. I love the smell and the way it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Works okay.  Smells weird.  I prefer the 5% glycolic acid cream by Revive Labs, but I just bought these and now have to use them up.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for a year now. Good stuff</li>
            <li> Very effective for the prevention of nodular acne on the chin, blackheads on the nose, and any keritinic accumulations if used twice daily.</li>
            <li> Super convenient and easy to use. They smell very nice and leave my face feeling great.  I was concerned that they would dry out by the time that I got to the end of the jar, but the last was just as moist as the first.  I bought them because all of the ingredients are safe to use while pregnant, but will continue to use them because I like them so much.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of St. Ives products and have most of them, so when I stumbled upon this one I thought why not give it a try.  I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s needed.  I&#x27;ve used it for a while now and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin or texture and it really just seems like an added step that doesn&#x27;t need to be added.  Quality product as all St. Ives products are but really not needed.</li>
            <li> I am a skin care snob usually but these pads really work. They are VERY small and thin but there is plenty of solution on them to cover my face and neck. My face glows after I use these. I am now on auto ship. Updated April 2014: I continue to use the pads and still love them. I use serums and high end creams as well as Retin A but these pads have a place in my skin care regimen and will until I can&#x27;t get them any longer. My face really seems to like the ingredients and I still glow after I use the pads on my clean face before moisturizing..</li>
            <li> I love this product, also recommended it to my friends and family members.&lt;br /&gt;Really works wonders to remove the dull dead skin and lightens pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product.</li>

My only complaint is that the pads are a bit difficult to separate from each other.  They are thin, yet strong, and super saturated without being \\&quot;drippy\\&quot;.  Great value for the money and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I used to use St. Ives products all the time so I was interested in seeing if these pads performed as well as a more expensive pad I tried by Origins.  I&#x27;m sorry to say these do not measure up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brands have enough solution in the pads for me to use them on my face, neck and forearms (though the St. Ives pads are so thin it was difficult to get just one pad at a time out of the jar).  Where I noticed a huge difference was on my arms where the Origins pads were actually making sun damage spots disappear.  The St. Ives did nothing.  Nor did I see any effect on my face or neck.  I just used up my two jars and will not be purchasing more.  No matter how affordable they seem, they are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use these twice daily, and they are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is just so great! And they are amazing for gentle AHA exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with exfolliants as I have very dry mature skin and most exfolliants make it even drier and my skin takes a couple of days to pull out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Always was shopping and trying new ones.  These actually did not dry out my skin and I looked at the before and after skin in a magnifying mirror and all I saw was smoother skin not drier skin by any means. Never felt dry or tight even without moisturizer. After I put on there collagen and amazing skin, smooth, soft and very very nice!</li>
            <li> I picked this up for everyday use. I have dry skin (even in summer) and tend to avoid a lot of products that dry my skin even more due to their chemical formulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging &amp; Price:&lt;br /&gt;It is not packaged in excessive materials. The jar is recyclable. It has a screw-top lid that has kept the product from drying out so far. Price is extremely good considering you get 60 pads per jar! Using one or even two pads per day still makes the cost acceptable for the amount you get. However, I do wonder sometimes about the quality of the ingredients for such a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:&lt;br /&gt;These are thin round pads. It is the only disappointment of my purchase. It will take you a hot minute to familiarize yourself on how to separate the pads. However, all the pads were soaked very well and had a very soft texture. I could easily do my whole face with one pad but I like to get my neck and decollete as well so I use two pads daily. The smell is unusual (brighter noses can detect the lactic acid) but it is not offensive. It has not dried out my skin nor broke it out. I have noticed my skin is softer (I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over two months now) and looks quite refreshed. Keep in mind I also use a separate moisturizer and a serum. Although, I can say that this has effectively replaced an expensive sugar scrub I was using with better results and less mess! I also noticed that I do not have to use as much moisturizer as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product. The ingredient list is great. The price is nice. The results were as expected (nothing drastic but nice improvement in texture). It does gently exfoliate. The pads could be thicker. The smell could be less noticeable. I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Nice pads for light exfoliation. My skin is smoother and brightened. I found these at my local Big Lots for $3.50.</li>
