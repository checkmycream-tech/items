            <li>Amazing drill and</li>
            <li>These drills work amazing</li>
            <li>I can now do my own mani-pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Comes in handy for taking off gel at the pedi tub.</li>
            <li>Nail drill works nicely and came very quickly!</li>
            <li>very strong, thou</li>
            <li>Very easy.</li>
            <li>Works great, very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good!</li>
            <li>It was awesome it came in early</li>
            <li>but I love to use this on my clients or on my own nails.  </li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best items I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>I love it, and all the bits that come with it were nice too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so small/slender and easy to manage compared to the grinder I use for my dogs nails, that I now use this instead!  </li>
            <li>This device is not so noisy, light-weighted and very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to use for me to do my own gel nails at home</li>
            <li>love this for my nails</li>
            <li>Love this product use it almost every day on clients just wish it came with more grit papers</li>
            <li>Love it works just as I thought it would like the ones in the salon.</li>
            <li>but I can always purchase more.</li>
            <li>I ordered this drill on the 12th of May and got it on May 16th, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>My toe never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love this drill.  </li>
            <li>Love love love.  </li>
            <li>I love how convenient it is</li>
            <li>There are several plug ins that allow me to shape my nail perfectly.</li>
            <li>This drill was very inexpensive and works great for the price.</li>
            <li>And being electric instead of requiring batteries is much more convenient and inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li>i love it makes doing acrylic nails faster and easier</li>
            <li>It has different level settings so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>...took me by surprise, but I am not complaining :)</li>
            <li>love the compact size</li>
            <li>It seems to be just okay for me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this tool.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, IMO, is that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re mostly surrounded by</li>
            <li>Great, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Product works really well for the price!!!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Overall great product love it!</li>
            <li>Works perfect, and also has a long cord.</li>
            <li>for how cheap this was, boy is it strong!</li>
            <li>but the bits didn&#x27;t even fit into the top part so</li>
            <li>Overall, great and easy product!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good drill overall and works great</li>
            <li>It also does not irritate the cuticles as much as other electric nail files do which is great!</li>
            <li>Easy to change the bits.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to work and has a lot of power.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and put together.</li>
            <li>This is my first drill for me to do my own acrylics at home.</li>
            <li>but it took the calluses of my feet just fine.</li>
            <li>I paid more for shopping than the tool itself, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Works great for personal use, not to mention the price was excellant also.</li>
            <li>it was so cheap..</li>
            <li>My mom gave me a drill she used to use in school and the bits on that one fit this one</li>
            <li>The price is cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight.  </li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>the drill is not the best quality and the RPM&#x27;s go way too fast for low speed around the cuticle</li>
            <li>but no that expression definitely does not apply to this drill it works great and is very powerful.</li>
            <li>product is decent IF you are cautious, but perhaps the best part about it is that the tools for engraving patterns in nails, for shaping nails, etc., fit the battery operated version of this that runs anywhere from $3 - $8 online in Amazon &amp; $6 - $8 in stores last time I checked.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful for the price too.</li>
            <li>Even on the lowest speed it is very fast - you have to touch it to your nails very lightly.</li>
            <li>Product is very powerful and it comes with every on the picture.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This drill is powerful!</li>
            <li>Powerful litte buggar!</li>
            <li>and once you figure out how to adjust the settings than you are able to really go all out!</li>
            <li>I love the drill, it makes it easier to do acrylics, however I just received my drill on fri, it is now Tuesday and now the drill works when it wants to, it just stopped working</li>
            <li>Seem that it would work great but the bits did not fit correctly on the filing one the rest work just fine</li>
            <li>I give 3 stars due of great power but wasn&#x27;t what I thought</li>
            <li>and I did a fresh full set of acrylics on my self</li>
            <li>no tomorrow lol be careful when you first try it on yourself or anyone</li>
            <li>just right, works fine, nice long cord and power.</li>
            <li>Great little tool lots of power</li>
            <li>Great little tool, It works well in between pedicure/manicure to keep hands and feet looking neat.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for someone who wants to try doing their own acrylic nails at home and doesn&#x27;t  want to spend too much at first like me.</li>
            <li>Some of the best friends I had as a young person were my grandmother&#x27;s friends (some of whom were old enough to be HER parents!)</li>
            <li>So far there are more tips in the kit than I can imagine finding a use for.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>I might as well just order a much better one for ths price I would be paying to get it fixed.</li>
            <li>Most people who do things like that for the elderly find themselves pleasantly surprised by the friendship.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It came with some rarely seen manicuring bits and plenty of sanding bands.</li>
            <li>First one was defective but they sent another one out quick.</li>
            <li>Nice but the lowest speed is still fast for my natural nail to the point where your nail bed gets hot.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with this if you want to make a living at it - get the right tools.</li>
            <li>It IS really good if you don&#x27;t want to get your nails cut down at the salon, but again, you can go too far too easily.</li>
            <li>It was very well wrapped during shipment and came quite quickly.</li>
            <li>if you want to fix your nails, and make them look better, this is definitely what you need.  </li>
            <li>The one star would be for the fast shiping!</li>
            <li>My old nail drill bits fit in it too</li>
            <li>However, it was not a huge deal as the company sent me a new hand piece which worked great.</li>
            <li>I have used it without any learning cycle at all really and would be surprised that anyone would not do so as easily.  </li>
            <li>If you really can&#x27;t afford it right away</li>
            <li>It took some time to get used to how it works, as it was more powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li>is I can get more precise and also round off the tips so that they&#x27;re not scratchy when dog jumps on you or &#x27;paws at you&#x27; for attention.  </li>
            <li>this is that it seems to have a pretty universal attachment part that i put my other bits into and used it like that.. worked great then...</li>
            <li>It might sound gross, but soak an older person&#x27;s feet in Ivory soap &amp; clean them off, then practice on their much thicker nails.</li>
            <li>it came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Been wishing my battery-powered one had more power for a long time; this is easy to use and definitely has oomph!</li>
            <li>I paid a crap ton more then the drill for shipping, but I am completely happy with my purchase and would very well recommend!!</li>
            <li>Worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The speed on this seems a bit fast for nails.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay a whole for a drill and selected this one based on reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to manipulate and the reason I grind my dog&#x27;s nails</li>
            <li>vibrates too much for me to use against my nails</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much, but when I did, this worked as described</li>
            <li>This drill will file off acrylic and real nail</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>l♡VE it so much.</li>
            <li>Some get really grumpy instead.</li>
            <li>Very upset with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery comes with different types of nail bits and sander, very powerful to be just a hand held.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to work with,  small and light.  </li>
            <li>This professional grade buffer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>So it does have various speeds which is cool.</li>
            <li>i put it on high speed and all it does is make my acrylic heat up and burn my nailbed.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is kind of hard to use if your not use to it.  </li>
            <li>In fact it looks quite normal.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and has all the tools you could possibly need.</li>
            <li>Its not hard to use at all nd its durable</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t have if I hadn&#x27;t just bought new polish</li>
            <li>I needed a new drill for my acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>I was afraid that it was going to be cheap because it was super cheap</li>
            <li>I was able to pick up some better bits at Harbor Freight but am disappointed that this came apart on the first use.</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised when the drill showed up the day after I ordered it!..</li>
            <li>and I finally found something that had enough power to file those babies down - LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>The drill is also very light makes it hard to hold without making it flimsy.  </li>
            <li>This is a very powerful little drill.</li>
            <li>It obviously got here way sooner then expected, and it works amazingly well its just as I expected.</li>
            <li>I bought one from Sally&#x27;s and took it back because it cost to much</li>
            <li>Whether you are a professional or not.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional</li>
            <li>Too much to send it back</li>
            <li>So basically I&#x27;m paying for it to get fixed..</li>
            <li>If you are trying to learn how to do this so you can make a living at it, I&#x27;d suggest getting a professional level Dremel-type tool instead, one that has a foot &amp; hand control.</li>
            <li>I will say one thing: DON&#x27;T use this thing on an old person&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised it works so well for this price.</li>
            <li>The items of this type are often so expensive when they do a good job.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and the price is definitely a steal!!</li>
            <li>This drills slowest setting is way to fast can&#x27;t really use it near my cuticles when sanding the acrylic one little slip or touch to the skin or cuticle</li>
            <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t discuss my toe fungus on line, but I have tried a podiatrist along with several medicines to rid myself of this toe fungus that afflicted one toe,  </li>
            <li>It burns to use overtop acrylic coating on the nail bed and forget about using it on bare nails for acrylic prep.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll still need to be careful, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it with less damage AND you will be doing an elderly person a huge favor by giving them a pedicure.</li>
            <li>you would think it would be better quality, but not only did it come broken</li>
            <li>Small but very efficient!!</li>
            <li>Less hot spots than my last dremmel.</li>
            <li>This thing is WAAAAAAY too fast for the average home user IMO.</li>
            <li>have to get use to it,it will take your nails down to their nubs,,,,,i like it ,but need to work with it a little more carefully.</li>
            <li>This little thing really had some power to it</li>
            <li>This little unit, for home use, is sturdy, works VERY well</li>
            <li>Unless Im just stupid lol.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s even better!!</li>
            <li> for the price very nice.</li>
            <li> This is mostly for acrylic and practice is required before you will perfect its use.</li>
            <li> Good for shaping edges and filing 3D decorations off.</li>
            <li> the ONE good thing abt</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for removing calcium buildup</li>

            <li> Amazing drill and</li>
            <li> These drills work amazing</li>
            <li> I can now do my own mani-pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Comes in handy for taking off gel at the pedi tub.</li>
            <li> Nail drill works nicely and came very quickly!</li>
            <li> very strong, thou</li>
            <li> Very easy.</li>
            <li> Works great, very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good!</li>
            <li> It was awesome it came in early</li>
            <li> but I love to use this on my clients or on my own nails.  </li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best items I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I love it, and all the bits that come with it were nice too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small/slender and easy to manage compared to the grinder I use for my dogs nails, that I now use this instead!  </li>
            <li> This device is not so noisy, light-weighted and very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Easy to use for me to do my own gel nails at home</li>
            <li> love this for my nails</li>
            <li> Love this product use it almost every day on clients just wish it came with more grit papers</li>
            <li> Love it works just as I thought it would like the ones in the salon.</li>
            <li> but I can always purchase more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this drill on the 12th of May and got it on May 16th, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> My toe never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I love this drill.  </li>
            <li> Love love love.  </li>
            <li> I love how convenient it is</li>
            <li> There are several plug ins that allow me to shape my nail perfectly.</li>
            <li> This drill was very inexpensive and works great for the price.</li>
            <li> And being electric instead of requiring batteries is much more convenient and inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li> i love it makes doing acrylic nails faster and easier</li>
            <li> It has different level settings so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> ...took me by surprise, but I am not complaining :)</li>
            <li> love the compact size</li>
            <li> It seems to be just okay for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tool.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , IMO, is that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re mostly surrounded by</li>
            <li> Great, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Product works really well for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall great product love it!</li>
            <li> Works perfect, and also has a long cord.</li>
            <li> for how cheap this was, boy is it strong!</li>
            <li> but the bits didn&#x27;t even fit into the top part so</li>
            <li> Overall, great and easy product!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good drill overall and works great</li>
            <li> It also does not irritate the cuticles as much as other electric nail files do which is great!</li>
            <li> Easy to change the bits.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to work and has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and put together.</li>
            <li> This is my first drill for me to do my own acrylics at home.</li>
            <li> but it took the calluses of my feet just fine.</li>
            <li> I paid more for shopping than the tool itself, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great for personal use, not to mention the price was excellant also.</li>
            <li> it was so cheap..</li>
            <li> My mom gave me a drill she used to use in school and the bits on that one fit this one</li>
            <li> The price is cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight.  </li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> the drill is not the best quality and the RPM&#x27;s go way too fast for low speed around the cuticle</li>
            <li> but no that expression definitely does not apply to this drill it works great and is very powerful.</li>
            <li> product is decent IF you are cautious, but perhaps the best part about it is that the tools for engraving patterns in nails, for shaping nails, etc., fit the battery operated version of this that runs anywhere from $3 - $8 online in Amazon &amp; $6 - $8 in stores last time I checked.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful for the price too.</li>
            <li> Even on the lowest speed it is very fast - you have to touch it to your nails very lightly.</li>
            <li> Product is very powerful and it comes with every on the picture.</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This drill is powerful!</li>
            <li> Powerful litte buggar!</li>
            <li> and once you figure out how to adjust the settings than you are able to really go all out!</li>
            <li> I love the drill, it makes it easier to do acrylics, however I just received my drill on fri, it is now Tuesday and now the drill works when it wants to, it just stopped working</li>
            <li> Seem that it would work great but the bits did not fit correctly on the filing one the rest work just fine</li>
            <li> I give 3 stars due of great power but wasn&#x27;t what I thought</li>
            <li> and I did a fresh full set of acrylics on my self</li>
            <li> no tomorrow lol be careful when you first try it on yourself or anyone</li>
            <li> just right, works fine, nice long cord and power.</li>
            <li> Great little tool lots of power</li>
            <li> Great little tool, It works well in between pedicure/manicure to keep hands and feet looking neat.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for someone who wants to try doing their own acrylic nails at home and doesn&#x27;t  want to spend too much at first like me.</li>
            <li> Some of the best friends I had as a young person were my grandmother&#x27;s friends (some of whom were old enough to be HER parents!)</li>
            <li> So far there are more tips in the kit than I can imagine finding a use for.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> I might as well just order a much better one for ths price I would be paying to get it fixed.</li>
            <li> Most people who do things like that for the elderly find themselves pleasantly surprised by the friendship.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It came with some rarely seen manicuring bits and plenty of sanding bands.</li>
            <li> First one was defective but they sent another one out quick.</li>
            <li> Nice but the lowest speed is still fast for my natural nail to the point where your nail bed gets hot.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this if you want to make a living at it - get the right tools.</li>
            <li> It IS really good if you don&#x27;t want to get your nails cut down at the salon, but again, you can go too far too easily.</li>
            <li> It was very well wrapped during shipment and came quite quickly.</li>
            <li> if you want to fix your nails, and make them look better, this is definitely what you need.  </li>
            <li> The one star would be for the fast shiping!</li>
            <li> My old nail drill bits fit in it too</li>
            <li> However, it was not a huge deal as the company sent me a new hand piece which worked great.</li>
            <li> I have used it without any learning cycle at all really and would be surprised that anyone would not do so as easily.  </li>
            <li> If you really can&#x27;t afford it right away</li>
            <li> It took some time to get used to how it works, as it was more powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li> is I can get more precise and also round off the tips so that they&#x27;re not scratchy when dog jumps on you or &#x27;paws at you&#x27; for attention.  </li>
            <li> this is that it seems to have a pretty universal attachment part that i put my other bits into and used it like that.. worked great then...</li>
            <li> It might sound gross, but soak an older person&#x27;s feet in Ivory soap &amp; clean them off, then practice on their much thicker nails.</li>
            <li> it came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Been wishing my battery-powered one had more power for a long time; this is easy to use and definitely has oomph!</li>
            <li> I paid a crap ton more then the drill for shipping, but I am completely happy with my purchase and would very well recommend!!</li>
            <li> Worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The speed on this seems a bit fast for nails.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay a whole for a drill and selected this one based on reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to manipulate and the reason I grind my dog&#x27;s nails</li>
            <li> vibrates too much for me to use against my nails</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much, but when I did, this worked as described</li>
            <li> This drill will file off acrylic and real nail</li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> l♡VE it so much.</li>
            <li> Some get really grumpy instead.</li>
            <li> Very upset with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery comes with different types of nail bits and sander, very powerful to be just a hand held.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to work with,  small and light.  </li>
            <li> This professional grade buffer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> So it does have various speeds which is cool.</li>
            <li> i put it on high speed and all it does is make my acrylic heat up and burn my nailbed.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is kind of hard to use if your not use to it.  </li>
            <li> In fact it looks quite normal.  </li>
            <li> Powerful and has all the tools you could possibly need.</li>
            <li> Its not hard to use at all nd its durable</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have if I hadn&#x27;t just bought new polish</li>
            <li> I needed a new drill for my acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it was going to be cheap because it was super cheap</li>
            <li> I was able to pick up some better bits at Harbor Freight but am disappointed that this came apart on the first use.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised when the drill showed up the day after I ordered it!..</li>
            <li> and I finally found something that had enough power to file those babies down - LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> The drill is also very light makes it hard to hold without making it flimsy.  </li>
            <li> This is a very powerful little drill.</li>
            <li> It obviously got here way sooner then expected, and it works amazingly well its just as I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought one from Sally&#x27;s and took it back because it cost to much</li>
            <li> Whether you are a professional or not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional</li>
            <li> Too much to send it back</li>
            <li> So basically I&#x27;m paying for it to get fixed..</li>
            <li> If you are trying to learn how to do this so you can make a living at it, I&#x27;d suggest getting a professional level Dremel-type tool instead, one that has a foot &amp; hand control.</li>
            <li> I will say one thing: DON&#x27;T use this thing on an old person&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised it works so well for this price.</li>
            <li> The items of this type are often so expensive when they do a good job.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and the price is definitely a steal!!</li>
            <li> This drills slowest setting is way to fast can&#x27;t really use it near my cuticles when sanding the acrylic one little slip or touch to the skin or cuticle</li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t discuss my toe fungus on line, but I have tried a podiatrist along with several medicines to rid myself of this toe fungus that afflicted one toe,  </li>
            <li> It burns to use overtop acrylic coating on the nail bed and forget about using it on bare nails for acrylic prep.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still need to be careful, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it with less damage AND you will be doing an elderly person a huge favor by giving them a pedicure.</li>
            <li> you would think it would be better quality, but not only did it come broken</li>
            <li> Small but very efficient!!</li>
            <li> Less hot spots than my last dremmel.</li>
            <li> This thing is WAAAAAAY too fast for the average home user IMO.</li>
            <li> have to get use to it,it will take your nails down to their nubs,,,,,i like it ,but need to work with it a little more carefully.</li>
            <li> This little thing really had some power to it</li>
            <li> This little unit, for home use, is sturdy, works VERY well</li>
            <li> Unless Im just stupid lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sue how long the drill bits will last</li>
            <li> it dose not work good at all :(</li>
            <li> Comes with several different files and a bunch of small sanding replacements, variable speeds, works just like a professional unit.</li>
            <li> As long as you unplug it after every use it&#x27;ll last a long time!  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t heat up when in use for a long time.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and actually sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> The bit came loose when I tried using it on my Labradoodle&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> Be careful  with  the speed.</li>
            <li> , please be careful.</li>
            <li> Most elderly people have very thin nails on their hands &amp; thick ones on their feet - circulation gets poorer as we age in our feet</li>
            <li> might keep and just find other drill bits for it...</li>
            <li> I usually just leave it on the low setting.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to use with one hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this item and unfortunately the first one I received was broken.</li>
            <li> These two items were less then 25.00 together.  </li>
            <li> I sanded down my husbands thick toe nails</li>
            <li> I know I need to keep it up for a year, but I have noticed that there isn&#x27;t that icky build up between polish and filing it down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad because i had high hopes for this &amp; at that price</li>
            <li> ;  It has cost me hundreds of dollars in the past.  </li>
            <li> It would be pointless to return it..</li>
            <li> it is so small and portable</li>
            <li> The woman was rude and started out with a procedure I didn&#x27;t ask for and when I  corrected her she became angry and told me next time I would have to pay if she made an error.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had it past the 30 day return mark because I was waiting for all my other stuff to come in.</li>
            <li> My nails were growing awfully, and my mom&#x27;s nails were&#x27;nt smooth at all, so with this I managed to fix all the problems I had.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try!  </li>
            <li> This is just like the expensive ones they use at the salons at half the price..</li>
            <li> My dogs hate the noise, but it gets the job done as far as smoothing their ragged nails, and shortening them without clipping, which I just can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> - their advice &amp; their stories helped me get through tough times.</li>
            <li> and if you have extremely thin flimsy fingernails</li>
            <li> Piece of crap only turned on once!</li>
            <li> but I have like 3 metal bits that are broken.</li>
            <li> She did a horrible job on my nails (bumps, clumps, too long) and I vowed that was the end of rude service.</li>
            <li> unfortunately i am beyond dissatisfied with it...</li>
            <li> dont think ill return</li>
            <li> and I am not happy with this, if the drip was working I would rate it 5 stars however it hasn&#x27;t even been a week and its not working, this is very bad for business</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s painful.  </li>
            <li> I hate when that happens</li>
            <li> and i hate going thru returns and wait for another one.</li>
            <li> My hubby has nasty &amp;#34;eagle talon&amp;#34; toe nails</li>
            <li> I had just paid a visit to a nail salon in July and had a horrible experience.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this for someone who wants to try doing their own acrylic nails at home and doesn&#x27;t  want to spend too much at first like me. Perfect tool and perfect price for a beginner.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and is a great value for the price! I am a beginner in doing nails so this product is perfect for practicing.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  I don&#x27;t know what we would do without it. Comes with several different files and a bunch of small sanding replacements, variable speeds, works just like a professional unit.</li>

            <li> love this for my nails</li>
            <li> Amazing drill and it came pretty fast. And soon after , I purchased another for backup. .. These drills work amazing</li>
            <li> This is a great tool. Worked better than I expected. I paid more for shopping than the tool itself, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> The speed on this seems a bit fast for nails. It burns to use overtop acrylic coating on the nail bed and forget about using it on bare nails for acrylic prep. Good for shaping edges and filing 3D decorations off.</li>
            <li> I really love this drill what a great price. I bought one from Sally&#x27;s and took it back because it cost to much and it didn&#x27;t work as well as this drill.</li>
            <li> Love this product use it almost every day on clients just wish it came with more grit papers</li>
            <li> Works great for personal use, not to mention the price was excellant also.</li>
            <li> great for my gel nails</li>
            <li> Love it works just as I thought it would like the ones in the salon.</li>
            <li> Product works really well for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> have to get use to it,it will take your nails down to their nubs,,,,,i like it ,but need to work with it a little more carefully.</li>
            <li> i ordered this based on reviews and price. i figured it was a win win! unfortunately i am beyond dissatisfied with it...&lt;br /&gt;the attachment pieces that are supposed to file/buff/drill/clean up your nails dont do anything!  i put it on high speed and all it does is make my acrylic heat up and burn my nailbed. the ONE good thing abt this is that it seems to have a pretty universal attachment part that i put my other bits into and used it like that.. worked great then... dont think ill return just bc it was so cheap..might keep and just find other drill bits for it...</li>
            <li> This is a great drill I would defiantly recommend it to someone else I&#x27;m not sue how long the drill bits will last but I can always purchase more. Fast shipping!!! Overall great product love it!</li>
            <li> The bit for the sand paper tips seemed to be two metal pieces glued together with rubber cement. The bit came loose when I tried using it on my Labradoodle&#x27;s nails. I was able to pick up some better bits at Harbor Freight but am disappointed that this came apart on the first use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this drill on the 12th of May and got it on May 16th, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied. It obviously got here way sooner then expected, and it works amazingly well its just as I expected. I sanded down my husbands thick toe nails and I did a fresh full set of acrylics on my self and I&#x27;m beyond happy with my purchase. you will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one before so, I have nothing to compare it with. My nails turned out so great I was tempted not to polish them at.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have if I hadn&#x27;t just bought new polish I was anxious to try!  Anyway, I love this product!</li>
            <li> works great on my nails</li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t discuss my toe fungus on line, but I have tried a podiatrist along with several medicines to rid myself of this toe fungus that afflicted one toe,  It has been three years to no avail.  I bought this along with a &amp;#34;Dr. School nail treatment and files. &amp;#34;  It has cost me hundreds of dollars in the past.  These two items were less then 25.00 together.  My toe never looked better.  I know I need to keep it up for a year, but I have noticed that there isn&#x27;t that icky build up between polish and filing it down.  In fact it looks quite normal.  I am very happy</li>
            <li> It was awesome it came in early I use it a lot for everything it&#x27;s good for removing calcium buildup</li>
            <li> My hubby has nasty &amp;#34;eagle talon&amp;#34; toe nails and I finally found something that had enough power to file those babies down - LOVE IT!  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this drill.  Whether you are a professional or not.  It&#x27;s easy to work with,  small and light.  Easy to change the bits.  Love love love.  I&#x27;m a professional but I love to use this on my clients or on my own nails.  Be careful  with  the speed.</li>
            <li> This is just like the expensive ones they use at the salons at half the price.. I taught myself how to use. Very easy. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I like the drill with one exception, the screw attached works it way out. Maybe i&#x27;m not srewing it into the drill correctly. The drill file my acrylic nails well. It does the job I just need to figure out how to lock my drill bit into place without working it way out. I would recommend this item, especially for beginnners like myself.</li>
            <li> Seem that it would work great but the bits did not fit correctly on the filing one the rest work just fine</li>
            <li> for the price very nice. works great. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My dogs hate the noise, but it gets the job done as far as smoothing their ragged nails, and shortening them without clipping, which I just can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! I love how convenient it is and it was inexpensive. There are several plug ins that allow me to shape my nail perfectly.</li>
            <li> This drill was very inexpensive and works great for the price. I didn&#x27;t want to pay a whole for a drill and selected this one based on reviews and I am not disappointed. Would recommend and buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad because i had high hopes for this &amp; at that price you would think it would be better quality, but not only did it come broken but the bits didn&#x27;t even fit into the top part so either way it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic deal!!  Easy to use for me to do my own gel nails at home (helps me remove the polish faster, file tips faster).  It&#x27;s so small/slender and easy to manage compared to the grinder I use for my dogs nails, that I now use this instead!  It&#x27;s so much easier to manipulate and the reason I grind my dog&#x27;s nails (in case you didn&#x27;t know about this) is I can get more precise and also round off the tips so that they&#x27;re not scratchy when dog jumps on you or &#x27;paws at you&#x27; for attention.  So far there are more tips in the kit than I can imagine finding a use for. And being electric instead of requiring batteries is much more convenient and inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful little drill. It&#x27;s easy to work and has a lot of power. I usually just leave it on the low setting. Love it!</li>
            <li> Helps me keep my nails looking perfect! People always ask where I get my nails done, and nothing makes me happier than saying I do them myself!</li>
            <li> It does work...but the chuck or bur/bit is not concentric?&lt;br /&gt;so vibrates too much for me to use against my nails</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best items I&#x27;ve ever bought. Definitely worth it and the price is magnificent. I did my nails and my mom&#x27;s and we&#x27;re both extremely happy. My nails were growing awfully, and my mom&#x27;s nails were&#x27;nt smooth at all, so with this I managed to fix all the problems I had. This device is not so noisy, light-weighted and very comfortable to hold. if you want to fix your nails, and make them look better, this is definitely what you need.  Now, this is just a piece of advise: Try not to turn on the drill and push the silver button that changes the accesories or you&#x27;ll damage it.</li>
            <li> This little thing really had some power to it and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I luv it and works so well</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a deal I got on this. Powerful and has all the tools you could possibly need. I can now do my own mani-pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works great i love it makes doing acrylic nails faster and easier</li>
            <li> Worked! I needed a new drill for my acrylic nails. It&#x27;s great. Less hot spots than my last dremmel. Worth the money</li>
            <li> This drill is powerful! It has different level settings so it&#x27;s perfect. My mom gave me a drill she used to use in school and the bits on that one fit this one so that&#x27;s even better!! its a great quality drill for a cheap price!</li>
            <li> It works for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Powerful litte buggar!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much, but when I did, this worked as described</li>
            <li> I love the drill, it makes it easier to do acrylics, however I just received my drill on fri, it is now Tuesday and now the drill works when it wants to, it just stopped working and I am not happy with this, if the drip was working I would rate it 5 stars however it hasn&#x27;t even been a week and its not working, this is very bad for business</li>
            <li> Great little tool lots of power I&#x27;m glad I bought it !</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! Its not hard to use at all nd its durable</li>
            <li> for how cheap this was, boy is it strong! I recommend this to anyone. This drill will file off acrylic and real nail like there is no tomorrow lol be careful when you first try it on yourself or anyone...took me by surprise, but I am not complaining :)</li>
            <li> works great.  love the compact size</li>
            <li> I love it! You do want to practice with it and if you have extremely thin flimsy fingernails I wouldn&#x27;t use this at all. I use it on my acrylic nails. Again works wonders and for the price it&#x27;s a steal!!!</li>
            <li> I give 3 stars due of great power but wasn&#x27;t what I thought</li>
            <li> This drills slowest setting is way to fast can&#x27;t really use it near my cuticles when sanding the acrylic one little slip or touch to the skin or cuticle and it&#x27;s painful.  The drill is also very light makes it hard to hold without making it flimsy.  The price is cheap but so is this drill.  Looking for another one for my nails but it took the calluses of my feet just fine.</li>
            <li> Terrible....stop working after 1 min... I bought 2 ....big mistake!!!! Too much to send it back so I cut my losses....</li>
            <li> Stopped working after one use</li>
            <li> the drill is not the best quality and the RPM&#x27;s go way too fast for low speed around the cuticle</li>
            <li> Good product for the cost! GREAT for the cost. Directions can be a tad clearer. Took me a minute to set it up... Unless Im just stupid lol. Even if it breaks, I spend 6 bucks, what was I expecting? Lol</li>
            <li> it dose not work good at all :(</li>
            <li> I bought this product a view months ago but until this week I put it to use. This professional grade buffer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Once you put the correct bit in, it works wonders! I used it recently to remove gel nail enamel on my toes and it took every bit of it off. I recommend this nail buffer to anyone.</li>
            <li> Came fast. Works pretty good!</li>
            <li> Nice but the lowest speed is still fast for my natural nail to the point where your nail bed gets hot.  This is mostly for acrylic and practice is required before you will perfect its use.</li>
            <li> good value...nice set....</li>
            <li> Comes in handy for taking off gel at the pedi tub. Will also be my back up just in case</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good drill overall and works great I bought 2 drills and recommended this product to others</li>
            <li> This is kind of hard to use if your not use to it.  It seems to be just okay for me.</li>
            <li> The one star would be for the fast shiping! My drill is not working at all!!! I hate when that happens and i hate going thru returns and wait for another one. I would advise get from somwhere else!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tool. It arrived on time and actually sooner than I expected. I had just paid a visit to a nail salon in July and had a horrible experience. The woman was rude and started out with a procedure I didn&#x27;t ask for and when I  corrected her she became angry and told me next time I would have to pay if she made an error. She did a horrible job on my nails (bumps, clumps, too long) and I vowed that was the end of rude service. I purchased this product and my nails look just as good. I am so happy I bought it. I especially love all the attachments. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Just got and opened, and had to try it out immediately! Been wishing my battery-powered one had more power for a long time; this is easy to use and definitely has oomph!</li>
            <li> This is the best. It&#x27;s light weight.  Very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I l♡VE it so much.</li>
            <li> I love it. Came earlier than expected! all the pieces were there and works great. I was afraid that it was going to be cheap because it was super cheap and you know the expression &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; but no that expression definitely does not apply to this drill it works great and is very powerful. I highly recommend it and the price is definitely a steal!! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I only got to use it once. While I was using it, it just stopped working. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a short in the wires, but it won&#x27;t turn on.. Unfortunately I had it past the 30 day return mark because I was waiting for all my other stuff to come in. In order to return it before the 60 day mark you have to put a $25 check in the return for shipping. So basically I&#x27;m paying for it to get fixed.. I would,not ever recommend this product or the company who sales it. It would be pointless to return it.. I might as well just order a much better one for ths price I would be paying to get it fixed.</li>
            <li> This is great for the price. It&#x27;s very powerful for the price too. My old nail drill bits fit in it too</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. It works great and is well made. It is for fingernails not for household chores. It is small enough to use with one hand. It also comes with different bits.</li>
            <li> Nail drill works nicely and came very quickly!</li>
            <li> First one was defective but they sent another one out quick. Works great for its price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> Awesome! Esp for the price and you can adjust the pressure of the drill.</li>
            <li> This thing is WAAAAAAY too fast for the average home user IMO. Even on the lowest speed it is very fast - you have to touch it to your nails very lightly. It IS really good if you don&#x27;t want to get your nails cut down at the salon, but again, you can go too far too easily. If you are trying to learn how to do this so you can make a living at it, I&#x27;d suggest getting a professional level Dremel-type tool instead, one that has a foot &amp; hand control. Don&#x27;t bother with this if you want to make a living at it - get the right tools. If you really can&#x27;t afford it right away &amp; you opt to spring for this until you can afford a good one, please be careful. It might sound gross, but soak an older person&#x27;s feet in Ivory soap &amp; clean them off, then practice on their much thicker nails. You&#x27;ll still need to be careful, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it with less damage AND you will be doing an elderly person a huge favor by giving them a pedicure. You might even find yourself making some friends, &amp; you might rescue someone - not all people in nursing homes have dementia, the reason they seem to, IMO, is that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re mostly surrounded by so they give up. Some get really grumpy instead. Some of the best friends I had as a young person were my grandmother&#x27;s friends (some of whom were old enough to be HER parents!) - their advice &amp; their stories helped me get through tough times. Most people who do things like that for the elderly find themselves pleasantly surprised by the friendship. I will say one thing: DON&#x27;T use this thing on an old person&#x27;s hands. Most elderly people have very thin nails on their hands &amp; thick ones on their feet - circulation gets poorer as we age in our feet first.&lt;br /&gt;The product is decent IF you are cautious, but perhaps the best part about it is that the tools for engraving patterns in nails, for shaping nails, etc., fit the battery operated version of this that runs anywhere from $3 - $8 online in Amazon &amp; $6 - $8 in stores last time I checked.</li>
            <li> Very good products! Well worth the money. Works perfect, and also has a long cord.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this item and unfortunately the first one I received was broken. However, it was not a huge deal as the company sent me a new hand piece which worked great. It is easy to use and put together. It also does not irritate the cuticles as much as other electric nail files do which is great! Overall, great and easy product! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap only turned on once! Very upset with this purchase. It&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very good drimmel!! I paid a crap ton more then the drill for shipping, but I am completely happy with my purchase and would very well recommend!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them to work.</li>
            <li> Great, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Small but very efficient!!</li>
            <li> The items of this type are often so expensive when they do a good job.  This little unit, for home use, is sturdy, works VERY well and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a occasional home use electric file.  I have used it without any learning cycle at all really and would be surprised that anyone would not do so as easily.  It was very well wrapped during shipment and came quite quickly.</li>
            <li> just right, works fine, nice long cord and power.</li>
            <li> Great little tool, It works well in between pedicure/manicure to keep hands and feet looking neat.  I purchased two of them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Highly recommended. If you have problems trying to use it, go on YouTube n they have a tutorial to guide you.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised when the drill showed up the day after I ordered it!.. And it works great! It came with some rarely seen manicuring bits and plenty of sanding bands. I think this thing is awesome and would recommend it to any beginners who want to do their own acrylic nails!</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected. Product is very powerful and it comes with every on the picture. I tried it out and I really love it. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Perfect item for my starter business</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!!! I swear I didnt anticipate this being so great. This is my first drill for me to do my own acrylics at home. You do gotta fiddle with it and once you figure out how to adjust the settings than you are able to really go all out! So it does have various speeds which is cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised it works so well for this price. It took some time to get used to how it works, as it was more powerful than I expected. I love it, and all the bits that come with it were nice too.</li>
            <li> As long as you unplug it after every use it&#x27;ll last a long time!  Works great</li>
            <li> I love this it is so small and portable but I have like 3 metal bits that are broken.</li>
