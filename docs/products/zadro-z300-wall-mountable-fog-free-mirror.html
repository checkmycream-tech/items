            <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect height, so it works for me.</li>
            <li>This makes shaving in the shower a breeze and best of all no sink to rinse out when your thru.</li>

            <li>Great for shaving and no worries if it drops it</li>
            <li>Company has GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li>Great and haven&#x27;t had a fog up yet.</li>
            <li>All in all, I think it is a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li>We are happy customers.</li>
            <li>It works great for what I bought it for and</li>
            <li>This mirror is great at not fogging up, but it won&#x27;t stick to my shower wall.</li>
            <li>Product works great able to see and shave perfectly</li>
            <li>But this is not a disadvantage, because it does the job perfectly for a very cheap price.  </li>
            <li>uction cup on this works ok at best.</li>
            <li>It stuck OK at best, sometimes falling off.</li>
            <li>Bought online; good product.</li>
            <li>But if your looking for a good scare to wake you up when your using the bathroom and it smacks the shower floor it will provide.</li>
            <li>and it is good for a shave.  </li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted and the suction cup did a good job of holding on the tile surface of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It holds really good and works well for me.</li>
            <li>Amazon quickly returned and refunded my money though and for that I am happy!</li>
            <li>and it stays put quite nicely.</li>
            <li>This one is good, better than the others.  </li>
            <li>when you want to get a nice close shave this mirror adheres to just about any surface in a bathroom shower.</li>
            <li>it does stay fairly fog free in the shower.</li>
            <li>Great for water conservation too and again another fantastic price available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The suction cup held onto the (very smooth) shower tile for about 20 seconds before the mirror fell.</li>
            <li>Makes the morning much better.</li>
            <li>The mirror and the frame parts (including the decorative parts on the top and bottom of the frame) all separated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the product.    </li>
            <li>Satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>but, my fault for not checking more closely.</li>
            <li>and this is a safe mirror for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love being able to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Going to spend more money to see if I can get something better.</li>
            <li>Wish I did more research before taking the item description at face value.</li>
            <li>and I do love it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay up for more than a couple days.</li>
            <li>And even after cleaning the mirror, it doesnt stay defogged for more than a couple seconds.</li>
            <li>Mirror is okay.</li>
            <li>mirror was ok.</li>
            <li>this is an OK product.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the mirror is still pretty good</li>
            <li>This item would be good if you needed to carry a fog free mirror in your pocket, but as far as using it to shave in the shower I need to be able to see more then just a piece of my face.</li>
            <li>We received the order very quickly and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li>Suction cup works well and easy to remove for travel.  </li>
            <li>All these mirrors come with a coating that very quickly is gone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fogless mirrors are easy to keep fogless.....</li>
            <li>This one hung easily on my over-the-showerhead-storage thing.</li>
            <li>Useful, but could be better for sure.</li>
            <li>Initially they work beautifully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not of the greatest fidelity and water seems to sit on it rather than run down.</li>
            <li>is fine.</li>
            <li>The mirror is not 100% fog free</li>
            <li>The mirror is cheap, piece of plastic, crappy anti-fog covering, and when you put the mirror on the wall it almost pops out of its frame because it is so cheap.  </li>
            <li>CHEAP Mirror    </li>
            <li>It is cheaply made something you could pick up in a dollar store.</li>
            <li>I am using it and feel it is not even fully fog free.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap and is distorted when you lift it away of your face.</li>
            <li>Even though this thing says fog free it doesn&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
            <li>Cheap manufacturing</li>
            <li>Its Cheap and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Not that great only lasted about 3 to 4 months</li>
            <li>I have it mounted in the shower, and I actually had a good bit of difficulty getting the suction cup off of the wall to be able to move it.</li>
            <li>Great suction cup, nice size, well, maybe a bit on the small size, but</li>
            <li>fast shipping, attaches pretty good to the wall.</li>
            <li>It most certainly is not fog free but does do a good job.....</li>
            <li>The price was very right.</li>
            <li>The fog free mirror is adequate for what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>and my mirror stays clean.</li>
            <li>Our special needs son likes to look at himself in the mirror</li>
            <li>I bought this mirror for my 5 year old who I&#x27;m teaching to wash her own hair.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, it is quite cheap and it does serve its purpose.</li>
            <li>(it slides right off), hold it under the shower for 5 seconds, and it stays fog free for rest of shower.  </li>
            <li>This is a very small mirror but perfect for our use.  </li>
            <li>First off, its not Fog Free.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, understanding how bathrooms steam up after a hot shower, I always shave before the shower, so</li>
            <li>Most people use some sort of shower cleaner to keep the walls and glass clean, such as &#x27;Tilex&#x27; or &#x27;Clean Shower&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Mirror is not even real glass, therefore you do not get an accurate reflection since it has curves in it.  </li>
            <li>Simple but effective mirror.</li>
            <li>This is worth maybe $0.50, but they are charging $8something now.      </li>
            <li>so no dangerous mishaps.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, the mirror seems pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>At least the suction cup is still of good quality!</li>
            <li>This mirror is quite small, but it works great and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>I liked this when I first used this, It lasted for a year and would clear upon putting water on it and stay clear for a bit while in a hot shower.</li>
            <li>Some complain that the silver has started to come off, mine is doing fine so far.</li>
            <li>First thing it did was fog up.</li>
            <li>The only successful surface was my big vanity mirror, which seems a bit superfluous.</li>
            <li>This arrived 2 days ago and yesterday my husband tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t completely fog free.</li>
            <li>You can probably pick up a better one at your local dollar store.</li>
            <li>Always, and its a pretty lightweight mirror.</li>
            <li>I got a suction cup razor holder for that light weight item and put it on the far side of the shower out of the water.  </li>
            <li>At first I gave it 4-stars because of the suction cup; then I realized that they all have suction cups or screw in.  </li>
            <li>Its exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Love that in the shower for facial shaving...  </li>
            <li>but once you splash a little water on it you&#x27;re good to go for virtually a whole shaving period.</li>
            <li>so she can see how much soap is in her hair and when she washes, how much of the soap (if any!)</li>
            <li>The slight magnification is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even sure how that happened and the suction cup comes loose all the time.</li>
            <li>It does the job fine, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I have had pretty good luck extending the life of the fog free by wiping down with the little towelette they provide.</li>
            <li>The suction cup doesn&#x27;t stick to much of anything.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need a shaving mirror on my vanity mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not technically fog free - it fogs, but just a splash of water removes it and it does not fog again.    </li>
            <li>Thankfully, it didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li>Pros: Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Its very scratch</li>
            <li>Its all it really matters.</li>
            <li>I have owned several types of these mirrors, including the kind where you fill a back reservoir, yet none have worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a good product, but nearly too small for use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This one does not have a razor holder, which is good because my previous mirror did and the constant water hitting the razor dissolved the lubricant prematurely.  </li>
            <li>He does mainly keep it in the tub</li>
            <li>the price was decent.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But after a year it no longer stays clear very well</li>
            <li>It has a suction cup to put on the bathtub tile, which sticks ok for only so long.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fog much and it isn&#x27;t large enough to get in the way.  </li>
            <li>He tried it on all the other smooth surfaces in the shower, but the suction cup would not hold to anything.</li>
            <li>The image is concave enough so you can see your entire face, and it stays fog free.  </li>
            <li>Most peoples biggist complaint of fogless mirrors is that they do not stay fogless very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is pretty solid.</li>
            <li>I have owned two of these and had the exact same experience.</li>
            <li>when it did manage to stick, any faint disturbance of any kind (even looking at it funny, it seems)would cause it crashing to the floor.</li>
            <li>I do not see a clear picture when I look into it.</li>
            <li>As far as in shower use, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>My mirror has had no trouble staying mounted on the shower wall.  </li>
            <li>but it has worked well for me so far.</li>
            <li>it has met my expectations and it actually works very well attached to the wall in the shower marble</li>
            <li>so far it has lived up to its name, with no fogging.</li>
            <li>So far it has stayed up.  </li>
            <li>This item is very lightweight because it is made entirely of plastic.  </li>
            <li>got this for my 9 month old so she can look at herself in the tub.  </li>
            <li>Definitely WOULD buy this again and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s about all the good I have to say about this thing.</li>
            <li>The mirror tends to collect a little fog at first, but throwing hot water on it takes care of the fog instantly for the rest of my time in the shower.</li>
            <li>You need to know that the mirror is cheaply built plastic and is small.  </li>
            <li>If you want a small and cheap mirror for shaving, get this one.</li>
            <li>The mirror also has a little bit of magnification to it, which was a nice little</li>
            <li>this wasn&#x27;t worth the money, ross and marshals have similar products that are larger and with lights for the same price.</li>
            <li>I figured with a really hot shower some fog is just to be expected.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really stay \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; for very long.  </li>
            <li>what really upset me was finding the same mirror on clearance at kmart for only a dollar!</li>
            <li>now that i got that out of the way, this mirror was far smaller than i had thought it to be.</li>
            <li>and now I can barely see myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li>although i hadn&#x27;t checked the dimensions before buying because i was desperate to reach my the minimum for free super savers shipping.</li>
            <li>More importantly, I thought the reflective image was poor and the construction even worse.</li>
            <li>so it flexes and is not perfectly flat, which means it&#x27;s like trying to shave in a fun-house mirror - one orientation makes</li>

            <li> (it slides right off), hold it under the shower for 5 seconds, and it stays fog free for rest of shower.  </li>
            <li> This is a very small mirror but perfect for our use.  </li>
            <li> First off, its not Fog Free.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, understanding how bathrooms steam up after a hot shower, I always shave before the shower, so</li>
            <li> Most people use some sort of shower cleaner to keep the walls and glass clean, such as &#x27;Tilex&#x27; or &#x27;Clean Shower&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Mirror is not even real glass, therefore you do not get an accurate reflection since it has curves in it.  </li>
            <li> Simple but effective mirror.</li>
            <li> This is worth maybe $0.50, but they are charging $8something now.      </li>
            <li> so no dangerous mishaps.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, the mirror seems pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> At least the suction cup is still of good quality!</li>
            <li> This mirror is quite small, but it works great and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> I liked this when I first used this, It lasted for a year and would clear upon putting water on it and stay clear for a bit while in a hot shower.</li>
            <li> Some complain that the silver has started to come off, mine is doing fine so far.</li>
            <li> First thing it did was fog up.</li>
            <li> The only successful surface was my big vanity mirror, which seems a bit superfluous.</li>
            <li> This arrived 2 days ago and yesterday my husband tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t completely fog free.</li>
            <li> You can probably pick up a better one at your local dollar store.</li>
            <li> Always, and its a pretty lightweight mirror.</li>
            <li> I got a suction cup razor holder for that light weight item and put it on the far side of the shower out of the water.  </li>
            <li> At first I gave it 4-stars because of the suction cup; then I realized that they all have suction cups or screw in.  </li>
            <li> Its exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love that in the shower for facial shaving...  </li>
            <li> but once you splash a little water on it you&#x27;re good to go for virtually a whole shaving period.</li>
            <li> so she can see how much soap is in her hair and when she washes, how much of the soap (if any!)</li>
            <li> The slight magnification is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even sure how that happened and the suction cup comes loose all the time.</li>
            <li> It does the job fine, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I have had pretty good luck extending the life of the fog free by wiping down with the little towelette they provide.</li>
            <li> The suction cup doesn&#x27;t stick to much of anything.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need a shaving mirror on my vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not technically fog free - it fogs, but just a splash of water removes it and it does not fog again.    </li>
            <li> Thankfully, it didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li> Pros: Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Its very scratch</li>
            <li> Its all it really matters.</li>
            <li> I have owned several types of these mirrors, including the kind where you fill a back reservoir, yet none have worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good product, but nearly too small for use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This one does not have a razor holder, which is good because my previous mirror did and the constant water hitting the razor dissolved the lubricant prematurely.  </li>
            <li> He does mainly keep it in the tub</li>
            <li> the price was decent.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But after a year it no longer stays clear very well</li>
            <li> It has a suction cup to put on the bathtub tile, which sticks ok for only so long.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fog much and it isn&#x27;t large enough to get in the way.  </li>
            <li> He tried it on all the other smooth surfaces in the shower, but the suction cup would not hold to anything.</li>
            <li> The image is concave enough so you can see your entire face, and it stays fog free.  </li>
            <li> Most peoples biggist complaint of fogless mirrors is that they do not stay fogless very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is pretty solid.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these and had the exact same experience.</li>
            <li> when it did manage to stick, any faint disturbance of any kind (even looking at it funny, it seems)would cause it crashing to the floor.</li>
            <li> I do not see a clear picture when I look into it.</li>
            <li> As far as in shower use, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> My mirror has had no trouble staying mounted on the shower wall.  </li>
            <li> but it has worked well for me so far.</li>
            <li> it has met my expectations and it actually works very well attached to the wall in the shower marble</li>
            <li> so far it has lived up to its name, with no fogging.</li>
            <li> So far it has stayed up.  </li>
            <li> This item is very lightweight because it is made entirely of plastic.  </li>
            <li> got this for my 9 month old so she can look at herself in the tub.  </li>
            <li> Definitely WOULD buy this again and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s about all the good I have to say about this thing.</li>
            <li> The mirror tends to collect a little fog at first, but throwing hot water on it takes care of the fog instantly for the rest of my time in the shower.</li>
            <li> You need to know that the mirror is cheaply built plastic and is small.  </li>
            <li> If you want a small and cheap mirror for shaving, get this one.</li>
            <li> The mirror also has a little bit of magnification to it, which was a nice little</li>
            <li> this wasn&#x27;t worth the money, ross and marshals have similar products that are larger and with lights for the same price.</li>
            <li> I figured with a really hot shower some fog is just to be expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really stay \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; for very long.  </li>
            <li> what really upset me was finding the same mirror on clearance at kmart for only a dollar!</li>
            <li> now that i got that out of the way, this mirror was far smaller than i had thought it to be.</li>
            <li> and now I can barely see myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li> although i hadn&#x27;t checked the dimensions before buying because i was desperate to reach my the minimum for free super savers shipping.</li>
            <li> More importantly, I thought the reflective image was poor and the construction even worse.</li>
            <li> so it flexes and is not perfectly flat, which means it&#x27;s like trying to shave in a fun-house mirror - one orientation makes</li>
            <li> The vacuum holder does not stick at all, to any surface.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re looking for a small mirror this one is much smaller than the picture, and very foggy in shower.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to judge exactly where the blade is about to land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fogs up in 30 seconds flat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect a lot from a cheap item but this failed to meet my low expectations.</li>
            <li> occasionally fallen off of wall, but not very often and not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all sorts of shower mirrors; expensive to as cheap as this one.  </li>
            <li> : After having this mirror up in the shower for about 7 months about 50% of the silver lining has disappeared (about a quarter from each edge), so only half of the mirror is still actually a mirror.</li>
            <li> Compared to my last mirror which was close to double the weight it fell less often.  </li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be, since it&#x27;s only 4x4 including trim.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the mirror falling off my shower wall.  </li>
            <li> I have decided to hold it because it falls every single time I try to mount it on the wall</li>
            <li> much less expensive than the mirrors designed for this purpose, it&#x27;s a nice small size for storage, and plastic</li>
            <li> alas it is very very small .I should have read the description more carefully and realized the size.</li>
            <li> It never fell down in the middle of the night like other mirrors do.</li>
            <li> goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single suction cup was also not strong enough this fell off the tile about once every 3 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless, cheap and for me a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected.</li>
            <li> They talk as if they spent a weeks wages on this.</li>
            <li> Its just not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Total Waste.</li>
            <li> the face is comically wide.  </li>
            <li> this may very well be an attempt to explain the poor reflection quality (which is certainly not the &amp;#34;Optical&amp;#34; quality claimed on the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> main issue, however, is the poor mirror quality.  </li>
            <li> , I just wanted a handy plain mirror, which is what I thought this was. :-(</li>
            <li> I read other reviews</li>
            <li> This mirror stays on and doesn&#x27;t fog up nearly as much as other mirrors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The fogging isn&#x27;t an issue for me because I prefer to hold the mirror in my other hand and dunk it in the shower stream if it does start to fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually put a little liquid soap on it and rinse it before using it so it doesn&#x27;t fog because this is the third one I have had, and they all fog.</li>
            <li> Others have complained about the suction cups not working, but have had no such problem.</li>
            <li> Honestly not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be blunt: It is not worth $7.99 at all.</li>
            <li> It falls down after 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> All of them fell down off the wall -- except for this one.</li>
            <li> I mean, technically, it&#x27;s a mirror, but...    </li>
            <li> While the anti-fog coating seems to work this does little to help as the reflection is pretty much worthless, akin to a funhouse mirror with major and unpredictable distortions.  </li>
            <li> They ranged from large to small and expensive to inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Because I lost my anti-fog spray bottle, sometimes the mirror can get a little fogged up</li>
            <li> After a few months they get a little cloudy.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> and fogs up due to soap scum etc after a few weeks, but can&#x27;t argue for the price.</li>
            <li> The first few months of use it wasn&#x27;t so bad</li>
            <li> it is only 3\\&quot; by 3\\&quot; and next to impossible for my husband to see when shaving.</li>
            <li> This mirror is so bad, it&#x27;s not even a real mirror, it&#x27;s a plastic mirror, that can make your face shape changes depending on the angle you lift your mirror!</li>
            <li> Easier and less complex than others, and works well.  </li>
            <li> so after my experience, you can never really be sure what you are getting if you buy this mirror.  </li>
            <li> way too small.      </li>
            <li> But, what is not okay is that the mirror is rather distorted.</li>
            <li> How could you not love a mirror that works in the shower.  </li>
            <li> does what it says it does but is too small and over priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little small, but works for us!</li>
            <li> He said to give it three stars because it still fogs up and the size of the mirror is quite small.  </li>
            <li> Too small.  </li>
            <li> So small.</li>
            <li> This is just a small mirror for shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Small, the anti fog coating erodes over time and has to be &amp;#34;replenished&amp;#34; with a provided tube of</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re accustomed to the heft and fidelity of a flat glass mirror, you&#x27;ll find this one difficult to adapt to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write review, but because I&#x27;ve had such a horrible experience with this mirror...</li>
            <li> Not much, but enough to be annoying.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the reason for its poor ability to stick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s held up to her destructive ways!</li>
            <li> Seriously... after I bought this mirror they changed the picture of what the mirror looks like....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and it works!!</li>
            <li> Poorly Made    </li>
            <li> After having used it for over a year it just gets worse.</li>
            <li> Not a great mirror but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is thin plastic</li>
            <li> the face tall and thin, 90 degree turn and</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t see anything in this foggy mirror.\\&quot; Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing is useless.</li>
            <li> I tried to stick it to the wall and failed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First thing it did was fog up. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective mirror. Great for shaving and no worries if it drops it is fine. Makes the morning much better.</li>
            <li> This thing is useless. I mean, technically, it&#x27;s a mirror, but...    The mirror itself is pretty solid. It&#x27;s not of the greatest fidelity and water seems to sit on it rather than run down. The anti-fog stuff works as advertised.    Unfortunately, that&#x27;s about all the good I have to say about this thing. \\&quot;Wall mountable\\&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. As far as in shower use, don&#x27;t bother. The suction cup doesn&#x27;t stick to much of anything. I tried tile, fiberglass, wood, laminate...when it did manage to stick, any faint disturbance of any kind (even looking at it funny, it seems)would cause it crashing to the floor. The only successful surface was my big vanity mirror, which seems a bit superfluous. I don&#x27;t really need a shaving mirror on my vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> Works well for the price.  Falls off the wall every now and then and fogs up due to soap scum etc after a few weeks, but can&#x27;t argue for the price.</li>
            <li> My mirror has had no trouble staying mounted on the shower wall.  It does the job fine, especially for the price.  I suppose it&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be, since it&#x27;s only 4x4 including trim.  The slight magnification is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This arrived 2 days ago and yesterday my husband tried it for the first time.  The suction cup held onto the (very smooth) shower tile for about 20 seconds before the mirror fell. The mirror and the frame parts (including the decorative parts on the top and bottom of the frame) all separated.  He finally found them all and put it back together.  (The mirror got scratched, but didn&#x27;t break.) He tried it on all the other smooth surfaces in the shower, but the suction cup would not hold to anything. It&#x27;s being returned today.</li>
            <li> You need to know that the mirror is cheaply built plastic and is small.  But this is not a disadvantage, because it does the job perfectly for a very cheap price.  It&#x27;s not technically fog free - it fogs, but just a splash of water removes it and it does not fog again.    I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the product.    If you want a small and cheap mirror for shaving, get this one.</li>
            <li> Does what it should. Doesn&#x27;t fall off the wall. Husband likes.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected. Others have complained about the suction cups not working, but have had no such problem. Satisfied with product. Company has GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li> The fog free mirror is adequate for what you pay for.  The mirror is not 100% fog free but it has worked well for me so far.</li>
            <li> Seriously... after I bought this mirror they changed the picture of what the mirror looks like.... so after my experience, you can never really be sure what you are getting if you buy this mirror.  The mirror is cheap, piece of plastic, crappy anti-fog covering, and when you put the mirror on the wall it almost pops out of its frame because it is so cheap.  This is worth maybe $0.50, but they are charging $8something now.      Also the size is the size of a KitKat candy bar (the 4 stick one)... way too small.      SUMMARY:      CHEAP Mirror    Poorly Made    Horrible anti-fog    Way too small!    DO NOT BUY! I don&#x27;t normally write review, but because I&#x27;ve had such a horrible experience with this mirror... I want to warn the world.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Needed a shower mirror for my son; could not find at local department stores.  Bought online; good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for about a month, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it. I have it mounted in the shower, and I actually had a good bit of difficulty getting the suction cup off of the wall to be able to move it. The suction cup has been rock solid for me. The mirror tends to collect a little fog at first, but throwing hot water on it takes care of the fog instantly for the rest of my time in the shower. The mirror also has a little bit of magnification to it, which was a nice little surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After having this mirror up in the shower for about 7 months about 50% of the silver lining has disappeared (about a quarter from each edge), so only half of the mirror is still actually a mirror. I have changed my rating from 5 stars to 1 star, and when I soon replace the mirror, it will be with a different product. At least the suction cup is still of good quality! After 1.5 years there&#x27;s almost no silver lining left (see image).</li>
            <li> This mirror is very small.  It seems to be a good product, but nearly too small for use in the shower.  Also looks a bit different from the picture.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and I couldn&#x27;t believe what people said about this product. They talk as if they spent a weeks wages on this. For the money this product exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s done everything that they said it would. AND IT&#x27;S STILL ON THE WALL AFTER TWO MONTHS. I feel sorry for the people who expect MORE. Forget the cheeseburger and get the mirror.</li>
            <li> I thought this mirror was bigger it is only 3\\&quot; by 3\\&quot; and next to impossible for my husband to see when shaving. It is cheaply made something you could pick up in a dollar store. I felt ripped off at the $9.99 price when I received it. It is total piece of garbage do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I envisioned but, my fault for not checking more closely. Also, it DOES fog.</li>
            <li> This is a very small mirror but perfect for our use.  Our special needs son likes to look at himself in the mirror and this is a safe mirror for that purpose.  He does mainly keep it in the tub and it stays put quite nicely.</li>
            <li> There is nothing to appreciate regarding quality, but it is the cheapest among the competitor product. I am using it and feel it is not even fully fog free.</li>
            <li> This mirror is a LOT smaller than what I thought it would be. That&#x27;s okay. But, what is not okay is that the mirror is rather distorted. I do not see a clear picture when I look into it. Its fuzzy and it distorts my face. Its just not what I expected it to be. Thankfully, it didn&#x27;t cost too much. I will be looking around for something different.</li>
            <li> How could you not love a mirror that works in the shower.  Great and haven&#x27;t had a fog up yet.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what she said.    now that i got that out of the way, this mirror was far smaller than i had thought it to be. although i hadn&#x27;t checked the dimensions before buying because i was desperate to reach my the minimum for free super savers shipping. this wasn&#x27;t worth the money, ross and marshals have similar products that are larger and with lights for the same price. what really upset me was finding the same mirror on clearance at kmart for only a dollar! but that might not be a deal people can replicate.    final thoughts:  does what it says it does but is too small and over priced.</li>
            <li> Pros: Very inexpensive. I love being able to shave in the shower.  Works as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the mirror falling off my shower wall.  It&#x27;s mounted to tile and seems to be holding well.  The mirror comes with a spray bottle of anti-fog stuff, which I promptly lost.        Cons:  None.  Because I lost my anti-fog spray bottle, sometimes the mirror can get a little fogged up but once you splash a little water on it you&#x27;re good to go for virtually a whole shaving period.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars only because is was so inexpensive. It falls often, it&#x27;s fogs up and now I can barely see myself in the mirror. It&#x27;s useless, cheap and for me a waste of money. Going to spend more money to see if I can get something better.</li>
            <li> The first few months of use it wasn&#x27;t so bad but it wasn&#x27;t completely fog free. I figured with a really hot shower some fog is just to be expected. After having used it for over a year it just gets worse. Its very scratch and I&#x27;m not even sure how that happened and the suction cup comes loose all the time. But if your looking for a good scare to wake you up when your using the bathroom and it smacks the shower floor it will provide.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and it works!! Great suction cup, nice size, well, maybe a bit on the small size, but it does stay fairly fog free in the shower. All in all, I think it is a great buy for the price. I have owned several types of these mirrors, including the kind where you fill a back reservoir, yet none have worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li> Stop!! This is a cheap piece of plastic. You can probably pick up a better one at your local dollar store.</li>
            <li> it has met my expectations and it actually works very well attached to the wall in the shower marble</li>
            <li> Honestly not worth the money.  The suction cup does not adhere well to tile or glass and appears to have a nick on the inner cup.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is the reason for its poor ability to stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue, however, is the poor mirror quality.  While the anti-fog coating seems to work this does little to help as the reflection is pretty much worthless, akin to a funhouse mirror with major and unpredictable distortions.  The web-page for the product claims 1x magnification as a feature (a &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; that is NOT stated on the package) but this may very well be an attempt to explain the poor reflection quality (which is certainly not the &amp;#34;Optical&amp;#34; quality claimed on the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be blunt: It is not worth $7.99 at all. Avoid this product.</li>
            <li> The price was very right. I would like a carrying case but maybe another time. We received the order very quickly and it was well packaged. We are happy customers.</li>
            <li> cant see a thing w this mirror</li>
            <li> I bought this for hubby who prefers to shave in the shower, but then had to do \\&quot;touch-ups\\&quot; afterward because he didn&#x27;t have a mirror.  so far it has lived up to its name, with no fogging.</li>
            <li> Perfect for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> One of the key things I considered when purchasing a shower mirror was the size.  I bought this because it was advertised as 5 x 8 inches.  Including the frame, it&#x27;s only 5 x 4.  The packaging it come in is what&#x27;s 5x8....  Wish I did more research before taking the item description at face value.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my 5 year old who I&#x27;m teaching to wash her own hair.  I got this so she can see how much soap is in her hair and when she washes, how much of the soap (if any!) is left.  It has a suction cup to put on the bathtub tile, which sticks ok for only so long.  It works great for what I bought it for and the price was decent.</li>
            <li> This mirror is so bad, it&#x27;s not even a real mirror, it&#x27;s a plastic mirror, that can make your face shape changes depending on the angle you lift your mirror! It&#x27;s so cheap and is distorted when you lift it away of your face. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> When the mirror arrived, it was much smaller than I thought it would be.  I thought the packaging/advertising was some type of Jedi Mind Trick to make it look larger.  However, I decided to try it and I do love it.  The image is concave enough so you can see your entire face, and it stays fog free.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> First off, its not Fog Free. Why claim something that it isn&#x27;t? Fortunately, understanding how bathrooms steam up after a hot shower, I always shave before the shower, so I don&#x27;t mind that its all fogged up. Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t mention that it magnifies, but that probably because that didn&#x27;t do that properly either. The reflection is distorted, esp around the edges. Zadro, say something about the magnification in the product description, because I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it otherwise, I just wanted a handy plain mirror, which is what I thought this was. :-(</li>
            <li> Product works great able to see and shave perfectly I would recomen this product for any one who needs a mirror in the shower</li>
            <li> Even though this thing says fog free it doesn&#x27;t work that well.  It still fogs up, and you constantly have to rinse it off.  Mirror is not even real glass, therefore you do not get an accurate reflection since it has curves in it.  uction cup on this works ok at best.</li>
            <li> This mirror is quite small, but it works great and serves its purpose. My husband uses it to shave in the shower and loves it.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks it started to fog up. Not much, but enough to be annoying. blasting it with water for a couple seconds seems to fix it...Plus the suction cup always falls off. Always, and its a pretty lightweight mirror. Compared to my last mirror which was close to double the weight it fell less often.  Don&#x27;t recommend  After having it a while longer, like 18 months. It doesn&#x27;t stay up for more than a couple days. And even after cleaning the mirror, it doesnt stay defogged for more than a couple seconds.</li>
            <li> It most certainly is not fog free but does do a good job.....as a shaving mirror.  Fogs up in 30 seconds flat so you will need to unhook and rinse.  Suction cup works well and easy to remove for travel.  Some complain that the silver has started to come off, mine is doing fine so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all sorts of shower mirrors; expensive to as cheap as this one.  This one is good, better than the others.  I have found that all suction cups give way in the middle of the night.  I cut off the plastic suction cup flange on this one and stuck it on the wall with double sided tape - Its on there good(and flush).  All these mirrors come with a coating that very quickly is gone.  I simply splash water, sometimes soap, on it and it is good for a shave.  This one does not have a razor holder, which is good because my previous mirror did and the constant water hitting the razor dissolved the lubricant prematurely.  I got a suction cup razor holder for that light weight item and put it on the far side of the shower out of the water.  Great setup!  Note: the mirror had different perspectives depending if you mount it vertical or horizontal, I perfer horizontal.  At first I gave it 4-stars because of the suction cup; then I realized that they all have suction cups or screw in.  Therefore my 5-star rating</li>
            <li> Great product!  We&#x27;ve been looking for one that STAYS on the wall!  This mirror stays on and doesn&#x27;t fog up nearly as much as other mirrors.  My husband is very pleased with this shower mirror!</li>
            <li> A bit smaller than you would think....but works perfectly as a shower shaving mirror.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As promised, this mirror does not fog at all.  My husband uses it to shave in the shower and has had no complaints.  It&#x27;s a little small, but works for us!</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these and had the exact same experience. Initially they work beautifully. I use them according to the instructions. After a few months they get a little cloudy. I have had pretty good luck extending the life of the fog free by wiping down with the little towelette they provide. No matter what I do, in a year or so, they are fogged.</li>
            <li> Mirror is okay. Cheap manufacturing but it works.    Suction cup is a joke; doesn&#x27;t stick to anything. You&#x27;ll have to hold it up if you want to get any use out of it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is the perfect size for my shower.  So far it has stayed up.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems withit falling off the shower wall or fogging up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy! Don&#x27;t buy! Don&#x27;t buy!  It fogs up faster than you can say, \\&quot;Hey, I can&#x27;t see anything in this foggy mirror.\\&quot; Waste of money!!!! Total Waste.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay unfogged</li>
            <li> This item would be good if you needed to carry a fog free mirror in your pocket, but as far as using it to shave in the shower I need to be able to see more then just a piece of my face. Amazon quickly returned and refunded my money though and for that I am happy!</li>
            <li> It stuck OK at best, sometimes falling off. More importantly, I thought the reflective image was poor and the construction even worse. I don&#x27;t expect a lot from a cheap item but this failed to meet my low expectations.</li>
            <li> Very good. I usually put a little liquid soap on it and rinse it before using it so it doesn&#x27;t fog because this is the third one I have had, and they all fog.</li>
            <li> Bought the mirror for my boyfriend.  He said to give it three stars because it still fogs up and the size of the mirror is quite small.  For what it&#x27;s worth, it is quite cheap and it does serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great at not fogging up, but it won&#x27;t stick to my shower wall. It falls down after 5 seconds. Luckily, the mirror seems pretty sturdy. It didn&#x27;t break all those times I tried to stick it to the wall and failed. I have a shower caddy hanging from the shower head that I put the mirror in and it&#x27;s the perfect height, so it works for me.</li>
            <li> Basic mirror.  works well.   occasionally fallen off of wall, but not very often and not a big deal.  There is another mirror on amazon that has some type of water reservoir to keep it from fogging.  With this one, I simply take it off the suction cup (it slides right off), hold it under the shower for 5 seconds, and it stays fog free for rest of shower.  Easier and less complex than others, and works well.  I&#x27;ve bought a couple of these now (multiple showers)</li>
            <li> I liked this when I first used this, It lasted for a year and would clear upon putting water on it and stay clear for a bit while in a hot shower. But after a year it no longer stays clear very well and it stays spotted &amp; foggy even if you splash water or wipe it with cleaner.  It was good while it lasted and the suction cup did a good job of holding on the tile surface of the shower.  I suppose it did its job for the time. Also, it is smaller than you might expect.</li>
            <li> Too small.  My fault for buying and not checking the specs!</li>
            <li> when you want to get a nice close shave this mirror adheres to just about any surface in a bathroom shower. This makes shaving in the shower a breeze and best of all no sink to rinse out when your thru. Great for water conservation too and again another fantastic price available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It would not stay on my bathroom (stone) wall. Kept falling off. Otherwise the mirror is still pretty good</li>
            <li> So small. Its exactly what you pay for. And there is still fog when you put it on shower. Its Cheap and gets the job done. Its all it really matters.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless portable mirrors, as I travel and stay in different hotels around the country.  They ranged from large to small and expensive to inexpensive.  All of them fell down off the wall -- except for this one. With this mirror, you can stick it to the shower wall, or any surface, as soon as you arrive at your hotel room. Regardless of whether you are staying there for one night or one week: This mirror will stay up the entire time. It never fell down in the middle of the night like other mirrors do.</li>
            <li> Been using mine for several years now. Not a great mirror but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The vacuum holder does not stick at all, to any surface. I have decided to hold it because it falls every single time I try to mount it on the wall</li>
            <li> Most peoples biggist complaint of fogless mirrors is that they do not stay fogless very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fogless mirrors are easy to keep fogless..... Most people use some sort of shower cleaner to keep the walls and glass clean, such as &#x27;Tilex&#x27; or &#x27;Clean Shower&#x27;. My wife leaves these shower cleaning products in the shower to be used regularly. So every day or two I just spray my fogless mirror with the cleaner and my mirror stays clean. I have had the same fogless mirror for over 6 years.</li>
            <li> This is just a small mirror for shaving in the shower.  It doesn&#x27;t fog much and it isn&#x27;t large enough to get in the way.  This one hung easily on my over-the-showerhead-storage thing.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re looking for a small mirror this one is much smaller than the picture, and very foggy in shower.</li>
            <li> Lasted a month before began fogging, even though I followed manufacturer&#x27;s directions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I feel $7 might be overpriced.</li>
            <li> fogs up within seconds.</li>
            <li> This item is very lightweight because it is made entirely of plastic.  The mirror itself is thin plastic so it flexes and is not perfectly flat, which means it&#x27;s like trying to shave in a fun-house mirror - one orientation makes the face tall and thin, 90 degree turn and the face is comically wide.  One wouldn&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a problem until you&#x27;re about to put a razor against your skin and it&#x27;s hard to judge exactly where the blade is about to land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fogging isn&#x27;t an issue for me because I prefer to hold the mirror in my other hand and dunk it in the shower stream if it does start to fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re accustomed to the heft and fidelity of a flat glass mirror, you&#x27;ll find this one difficult to adapt to.</li>
            <li> Small, the anti fog coating erodes over time and has to be &amp;#34;replenished&amp;#34; with a provided tube of goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single suction cup was also not strong enough this fell off the tile about once every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Fogs up and the mirror part is starting to chip off. I have had it for 6 months.</li>
            <li> got this for my 9 month old so she can look at herself in the tub.  much less expensive than the mirrors designed for this purpose, it&#x27;s a nice small size for storage, and plastic so no dangerous mishaps.  so far it&#x27;s held up to her destructive ways!</li>
            <li> Not that great only lasted about 3 to 4 months and then the edges of the mirror started getting permanently foggy</li>
            <li> I bought this as a backup for ny husband as he loves the travel version and has an OXO one that is permanently in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;But alas it is very very small .I should have read the description more carefully and realized the size.</li>
            <li> It holds really good and works well for me.</li>
            <li> mirror was ok. i thougth it was bigger. fast shipping, attaches pretty good to the wall. wish it was bigger but it does the work.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog and it is great!  Love that in the shower for facial shaving...  Definitely WOULD buy this again and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> this is an OK product.  Doesn&#x27;t really stay \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; for very long.  Useful, but could be better for sure.</li>
