            <li>However...it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>

            <li>I think it has a nice aroma; the wife says it smells spicy (and good).</li>

            <li>Great oil,  smells great and makes my beard look much healthier.  </li>
            <li>I recommend all Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li>After 40 years of wearing a beard nice to have it not feel like a Brillo pad...</li>
            <li>It does add a &amp;#34;glisten&amp;#34; to my beard, a kind of shine or sheen to it.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice for moisturizing beard.</li>
            <li>It works really well, and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice sheen but is never oily like some beard wax.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency but not meant to hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already started recommending Honest Amish products to my bearded brethren.  </li>
            <li>He smells delightful and he gets complimented very often on it.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your beard with a nice shine and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping it&#x27;d soften my beard, make it feel nice, and maybe even straighten it a bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had used the &amp;#34;Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-in Conditioner&amp;#34; before and liked it so I figured I would try this one to see the difference.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product you can use on your beard!</li>
            <li>The reason I am leaving a 5/5 star review is because honest amish emailed me today asking how I liked it</li>
            <li>Also liked the way it went into my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have beard dandruff and flakey skin make sure to use a good beard soap/soap because this product will suspend those particles in your beard.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s honest if you ask me</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>the Honest Amish also makes.</li>
            <li>I ended needing to use Honest Amish&#x27;s Beard Wax to finish taming my beard</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not at all overpowering if you found you weren&#x27;t too fond of it.  </li>
            <li>This product smells good and does add slightly more beard control and luster.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just continue to let my beard do its own beard stuff.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, earthy but kinda citrusy.</li>
            <li>I think it smells like a nice after shave though.  </li>
            <li>Some may not like the smell, but I think it is rather nice.</li>
            <li>I think at times, but is nice as it keeps the skin under the beard nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Got in touch with Honest Amish</li>
            <li>My husband has been using Honest Amish products for about a year now.</li>
            <li>It nurishes the hair and the skin while keeping the beard nicely groomed.</li>
            <li>Thank you Honest Amish for a life changing product.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a nicely crafted and shaped beard and then put on the original one before bed so that the ladies are happy.</li>
            <li>It has been great in my endeavor to grow a nice full beard.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and and it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>but when the weather is warm its very easy to spread in your hands and apply.</li>
            <li>Just wish it had a bit more of a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It softens very quickly in your hands and does a great job at softening your whiskers; I&#x27;ve found it makes my hair more manageable and controllable, as mine is frizzy by nature.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Honest Amish!!</li>
            <li>Most important, my wife is happy.</li>
            <li>The best product Honest Amosh offers.</li>
            <li>This product does have an incredibly good scent that is very mild.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to work into even think beards.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell at all.</li>
            <li>It has an interesting scent that is pleasant but a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>After trying the very first time, he fell in love!!</li>
            <li>It keeps my door knocker and epic mustache looking great!</li>
            <li>Best beard balm I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>We started with Honest Amish beard oil which substantially changed the conditioning of his skin and his beard making it more tolerable.</li>
            <li>This stuff has a nice, light smell too!</li>
            <li>By far the best oil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It did add a nice healthy shine that</li>
            <li>There are reviews I read that said they love the smell, to each their own.</li>
            <li>Both work as advertised, but the Honest Amish works better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a couple of days when its freshly melted.</li>
            <li>I will be using Honest Amish from here on for sure.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love Honest Amish Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>Best i have tried so far</li>
            <li>First off, I just want to say that I think Honest Amish is a great company that cares about the product they sell.</li>
            <li>Sure it smells great, comes in a cool tin and a fancy burlap sack.</li>
            <li>Holds better than oils alone and the light licorice scent is pleasant while it lasts.</li>
            <li>It ships very quickly!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>The price is very fair, considering this size will last you a good while.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There was an issue during shipping but the folks at Honest Amish were awesome and a replacement arrived very shortly after I had contacted them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This looks to be a great Balm and was very much looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>It is only once I tried,these products that I&#x27;ve begun to understand how my great great grandfather groomed his beard 100 or more years ago.</li>
            <li>The description is very accurate as is the application method.</li>
            <li>It had a very light unoffensive fragrance to me.  </li>
            <li>, Fragrance is Very Light...</li>
            <li>this is great, my wife complemented me on my beard after the first day of use,  gave it a healthy shine</li>
            <li>Great product as usual been ordering this for quite often and it&#x27;s the best for conditioning and taming my beard</li>
            <li>Nice and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, leaves my beard easy to style.</li>
            <li>The Honest Amish beard balm is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but not at all strong.  </li>
            <li>I strongly dislike the scent of the wax (smells like putting crayons on my face, ugh), and it doesn&#x27;t soften the beard as nicely as this does.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product and keeps my beard shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>This balm is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It was actually much better in terms of ability to apply</li>
            <li>I have worn this product and enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li>Many of my friends wear this product and love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li>My grandson said your product was outstanding.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you brush you beard out</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I reviewed a lighter version of this balm talking about how oily the product was and that there may be something better out there.</li>
            <li>I like how you get some of the wax and rub it in your hands until it is more of a liquid.</li>
            <li>It spreads better that way.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay.</li>
            <li>Love the fact</li>
            <li>I have been growing my goatee for around 6 years and have never been able to get it longer than 4-5 inches without it going all scraggly, so hopefully this stuff well help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already planning to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Think of this as being more like a mousse or pomade than a firm-hold hair</li>
            <li>brush and do a more aggressive shaping and fluffing.  </li>
            <li>So, I have to give it three stars for OK.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this beard balm.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the balm.</li>
            <li>I like it better than any of the beard oils.</li>
            <li>Between the balm and a separate oil, my beard has never been better.  </li>
            <li>I must admit I prefer using this much more than I ever did any of the oils I have tried.</li>
            <li>and I like the feel of my beard now much better.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome and leaves my beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the spicy fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>It will get most of your beard orderly though.</li>
            <li>My beard is not coarse but it&#x27;s fairly &amp;#34;scraggly&amp;#34;, lots of fly away hairs.</li>
            <li>It keeps my beard feeling a lot better, and much more controlled looking.</li>
            <li>People are always asking how I get my beard to look so healthy</li>
            <li>Try it and you will love it.</li>
            <li>this is the top shelf stuff.</li>
            <li>I think what I thought this was, was used more for control than anything else.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be more of a sold variation of what their oils are.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is freaking magic.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed it the most of the years on my chin.</li>
            <li>I love the sheen that it gives my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>and I have recommended it to many of my bearded friends.  </li>
            <li>When I get close to running out of this, I&#x27;ll be buying more.  </li>
            <li>I definetly make sure to recommend it to my bearded friends.</li>
            <li>keeps my beard well conditioned and does OK on keeping it looking well groomed.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Great product from a environmentally responsible company.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the product is ok</li>
            <li>Within a day of delivery I got an email asking if I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t control the strays as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>it does add some control and it also makes my beard look more uniform.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My going on three year beard is getting more and more unruly</li>
            <li>Smells great, protects the beard very well.  </li>
            <li>I use this more than the oil.</li>
            <li>and it was a lot cheaper, lasts longer, smells better and is easier to get.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent - I really, really love the smell.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>still using beard oil on some days but mostly I&#x27;m using  balm</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have a beard anymore, and I still use it for moisturizing and the smell :)</li>
            <li>Hope to find something that works better.</li>
            <li>As in most things in life it is a tradeoff.</li>
            <li>but it sure does help.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>You may need to let your beard grow out more to be able to see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The moisturizing and conditioning is top notch</li>
            <li>After having a mustache for many years, I knew going into it that my beard was going to be wirey and chaotic, just like my mustache.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with that either</li>
            <li>Now is softer and is much more behaved.</li>
            <li>wife and kid love it and the smell is not over welling.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li>I use the wax occasionally when i want my beard to look perfect.</li>
            <li>it is more of a conditioner but has some hold to it as well.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something with more hold though,</li>
            <li>Eh, it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the purchase and would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I love the smell</li>
            <li>I would give this 10 stars if Amazon had more than 5.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the balm and how it applied to my beard.  </li>
            <li>Ok, just got it.</li>
            <li>I am sure this works</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much, but it does a great job taming most, not all, flyaways.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it :-)</li>
            <li>and I can say already that my bread is more moist and controlled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping with continue use of this product my beard will look even better.</li>
            <li>It has made my beard much more presentable.</li>
            <li>and it just looks way better with the conditioner in...</li>
            <li>I have found nothing better.</li>
            <li>And hey...maybe I just got a funky batch and everyone else&#x27;s really smells great..</li>
            <li>I need some of those whiskers that are growing in a bit more wiry to be held in place.  </li>
            <li>Love the stuff</li>
            <li>I still like their beard oil with dropper better.</li>
            <li>Just reordered more.</li>
            <li>Makes my shaggy beard buttery smooth!</li>
            <li>make sure to melt it well between your hands, then apply and rub down/brush</li>
            <li>You have to use way more product than what is advertised.</li>
            <li>Works better than any beard oil I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>but overall, the smell and functionality of this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>It seems to help keep the skin underneath moisturized and healthy as well.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This balm is appropriately advertised.  </li>
            <li>I thought with a name like &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; it would provide more hold.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t and to top it off all the grease</li>
            <li>I have stopped blow drying my beard since I started using this product, and it looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>Its okay stuff.</li>
            <li>But I think I prefer the oils more. .. ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit grainy but as soon as you work it into your hands it turns into a nice smooth balm.</li>
            <li>, maybe I need to scoop much more balm out of the can so that there is more stuff on the beard -</li>
            <li>; I find the grooming and control qualities more on the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; side.</li>
            <li>And I LOVE that it is vegan.</li>
            <li>She likes to curl up and nuzzle into my beard, and I absolutely love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now it has some hold and smells more like a man should, but for almost $20, you should try something else.</li>
            <li>The balm is not a wax, but it has helped me get my beard manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li>The longer it got the more wirey it got.</li>
            <li>I have had a beard for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li>As the beard as grown in I just include a bit more to spread it around.  </li>
            <li>and i really satisfied about the all shipment</li>
            <li>so my hope was that this would give me a bit more control while also conditioning my beard.</li>
            <li>I love my boyfriends beard</li>
            <li>The conditioning is way better too.  </li>
            <li>more for your money</li>
            <li>and you will need more at some point unless you shave,</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and requires more heat/manipulation to spread around.</li>
            <li>I also think it smells better.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, but can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Please Honest Amish, come up up a truly scent free version.</li>
            <li>But not any more.  </li>
            <li>Sure that is a plus to me.</li>
            <li>This item arrived fast and works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer, more controllable, and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>This does indeed aid in control of said craziness and it makes the hair feel softer (which my girls love).  </li>
            <li>As advertised it controls my beard better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was going to do a better job of taming my beard</li>
            <li>It was more like Grave</li>
            <li>Makes my beard look healthy and with more control.</li>
            <li>I am a true fan of this stuff and look forward to trying more Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li>really but it is pretty awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>Great for control and managing the main</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the fact that the scent is very mild and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like many of the beard oils...</li>
            <li>Great product arrived very early I was expecting Friday got here on a Monday will do more business with them probably will get the wax too.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, I kind of like it, although I understand how some people won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>so I can not comment on long term improvement an excellent product</li>
            <li>, just wrote the original review below, and the next day, they issued me a full refund, an email apology that their product didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, a list of honestly helpful tips for beard management and how to best use their product, and it even sounds like they&#x27;re sending me their wax product to see if that works better.</li>
            <li>It smells great, holds great, and doesn&#x27;t stiffen up or leave those pesky wax clumps after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice now and already my beard is softer, and the wiry gray hairs that I have been graced with since my mid-20s are more easily manageable than without any product at all.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and it came quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Great product that leaves my husbands beard soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I am not going to be coy; my beard is epic, and I owe it to this product and the good people at Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>Great smelling and leaves my beard very soft and a bit easier to comb.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend says it works great, but doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li>This is a really good thing, because the scent it pretty strong and lasts.</li>
            <li>excellent awesome use it everyday, will most likely buy for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>It arrived well before expected which I was very happy about.</li>
            <li>Works best when beard is wet before application</li>
            <li>Keeps the beard soft and smells great.</li>

            <li>Goes on great and basically disappears and just leaves my beard soft.</li>

            <li>Great product makes my beard soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the perfect blend of wax and oils for the harder to maintain parts of the beard.</li>
            <li>it keeps it from becoming unruly and out of control.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hold as good as my husband thought it would and it makes his beard very shiny</li>
            <li>It is kind of fun to use because of it.  </li>
            <li>The good - It really conditions your beard.</li>
            <li>The beard is also softer, less itchy and all around more awesome.</li>
            <li>Excellent, gives me great control ( I have a wicked thick beard), smell is NOT to strong, and it makes my beard nice and soft!</li>
            <li>My beard is nearing two inches right now, so it had a nice poof to it.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish is by far top quality, I have been a repeat customer and will continue to be so!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It is significantly softer and has a lot more shine while not looking greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This is my first beard conditioner and it&#x27;s been top shelf all the way!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be holding any better than the original, even though it&#x27;s a thicker balm, and not as oily.  </li>
            <li>The pine scent is cool too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the the original Amish beard balm it smells better plus easier to groom</li>
            <li>There is very minimal scent and it smells very pleasant!</li>
            <li>Once u work this balm into your hands it goes on as easy as beard oil.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply...keeps those strays in line....</li>
            <li>Easily worked into the beard and skin.</li>
            <li>Great for the beard, especially for occasions where you want to it to be more neat than anything.</li>
            <li>A great thing to have if you have  a big beard, for sure.</li>
            <li>Works very well for brushing your beard after a shower and leaves it feeling nice and healthy.</li>
            <li>Kept my beard nice and tidy, plus soft according to the wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does work into your beard easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved the regular leave in conditioner, it&#x27;s been amazing for softening and helping keep my beard manageable.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to apply and how it conditions my beard.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild organic type smell without any licorice odor like the parent product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t build up, easy to wash</li>
            <li>my rating, just for the sole fact of a great and quick response from the Honest Amish representative.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>Nothing too strong or too &#x27;perfumey&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells kinda funky, though, and the smell is somewhat strong.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, applies easily, smells good, beard is softer, less itchy, helps with shaping, not as much as wax</li>
            <li>Not too strong of a hold, but you&#x27;d want a wax for that anyway.</li>
            <li>but it isnt gonna be as strong as something like hair glue.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Too shiny, itches and strong smell.</li>
            <li>Strong.</li>
            <li>beard has a couple strong &amp;#34;cowlicks&amp;#34; that this stuff doesn&#x27;t fix, but I didn&#x27;t fully expect it to.</li>
            <li>Its not as strong as a wax but still holds beard in place.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>So most of us know how honest children are and when they say Daddy your beard is as soft as their favorite stuffed animal.</li>
            <li>This is the first Honest Amish product I have purchased.</li>
            <li>This has a pleasant, but very mild and natural scent.</li>
            <li>So now I use it when it is important to me to appear more neat or clean cut.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to open and a good seal on them.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine too.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging, and love how fast it came, 2 days!</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps even the roughest beard as sweet and soft as puppy dreams.</li>
            <li>It leaves my beard nice and smooth and pretty shiny.  </li>
            <li>After a quick brush, I noticed my beard was much more controllable without looking like I had anything on it.  </li>
            <li>Light in scent and strong in hold.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it contains all natural ingredients, has a pleasant smell and conditions (softens) the beard while holding it - no stray flyaways.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my beard super greasy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two weeks of use my beard is much more tame and healthy, I could not be more happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>This the best beard balm available on the market hands down.</li>
            <li>This does have a good hold on longer beards and tames pretty well, but is slightly more oily when you apply that much for the hold.</li>
            <li>The hold and control is perfect - not stiff but keeps it all tamed and soft, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>The original was one of my favorite things to put on my face, with it&#x27;s sweet and spicy clove smell.</li>
            <li>in all it&#x27;s a nice, quality product that I will certainly be purchasing again when the time comes.</li>
            <li>Light pleasant fragrance, all natural high quality organic ingredients, works in easily to the beard, nice absorption and conditioning, softens beard hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is not as strong as the original balm from HA.  </li>
            <li>This in itself is a huge selling point for me.</li>
            <li>Check out their natural soaps too, they use the best natural ingredients, non-man made.</li>
            <li>The heavy duty beard Balm smells great and adds a nice shine to my beard.</li>
            <li>It also works well for its stated use, which is of course equally important.</li>
            <li>Well priced and I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>You will have much better success that way.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost all of the beard care products available over the years.</li>
            <li>I have used both Honest Amish and Beard Balm, and in my best of observations, they are the same essentially.  </li>
            <li>Overall, these two products work great.</li>
            <li>Wish I didn&#x27;t spend this much money ob it in all reality,  honest amish should have a sample pack , that way we have a way of testing these products before purchasing them</li>
            <li>, you get a free bottle of beard oil.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic</li>
            <li>rub in comb smooth done.</li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>Fantastic beard balm.  </li>
            <li>regular product is really great for conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic hold and finish.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic company.</li>
            <li>Lightly scented.</li>
            <li>Thanks honest amish for backing your product</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product that works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Gives an excellent all day hold and keeps my beard from drying out along with my face on these harsh winter days.</li>
            <li>Just a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The smell it emits is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It has solid hold for the length of my beard, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t make my beard shiny, everything I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a few others, but they best I have every found was at a farmers market that conditioned</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Has a good hold for an all natural product</li>
            <li>you have any kind of facial hair, please, please give this Honest Amish a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The first one was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Really softens the beard a lot and has a very clean smell!  </li>
            <li>I had been using the honest Amish original beard balm for some time now, and as my beard has grown longer and more unruly, I was delighted to see a heavy duty version.</li>
            <li>I tried one other brand of beard balm and was nowhere near as impressed as I am with Honest Amish Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>Beard looks great, specially combined with the Extra Grit Wax.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product the most useful and unique of the Honest Amish products, it fits a good niche: makes me look less like a vagrant.</li>
            <li>I use the Honest Amish Classic Oil then brush this in.</li>
            <li>and I got many compliments ;)</li>
            <li>offers ok control of wild hairs but smells great</li>
            <li>First let me say that I love this company.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but getting the beads to melt is a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li>Good stuff makes facial hair soft and look good</li>
            <li>at this point nothing significant.</li>
            <li>Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Saver.  </li>
            <li>Totally sold on the Honest Amish products I have used!</li>
            <li>The night and day effect wasn&#x27;t as significant as  I hoped.</li>
            <li>A little greasy, but good product for the man that grows his own scarf.</li>
            <li>After trying oils of different brands, and even some other products by honest Amish, I have to admit, this is the best beard balm I have tried and tested.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more of the honest amish beard balm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conditioning:  It&#x27;s been every bit as good as the regular Beard Balm at softening, thickening, and keeping my beard itch and flake free.  </li>
            <li>bottom line is that Honest Amish Beard Balm is the real deal, and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>makes beard soft and tangle free reduces itch smells nice.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, packaging is simple but elegant, etc.</li>
            <li>It left my beard with a nice healthy looking shine.  </li>
            <li>It might have slightly better control than the Cream/Conditioner mentioned above, but It also leaves my face kind of greasy when applying it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous beard balms, oils, waxes, but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder about how clean the product is.  </li>
            <li>And it makes his beard shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>and then the clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li>Thirdly, it has a pleasant and manly scent.</li>
            <li>good conditioning, nice smell, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the scraggly beard nice and shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li>Stays nicely and control my wild beard hairs!</li>
            <li>This is a great product but has a smell I am not particularly fond of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went with this certain one.</li>
            <li>also gave it a nice sheen and had a great but subtle smell.</li>
            <li>Love the feel it gives, although doesn&#x27;t provide much hold for rogue hairs...</li>
            <li>Good stuff, 3rd go of it</li>
            <li>I got this for my son, who has a full beard.</li>
            <li>This not only controlled my beard and made it look good, it also stopped the flaking skin.</li>
            <li>Nice amount of hold but keeps the beard soft.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish beard balm leaves my beard shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of softening my coarse beard hairs, so kudos there.</li>
            <li>I wear glasses full time</li>
            <li>The thing that makes this such a good product is the way your beard will feel.</li>
            <li>Makes your beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and I was applying roughly a full dime size every time after showering and</li>
            <li>I love that this company ships extremely fast.</li>
            <li>In full sun its a bit shiny for my taste but</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even contact Honest Amish directly</li>
            <li>A good solid, beard balm.</li>
            <li>All my male coworkers asked during November what I used so they could support mens health without the itch and stay the good graces of their wives and girlfriends.</li>
            <li>beard very shiny and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a nice soft smell, I got the cedar pine.</li>
            <li>Sure I&#x27;m not giving this much time.</li>
            <li>its cool</li>
            <li>Good enough to order another 4 oz.</li>
            <li>made my husbands beard nice and soft (:</li>
            <li>It does not provide much control for unruly hairs, and is more of a conditioner/ protectent.</li>
            <li>experience will likely differ from mine, but by trial and error you will have as good an experience as mine, I suspect.  </li>
            <li>It smells good , iseasy to apply, and i have received numerous compliments on how shiny my beard is.  </li>
            <li>Honest Amish beard balm keeps my beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several months now, and it is not as good as everyone is making it out to be.</li>
            <li>good for after you you wash your beard to get some moisture back in it.  </li>
            <li>After much research on a healthy beard product to help maintain my husbands beard, this was the product for him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I tried every fancy fly by night brand looking to jump on the new beard fad band wagon and finally went to something good ole fashioned and hand made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am dissapointed in its ability to tame the strays in my mustache and have found a very good wax for that instead</li>
            <li>Nice scent, Easy to apply and definitely makes a difference with the beard.  </li>
            <li>Aroma is pleasant and not overpowering - similar to fresh cut pine.  </li>
            <li>But it is pretty strong of a scent.</li>
            <li>They are great at follow-up and extremely conscientious.</li>
            <li>this is a better product than its competition, a little bit will do, let it sit for a while, comb through and ur good to go, product has better control than blue b&#x27;s is cheaper and smells better</li>
            <li>Its absolutely fantastic - smells great, makes my beard nice and soft and provides just enough control to keep a wild beard in check if you have a meeting to attend but doesn&#x27;t make it all waxy.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of balms and oils, and this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li>If I can get the hang of using it, I would most likely purchase more as I need the control.</li>
            <li>A bit too oily but works well for conditioning and mild sculpting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through 4 tins already and will continue to be loyal.</li>
            <li>and I find the scent fades away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I seen people put off on the aroma, but it will dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li>It does melt quickly on the fingers when you rubs them together</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better for me, would be for it to be slightly more aromatic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better success with just straight SHEA butter.</li>
            <li>I should have stuck with the fantastic standard beard balm from Honest Amish.  </li>
            <li>Product came quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell at first, but it&#x27;s very mild and very manly and disappears pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use with no mess.</li>
            <li>DOWN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sceptical at first but as soon as I put some on my beard it was smooth and my frizz was in control.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant; it sort of reminds me of tooth paste.</li>
            <li>If I had to offer up one con it would be the smell; while not unpleasant it isn&#x27;t as olfactorily-pleasing as the oil I was using...</li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick and the product very high quality.</li>
            <li>I got it yesterday and was really excited , I used it it smelled good ,masculine, made by beard soft an all</li>
            <li>While I would give the edge in conditioning to the Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Saver, I would say the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm does a better job of managing (i.e. &amp;#34;shaping)</li>
            <li>Leave a very light, mild, masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>at first i thought it was good when i used it, till an hour later when my beard started itching a lot.</li>
            <li>It smells good (not strong) and makes his beard tame which is wonderful in itself.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a pleasant and delightful smell...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still a little new at trying to manage my wiry beard, but this product is the best of those I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of things in mine and this is hands down the best product, by far.</li>
            <li>you have normal hair, I&#x27;m sure this product is great, but that&#x27;s why I got the heavy duty stuff.</li>
            <li>But if you have a shorter beard there are plenty of other Honest Amish products to help with you beard needs!</li>
            <li>I use this first out of the shower, and the Original Beard Wax after.</li>
            <li>I was using a bay oil-based beard softener but decided to try something new; I&#x27;d had a good experience with their beard wax so this was a natural choice.  </li>
            <li>I only mention it because many people said that it was strong, though I have never found it so.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new to having a full on beard, so I haven&#x27;t tried too many oils or balms yet, but I decided to trust this brand based on their claims of beard product experience.</li>
            <li>A little on the greasy end but smells great and helps my beard from going everywhere and getting all puffy</li>
            <li>In all honestly, it may have a little better hold</li>
            <li>an make my beard feel good  but did not tame any wild stray hairs.</li>
            <li>but then it&#x27;s absorbed and you&#x27;re left with an extremely happy and soft beard.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and the regular Honest Amish beard balm for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This response was obviously from someone representing HONEST AMISH.</li>
            <li>This one I would rate up there near the top.</li>
            <li>I have had a beard all my adult life, but I have never let it grow more the a inch or so.</li>
            <li>into consideration that using a proper quality beard brush does 80% of the work - the rest is subjective - (how good you feel about the smell, the feel of the hair, absorbing ability and</li>
            <li>it worth the price?  </li>
            <li>it worth the price?  </li>
            <li>I found Honest Amish and a beard oil (different company).</li>
            <li>(I use honest Amish beard oil daily)</li>
            <li>as expected, good value</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t explain it more clearly than that.</li>
            <li>This is his second time purchasing it, and I&#x27;m sure he will buy many more in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SUMMARY: I enjoyed using the product, I like the all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Second purchase from Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>For my own personal liking, I cannot get used to the smell.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I may need to try Honest Amish&#x27;s Extra Grit beard wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product leaves my beard soft, supple and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not a feminine smell kind of woodsy but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I melted the product with some beeswax and added some of my own essential oils</li>
            <li>The pouch it comes in is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li>The scent is light yet different, more citrus, than Dr. Ganix, which has a an almost leathery smell, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second tin of Honest Amish now.  </li>
            <li>He will only use honest amish products for his beard now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Honest Amish products, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Despite the rave reviews that all Honest Amish products seem to carry I was rather skeptical that it could be that great.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish is the only beard product l use and will use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I had been using the regular version of the Honest Amish beard balm and I liked what it was doing for my beard, but I needed a bit more hold to tame my 5 month growth.</li>
            <li>So I initially started using this balm at night and the Honest Amish beard wax (Original or Extra Grit) in the morning for more control.</li>
            <li>The regular conditioner had a unique smell of its own as well but did not bother me as much as this.</li>
            <li>As I get older (with a few more gray hairs) I&#x27;ve been finding more and more flyaway hairs in my beard that don&#x27;t want to stay in place.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the original balm, especially the scent.  </li>
            <li>Works great to tame my beard.</li>
            <li>Throw some in right out of the shower</li>
            <li>You can not apply it to you beard right from jar, you have to rub it between fingers until it became smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Bad product.</li>
            <li>Just about right for me, and how a gentlemen&#x27;s beard should smell.</li>
            <li>You will have to find the right combination for your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Something wasn&#x27;t right though.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have near the hold that I thought it would based on it being called &amp;#34;Heavy duty.&amp;#34; I guess I should&#x27;ve read more reviews first.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want anyone touching my beard when I have the wax in (I have kids) as it just gets all over your hands and isn&#x27;t simply wiped off easily.</li>
            <li>Before his beard was very coarse and knotted up very easily.</li>
            <li>(nice clean scent without being overpowering), and has made his beard less frizzy and much more soft.</li>
            <li>There is a light scent and it leaves his beard super soft.</li>
            <li>My lesson has been learned, My beard is soft and manageable and has just the slightest hint of a pleasant licorice smell that will disappear after a short time.</li>
            <li>Softer, tamer and the scent is light enough for my over sensitive nose to be a nice hint that fades away.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s always checking his beard out in the mirror.. or even past anything that reflects lol.</li>
            <li>Had my beard about 5 inches long this stuff was nice.</li>
            <li>At an inch long my beard is nice and uniform with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is a little bit different but not unpleasant, and fades quickly which is ideal.</li>
            <li>and it did help somewhat, but using a dab of this stuff right out of the shower makes it soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>It makes my uncontrollable beard lie down and look good.</li>
            <li>The product works exactly like it should and gives you a soft, smooth beard quickly.</li>
            <li>The Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm arrived in a small burlap bag (just like in the picture) and the first thing I noticed when I opened the can was a very pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh, feels great and helps tame some of the wild hairs</li>
            <li>Holds all day,  never have to worry about my beard splitting in the center like I experienced with so many other products.</li>
            <li>I use it two to three times a week the other days I use Honest Amish - Heavy Grit Wax another great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to strong perfumes and chemical smells, so I&#x27;m always hesitant when buying a product that will be so close to my nose.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft and easy to comb and style</li>
            <li>, I wish it would smell like citrus or something more fresh than a glass of bourbon (or come in different smells?)</li>
            <li>Really started to soften up my beard fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Really helps make my beard feel softer and quickly.</li>
            <li>The ingredients written on the side does sound like a very natural blend.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell how it makes my beard more tame, more full, and the smell is pleasant and not strong.</li>
            <li>When I bought it tought it will really keep calm my fly aways, but its not that different from the regular balm.</li>
            <li>He likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>They e-mailed me twice, asking for a positive review or for the opportunity to make it right before I posted a review.  </li>
            <li>Looks good and helps a little with the rogue whiskers.</li>
            <li>First off this seller ships asap, came very fast in comparison to others on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Works very well for conditioning and makes my beard very easy to shape if I don&#x27;t use shampoo to wash it out the next day.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not muchI guess, but when you pay almost $20 for a little tin of stuff it&#x27;d be nice if it was full.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan has continued to use this daily for about a month now, so I assume this means he is pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Wax first then balm.</li>
            <li>Makes your beard feel soft and smooth without feeling greasy or waxy.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and makes that icky pokey rough and gruff stuff on his face amazing to touch.</li>
            <li>- when first growing out a beard it keeps it from getting itchy so it doesn&#x27;t drive you nuts.</li>
            <li>As for the smell; I was worried about it after reading so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>This is the first balm that I&#x27;ve bought for my beard</li>
            <li>After trying many different companies and oils</li>
            <li>shiny!&lt;br /&gt;i didnt like the smell at first</li>
            <li>This is my first try with any product like this</li>
            <li>I use quite a bit--mostly for the conditioning--and I think it holds up pretty well even after my 9 or 10 hour work days.  </li>
            <li>At this point, the wax has set pretty well so you can move your beard around more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find their customer service to be of an even higher quality.</li>
            <li>Then I apply the balm to individual areas of my beard, to make sure it is evenly disbursed.</li>
            <li>Now that he&#x27;s been using it for a while, his beard is so much softer, and tamed!</li>
            <li>This is important for times I need to mash it into her soft skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I like the way it makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li>This stuff really tames your beard!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got one of those fuzzy pretty beards, move on.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well for my husbands beard.</li>
            <li>This was my first time growing a beard and buying beard products.</li>
            <li>I chose a five star rating because there was not a way amazon would let me rate it any higher.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll immediately think about ordering more in the future as I will.</li>
            <li>I like the regular balm a lot better.  </li>
            <li>but the regular conditions better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely adds more control than oil would</li>
            <li>(I have a pretty wiry beard).  </li>
            <li>(might be more of a personal problem).</li>
            <li>I am growing out my beard for the first time.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something different, something more geared towards beards, so I tried this stuff</li>
            <li>was hoping this would give slightly more control and conditioning, but this just leaves my beard feeling greasy and coarse.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it&#x27;d be able to handle my coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to any man with a beard...or woman ;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely buy again when it runs out.  </li>
            <li>Leaves me soft and smooth and not oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Of course I messed this one up by the hot weather.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty unruly beard...</li>
            <li>I will keep purchasing this as I use it up way to fast!</li>
            <li>In my personal opinion it&#x27;s more like a leave in conditioner for beards.</li>
            <li>and they willingly said they would refund me</li>
            <li>As a beard guy, I have tried many different beard balms, oils, and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I could feel a difference in texture after the first use.</li>
            <li>Put this stuff on first and then put on some beard oil over it.</li>
            <li>Way better than their regular beard balm.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m going off just the first use</li>
            <li>but now it is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The regular one conditions just as well as this one, this one just has a tad bit more thickness.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Wolfgang!</li>
            <li>This makes me beard feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>On the first day I used it I instantly feel in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty curly beard which this helped straighten it out a bit.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that this stuff does</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, my beard looks smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it not only on my beard, but I also rub it into my hands, face, and mostly bald head.</li>
            <li>Consider it for hot weather locations.</li>
            <li>Overall liking this beard conditioner but was hoping for more hold and control.</li>
            <li>A proper trim deals with that better than any product, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product, the Heavy Duty Beard Balm is the first product I have found that works to condition, and keep my beard in place and looking good all day.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve got a pretty unruly beard</li>
            <li>This is the first thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for my beard aside from a comb</li>
            <li>After the first couple of uses though, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>Just looks fuller and definitely holds shape better.  </li>
            <li>but hey, real men don&#x27;t shave!</li>
            <li>If you want more control get the regular beard wax!</li>
            <li>I find that it provides much more control than the regular beard balm.</li>
            <li>I use oil first and foremost then after a couple minutes use a hairdryer to heat this up and work it into my beard.</li>
            <li>its growing in much thicker and thankfully its softer!</li>
            <li>First time beard owner.</li>
            <li>so this was my first foray into the realm of beard-keeping products.  </li>
            <li>When I bought this I was actually looking for more of a wax that will help me guide where I want all this man fur on my face to go.</li>
            <li>This is a good heavy duty balm.</li>
            <li>Works good, may be too heavy for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a very satisfied customer, and will order other products form them as well (like their handmade soaps!).</li>
            <li>I will be trying other products made by honest Amish as I am sure the quality will be the same</li>
            <li>If you use the right amount, it feels softer, but it&#x27;s still really curly and springy.</li>
            <li>Given that you don&#x27;t wash your beard everyday (which you shouldn&#x27;t) this is the maintenance product that keeps it fresh and handsome!</li>
            <li>After searching through various beard oils and conditioners, I decided to give Honest Amish a try, primarily due to the long list of natural ingredients and a very fair price.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, this product is great because I don&#x27;t have to worry about ridiculous chemicals.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish has some other products that I would like to try though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a beard wax before and thought this would work better to make all my stray hairs lie flat</li>
            <li>I plan on checking out some other products from Honest Amish</li>
            <li>Other wax-based products require heating with a blow dryer or lots of rubbing to melt, but Honest Amish Beard Balm melts at body temperature.</li>
            <li>Smells is subtle and great,</li>
            <li>After the balm settled in for a few hours, my beard was noticeably softer as well, and a lot more comfortable on my face.  </li>
            <li>, I have extremely sensitive skin, no issues actually the relentlessly itching is gone and a nice side benefit</li>
            <li>, I didnt use much I can see the oil left on my finger tips from touching my goatee which makes sense.</li>
            <li>It did take a few days to get used to, but once I did, I really enjoy how it controls the beard and puts a healthy shine to it.  </li>
            <li>it is very easy to apply and adds a minimal healthy-looking (not overly) shine to it.</li>
            <li>pretty good, however sometimes if you do not thin it out well enough it will clump back together on your beard.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, wish it did a little more to help with the fly aways, but it takes care of my dry skin and makes my beard soft.</li>
            <li>Lightly scented, but generally neutral.</li>
            <li>Just really softens it up and keeps it pretty maintained.</li>
            <li>Work pretty well, my beard is really course</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s pretty much hit or miss.</li>
            <li>So although I like it, again, it&#x27;s pretty much hair grease.  </li>
            <li>smell is intense at first but is a mans mans smell.</li>
            <li>It stays on my hands for much longer and tends to get all over anything you touch in the first hour or so after application.  </li>
            <li>After the first two weeks, I didn&#x27;t really notice it any longer.    </li>
            <li>Minor inconvenience for having a healthy beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Probably better for the long beards.</li>
            <li>That plus this beard goop have pretty much eliminated all my Winter beard itch problems.</li>
            <li>I apply it in the morning before work, and the scent has pretty much dissipated by lunch time.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t my first time getting this wax, I have a very rebel bear...</li>
            <li>I find it is slightly easier to apply the Honest Amish, but I also like the control that I get from Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li>When I combine this with their beard wax my beard gets super soft.</li>
            <li>I really cant say to much since this is my first beard product</li>
            <li>Smell fades fairly quick, balm absorbs into your beard over time and makes soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Ok...I am totally not knocking the honest Amish products because since I&#x27;ve discovered their beard balms and leave in conditioners, I barely go a day without it</li>
            <li>I wash it with shampoo, spray leave-in conditioner in it, blow dry it and top it off with this balm.  </li>
            <li>First off it is VERY oily so much so that you can see it from across the room.</li>
            <li>Friend of mine recommend this stuff and sold me by saying using this product makes his beard super soft and that his wife said the difference was night and day.</li>
            <li>Really good stuff, especially for a long beard.  </li>
            <li>I really do like the balm and can safely say that as long as I&#x27;m sporting a beard</li>
            <li>Definitely not for styling, smell is a bit strong</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much either and works extremely well to tame beard and make it look awesome!</li>
            <li>My tin arrived a bit banged up, but that certainly doesn&#x27;t affect the product.</li>
            <li>It has been pretty warm on the East Coast (mid to upper 80s), so maybe ambient temperature has something to do with it not taking to the beard.  </li>
            <li>It gives my beard a great silky feel and is easily malleable in order to control some of the crazy &#x27;rogue&#x27; hairs.</li>
            <li>OK, maybe not that long, but I have had facial hair most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>It is very curly in some spots and straight in others and chock full of wild hairs that like to stand straight out.</li>
            <li>, I will continue to look at your other products as I continue to grow my first large beard :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, and most importantly - &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Applying any beard product on your face will require using a proper beard brush&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;Without using a proper (boar bristle) beard brush, the product simply won&#x27;t get to its full potential.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>I would not rate one higher than the other, because they both do what they say they will, soften your beard, give you some control, and a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s fine, and I will use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I&#x27;ll probably look for something different after that.</li>
            <li>No, seriously!</li>
            <li>you must be high or never worked in a restaurant kitchen before, because in my opinion that&#x27;s exactly what it smells like...</li>
            <li>This product may be great for people who just need a little extra control</li>
            <li>am very much looking forward to using this fine product while I grow the new one out starting in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Smells slightly different then the other stuff (still good) but holds a little better!</li>
            <li>My only issue is it seems to flake more easily than other balms.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish really tamed that puppy down!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to Mod Cabin which I thoroughly enjoy.</li>
            <li>The balm was chunky and gritty but after massaging it in my hands it melted smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>He has a very curly beard so it really helps with knots and tangles.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or you will end up greasy-</li>
            <li>The pool water just really  made my beard like a wire brush.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>my beard has always been curly on one side but not anymore thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>and I rock a righteous beard thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li>Should be used in conjunction with beard wax for people with really Wirey beards.</li>
            <li>After experimenting over 2 weeks with how much to use, I found that I either get no softening and conditioning,  or</li>
            <li>, it now much smoother</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any real advantage to this over burts bee&#x27;s miracle salve.</li>
            <li>I really like the aroma of this stuff.....</li>
            <li>, really let my beard moisturized all day 24 hours no matter the weather</li>
            <li>Really helped soften my beard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like them both.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>rub the balm into my beard well with the palms of my hands, and finish it off with my boar bristle brush to really get the oils to distribute  evenly.</li>
            <li>It really helped in the ichy phase.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your beard soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is not over powering, but very manly.</li>
            <li>this really isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li>But no matter how much I tried working the beard balm in my hands before applying, the beads wouldn&#x27;t melt.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much value in using it.</li>
            <li>He would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Use to much, and that&#x27;s a headache in itself.</li>
            <li>and I know when I put to much on, my glassed end up smeared with</li>
            <li>But like others have said, it does not take much to treat your beard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I expected it would give more control of my beard</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much easier to work with</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>In it&#x27;s defense I do have a very wiry undisciplined beard...</li>
            <li>so you really have to work it with your hand and fingers quite a while for it to liquefy.  </li>
            <li>Really does what it says on the tin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really really like this product.</li>
            <li>A thoughtful gesture from folks who stand by their products and understand that what you send out into the world comes back to you.</li>
            <li>This product does not seem to soften the beard much at all.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like licorice, but I did enjoy the scent of it in the regular balm.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve actually grown to enjoy the smell.  </li>
            <li>My beard is MUCH softer when I use the beard</li>
            <li>balm works very well</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t have to worry about the ingrown hairs as much</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not the beard balm&#x27;s fault that my hair is like that, but it just doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot to help.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t take much....</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well...</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all, a bit about the size of a pea</li>
            <li>like I stated, I don&#x27;t use much but it leaves my skin and beard shiny.</li>
            <li>I had expected this &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; beard balm to have more hold when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose when it came to trying this product.  </li>
            <li>I expected a better hold.</li>
            <li>Bought this not knowing whether this stuff really works or not.</li>
            <li>highly recommended for the beard grower in your life!</li>
            <li>My beard has shapes it doesn&#x27;t want to give up and one area that is really like crinkled wires.  </li>
            <li>This helped straighten it out and made it much softer.</li>
            <li>If if leaves your beard looking greasy; you just used too much.  </li>
            <li>Keeps everything in place and doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent at all.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>My beard is very curly and tends to get a lot of stray hairs that don&#x27;t seem to obey my comb</li>
            <li>This may work for some people but it just really doesn&#x27;t hold up against my beard.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>The texture is really gritty/grainy until you get it sufficiently melted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to brush and comb now.</li>
            <li>I really like this as a change of pace from beard oil.</li>
            <li>It keeps your beard very well moisturized.</li>
            <li>I think this is because my beard had never really been conditioned before and just became more manageable and softer over time with use of a balm.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, but it really clashes with my cologne.</li>
            <li>he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>He loves the stuff, will be ordering more as he never wants to run out!&lt;br</li>
            <li>i really like how it works, but i don&#x27;t care for the smell of it</li>
            <li>highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using honest Amish beard balm for severely months now, and as my beard has progressed I decided to step up to the heavy duty.</li>
            <li>I have used the balm and the heavy grit beard wax from Honest Amish.  </li>
            <li>I decided it was time to give the Honest Amish - Heavy Duty Beard Balm a try.</li>
            <li>I liked the regular enough to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely good stuff, however they are not really the same thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gritty and you need to considerably mix it in the palm of your hand to melt it and be able to apply it.</li>
            <li>I tried many different things to try and make my beard soft and not wiry.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE noticed my beard has a better overall shine and soft feel to it, but as it&#x27;s getting longer</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for at least 4 to 6 months.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple different products for my beard and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>you are looking for something to tame the strays and add a nice sheen to your beard, this is it.  </li>
            <li>It holds extremely well without making my beard appear that I&#x27;ve put a ton of wax in it and keeps my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and I imagine that helps condition it pretty good, but I wanted something to tame the wild hairs a little more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure like other reviewers mentioned,</li>
            <li>mostly got this due to beard dandruff.</li>
            <li>My three month growth is getting pretty wild!</li>
            <li>The odor of the balm was a little overwhelming at first, but it does not linger throughout the day</li>
            <li>Then as I comb it, add just a tiny bit of the Original Beard Wax to the area of crinkled wires.  </li>
            <li>Emailed the company, got a friendly response the very next morning.</li>
            <li>I wonder what their other products do. :)</li>
            <li>Just as described, a very small amount keeps my beard in good condition.</li>
            <li>highly recommend Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>When my beard grows more than an inch long it starts kinking out wildly.</li>
            <li>It doesnt have a very strong scent once you have it in your beard for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>And yes, it doesn&#x27;t take much, make sure to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; it down in the palms of your hands before applying.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Nothing&#x27;s gonna make your beard not look like pubes.&amp;#34; Well folks, my wife was pretty much right about that, my beard hair is still coarse and wavy.</li>
            <li>It was getting dry and itchy and with this beard balm it looks shiny and healthy and feels soft.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and helps tame the curly, wild mess of a beard that hangs from my face.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the strange scent.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit longer to liquefy in hands than the normal balm but does its job wants in your beard.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a redhead and my beard is very coarse, but after using this daily, it&#x27;s soft like normal hair, love it!</li>
            <li>I hesitate to recommend the scent only because it seems to scream &amp;#34;I have something in my beard!&amp;#34; but it is not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>amazing beard hydration with just the right amount of wax to add a little extra control of your beard.</li>
            <li>I have on tried the regular/original Amish balm a few times and from when I can tell the original softens more but has less hold and the heavy duty keeps a good hold but does not soften as much.</li>
            <li>I was kinda sad about that because I LOVE the scent of this stuff and didn&#x27;t consider it to be that strong in the first place.</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a week, but it is working great to help tame wild hairs and keep my cheeks under control.  </li>
            <li>After reading many of the reviews on here, both good and bad, I decided to go ahead and give this balm a try.</li>
            <li>As I have become more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; and I have less hair on my head</li>
            <li>After a lot of research and review-reading, I decided on this particular one.</li>
            <li>Ill sure be buying more.</li>
            <li>I am able to use a significantly lesser amount of balm for the same hold, which will save me</li>
            <li>First off, this product doesn&#x27;t describe itself as a wax or a holding agent, so I &#x27;m not sure why so many people are complaining about it not being a wax or styling agent.</li>
            <li>However this particular product didn&#x27;t quite deliver as well as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>The heavy duty works just as good as the regular balm and it helps control those stray hairs.</li>
            <li>smell is similar to the standard balm, but I get more mint out of it, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I really enjoyed smelling it through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Softens &amp; conditions&amp;#34; - After 3 months of regular daily use, I didn&#x27;t notice any softening or conditioning.</li>
            <li>Still, I am able to get the same about of shine and &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; from the basic anti-frizz shine serum I use on my hair (which is cheaper).</li>
            <li>This product gets everything going the same way and does a good job of keeping my beard from looking messy.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much more for me than their regular balm, so I switched back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely taking better care of my whiskers than I was before, so I don&#x27;t look like such a bum.</li>
            <li>Now I rinse it only when I take most showers and wash it about every third day.</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t do anything to tame my unruly beard hairs and it didn&#x27;t control my beard any more than a beard brush does on</li>
            <li>It is ok, we&#x27;ll see how things go, but all in all I am not satisfied with what I got, I expected more.</li>
            <li>This is my third tin of Honest Amish Beard Balm, my first tin of the Heavy Duty product.</li>
            <li>oil-like&amp;#34; product that comes in solid form but doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good or last as long.  </li>
            <li>Everything from their beard wax to soaps are quality products and I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would still highly recommend this as conditioning product.</li>
            <li>so I guess my expectations were a bit too high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I was worried about it melting from the high heat we are having</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to any and all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a softer and healthier beard</li>
            <li>High quality leave in beard conditioner.</li>
            <li>I prefer, slightly, Honest Amish to Beard Balm due to the initial texture and consistency.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be more of a cream, but kept getting little chunks of the stuff that would stick in my beard.</li>
            <li>It does condition and help make your beard a little more manageable.</li>
            <li>It might moisturize the beard a little, but a conditioner works much better.  </li>
            <li>You only need a very little bit and it makes your beard look a lot more full.</li>
            <li>Your beard will be happy and your wallet will be sad.</li>
            <li>I have a very wiry and wild beard.</li>
            <li>As far as control, it didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry but for everyone saying how great of a smell it has...</li>
            <li>It also helps straighten hairs out but not to much that I completely lose the curl character</li>
            <li>Heavy duty works better on my beard.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice and makes me feel like a man when I use it, so there&#x27;s that at least.</li>
            <li>Even if I only got, let&#x27;s say, one month of use out of a tin, I&#x27;d still say that it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Even if I only got, let&#x27;s say, one month of use out of a tin, I&#x27;d still say that it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>True, it&#x27;s faint and doesn&#x27;t last long, but a more piney or something would be nice.</li>
            <li>, I had to use a thumbnail to scrape it out unlike the normal balm which swipes out with a fingertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can shape your beard significantly better with the heavy duty balm.  </li>
            <li>started using the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm (I have very course facial hair) about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>and/or their Normal Beard balm, I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li>Use a wax for the moustache, and a balm for most of the beard, and this for the sides and trouble spots.</li>
            <li>At least, not the kind of difference this product claims to give.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because the product I normally use was out of stock.</li>
            <li>If there are just a few stray hairs, I&#x27;ll then trim them for a better defined beard outline.</li>
            <li>at first it reminds me of burts bees wax, but I barely notice the smell</li>
            <li>feel it leaves behind which cant be good for any skin.</li>
            <li>I have used Honest Amish products before I bought this, and they just simply don&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li>Much has also been written about the scent, and I tend to agree that, at least at first, its quite strong.  </li>
            <li>There are some mixed reviews and from what I mainly see is that some men expect this product to magically change their weak beards to strong beards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 4, maybe even 5 stars, but what burns me on this product stems from a previous review I left on another type of balm from Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>Only con (so far) is that it runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>I expected a less grease balm with a good smell...</li>
            <li>and my beard shapes right back up as if I never slept on it.</li>
            <li>I use this from time to time to keep my beard more tame.</li>
            <li>I have a very stiff beard and Honest Amish keeps it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to grow my beard a little longer, but kept trimming it back because I couldn&#x27;t get a nicely groomed look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several beard balms and oils, and this one rates pretty high.</li>
            <li>I purchased this beard balm for my newly bearded boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I am new to using products like this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of beard maintenance</li>
            <li>If you are new to beard products, this is where you should start.</li>
            <li>The scent is definitely masculine, but not too strong that it over powers other things.  </li>
            <li>(it absolutely works better in a wet beard than a dry one) and comb through.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it does help the appearance of a beard and has a nice subtle smell to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2 weeks now, and I really don&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li>I actually like both scents, but my wife thinks the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm smells like citronella (which she doesn&#x27;t like) - bummer.  </li>
            <li>The directions were very clear &amp; it is packaged well.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this for his beard - makes it very soft</li>
            <li>Applying is very fast and simple.</li>
            <li>I have a very soft beard already</li>
            <li>and it makes his beard very soft.</li>
            <li>It requires very little per application, produces good hold, and has even helped reduce instances of flaky, dry skin under my beard.</li>
            <li>This stuff melts easily in your hands and works into your beard without a mess.</li>
            <li>It is made from several natural oils, but does not feel oily on your face or beard if used in the right amount.</li>
            <li>Great beard balm, but like other reviewers said it&#x27;s like a thick pommade.</li>
            <li>was surprise at the size of the can, sure seems small for what you pay.</li>
            <li>It makes my beard really soft!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the oily texture and noticed that it did not fair well in warm climates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d make it past a month before needing to order more.</li>
            <li>; - The balm didn&#x27;t lend much style control even though this heavy duty balm &amp;#34;gives more control&amp;#34; than their regular balm.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, the hair is pretty coarse again.</li>
            <li>My beard&#x27;s never been so soft!</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again, only due to the price, but I surely recommend it.</li>
            <li>first I&#x27;d put a bit in in the morning and continued to wash it daily.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t use enough and</li>
            <li>Cool idea and packaging, not really for me.</li>
            <li>Knocked one star off as it can leave little pieces that won&#x27;t mix in and the scent is overly strong for a product that intended to be used two inches from your nose.</li>
            <li>I have a thicker beard and this product not only has a nice aroma that is almost perfectly faint but present at the same time, but it also gives my beard a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I got the heavy duty because I thought with my thick and coarse hairs it would fair a lot better than the regular balm.</li>
            <li>First of all, I was really surprised how tiny the can is.</li>
            <li>My beard went from wild and dull colored to appearing fuller and far more vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have any scent, just a minor natural fragrance that you can&#x27; really smell.</li>
            <li>After giving Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm a long and drawn out testing stage, I feel compelled to share my experience with the rest of the beard nation!</li>
            <li>Using this balm about twice a week after shampooing has definitely made my beard softer and more manageable, and my beard skin less itchy.</li>
            <li>In a nutshell, honest amish is far less than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other beard care products and never had the success this has given me on simply the first use.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit better than what I normally use, but I think I will only use this as my back up now that the other product is in stock.</li>
            <li>It does provide a little more control, but is not as scented as the regular balm (I like the fragrance).</li>
            <li>Wish it made my beard a little more softer than it does, but I have only been using for five days.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of their regular beard balm but want/need a little more control, this is the stuff.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that this tin lasted me a little more than three months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He had been using the leave in conditioner for about three months which helped soften his beard but did not really condition or smooth out the curly, coarse hairs.</li>
            <li>Quality product, has completely softened my unruly beard.</li>
            <li>A natural scent, conditions well.  </li>
            <li>Smell is soft</li>
            <li>Beard feels soft and in-place come mid-day once the oils finally either come off on your hand (and then onto anything you subsequently touch) and/or get absorbed by your beard.</li>
            <li>Recommend applying directly after showers.</li>
            <li>and it wasnt near as scrachy.</li>
            <li>: doesn&#x27;t go as far as I would like...</li>
            <li>a larger size would be welcome, seems as though it really stiffens up in the cold, feels like I put gel in my beard if I&#x27;m working outdoors after application.</li>
            <li>I want my beard to be soft but not oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural smell that I expect will fade over time while wearing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>makes beard soft and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>Starred in beards gone wild.</li>
            <li>It really makes a big difference compared to growing a beard without it.retty</li>
            <li>It really makes a big difference compared to growing a beard without it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to freeze every wild hair in place, this won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>key thing is that this makes my beard much softer.</li>
            <li>It does help control the unruly hairs and help in keeping your beard soft.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work nearly as well as beard oil.</li>
            <li>Leaves the beard soft and helps keep those wild hairs from sticking out all over the place.</li>
            <li>my beard because they are surprised how soft it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it actually has wax in it (probably just more shea butter or something), but it&#x27;s definitely much harder in the tin than the standard balm</li>
            <li>It gives your hair that natural sheen again and helps with styling.</li>
            <li>This stuff rocks and serves a purpose beyond just making your beard soft.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use this product to keep beard soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>This makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Then the balm is ready to be applied to my beard starting in the areas that need it most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a heavy waxiness.</li>
            <li>It leaves the beard feeling smoother, softer, and helps remove some natural curling.</li>
            <li>I have a very coarse beard, and it really doesn&#x27;t do anything to help it.</li>
            <li>My initial assumption was that this product was the same as the regular, but it simply had more control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but compared with the regular product it does very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Triple Moisture Touch Leave In conditioner/hair cream, and felt that my beard was &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; throughout the day, but soft.  </li>
            <li>My beard is getting pretty long...</li>
            <li>This product does not (thankfully) get rid of all the natural shape.</li>
            <li>However, as far as softening up my beard it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My beard is still somewhat curly, but it isn&#x27;t wild anymore.</li>
            <li>It works like advertised, makes your beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Makes even a wiry beard like mine soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Much thicker than the regular beard balm.</li>
            <li>At night if I choose to wash my beard, I use old fashioned pine tar soap for that, I will apply the beard oil</li>
            <li>Makes my beard soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again and will be looking for an alternative before I am anywhere near out of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to early to say if it has any effect on the beard yet but will follow up on the review.</li>
            <li>Softens beard and helps a bit controlling the wild, stray beard hairs.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my 19 yr old son for Christmas..</li>
            <li>This product relaxed his coarse, brittle, curly hair and really helped soothe his irritated</li>
            <li>When applied it makes my beard soft and it stays in place.</li>
            <li>My company does not mind my beard, but requires it to appear neat and professional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural ingredients and made by hand by the Amish workers.</li>
            <li>His beard Is so soft.</li>
            <li>The heavy duty beard balm makes his beard smooth and shiny and also helps keeps the strays in place.</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t get near the amount of oil your head hair does.</li>
            <li>The second day, I used too much and my beard looked a bit shiny.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Bought both heavy duty and regular and love them both.</li>
            <li>my beard is grey and coarse, and has a mind of it own, this is the only product that manages the long hairs from sticking out all over the place.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for more softness for your lady then go with the regular one, if you are going on an interview then use the heavy duty.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t tell it helped you, you most likely didn&#x27;t need the heavy duty and should have gotten the regular.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Over-priced for 2 ounces of product that won&#x27;t last more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Was skeptical on the cost but the reviews were good ao gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>Okay, but didn&#x27;t like the oily residue that never seemed to absorb despite the fact that I followed directions and have a thick beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this balm several times now and it goes on easily and last long.</li>
            <li>beard hair is pretty dry and can get somewhat unruly</li>
            <li>Product was not as described - rather than a smooth balm or paste, it was congealed and oily with tiny beads of suspended wax throughout, as seen in other photo reviews.  </li>
            <li>Has to dry first, but after that comb it out</li>
            <li>Thats pretty much it, using them both at the same time would make it too greasy but the heavy duty and original definitely have different purposes.</li>
            <li>Only reason for only 4 stars is that I&#x27;m not that fond of the smell, takes some getting used to, especially if it was on a full beard closer to the nose.</li>
            <li>So pretty much put the heavy duty on before work</li>
            <li>I may use a little more here and there if my face feels dry.</li>
            <li>Having no previous experience grooming a beard, I had high hopes but low expectations.  </li>
            <li>I do however highly recommend the extra grit beard wax.</li>
            <li>I was very easy to break down and apply to my beard but the major down side</li>
            <li>My beard length is around 10 inches and thick, the beard balm makes my beard soft and easy to shape in the morning.  </li>
            <li>(I have a long beard, so this is a real concern).</li>
            <li>This was my second purchase of the Heavy Duty, and will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Just be careful if ordering during the hot months because it will arrive melted.</li>
            <li>well if you enjoy a greasy beard that you cant touch through out the day but after years of having my goatee its hard to not touch it and break old habits.</li>
            <li>but I think mostly would be useful if you were going for a crazy shaped mustache.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects on the hair, but it does help tame the wild beast, it goes on easy and thoroughly, and from the burlap sack it comes in, to the tongue-in-bearded-cheek instructions, to the tin-filled product itself, there&#x27;s no doubt</li>
            <li>It also works great on hair if you hate that super dry looking frizziness after shampooing.</li>
            <li>I blow dried mostly so that my chin and cheeks would not stay wet, but the skin conditioners in this product keep me from having any flakiness, irritation, or itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first beard balm and I have a fairly thick beard I have grown out for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to being a beardsman and love how it keeps my beard looking tight and groomed everyday.</li>
            <li>This is only the 2nd leave-in beard balm I have ever used, the other being Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Saver.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is a little oily but if you rub it into your beard, comb, leave for a few minutes, and then re-comb, it is awesome.</li>
            <li>With this, I can grow it as long as I want and maintain a tame, professional and show worthy beard!</li>
            <li>Seriously considering becoming Amish because of this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the original did the job, but the heavy duty balm goes above and beyond the call of duty.</li>
            <li>From the first application, you could see a difference in the color of his beard - the dull red was now a deep, rich red.</li>
            <li>Right, Skin Moisturize and Tight</li>
            <li>I thought it would have held the hair down a little more, but I&#x27;ll deal with it.  </li>
            <li>formula is likely centuries old, and it still works.  </li>
            <li>Instant difference on this wiry out of control 3 week old beard.</li>
            <li>point is that after using the heavy duty balm for about a week, I really noticed how much conditioning the regular balm does.  </li>
            <li>If you have stubble or a week old beard, you may need the regular balm or some oils.</li>
            <li>Naturally, it became very coarse and wiry.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to add natural oils back in, get rid of the somewhat unruly hairs.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard extra soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>All natural American made.</li>
            <li>Be careful how much you use...</li>
            <li>However, it does not really hold your beard or mustache in place; though, it is really greasy.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to any guy with a beard, or even to guys with short hair who want something natural to use on their scalp.</li>
            <li>keeps the beard soft, controllable (I have an especially bushy beard)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d still be weird for me to rate it a 5/5 even given that customer service because this is still a review of this product and my experience with it, but after the surprise refund and extremely kind message, I felt compelled to update my review and let everyone know.</li>
            <li>) Growing it out for 6-8 weeks and then trimming lightly to even up the slow vs fast&lt;</li>
            <li>You just need to experiment a little with how and when you apply them and determine which product is right for you.</li>
            <li>After a little experimentation, I found the right amount for me.</li>
            <li>Inside my tin the balm had separated but it became a relaxing ritual to slowly melt it all down in the palm of my hand (if you so choose you can melt the balm in a pan with warm water</li>
            <li>My man-mane is several inches long and VERY curly and wiry, this is helping to tame down the strays and consolidate the bush into something a bit more sculpted.</li>
            <li>This stuff works way better than beard oils in my opinion is easier to apply and less oily and messy.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get something to tame my wild man beard, but this was a huge disappointment!  </li>
            <li>Much milder smell than other balms I have used.</li>
            <li>and it really helps with extremely unruly beards.</li>
            <li>The two products complement each other very well, but they are not interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then again, I may have been using way too much of that other product.</li>
            <li>It seems much thicker than nay other beard balm I had tried before.  </li>
            <li>The Heavy Duty gives my beard a little bit more structure and is not as oily as the Leave-In Conditioner.</li>
            <li>It was the smell that really got to me, like a musty, dirty hippy scent that I was glad to wash out.</li>
            <li>The smell is great but faint, so it vanishes after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely softer when I use the balm, but you have to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>After search social media sites, internet blogs and hundred&#x27;s of product reviews</li>
            <li>The manufacturer has a social media site check it out for additional information.</li>
            <li>The heavy duty beard balm is my favorite for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The balm is a little gritty which means more rubbing to get it smoothed out without the little granules.</li>
            <li>This is almost certainly the only beard product I will be buying form now on (though I might try other well-received balms just to see).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i found it to be too greasy and the grit makes my beard sparkle, but hey maybe you are going for the sparkly look, does tame wild hairs very well</li>
            <li>Again, I have only used for five days so far, but it seems like this tiny 2-ounce tin would last me longer than the 4 ounce</li>
            <li>The ingredient list on my new tin changed slightly from what it says on my old tin.</li>
            <li>I use the large tin and even using larger amounts it seems to last a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the large tin and even using larger amounts it seems to last a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s melted it works fine but not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>This has really minimized my flakes and helps to keep my beard down.  </li>
            <li>I have a very wiry beard and this stuff calms it down to a degree.</li>
            <li>The product is very thin, melts very easily, and has no hold to it.  </li>
            <li>But unless you have a full beard that is actually coarse, dry and stiff, you may not notice the benefit of this balm.</li>
            <li>Keeps the hair soft, and stops the itchiness from dry skin when you start growing it longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also recommend not using too much to start (half dime size to start).  </li>
            <li>It turned my dry, wiry, brittle beard hairs soft and supple.</li>
            <li>After one use he noticed his beard was much softer and tamer and his skin was less itchy as well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much for me, maybe half the size of my thumbnail.</li>
            <li>Super thick and wavy/curly.</li>
            <li>I have tried other beard balms and they were much more stiff and harder to work in and way thicker.</li>
            <li>If you want a soft beard and you need to keep  wild hairs laying down</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have near the beard that I want yet, but it does help keep down the wild hairs.  </li>
            <li>After just a few days I could notice a difference in my gnarly chin rug softening up, becoming less course, and much easier to tame.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy the fancy cans with crazy designs and logos, get this and have a beard that you and that significant other will enjoy</li>
            <li>But the oils never seem to last long and require several reapplications to keep my beard soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>biggest complaint is that it is super grainy, and those grains don&#x27;t seem to entirely liquify with friction.</li>
            <li>I now have used several products from other vendors (almost all rather disappointing) and the following from Honest Amish:  Beard Balm, Original Beard Wax and Heavy Duty Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t care with the balm since my beard won&#x27;t really feel oilier than my face after a little while.</li>

            <li> As always i am very happy with all of the honest Amish products that i have got from them!!</li>
            <li> Both are very good products.  </li>
            <li> Very good stuff.</li>
            <li> IT doesn&#x27;t leave a sheen like some others, but the hold is incredible.  </li>
            <li> The product smells really good too!</li>
            <li> regards to my Amish brothers who labor to produce this product, it IS exceptionally good!</li>
            <li> Good beard product, but don&#x27;t expect it to shape your unruly beard!</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  </li>
            <li> and I like it because he&#x27;s happy, happy, happy, happy and the stuff smells good!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s honestly the best customer service I&#x27;ve ever experienced, so I&#x27;m raising my rating from 3/5 stars to 4/5.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a great smell and a great hold.</li>
            <li> Great for conditioning and taming to a point, but I&#x27;ll probably be buying some wax for shaping too.</li>
            <li> It smells great</li>
            <li> Pros: gets the job done, softens and adds a great shine to your face mane.</li>

            <li> Good beard-keeping.</li>
            <li> Smells good and does its job.</li>
            <li> It smells good going on, but after couple of hours smells like spaghetti sauce.</li>
            <li> good stuff here</li>
            <li> really good for my beard.  </li>
            <li> Using a good balm on the rest of the beard&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> so I use this to help keep it in check and looking good.</li>
            <li> However, the balm does smell good and conditioned the beard keeping it conditioned.</li>
            <li> However...it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> I still have a good deal of unruly beard</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> but considering the ingredients it makes sense that it does a good job at bear conditioning.</li>
            <li> I have a longer beard and it&#x27;s never looked so good.  </li>
            <li> Good product</li>

            <li> Smells nice and keeps the beard looking good.</li>
            <li> I think it has a nice aroma; the wife says it smells spicy (and good).</li>

            <li> Love it and love the smell!!</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said it best when they said that they really knew how good the product was when they quit using it.  </li>

            <li> Smells good and makes the hair more workable.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try an Honest Amish product that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> and I have no problem telling them about Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> keeps the tangles out, the frizzies to a minimum, and it even smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma, feels greasy in your hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m good with that as any kind of relief is better than none.</li>
            <li> The aroma is nice though.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got 4 inch barbed wire with a mind of its own, get this.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found this stuff before purchasing the Honest Amish wax (the &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great oil,  smells great and makes my beard look much healthier.  </li>
            <li> I recommend all Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li> After 40 years of wearing a beard nice to have it not feel like a Brillo pad...</li>
            <li> It does add a &amp;#34;glisten&amp;#34; to my beard, a kind of shine or sheen to it.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice for moisturizing beard.</li>
            <li> It works really well, and it smells great!  </li>
            <li> Leaves a nice sheen but is never oily like some beard wax.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency but not meant to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already started recommending Honest Amish products to my bearded brethren.  </li>
            <li> He smells delightful and he gets complimented very often on it.</li>
            <li> It also leaves your beard with a nice shine and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping it&#x27;d soften my beard, make it feel nice, and maybe even straighten it a bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had used the &amp;#34;Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-in Conditioner&amp;#34; before and liked it so I figured I would try this one to see the difference.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product you can use on your beard!</li>
            <li> The reason I am leaving a 5/5 star review is because honest amish emailed me today asking how I liked it</li>
            <li> Also liked the way it went into my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have beard dandruff and flakey skin make sure to use a good beard soap/soap because this product will suspend those particles in your beard.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s honest if you ask me</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> the Honest Amish also makes.</li>
            <li> I ended needing to use Honest Amish&#x27;s Beard Wax to finish taming my beard</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and not at all overpowering if you found you weren&#x27;t too fond of it.  </li>
            <li> This product smells good and does add slightly more beard control and luster.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just continue to let my beard do its own beard stuff.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, earthy but kinda citrusy.</li>
            <li> I think it smells like a nice after shave though.  </li>
            <li> Some may not like the smell, but I think it is rather nice.</li>
            <li> I think at times, but is nice as it keeps the skin under the beard nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Got in touch with Honest Amish</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Honest Amish products for about a year now.</li>
            <li> It nurishes the hair and the skin while keeping the beard nicely groomed.</li>
            <li> Thank you Honest Amish for a life changing product.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have a nicely crafted and shaped beard and then put on the original one before bed so that the ladies are happy.</li>
            <li> It has been great in my endeavor to grow a nice full beard.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and and it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> but when the weather is warm its very easy to spread in your hands and apply.</li>
            <li> Just wish it had a bit more of a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It softens very quickly in your hands and does a great job at softening your whiskers; I&#x27;ve found it makes my hair more manageable and controllable, as mine is frizzy by nature.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Honest Amish!!</li>
            <li> Most important, my wife is happy.</li>
            <li> The best product Honest Amosh offers.</li>
            <li> This product does have an incredibly good scent that is very mild.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to work into even think beards.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell at all.</li>
            <li> It has an interesting scent that is pleasant but a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> After trying the very first time, he fell in love!!</li>
            <li> It keeps my door knocker and epic mustache looking great!</li>
            <li> Best beard balm I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> We started with Honest Amish beard oil which substantially changed the conditioning of his skin and his beard making it more tolerable.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a nice, light smell too!</li>
            <li> By far the best oil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It did add a nice healthy shine that</li>
            <li> There are reviews I read that said they love the smell, to each their own.</li>
            <li> Both work as advertised, but the Honest Amish works better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a couple of days when its freshly melted.</li>
            <li> I will be using Honest Amish from here on for sure.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love Honest Amish Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> Best i have tried so far</li>
            <li> First off, I just want to say that I think Honest Amish is a great company that cares about the product they sell.</li>
            <li> Sure it smells great, comes in a cool tin and a fancy burlap sack.</li>
            <li> Holds better than oils alone and the light licorice scent is pleasant while it lasts.</li>
            <li> It ships very quickly!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> The price is very fair, considering this size will last you a good while.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There was an issue during shipping but the folks at Honest Amish were awesome and a replacement arrived very shortly after I had contacted them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This looks to be a great Balm and was very much looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> It is only once I tried,these products that I&#x27;ve begun to understand how my great great grandfather groomed his beard 100 or more years ago.</li>
            <li> The description is very accurate as is the application method.</li>
            <li> It had a very light unoffensive fragrance to me.  </li>
            <li> , Fragrance is Very Light...</li>
            <li> this is great, my wife complemented me on my beard after the first day of use,  gave it a healthy shine</li>
            <li> Great product as usual been ordering this for quite often and it&#x27;s the best for conditioning and taming my beard</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, leaves my beard easy to style.</li>
            <li> The Honest Amish beard balm is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but not at all strong.  </li>
            <li> I strongly dislike the scent of the wax (smells like putting crayons on my face, ugh), and it doesn&#x27;t soften the beard as nicely as this does.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good product and keeps my beard shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This balm is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It was actually much better in terms of ability to apply</li>
            <li> I have worn this product and enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li> Many of my friends wear this product and love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li> My grandson said your product was outstanding.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you brush you beard out</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I reviewed a lighter version of this balm talking about how oily the product was and that there may be something better out there.</li>
            <li> I like how you get some of the wax and rub it in your hands until it is more of a liquid.</li>
            <li> It spreads better that way.</li>
            <li> The scent is okay.</li>
            <li> Love the fact</li>
            <li> I have been growing my goatee for around 6 years and have never been able to get it longer than 4-5 inches without it going all scraggly, so hopefully this stuff well help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already planning to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Think of this as being more like a mousse or pomade than a firm-hold hair</li>
            <li> brush and do a more aggressive shaping and fluffing.  </li>
            <li> So, I have to give it three stars for OK.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this beard balm.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the balm.</li>
            <li> I like it better than any of the beard oils.</li>
            <li> Between the balm and a separate oil, my beard has never been better.  </li>
            <li> I must admit I prefer using this much more than I ever did any of the oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> and I like the feel of my beard now much better.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and leaves my beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the spicy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> It will get most of your beard orderly though.</li>
            <li> My beard is not coarse but it&#x27;s fairly &amp;#34;scraggly&amp;#34;, lots of fly away hairs.</li>
            <li> It keeps my beard feeling a lot better, and much more controlled looking.</li>
            <li> People are always asking how I get my beard to look so healthy</li>
            <li> Try it and you will love it.</li>
            <li> this is the top shelf stuff.</li>
            <li> I think what I thought this was, was used more for control than anything else.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be more of a sold variation of what their oils are.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is freaking magic.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed it the most of the years on my chin.</li>
            <li> I love the sheen that it gives my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this stuff</li>
            <li> and I have recommended it to many of my bearded friends.  </li>
            <li> When I get close to running out of this, I&#x27;ll be buying more.  </li>
            <li> I definetly make sure to recommend it to my bearded friends.</li>
            <li> keeps my beard well conditioned and does OK on keeping it looking well groomed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product from a environmentally responsible company.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the product is ok</li>
            <li> Within a day of delivery I got an email asking if I was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t control the strays as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> it does add some control and it also makes my beard look more uniform.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My going on three year beard is getting more and more unruly</li>
            <li> Smells great, protects the beard very well.  </li>
            <li> I use this more than the oil.</li>
            <li> and it was a lot cheaper, lasts longer, smells better and is easier to get.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent - I really, really love the smell.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> still using beard oil on some days but mostly I&#x27;m using  balm</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have a beard anymore, and I still use it for moisturizing and the smell :)</li>
            <li> Hope to find something that works better.</li>
            <li> As in most things in life it is a tradeoff.</li>
            <li> but it sure does help.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> You may need to let your beard grow out more to be able to see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The moisturizing and conditioning is top notch</li>
            <li> After having a mustache for many years, I knew going into it that my beard was going to be wirey and chaotic, just like my mustache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with that either</li>
            <li> Now is softer and is much more behaved.</li>
            <li> wife and kid love it and the smell is not over welling.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li> I use the wax occasionally when i want my beard to look perfect.</li>
            <li> it is more of a conditioner but has some hold to it as well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with more hold though,</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the purchase and would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I love the smell</li>
            <li> I would give this 10 stars if Amazon had more than 5.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the balm and how it applied to my beard.  </li>
            <li> Ok, just got it.</li>
            <li> I am sure this works</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much, but it does a great job taming most, not all, flyaways.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it :-)</li>
            <li> and I can say already that my bread is more moist and controlled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping with continue use of this product my beard will look even better.</li>
            <li> It has made my beard much more presentable.</li>
            <li> and it just looks way better with the conditioner in...</li>
            <li> I have found nothing better.</li>
            <li> And hey...maybe I just got a funky batch and everyone else&#x27;s really smells great..</li>
            <li> I need some of those whiskers that are growing in a bit more wiry to be held in place.  </li>
            <li> Love the stuff</li>
            <li> I still like their beard oil with dropper better.</li>
            <li> Just reordered more.</li>
            <li> Makes my shaggy beard buttery smooth!</li>
            <li> make sure to melt it well between your hands, then apply and rub down/brush</li>
            <li> You have to use way more product than what is advertised.</li>
            <li> Works better than any beard oil I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> but overall, the smell and functionality of this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> It seems to help keep the skin underneath moisturized and healthy as well.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This balm is appropriately advertised.  </li>
            <li> I thought with a name like &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; it would provide more hold.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t and to top it off all the grease</li>
            <li> I have stopped blow drying my beard since I started using this product, and it looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> Its okay stuff.</li>
            <li> But I think I prefer the oils more. .. ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit grainy but as soon as you work it into your hands it turns into a nice smooth balm.</li>
            <li> , maybe I need to scoop much more balm out of the can so that there is more stuff on the beard -</li>
            <li> ; I find the grooming and control qualities more on the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; side.</li>
            <li> And I LOVE that it is vegan.</li>
            <li> She likes to curl up and nuzzle into my beard, and I absolutely love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now it has some hold and smells more like a man should, but for almost $20, you should try something else.</li>
            <li> The balm is not a wax, but it has helped me get my beard manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li> The longer it got the more wirey it got.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li> As the beard as grown in I just include a bit more to spread it around.  </li>
            <li> and i really satisfied about the all shipment</li>
            <li> so my hope was that this would give me a bit more control while also conditioning my beard.</li>
            <li> I love my boyfriends beard</li>
            <li> The conditioning is way better too.  </li>
            <li> more for your money</li>
            <li> and you will need more at some point unless you shave,</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker and requires more heat/manipulation to spread around.</li>
            <li> I also think it smells better.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Please Honest Amish, come up up a truly scent free version.</li>
            <li> But not any more.  </li>
            <li> Sure that is a plus to me.</li>
            <li> This item arrived fast and works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer, more controllable, and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> This does indeed aid in control of said craziness and it makes the hair feel softer (which my girls love).  </li>
            <li> As advertised it controls my beard better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was going to do a better job of taming my beard</li>
            <li> It was more like Grave</li>
            <li> Makes my beard look healthy and with more control.</li>
            <li> I am a true fan of this stuff and look forward to trying more Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li> really but it is pretty awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> Great for control and managing the main</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the fact that the scent is very mild and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like many of the beard oils...</li>
            <li> Great product arrived very early I was expecting Friday got here on a Monday will do more business with them probably will get the wax too.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, I kind of like it, although I understand how some people won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so I can not comment on long term improvement an excellent product</li>
            <li> , just wrote the original review below, and the next day, they issued me a full refund, an email apology that their product didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, a list of honestly helpful tips for beard management and how to best use their product, and it even sounds like they&#x27;re sending me their wax product to see if that works better.</li>
            <li> It smells great, holds great, and doesn&#x27;t stiffen up or leave those pesky wax clumps after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now and already my beard is softer, and the wiry gray hairs that I have been graced with since my mid-20s are more easily manageable than without any product at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it came quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Great product that leaves my husbands beard soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I am not going to be coy; my beard is epic, and I owe it to this product and the good people at Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Great smelling and leaves my beard very soft and a bit easier to comb.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend says it works great, but doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li> This is a really good thing, because the scent it pretty strong and lasts.</li>
            <li> excellent awesome use it everyday, will most likely buy for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> It arrived well before expected which I was very happy about.</li>

            <li> Great product makes my beard soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the perfect blend of wax and oils for the harder to maintain parts of the beard.</li>
            <li> it keeps it from becoming unruly and out of control.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold as good as my husband thought it would and it makes his beard very shiny</li>
            <li> It is kind of fun to use because of it.  </li>
            <li> The good - It really conditions your beard.</li>
            <li> The beard is also softer, less itchy and all around more awesome.</li>
            <li> Excellent, gives me great control ( I have a wicked thick beard), smell is NOT to strong, and it makes my beard nice and soft!</li>
            <li> My beard is nearing two inches right now, so it had a nice poof to it.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish is by far top quality, I have been a repeat customer and will continue to be so!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It is significantly softer and has a lot more shine while not looking greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard conditioner and it&#x27;s been top shelf all the way!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be holding any better than the original, even though it&#x27;s a thicker balm, and not as oily.  </li>
            <li> The pine scent is cool too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the the original Amish beard balm it smells better plus easier to groom</li>
            <li> There is very minimal scent and it smells very pleasant!</li>
            <li> Once u work this balm into your hands it goes on as easy as beard oil.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply...keeps those strays in line....</li>
            <li> Easily worked into the beard and skin.</li>
            <li> Great for the beard, especially for occasions where you want to it to be more neat than anything.</li>
            <li> A great thing to have if you have  a big beard, for sure.</li>
            <li> Works very well for brushing your beard after a shower and leaves it feeling nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> Kept my beard nice and tidy, plus soft according to the wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work into your beard easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved the regular leave in conditioner, it&#x27;s been amazing for softening and helping keep my beard manageable.</li>
            <li> I like how easy it is to apply and how it conditions my beard.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild organic type smell without any licorice odor like the parent product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t build up, easy to wash</li>
            <li> my rating, just for the sole fact of a great and quick response from the Honest Amish representative.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> Nothing too strong or too &#x27;perfumey&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells kinda funky, though, and the smell is somewhat strong.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, applies easily, smells good, beard is softer, less itchy, helps with shaping, not as much as wax</li>
            <li> Not too strong of a hold, but you&#x27;d want a wax for that anyway.</li>
            <li> but it isnt gonna be as strong as something like hair glue.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Too shiny, itches and strong smell.</li>
            <li> Strong.</li>
            <li> beard has a couple strong &amp;#34;cowlicks&amp;#34; that this stuff doesn&#x27;t fix, but I didn&#x27;t fully expect it to.</li>
            <li> Its not as strong as a wax but still holds beard in place.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> So most of us know how honest children are and when they say Daddy your beard is as soft as their favorite stuffed animal.</li>
            <li> This is the first Honest Amish product I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant, but very mild and natural scent.</li>
            <li> So now I use it when it is important to me to appear more neat or clean cut.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to open and a good seal on them.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine too.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, and love how fast it came, 2 days!</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps even the roughest beard as sweet and soft as puppy dreams.</li>
            <li> It leaves my beard nice and smooth and pretty shiny.  </li>
            <li> After a quick brush, I noticed my beard was much more controllable without looking like I had anything on it.  </li>
            <li> Light in scent and strong in hold.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it contains all natural ingredients, has a pleasant smell and conditions (softens) the beard while holding it - no stray flyaways.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my beard super greasy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks of use my beard is much more tame and healthy, I could not be more happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> This the best beard balm available on the market hands down.</li>
            <li> This does have a good hold on longer beards and tames pretty well, but is slightly more oily when you apply that much for the hold.</li>
            <li> The hold and control is perfect - not stiff but keeps it all tamed and soft, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> The original was one of my favorite things to put on my face, with it&#x27;s sweet and spicy clove smell.</li>
            <li> in all it&#x27;s a nice, quality product that I will certainly be purchasing again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Light pleasant fragrance, all natural high quality organic ingredients, works in easily to the beard, nice absorption and conditioning, softens beard hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as strong as the original balm from HA.  </li>
            <li> This in itself is a huge selling point for me.</li>
            <li> Check out their natural soaps too, they use the best natural ingredients, non-man made.</li>
            <li> The heavy duty beard Balm smells great and adds a nice shine to my beard.</li>
            <li> It also works well for its stated use, which is of course equally important.</li>
            <li> Well priced and I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> You will have much better success that way.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost all of the beard care products available over the years.</li>
            <li> I have used both Honest Amish and Beard Balm, and in my best of observations, they are the same essentially.  </li>
            <li> Overall, these two products work great.</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t spend this much money ob it in all reality,  honest amish should have a sample pack , that way we have a way of testing these products before purchasing them</li>
            <li> , you get a free bottle of beard oil.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic</li>
            <li> rub in comb smooth done.</li>
            <li> Great product overall.</li>
            <li> Fantastic beard balm.  </li>
            <li> regular product is really great for conditioning.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic hold and finish.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic company.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented.</li>
            <li> Thanks honest amish for backing your product</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Gives an excellent all day hold and keeps my beard from drying out along with my face on these harsh winter days.</li>
            <li> Just a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> The smell it emits is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It has solid hold for the length of my beard, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t make my beard shiny, everything I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others, but they best I have every found was at a farmers market that conditioned</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Has a good hold for an all natural product</li>
            <li> you have any kind of facial hair, please, please give this Honest Amish a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The first one was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Really softens the beard a lot and has a very clean smell!  </li>
            <li> I had been using the honest Amish original beard balm for some time now, and as my beard has grown longer and more unruly, I was delighted to see a heavy duty version.</li>
            <li> I tried one other brand of beard balm and was nowhere near as impressed as I am with Honest Amish Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> Beard looks great, specially combined with the Extra Grit Wax.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product the most useful and unique of the Honest Amish products, it fits a good niche: makes me look less like a vagrant.</li>
            <li> I use the Honest Amish Classic Oil then brush this in.</li>
            <li> and I got many compliments ;)</li>
            <li> offers ok control of wild hairs but smells great</li>
            <li> First let me say that I love this company.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but getting the beads to melt is a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Good stuff makes facial hair soft and look good</li>
            <li> at this point nothing significant.</li>
            <li> Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Saver.  </li>
            <li> Totally sold on the Honest Amish products I have used!</li>
            <li> The night and day effect wasn&#x27;t as significant as  I hoped.</li>
            <li> A little greasy, but good product for the man that grows his own scarf.</li>
            <li> After trying oils of different brands, and even some other products by honest Amish, I have to admit, this is the best beard balm I have tried and tested.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be getting more of the honest amish beard balm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conditioning:  It&#x27;s been every bit as good as the regular Beard Balm at softening, thickening, and keeping my beard itch and flake free.  </li>
            <li> bottom line is that Honest Amish Beard Balm is the real deal, and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> makes beard soft and tangle free reduces itch smells nice.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, packaging is simple but elegant, etc.</li>
            <li> It left my beard with a nice healthy looking shine.  </li>
            <li> It might have slightly better control than the Cream/Conditioner mentioned above, but It also leaves my face kind of greasy when applying it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous beard balms, oils, waxes, but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder about how clean the product is.  </li>
            <li> And it makes his beard shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> and then the clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li> Thirdly, it has a pleasant and manly scent.</li>
            <li> good conditioning, nice smell, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the scraggly beard nice and shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li> Stays nicely and control my wild beard hairs!</li>
            <li> This is a great product but has a smell I am not particularly fond of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went with this certain one.</li>
            <li> also gave it a nice sheen and had a great but subtle smell.</li>
            <li> Love the feel it gives, although doesn&#x27;t provide much hold for rogue hairs...</li>
            <li> Good stuff, 3rd go of it</li>
            <li> I got this for my son, who has a full beard.</li>
            <li> This not only controlled my beard and made it look good, it also stopped the flaking skin.</li>
            <li> Nice amount of hold but keeps the beard soft.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish beard balm leaves my beard shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of softening my coarse beard hairs, so kudos there.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses full time</li>
            <li> The thing that makes this such a good product is the way your beard will feel.</li>
            <li> Makes your beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and I was applying roughly a full dime size every time after showering and</li>
            <li> I love that this company ships extremely fast.</li>
            <li> In full sun its a bit shiny for my taste but</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even contact Honest Amish directly</li>
            <li> A good solid, beard balm.</li>
            <li> All my male coworkers asked during November what I used so they could support mens health without the itch and stay the good graces of their wives and girlfriends.</li>
            <li> beard very shiny and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a nice soft smell, I got the cedar pine.</li>
            <li> Sure I&#x27;m not giving this much time.</li>
            <li> its cool</li>
            <li> Good enough to order another 4 oz.</li>
            <li> made my husbands beard nice and soft (:</li>
            <li> It does not provide much control for unruly hairs, and is more of a conditioner/ protectent.</li>
            <li> experience will likely differ from mine, but by trial and error you will have as good an experience as mine, I suspect.  </li>
            <li> It smells good , iseasy to apply, and i have received numerous compliments on how shiny my beard is.  </li>
            <li> Honest Amish beard balm keeps my beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now, and it is not as good as everyone is making it out to be.</li>
            <li> good for after you you wash your beard to get some moisture back in it.  </li>
            <li> After much research on a healthy beard product to help maintain my husbands beard, this was the product for him.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I tried every fancy fly by night brand looking to jump on the new beard fad band wagon and finally went to something good ole fashioned and hand made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am dissapointed in its ability to tame the strays in my mustache and have found a very good wax for that instead</li>
            <li> Nice scent, Easy to apply and definitely makes a difference with the beard.  </li>
            <li> Aroma is pleasant and not overpowering - similar to fresh cut pine.  </li>
            <li> But it is pretty strong of a scent.</li>
            <li> They are great at follow-up and extremely conscientious.</li>
            <li> this is a better product than its competition, a little bit will do, let it sit for a while, comb through and ur good to go, product has better control than blue b&#x27;s is cheaper and smells better</li>
            <li> Its absolutely fantastic - smells great, makes my beard nice and soft and provides just enough control to keep a wild beard in check if you have a meeting to attend but doesn&#x27;t make it all waxy.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of balms and oils, and this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> If I can get the hang of using it, I would most likely purchase more as I need the control.</li>
            <li> A bit too oily but works well for conditioning and mild sculpting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 4 tins already and will continue to be loyal.</li>
            <li> and I find the scent fades away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I seen people put off on the aroma, but it will dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li> It does melt quickly on the fingers when you rubs them together</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better for me, would be for it to be slightly more aromatic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better success with just straight SHEA butter.</li>
            <li> I should have stuck with the fantastic standard beard balm from Honest Amish.  </li>
            <li> Product came quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell at first, but it&#x27;s very mild and very manly and disappears pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use with no mess.</li>
            <li> DOWN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sceptical at first but as soon as I put some on my beard it was smooth and my frizz was in control.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The smell is not unpleasant; it sort of reminds me of tooth paste.</li>
            <li> If I had to offer up one con it would be the smell; while not unpleasant it isn&#x27;t as olfactorily-pleasing as the oil I was using...</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick and the product very high quality.</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and was really excited , I used it it smelled good ,masculine, made by beard soft an all</li>
            <li> While I would give the edge in conditioning to the Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Saver, I would say the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm does a better job of managing (i.e. &amp;#34;shaping)</li>
            <li> Leave a very light, mild, masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> at first i thought it was good when i used it, till an hour later when my beard started itching a lot.</li>
            <li> It smells good (not strong) and makes his beard tame which is wonderful in itself.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a pleasant and delightful smell...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little new at trying to manage my wiry beard, but this product is the best of those I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of things in mine and this is hands down the best product, by far.</li>
            <li> you have normal hair, I&#x27;m sure this product is great, but that&#x27;s why I got the heavy duty stuff.</li>
            <li> But if you have a shorter beard there are plenty of other Honest Amish products to help with you beard needs!</li>
            <li> I use this first out of the shower, and the Original Beard Wax after.</li>
            <li> I was using a bay oil-based beard softener but decided to try something new; I&#x27;d had a good experience with their beard wax so this was a natural choice.  </li>
            <li> I only mention it because many people said that it was strong, though I have never found it so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to having a full on beard, so I haven&#x27;t tried too many oils or balms yet, but I decided to trust this brand based on their claims of beard product experience.</li>
            <li> A little on the greasy end but smells great and helps my beard from going everywhere and getting all puffy</li>
            <li> In all honestly, it may have a little better hold</li>
            <li> an make my beard feel good  but did not tame any wild stray hairs.</li>
            <li> but then it&#x27;s absorbed and you&#x27;re left with an extremely happy and soft beard.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and the regular Honest Amish beard balm for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This response was obviously from someone representing HONEST AMISH.</li>
            <li> This one I would rate up there near the top.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard all my adult life, but I have never let it grow more the a inch or so.</li>
            <li> into consideration that using a proper quality beard brush does 80% of the work - the rest is subjective - (how good you feel about the smell, the feel of the hair, absorbing ability and</li>
            <li> it worth the price?  </li>
            <li> it worth the price?  </li>
            <li> I found Honest Amish and a beard oil (different company).</li>
            <li> (I use honest Amish beard oil daily)</li>
            <li> as expected, good value</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t explain it more clearly than that.</li>
            <li> This is his second time purchasing it, and I&#x27;m sure he will buy many more in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SUMMARY: I enjoyed using the product, I like the all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Second purchase from Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> For my own personal liking, I cannot get used to the smell.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I may need to try Honest Amish&#x27;s Extra Grit beard wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product leaves my beard soft, supple and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not a feminine smell kind of woodsy but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I melted the product with some beeswax and added some of my own essential oils</li>
            <li> The pouch it comes in is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li> The scent is light yet different, more citrus, than Dr. Ganix, which has a an almost leathery smell, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tin of Honest Amish now.  </li>
            <li> He will only use honest amish products for his beard now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Honest Amish products, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> Despite the rave reviews that all Honest Amish products seem to carry I was rather skeptical that it could be that great.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish is the only beard product l use and will use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I had been using the regular version of the Honest Amish beard balm and I liked what it was doing for my beard, but I needed a bit more hold to tame my 5 month growth.</li>
            <li> So I initially started using this balm at night and the Honest Amish beard wax (Original or Extra Grit) in the morning for more control.</li>
            <li> The regular conditioner had a unique smell of its own as well but did not bother me as much as this.</li>
            <li> As I get older (with a few more gray hairs) I&#x27;ve been finding more and more flyaway hairs in my beard that don&#x27;t want to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the original balm, especially the scent.  </li>
            <li> Works great to tame my beard.</li>
            <li> Throw some in right out of the shower</li>
            <li> You can not apply it to you beard right from jar, you have to rub it between fingers until it became smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Bad product.</li>
            <li> Just about right for me, and how a gentlemen&#x27;s beard should smell.</li>
            <li> You will have to find the right combination for your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Something wasn&#x27;t right though.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have near the hold that I thought it would based on it being called &amp;#34;Heavy duty.&amp;#34; I guess I should&#x27;ve read more reviews first.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want anyone touching my beard when I have the wax in (I have kids) as it just gets all over your hands and isn&#x27;t simply wiped off easily.</li>
            <li> Before his beard was very coarse and knotted up very easily.</li>
            <li> (nice clean scent without being overpowering), and has made his beard less frizzy and much more soft.</li>
            <li> There is a light scent and it leaves his beard super soft.</li>
            <li> My lesson has been learned, My beard is soft and manageable and has just the slightest hint of a pleasant licorice smell that will disappear after a short time.</li>
            <li> Softer, tamer and the scent is light enough for my over sensitive nose to be a nice hint that fades away.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s always checking his beard out in the mirror.. or even past anything that reflects lol.</li>
            <li> Had my beard about 5 inches long this stuff was nice.</li>
            <li> At an inch long my beard is nice and uniform with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit different but not unpleasant, and fades quickly which is ideal.</li>
            <li> and it did help somewhat, but using a dab of this stuff right out of the shower makes it soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> It makes my uncontrollable beard lie down and look good.</li>
            <li> The product works exactly like it should and gives you a soft, smooth beard quickly.</li>
            <li> The Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm arrived in a small burlap bag (just like in the picture) and the first thing I noticed when I opened the can was a very pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean and fresh, feels great and helps tame some of the wild hairs</li>
            <li> Holds all day,  never have to worry about my beard splitting in the center like I experienced with so many other products.</li>
            <li> I use it two to three times a week the other days I use Honest Amish - Heavy Grit Wax another great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to strong perfumes and chemical smells, so I&#x27;m always hesitant when buying a product that will be so close to my nose.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft and easy to comb and style</li>
            <li> , I wish it would smell like citrus or something more fresh than a glass of bourbon (or come in different smells?)</li>
            <li> Really started to soften up my beard fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Really helps make my beard feel softer and quickly.</li>
            <li> The ingredients written on the side does sound like a very natural blend.</li>
            <li> and I can really tell how it makes my beard more tame, more full, and the smell is pleasant and not strong.</li>
            <li> When I bought it tought it will really keep calm my fly aways, but its not that different from the regular balm.</li>
            <li> He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> They e-mailed me twice, asking for a positive review or for the opportunity to make it right before I posted a review.  </li>
            <li> Looks good and helps a little with the rogue whiskers.</li>
            <li> First off this seller ships asap, came very fast in comparison to others on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Works very well for conditioning and makes my beard very easy to shape if I don&#x27;t use shampoo to wash it out the next day.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not muchI guess, but when you pay almost $20 for a little tin of stuff it&#x27;d be nice if it was full.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan has continued to use this daily for about a month now, so I assume this means he is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Wax first then balm.</li>
            <li> Makes your beard feel soft and smooth without feeling greasy or waxy.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and makes that icky pokey rough and gruff stuff on his face amazing to touch.</li>
            <li> - when first growing out a beard it keeps it from getting itchy so it doesn&#x27;t drive you nuts.</li>
            <li> As for the smell; I was worried about it after reading so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> This is the first balm that I&#x27;ve bought for my beard</li>
            <li> After trying many different companies and oils</li>
            <li> shiny!&lt;br /&gt;i didnt like the smell at first</li>
            <li> This is my first try with any product like this</li>
            <li> I use quite a bit--mostly for the conditioning--and I think it holds up pretty well even after my 9 or 10 hour work days.  </li>
            <li> At this point, the wax has set pretty well so you can move your beard around more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find their customer service to be of an even higher quality.</li>
            <li> Then I apply the balm to individual areas of my beard, to make sure it is evenly disbursed.</li>
            <li> Now that he&#x27;s been using it for a while, his beard is so much softer, and tamed!</li>
            <li> This is important for times I need to mash it into her soft skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I like the way it makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li> This stuff really tames your beard!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got one of those fuzzy pretty beards, move on.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well for my husbands beard.</li>
            <li> This was my first time growing a beard and buying beard products.</li>
            <li> I chose a five star rating because there was not a way amazon would let me rate it any higher.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll immediately think about ordering more in the future as I will.</li>
            <li> I like the regular balm a lot better.  </li>
            <li> but the regular conditions better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely adds more control than oil would</li>
            <li> (I have a pretty wiry beard).  </li>
            <li> (might be more of a personal problem).</li>
            <li> I am growing out my beard for the first time.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different, something more geared towards beards, so I tried this stuff</li>
            <li> was hoping this would give slightly more control and conditioning, but this just leaves my beard feeling greasy and coarse.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it&#x27;d be able to handle my coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to any man with a beard...or woman ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely buy again when it runs out.  </li>
            <li> Leaves me soft and smooth and not oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Of course I messed this one up by the hot weather.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty unruly beard...</li>
            <li> I will keep purchasing this as I use it up way to fast!</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion it&#x27;s more like a leave in conditioner for beards.</li>
            <li> and they willingly said they would refund me</li>
            <li> As a beard guy, I have tried many different beard balms, oils, and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I could feel a difference in texture after the first use.</li>
            <li> Put this stuff on first and then put on some beard oil over it.</li>
            <li> Way better than their regular beard balm.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m going off just the first use</li>
            <li> but now it is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The regular one conditions just as well as this one, this one just has a tad bit more thickness.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Wolfgang!</li>
            <li> This makes me beard feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> On the first day I used it I instantly feel in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty curly beard which this helped straighten it out a bit.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that this stuff does</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, my beard looks smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it not only on my beard, but I also rub it into my hands, face, and mostly bald head.</li>
            <li> Consider it for hot weather locations.</li>
            <li> Overall liking this beard conditioner but was hoping for more hold and control.</li>
            <li> A proper trim deals with that better than any product, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product, the Heavy Duty Beard Balm is the first product I have found that works to condition, and keep my beard in place and looking good all day.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve got a pretty unruly beard</li>
            <li> This is the first thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for my beard aside from a comb</li>
            <li> After the first couple of uses though, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> Just looks fuller and definitely holds shape better.  </li>
            <li> but hey, real men don&#x27;t shave!</li>
            <li> If you want more control get the regular beard wax!</li>
            <li> I find that it provides much more control than the regular beard balm.</li>
            <li> I use oil first and foremost then after a couple minutes use a hairdryer to heat this up and work it into my beard.</li>
            <li> its growing in much thicker and thankfully its softer!</li>
            <li> First time beard owner.</li>
            <li> so this was my first foray into the realm of beard-keeping products.  </li>
            <li> When I bought this I was actually looking for more of a wax that will help me guide where I want all this man fur on my face to go.</li>
            <li> This is a good heavy duty balm.</li>
            <li> Works good, may be too heavy for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a very satisfied customer, and will order other products form them as well (like their handmade soaps!).</li>
            <li> I will be trying other products made by honest Amish as I am sure the quality will be the same</li>
            <li> If you use the right amount, it feels softer, but it&#x27;s still really curly and springy.</li>
            <li> Given that you don&#x27;t wash your beard everyday (which you shouldn&#x27;t) this is the maintenance product that keeps it fresh and handsome!</li>
            <li> After searching through various beard oils and conditioners, I decided to give Honest Amish a try, primarily due to the long list of natural ingredients and a very fair price.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, this product is great because I don&#x27;t have to worry about ridiculous chemicals.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish has some other products that I would like to try though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a beard wax before and thought this would work better to make all my stray hairs lie flat</li>
            <li> I plan on checking out some other products from Honest Amish</li>
            <li> Other wax-based products require heating with a blow dryer or lots of rubbing to melt, but Honest Amish Beard Balm melts at body temperature.</li>
            <li> Smells is subtle and great,</li>
            <li> After the balm settled in for a few hours, my beard was noticeably softer as well, and a lot more comfortable on my face.  </li>
            <li> , I have extremely sensitive skin, no issues actually the relentlessly itching is gone and a nice side benefit</li>
            <li> , I didnt use much I can see the oil left on my finger tips from touching my goatee which makes sense.</li>
            <li> It did take a few days to get used to, but once I did, I really enjoy how it controls the beard and puts a healthy shine to it.  </li>
            <li> it is very easy to apply and adds a minimal healthy-looking (not overly) shine to it.</li>
            <li> pretty good, however sometimes if you do not thin it out well enough it will clump back together on your beard.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, wish it did a little more to help with the fly aways, but it takes care of my dry skin and makes my beard soft.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented, but generally neutral.</li>
            <li> Just really softens it up and keeps it pretty maintained.</li>
            <li> Work pretty well, my beard is really course</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s pretty much hit or miss.</li>
            <li> So although I like it, again, it&#x27;s pretty much hair grease.  </li>
            <li> smell is intense at first but is a mans mans smell.</li>
            <li> It stays on my hands for much longer and tends to get all over anything you touch in the first hour or so after application.  </li>
            <li> After the first two weeks, I didn&#x27;t really notice it any longer.    </li>
            <li> Minor inconvenience for having a healthy beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Probably better for the long beards.</li>
            <li> That plus this beard goop have pretty much eliminated all my Winter beard itch problems.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning before work, and the scent has pretty much dissipated by lunch time.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t my first time getting this wax, I have a very rebel bear...</li>
            <li> I find it is slightly easier to apply the Honest Amish, but I also like the control that I get from Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> When I combine this with their beard wax my beard gets super soft.</li>
            <li> I really cant say to much since this is my first beard product</li>
            <li> Smell fades fairly quick, balm absorbs into your beard over time and makes soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Ok...I am totally not knocking the honest Amish products because since I&#x27;ve discovered their beard balms and leave in conditioners, I barely go a day without it</li>
            <li> I wash it with shampoo, spray leave-in conditioner in it, blow dry it and top it off with this balm.  </li>
            <li> First off it is VERY oily so much so that you can see it from across the room.</li>
            <li> Friend of mine recommend this stuff and sold me by saying using this product makes his beard super soft and that his wife said the difference was night and day.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, especially for a long beard.  </li>
            <li> I really do like the balm and can safely say that as long as I&#x27;m sporting a beard</li>
            <li> Definitely not for styling, smell is a bit strong</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much either and works extremely well to tame beard and make it look awesome!</li>
            <li> My tin arrived a bit banged up, but that certainly doesn&#x27;t affect the product.</li>
            <li> It has been pretty warm on the East Coast (mid to upper 80s), so maybe ambient temperature has something to do with it not taking to the beard.  </li>
            <li> It gives my beard a great silky feel and is easily malleable in order to control some of the crazy &#x27;rogue&#x27; hairs.</li>
            <li> OK, maybe not that long, but I have had facial hair most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> It is very curly in some spots and straight in others and chock full of wild hairs that like to stand straight out.</li>
            <li> , I will continue to look at your other products as I continue to grow my first large beard :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, and most importantly - &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Applying any beard product on your face will require using a proper beard brush&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;Without using a proper (boar bristle) beard brush, the product simply won&#x27;t get to its full potential.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> I would not rate one higher than the other, because they both do what they say they will, soften your beard, give you some control, and a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s fine, and I will use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I&#x27;ll probably look for something different after that.</li>
            <li> No, seriously!</li>
            <li> you must be high or never worked in a restaurant kitchen before, because in my opinion that&#x27;s exactly what it smells like...</li>
            <li> This product may be great for people who just need a little extra control</li>
            <li> am very much looking forward to using this fine product while I grow the new one out starting in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Smells slightly different then the other stuff (still good) but holds a little better!</li>
            <li> My only issue is it seems to flake more easily than other balms.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish really tamed that puppy down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to Mod Cabin which I thoroughly enjoy.</li>
            <li> The balm was chunky and gritty but after massaging it in my hands it melted smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> He has a very curly beard so it really helps with knots and tangles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or you will end up greasy-</li>
            <li> The pool water just really  made my beard like a wire brush.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> my beard has always been curly on one side but not anymore thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li> and I rock a righteous beard thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Should be used in conjunction with beard wax for people with really Wirey beards.</li>
            <li> After experimenting over 2 weeks with how much to use, I found that I either get no softening and conditioning,  or</li>
            <li> , it now much smoother</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any real advantage to this over burts bee&#x27;s miracle salve.</li>
            <li> I really like the aroma of this stuff.....</li>
            <li> , really let my beard moisturized all day 24 hours no matter the weather</li>
            <li> Really helped soften my beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like them both.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> rub the balm into my beard well with the palms of my hands, and finish it off with my boar bristle brush to really get the oils to distribute  evenly.</li>
            <li> It really helped in the ichy phase.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your beard soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not over powering, but very manly.</li>
            <li> this really isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> But no matter how much I tried working the beard balm in my hands before applying, the beads wouldn&#x27;t melt.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much value in using it.</li>
            <li> He would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Use to much, and that&#x27;s a headache in itself.</li>
            <li> and I know when I put to much on, my glassed end up smeared with</li>
            <li> But like others have said, it does not take much to treat your beard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I expected it would give more control of my beard</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much easier to work with</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s defense I do have a very wiry undisciplined beard...</li>
            <li> so you really have to work it with your hand and fingers quite a while for it to liquefy.  </li>
            <li> Really does what it says on the tin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really really like this product.</li>
            <li> A thoughtful gesture from folks who stand by their products and understand that what you send out into the world comes back to you.</li>
            <li> This product does not seem to soften the beard much at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like licorice, but I did enjoy the scent of it in the regular balm.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve actually grown to enjoy the smell.  </li>
            <li> My beard is MUCH softer when I use the beard</li>
            <li> balm works very well</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t have to worry about the ingrown hairs as much</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not the beard balm&#x27;s fault that my hair is like that, but it just doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot to help.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t take much....</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well...</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all, a bit about the size of a pea</li>
            <li> like I stated, I don&#x27;t use much but it leaves my skin and beard shiny.</li>
            <li> I had expected this &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; beard balm to have more hold when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose when it came to trying this product.  </li>
            <li> I expected a better hold.</li>
            <li> Bought this not knowing whether this stuff really works or not.</li>
            <li> highly recommended for the beard grower in your life!</li>
            <li> My beard has shapes it doesn&#x27;t want to give up and one area that is really like crinkled wires.  </li>
            <li> This helped straighten it out and made it much softer.</li>
            <li> If if leaves your beard looking greasy; you just used too much.  </li>
            <li> Keeps everything in place and doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent at all.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> My beard is very curly and tends to get a lot of stray hairs that don&#x27;t seem to obey my comb</li>
            <li> This may work for some people but it just really doesn&#x27;t hold up against my beard.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> The texture is really gritty/grainy until you get it sufficiently melted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to brush and comb now.</li>
            <li> I really like this as a change of pace from beard oil.</li>
            <li> It keeps your beard very well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I think this is because my beard had never really been conditioned before and just became more manageable and softer over time with use of a balm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it, but it really clashes with my cologne.</li>
            <li> he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> He loves the stuff, will be ordering more as he never wants to run out!&lt;br</li>
            <li> i really like how it works, but i don&#x27;t care for the smell of it</li>
            <li> highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using honest Amish beard balm for severely months now, and as my beard has progressed I decided to step up to the heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I have used the balm and the heavy grit beard wax from Honest Amish.  </li>
            <li> I decided it was time to give the Honest Amish - Heavy Duty Beard Balm a try.</li>
            <li> I liked the regular enough to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely good stuff, however they are not really the same thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gritty and you need to considerably mix it in the palm of your hand to melt it and be able to apply it.</li>
            <li> I tried many different things to try and make my beard soft and not wiry.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE noticed my beard has a better overall shine and soft feel to it, but as it&#x27;s getting longer</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for at least 4 to 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple different products for my beard and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> you are looking for something to tame the strays and add a nice sheen to your beard, this is it.  </li>
            <li> It holds extremely well without making my beard appear that I&#x27;ve put a ton of wax in it and keeps my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and I imagine that helps condition it pretty good, but I wanted something to tame the wild hairs a little more.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure like other reviewers mentioned,</li>
            <li> mostly got this due to beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> My three month growth is getting pretty wild!</li>
            <li> The odor of the balm was a little overwhelming at first, but it does not linger throughout the day</li>
            <li> Then as I comb it, add just a tiny bit of the Original Beard Wax to the area of crinkled wires.  </li>
            <li> Emailed the company, got a friendly response the very next morning.</li>
            <li> I wonder what their other products do. :)</li>
            <li> Just as described, a very small amount keeps my beard in good condition.</li>
            <li> highly recommend Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> When my beard grows more than an inch long it starts kinking out wildly.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a very strong scent once you have it in your beard for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> And yes, it doesn&#x27;t take much, make sure to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; it down in the palms of your hands before applying.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Nothing&#x27;s gonna make your beard not look like pubes.&amp;#34; Well folks, my wife was pretty much right about that, my beard hair is still coarse and wavy.</li>
            <li> It was getting dry and itchy and with this beard balm it looks shiny and healthy and feels soft.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and helps tame the curly, wild mess of a beard that hangs from my face.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the strange scent.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit longer to liquefy in hands than the normal balm but does its job wants in your beard.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a redhead and my beard is very coarse, but after using this daily, it&#x27;s soft like normal hair, love it!</li>
            <li> I hesitate to recommend the scent only because it seems to scream &amp;#34;I have something in my beard!&amp;#34; but it is not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> amazing beard hydration with just the right amount of wax to add a little extra control of your beard.</li>
            <li> I have on tried the regular/original Amish balm a few times and from when I can tell the original softens more but has less hold and the heavy duty keeps a good hold but does not soften as much.</li>
            <li> I was kinda sad about that because I LOVE the scent of this stuff and didn&#x27;t consider it to be that strong in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a week, but it is working great to help tame wild hairs and keep my cheeks under control.  </li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews on here, both good and bad, I decided to go ahead and give this balm a try.</li>
            <li> As I have become more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; and I have less hair on my head</li>
            <li> After a lot of research and review-reading, I decided on this particular one.</li>
            <li> Ill sure be buying more.</li>
            <li> I am able to use a significantly lesser amount of balm for the same hold, which will save me</li>
            <li> First off, this product doesn&#x27;t describe itself as a wax or a holding agent, so I &#x27;m not sure why so many people are complaining about it not being a wax or styling agent.</li>
            <li> However this particular product didn&#x27;t quite deliver as well as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> The heavy duty works just as good as the regular balm and it helps control those stray hairs.</li>
            <li> smell is similar to the standard balm, but I get more mint out of it, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I really enjoyed smelling it through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Softens &amp; conditions&amp;#34; - After 3 months of regular daily use, I didn&#x27;t notice any softening or conditioning.</li>
            <li> Still, I am able to get the same about of shine and &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; from the basic anti-frizz shine serum I use on my hair (which is cheaper).</li>
            <li> This product gets everything going the same way and does a good job of keeping my beard from looking messy.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much more for me than their regular balm, so I switched back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely taking better care of my whiskers than I was before, so I don&#x27;t look like such a bum.</li>
            <li> Now I rinse it only when I take most showers and wash it about every third day.</li>
            <li> It certainly didn&#x27;t do anything to tame my unruly beard hairs and it didn&#x27;t control my beard any more than a beard brush does on</li>
            <li> It is ok, we&#x27;ll see how things go, but all in all I am not satisfied with what I got, I expected more.</li>
            <li> This is my third tin of Honest Amish Beard Balm, my first tin of the Heavy Duty product.</li>
            <li> oil-like&amp;#34; product that comes in solid form but doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good or last as long.  </li>
            <li> Everything from their beard wax to soaps are quality products and I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would still highly recommend this as conditioning product.</li>
            <li> so I guess my expectations were a bit too high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was worried about it melting from the high heat we are having</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to any and all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a softer and healthier beard</li>
            <li> High quality leave in beard conditioner.</li>
            <li> I prefer, slightly, Honest Amish to Beard Balm due to the initial texture and consistency.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be more of a cream, but kept getting little chunks of the stuff that would stick in my beard.</li>
            <li> It does condition and help make your beard a little more manageable.</li>
            <li> It might moisturize the beard a little, but a conditioner works much better.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very little bit and it makes your beard look a lot more full.</li>
            <li> Your beard will be happy and your wallet will be sad.</li>
            <li> I have a very wiry and wild beard.</li>
            <li> As far as control, it didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but for everyone saying how great of a smell it has...</li>
            <li> It also helps straighten hairs out but not to much that I completely lose the curl character</li>
            <li> Heavy duty works better on my beard.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice and makes me feel like a man when I use it, so there&#x27;s that at least.</li>
            <li> Even if I only got, let&#x27;s say, one month of use out of a tin, I&#x27;d still say that it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Even if I only got, let&#x27;s say, one month of use out of a tin, I&#x27;d still say that it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> True, it&#x27;s faint and doesn&#x27;t last long, but a more piney or something would be nice.</li>
            <li> , I had to use a thumbnail to scrape it out unlike the normal balm which swipes out with a fingertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can shape your beard significantly better with the heavy duty balm.  </li>
            <li> started using the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm (I have very course facial hair) about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> and/or their Normal Beard balm, I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Use a wax for the moustache, and a balm for most of the beard, and this for the sides and trouble spots.</li>
            <li> At least, not the kind of difference this product claims to give.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the product I normally use was out of stock.</li>
            <li> If there are just a few stray hairs, I&#x27;ll then trim them for a better defined beard outline.</li>
            <li> at first it reminds me of burts bees wax, but I barely notice the smell</li>
            <li> feel it leaves behind which cant be good for any skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Honest Amish products before I bought this, and they just simply don&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> Much has also been written about the scent, and I tend to agree that, at least at first, its quite strong.  </li>
            <li> There are some mixed reviews and from what I mainly see is that some men expect this product to magically change their weak beards to strong beards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 4, maybe even 5 stars, but what burns me on this product stems from a previous review I left on another type of balm from Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Only con (so far) is that it runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> I expected a less grease balm with a good smell...</li>
            <li> and my beard shapes right back up as if I never slept on it.</li>
            <li> I use this from time to time to keep my beard more tame.</li>
            <li> I have a very stiff beard and Honest Amish keeps it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to grow my beard a little longer, but kept trimming it back because I couldn&#x27;t get a nicely groomed look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several beard balms and oils, and this one rates pretty high.</li>
            <li> I purchased this beard balm for my newly bearded boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I am new to using products like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of beard maintenance</li>
            <li> If you are new to beard products, this is where you should start.</li>
            <li> The scent is definitely masculine, but not too strong that it over powers other things.  </li>
            <li> (it absolutely works better in a wet beard than a dry one) and comb through.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, it does help the appearance of a beard and has a nice subtle smell to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2 weeks now, and I really don&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li> I actually like both scents, but my wife thinks the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm smells like citronella (which she doesn&#x27;t like) - bummer.  </li>
            <li> The directions were very clear &amp; it is packaged well.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this for his beard - makes it very soft</li>
            <li> Applying is very fast and simple.</li>
            <li> I have a very soft beard already</li>
            <li> and it makes his beard very soft.</li>
            <li> It requires very little per application, produces good hold, and has even helped reduce instances of flaky, dry skin under my beard.</li>
            <li> This stuff melts easily in your hands and works into your beard without a mess.</li>
            <li> It is made from several natural oils, but does not feel oily on your face or beard if used in the right amount.</li>
            <li> Great beard balm, but like other reviewers said it&#x27;s like a thick pommade.</li>
            <li> was surprise at the size of the can, sure seems small for what you pay.</li>
            <li> It makes my beard really soft!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the oily texture and noticed that it did not fair well in warm climates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d make it past a month before needing to order more.</li>
            <li> ; - The balm didn&#x27;t lend much style control even though this heavy duty balm &amp;#34;gives more control&amp;#34; than their regular balm.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, the hair is pretty coarse again.</li>
            <li> My beard&#x27;s never been so soft!</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again, only due to the price, but I surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> first I&#x27;d put a bit in in the morning and continued to wash it daily.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t use enough and</li>
            <li> Cool idea and packaging, not really for me.</li>
            <li> Knocked one star off as it can leave little pieces that won&#x27;t mix in and the scent is overly strong for a product that intended to be used two inches from your nose.</li>
            <li> I have a thicker beard and this product not only has a nice aroma that is almost perfectly faint but present at the same time, but it also gives my beard a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I got the heavy duty because I thought with my thick and coarse hairs it would fair a lot better than the regular balm.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was really surprised how tiny the can is.</li>
            <li> My beard went from wild and dull colored to appearing fuller and far more vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have any scent, just a minor natural fragrance that you can&#x27; really smell.</li>
            <li> After giving Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm a long and drawn out testing stage, I feel compelled to share my experience with the rest of the beard nation!</li>
            <li> Using this balm about twice a week after shampooing has definitely made my beard softer and more manageable, and my beard skin less itchy.</li>
            <li> In a nutshell, honest amish is far less than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other beard care products and never had the success this has given me on simply the first use.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit better than what I normally use, but I think I will only use this as my back up now that the other product is in stock.</li>
            <li> It does provide a little more control, but is not as scented as the regular balm (I like the fragrance).</li>
            <li> Wish it made my beard a little more softer than it does, but I have only been using for five days.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of their regular beard balm but want/need a little more control, this is the stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that this tin lasted me a little more than three months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He had been using the leave in conditioner for about three months which helped soften his beard but did not really condition or smooth out the curly, coarse hairs.</li>
            <li> Quality product, has completely softened my unruly beard.</li>
            <li> A natural scent, conditions well.  </li>
            <li> Smell is soft</li>
            <li> Beard feels soft and in-place come mid-day once the oils finally either come off on your hand (and then onto anything you subsequently touch) and/or get absorbed by your beard.</li>
            <li> Recommend applying directly after showers.</li>
            <li> and it wasnt near as scrachy.</li>
            <li> : doesn&#x27;t go as far as I would like...</li>
            <li> a larger size would be welcome, seems as though it really stiffens up in the cold, feels like I put gel in my beard if I&#x27;m working outdoors after application.</li>
            <li> I want my beard to be soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural smell that I expect will fade over time while wearing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> makes beard soft and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> Starred in beards gone wild.</li>
            <li> It really makes a big difference compared to growing a beard without it.retty</li>
            <li> It really makes a big difference compared to growing a beard without it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to freeze every wild hair in place, this won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> key thing is that this makes my beard much softer.</li>
            <li> It does help control the unruly hairs and help in keeping your beard soft.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work nearly as well as beard oil.</li>
            <li> Leaves the beard soft and helps keep those wild hairs from sticking out all over the place.</li>
            <li> my beard because they are surprised how soft it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it actually has wax in it (probably just more shea butter or something), but it&#x27;s definitely much harder in the tin than the standard balm</li>
            <li> It gives your hair that natural sheen again and helps with styling.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks and serves a purpose beyond just making your beard soft.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this product to keep beard soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> This makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Then the balm is ready to be applied to my beard starting in the areas that need it most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a heavy waxiness.</li>
            <li> It leaves the beard feeling smoother, softer, and helps remove some natural curling.</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse beard, and it really doesn&#x27;t do anything to help it.</li>
            <li> My initial assumption was that this product was the same as the regular, but it simply had more control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but compared with the regular product it does very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Triple Moisture Touch Leave In conditioner/hair cream, and felt that my beard was &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; throughout the day, but soft.  </li>
            <li> My beard is getting pretty long...</li>
            <li> This product does not (thankfully) get rid of all the natural shape.</li>
            <li> However, as far as softening up my beard it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My beard is still somewhat curly, but it isn&#x27;t wild anymore.</li>
            <li> It works like advertised, makes your beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes even a wiry beard like mine soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Much thicker than the regular beard balm.</li>
            <li> At night if I choose to wash my beard, I use old fashioned pine tar soap for that, I will apply the beard oil</li>
            <li> Makes my beard soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again and will be looking for an alternative before I am anywhere near out of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to early to say if it has any effect on the beard yet but will follow up on the review.</li>
            <li> Softens beard and helps a bit controlling the wild, stray beard hairs.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my 19 yr old son for Christmas..</li>
            <li> This product relaxed his coarse, brittle, curly hair and really helped soothe his irritated</li>
            <li> When applied it makes my beard soft and it stays in place.</li>
            <li> My company does not mind my beard, but requires it to appear neat and professional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural ingredients and made by hand by the Amish workers.</li>
            <li> His beard Is so soft.</li>
            <li> The heavy duty beard balm makes his beard smooth and shiny and also helps keeps the strays in place.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t get near the amount of oil your head hair does.</li>
            <li> The second day, I used too much and my beard looked a bit shiny.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Bought both heavy duty and regular and love them both.</li>
            <li> my beard is grey and coarse, and has a mind of it own, this is the only product that manages the long hairs from sticking out all over the place.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for more softness for your lady then go with the regular one, if you are going on an interview then use the heavy duty.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t tell it helped you, you most likely didn&#x27;t need the heavy duty and should have gotten the regular.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Over-priced for 2 ounces of product that won&#x27;t last more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical on the cost but the reviews were good ao gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Okay, but didn&#x27;t like the oily residue that never seemed to absorb despite the fact that I followed directions and have a thick beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this balm several times now and it goes on easily and last long.</li>
            <li> beard hair is pretty dry and can get somewhat unruly</li>
            <li> Product was not as described - rather than a smooth balm or paste, it was congealed and oily with tiny beads of suspended wax throughout, as seen in other photo reviews.  </li>
            <li> Has to dry first, but after that comb it out</li>
            <li> Thats pretty much it, using them both at the same time would make it too greasy but the heavy duty and original definitely have different purposes.</li>
            <li> Only reason for only 4 stars is that I&#x27;m not that fond of the smell, takes some getting used to, especially if it was on a full beard closer to the nose.</li>
            <li> So pretty much put the heavy duty on before work</li>
            <li> I may use a little more here and there if my face feels dry.</li>
            <li> Having no previous experience grooming a beard, I had high hopes but low expectations.  </li>
            <li> I do however highly recommend the extra grit beard wax.</li>
            <li> I was very easy to break down and apply to my beard but the major down side</li>
            <li> My beard length is around 10 inches and thick, the beard balm makes my beard soft and easy to shape in the morning.  </li>
            <li> (I have a long beard, so this is a real concern).</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of the Heavy Duty, and will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if ordering during the hot months because it will arrive melted.</li>
            <li> well if you enjoy a greasy beard that you cant touch through out the day but after years of having my goatee its hard to not touch it and break old habits.</li>
            <li> but I think mostly would be useful if you were going for a crazy shaped mustache.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects on the hair, but it does help tame the wild beast, it goes on easy and thoroughly, and from the burlap sack it comes in, to the tongue-in-bearded-cheek instructions, to the tin-filled product itself, there&#x27;s no doubt</li>
            <li> It also works great on hair if you hate that super dry looking frizziness after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I blow dried mostly so that my chin and cheeks would not stay wet, but the skin conditioners in this product keep me from having any flakiness, irritation, or itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first beard balm and I have a fairly thick beard I have grown out for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to being a beardsman and love how it keeps my beard looking tight and groomed everyday.</li>
            <li> This is only the 2nd leave-in beard balm I have ever used, the other being Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Saver.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a little oily but if you rub it into your beard, comb, leave for a few minutes, and then re-comb, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> With this, I can grow it as long as I want and maintain a tame, professional and show worthy beard!</li>
            <li> Seriously considering becoming Amish because of this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the original did the job, but the heavy duty balm goes above and beyond the call of duty.</li>
            <li> From the first application, you could see a difference in the color of his beard - the dull red was now a deep, rich red.</li>
            <li> Right, Skin Moisturize and Tight</li>
            <li> I thought it would have held the hair down a little more, but I&#x27;ll deal with it.  </li>
            <li> formula is likely centuries old, and it still works.  </li>
            <li> Instant difference on this wiry out of control 3 week old beard.</li>
            <li> point is that after using the heavy duty balm for about a week, I really noticed how much conditioning the regular balm does.  </li>
            <li> If you have stubble or a week old beard, you may need the regular balm or some oils.</li>
            <li> Naturally, it became very coarse and wiry.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to add natural oils back in, get rid of the somewhat unruly hairs.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard extra soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> All natural American made.</li>
            <li> Be careful how much you use...</li>
            <li> However, it does not really hold your beard or mustache in place; though, it is really greasy.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to any guy with a beard, or even to guys with short hair who want something natural to use on their scalp.</li>
            <li> keeps the beard soft, controllable (I have an especially bushy beard)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d still be weird for me to rate it a 5/5 even given that customer service because this is still a review of this product and my experience with it, but after the surprise refund and extremely kind message, I felt compelled to update my review and let everyone know.</li>
            <li> ) Growing it out for 6-8 weeks and then trimming lightly to even up the slow vs fast&lt;</li>
            <li> You just need to experiment a little with how and when you apply them and determine which product is right for you.</li>
            <li> After a little experimentation, I found the right amount for me.</li>
            <li> Inside my tin the balm had separated but it became a relaxing ritual to slowly melt it all down in the palm of my hand (if you so choose you can melt the balm in a pan with warm water</li>
            <li> My man-mane is several inches long and VERY curly and wiry, this is helping to tame down the strays and consolidate the bush into something a bit more sculpted.</li>
            <li> This stuff works way better than beard oils in my opinion is easier to apply and less oily and messy.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get something to tame my wild man beard, but this was a huge disappointment!  </li>
            <li> Much milder smell than other balms I have used.</li>
            <li> and it really helps with extremely unruly beards.</li>
            <li> The two products complement each other very well, but they are not interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then again, I may have been using way too much of that other product.</li>
            <li> It seems much thicker than nay other beard balm I had tried before.  </li>
            <li> The Heavy Duty gives my beard a little bit more structure and is not as oily as the Leave-In Conditioner.</li>
            <li> It was the smell that really got to me, like a musty, dirty hippy scent that I was glad to wash out.</li>
            <li> The smell is great but faint, so it vanishes after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely softer when I use the balm, but you have to be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> After search social media sites, internet blogs and hundred&#x27;s of product reviews</li>
            <li> The manufacturer has a social media site check it out for additional information.</li>
            <li> The heavy duty beard balm is my favorite for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The balm is a little gritty which means more rubbing to get it smoothed out without the little granules.</li>
            <li> This is almost certainly the only beard product I will be buying form now on (though I might try other well-received balms just to see).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i found it to be too greasy and the grit makes my beard sparkle, but hey maybe you are going for the sparkly look, does tame wild hairs very well</li>
            <li> Again, I have only used for five days so far, but it seems like this tiny 2-ounce tin would last me longer than the 4 ounce</li>
            <li> The ingredient list on my new tin changed slightly from what it says on my old tin.</li>
            <li> I use the large tin and even using larger amounts it seems to last a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the large tin and even using larger amounts it seems to last a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s melted it works fine but not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> This has really minimized my flakes and helps to keep my beard down.  </li>
            <li> I have a very wiry beard and this stuff calms it down to a degree.</li>
            <li> The product is very thin, melts very easily, and has no hold to it.  </li>
            <li> But unless you have a full beard that is actually coarse, dry and stiff, you may not notice the benefit of this balm.</li>
            <li> Keeps the hair soft, and stops the itchiness from dry skin when you start growing it longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also recommend not using too much to start (half dime size to start).  </li>
            <li> It turned my dry, wiry, brittle beard hairs soft and supple.</li>
            <li> After one use he noticed his beard was much softer and tamer and his skin was less itchy as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much for me, maybe half the size of my thumbnail.</li>
            <li> Super thick and wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> I have tried other beard balms and they were much more stiff and harder to work in and way thicker.</li>
            <li> If you want a soft beard and you need to keep  wild hairs laying down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have near the beard that I want yet, but it does help keep down the wild hairs.  </li>
            <li> After just a few days I could notice a difference in my gnarly chin rug softening up, becoming less course, and much easier to tame.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy the fancy cans with crazy designs and logos, get this and have a beard that you and that significant other will enjoy</li>
            <li> But the oils never seem to last long and require several reapplications to keep my beard soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is that it is super grainy, and those grains don&#x27;t seem to entirely liquify with friction.</li>
            <li> I now have used several products from other vendors (almost all rather disappointing) and the following from Honest Amish:  Beard Balm, Original Beard Wax and Heavy Duty Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t care with the balm since my beard won&#x27;t really feel oilier than my face after a little while.</li>
            <li> have a full thick white/gray beard 6 inches long.</li>
            <li> It works on my beard and gives it a slightly more casual appearance.</li>
            <li> You should use about half a penny size per use depending on how large your beard is mine is about 2-3 inches long.</li>
            <li> Product looked promising, but it is not strong enough to hold my beard in place.</li>
            <li> but if you really need something to tame that fur</li>
            <li> This stuff really allows me to tame and sculpts it.</li>
            <li> Really help tame my beard and gave it softer feel.</li>
            <li> Just a conditioner that left my beard flat.</li>
            <li> I stand behind the original conditioner 100%..</li>
            <li> In order to avoid giving negative reviews, or understand why negative reviews were given - you&#x27;ll need to understand the purpose of this product and how to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;First, as some of you might think &amp;#34;Heavy Duty&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean it will harden your beard into one plastic looking block on your face, this is simply a very professional beard balm, with great smell, and quality ingredients + a little extra grip on your facial</li>
            <li> and it brought my beard back to soft and manageable in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> This scent is weaker and I notice it on me far less than the regular Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> My beard is usually dry and coarse and becomes bothersome to me after a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I have a monster thick beard that is tough to keep tidy, so perhaps that&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> last long makes my beard look like I don&#x27;t have anything on it</li>
            <li> Then we moved on to Beard Balm for manageability reasons once it got long enough.</li>
            <li> Long story short, it&#x27;s all about hydration.</li>
            <li> For me a very big disappointment and a waste of good money.</li>
            <li> The regular balm gradually conditions so that you hardly notice how much of a difference it makes until you stop using it for a week</li>
            <li> Once I get the grains combed out, my beard looks a bit shiny/oily but that doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> After using this balm for about a week I noticed my mustache and beard feel softer and it actually helps keep my skin from getting dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I wanted my beard to be softer and less wild.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any scent on this balm at all, or if there is, it&#x27;s very mild.  </li>
            <li> The balm is also far less greasy than the wax.</li>
            <li> Seems to be roughly the same product as Dr. Ganix Bombeardier Beard Balm (both are made by the same company).  </li>
            <li> Was very skeptical about using anything and was torn between a lot of products, will be a life long honest amish user now.</li>
            <li> Not sure why expected something different, but for some reason 2-inch-diameter can really baffled me.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I can&#x27;t get a handle on how to apply it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem extremely greasy, my fu manchu is much softer and manageable for having used it and the scent does not have me smelling like a little lamb around the muzzle and chin</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the tin wasn&#x27;t completely full; I&#x27;d say 10-15% was missing.  </li>
            <li> It says very clearly that it is a conditioner, and that it will tame unruly hair, not sculpt it.</li>
            <li> Also adds a little bit of control for those wild hairs, but not ridged like a wax or styling gel.  </li>
            <li> Helps tame the wild!  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of little spec things in it that require you to either melt this thing completely beforehand or rub it in your hands for a long time.</li>
            <li> You could use this for the whole beard if you want, but it&#x27;s hard to apply than the balm, so I just use it for the sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was also hard to keep straight and control.</li>
            <li> This product is a little more difficult to use than the regular beard balm.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the small size at first when ordering but a tiny dab goes a long way.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first beard balm, and I&#x27;m not impressed so far.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount to make your beard feel soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The heavy duty balm has helped with those, in addition to, taming the wild, stray hairs.</li>
            <li> We shall see on how it works long term for healthiness.</li>
            <li> I ordered Heavy Duty Beard Balm and the Leave-in Conditioner (all natural).</li>
            <li> It definitely promotes beard health but not a whole lot else for me.</li>
            <li> So I think over the long run its just getting healthier.</li>
            <li> convenient size tin,  lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My beard is about 6 inches long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll likely skip the heavy duty next time and try the regular out.  </li>
            <li> However I will not be ordering again, the odor is strange, &amp;#34;is that honey?&amp;#34; I kept asking myself, with a strange face.</li>
            <li> Also even though this says Prime this item took way longer to be delivered then expected by 2-3 extra days.</li>
            <li> but it seems roughly the same....</li>
            <li> After a few months of use I can&#x27;t leave without it, makes the beard really soft and also adds volume.</li>
            <li> This will be a staple in my beard care for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a particularly long beard, just over 1.5 inches for now.</li>
            <li> somewhere between outlaw biker and Viking long!</li>
            <li> I will never use another company for my beard care as long as these guys are in business!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried several other brands</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it keeps the crazy down in my beard daily.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is growing a very long beard.</li>
            <li> If you want less scent, their new formulation has less</li>
            <li> At this point, I do a &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; styling with my comb and wait about 10 to 20 minutes for my beard to dry.  </li>
            <li> Once my beard is totally dry, I&#x27;ll get out the comb or a &amp;#34;barrel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I brush my beard and let the beard completely dry.</li>
            <li> I bought these as gifts for my husband and father, my husband likes because it helps the dry skin under his beard.</li>
            <li> : use dandruff shampoo once or twice a week, and blow dry your beard after shower</li>
            <li> My beard was dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t hurt, I wasn&#x27;t using anything before and the hair was extremely dry and sometimes brittle.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I find it tedious to apply and the results aren&#x27;t really worth the extra effort of fluffing my beard.  </li>
            <li> The Heavy Duty Balm gives enough hold to keep my untrimmed beast presentable at work without the side effects of the aforementioned wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con of this and almost any of these products is the smell.</li>
            <li> Alas, I have been forced to wait a bit before testing its magic.</li>
            <li> As a side note, I generally have dry skin in the winter, therefore my face itched and my beard became brittle and at times a little bit itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other balms that were much more expensive and so not worth it.</li>
            <li> With a small amount, your beard should soak it up quickly and you&#x27;ll hardly notice anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> he puts it on his beard every single day...</li>
            <li> I went with the heavy duty balm thinking it would really help tame the loose hairs.</li>
            <li> my hubby has very dry skin and his beard is dry</li>
            <li> You have to rub it in your hands to melt it, but once applied it softened up all my beard hairs and caused them to lay back down.</li>
            <li> his beard now can be combed down longer giving his beard extra length.</li>
            <li> The scent is not terribly pleasant and the balm itself does not do much in the way of taming my beard.</li>
            <li> Also stopped my dry skin!</li>
            <li> take enough to cover half your thumbnail for full/medium length beards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to exploring other options to shape my beard and control flyaway hairs.xploring other options to shape my beard and control flyaway hairs.</li>
            <li> I will say that it DID seem to condition my beard, but also left a slight, oily residue any time I touched my beard.    </li>
            <li> will likely not get this product again because essentially I found this to be not much more than a &amp;#34;beard</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a little anise, sometimes barely a hint of mint, and this may sound weird, but sometimes it smells a little like sassafras or root beer.</li>
            <li> I was your typical everyday working man with a wild beard that could not be tamed.</li>
            <li> I will use a little bit at a time (enough to cover my finger tip) then rub two fingers together until the balm is liquid.</li>
            <li> I do scratch and dig into my beard a little bit prior to application just to separate hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is like the standard balm combined with a little bit of wax.  </li>
            <li> I only have about a a little over a week of growth and am at the itchy stage.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is there is little to no scent.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the heavy duty balm a try because my beard is a little wild.</li>
            <li> Ok ... kinda weird.. never used beard wax .. just hard to spread and  and doesnt control my wirey beard still.</li>
            <li> Not much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Both times my critique went unanswered.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few days, but my goatee does feel a bit softer.</li>
            <li> It is really not a sculpting type of wax.  </li>
            <li> Have only been using it a few days</li>
            <li> Only been a few days, and i can already tell a difference in the way my beard feels and looks.</li>
            <li> I had never really considered using a balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price , not much control</li>
            <li> After daily use for a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t see a difference though.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I could not tell if my beard was actually getting any softer, so I took a couple days off.  </li>
            <li> Definitely softens and helps control the beard, but don&#x27;t expect a heavy duty molding cream.</li>
            <li> Minimal if any scent associated with this use.</li>
            <li> (since at that stage it&#x27;s not really a liquid balm in my hands, but grease all over my palms and fingers).</li>
            <li> I started using the heavy duty beard balm and oil recently.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it does everything I expected.</li>
            <li> so I have no real basis to compare this to</li>
            <li> I use the heavy duty beard balm and the regular beard wax.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the shine but meh, not  a big deal.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is having to regularly re-heat the tin in the sun, as the balm repeatedly becomes separated into small beads of wax that just do not melt down well in your hand.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds your beard really nicely, holding down all of the crazy stray hairs!</li>
            <li> The tin is small but last a long time!</li>
            <li> The heavy duty version helps tame my wild hairs.  </li>
            <li> As my beard grew, I instantly noticed that it was pretty untamed and hard to control, and my wife complained that it was a little course.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is stiff enough for a handlebar mustache, etc., but you can definitely add some shape and tame a lot of those strays with it.  </li>
            <li> use this product when my beard gets beyond about half an inch long.</li>
            <li> My husband puts this on almost daily now (followed by brushing with a boar hair brush) to tame his beard.</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve found to tame the beard into submission.  </li>
            <li> Can is very small, but only a touch is needed so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li> there is slight difference with my beard (it&#x27;s not that long by the way), but</li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive for a tiny little can.</li>
            <li> This is a little thicker than the regular and has a much less pronounced anise scent (which never really bothered me).</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit of it goes a long way in my (at the moment)</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The problem I have is that my facial hair grows down on one side and out to the side on the other side, so I look like I was out in a wind storm for a few hours.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is the cost and the small container size.</li>
            <li> Through trial-and-error, we discovered that a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I tried two other products before this one.</li>
            <li> Not too find of the smell compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I use one finger to scoop up a small amount then, using just that one finger, rub the balm in my other palm until it is fully fluid.</li>
            <li> There are no more rules left in my beard now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine ever using any other product on my beard.</li>
            <li> They did include instructions on what to do if it does melt and how to use the product and just some other info.</li>
            <li> (along with other places I won&#x27;t go into) as an infection precaution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t work as well for me as other brands.</li>
            <li> At that point, my beard still usually does not look properly coifed.</li>
            <li> The odor was so bad and strong</li>
            <li> It has a slight hint of a waxy smell (expected) and I should have purchased the scentless beard balm.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s beard felt stiff and dry before he purchased this product, our granddaughter didn&#x27;t like papa&#x27;s beard</li>
            <li> My other half has been trying to grow his beard out for years.</li>
            <li> It was hard to disolve the solid into the oil.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this stuff at first.  </li>
            <li> but because of the hassle of the paste and it getting under my finger nails as it is dark and hard to remove from underneath on a daily basis, I thought I&#x27;d try the balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...</li>
            <li> I got another tin of this this past Christmas and it seems to me that H.A. has actually toned the scent down a little.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping from HA an in-between that shapes but doesn&#x27;t have the dark color and toughness that their wax has.  </li>
            <li> However, for the average guy with a beard</li>
            <li> The only negative he said was that the smell was a bit feminine.  </li>
            <li> This works well on a white, thick beard.  </li>
            <li> The heavy duty beard balm is for heavy duty beards that need something extra to help tame and condition it.</li>
            <li> Before I started using the balm, I had to rewet my beard down every morning and start again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I then brush it to get it laying down and styled.</li>
            <li> I just tamp it down with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> If any type of HOLD or TAMING of whiskers that just wont lay down right/stay in place is what you need, this product is probably not at all what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried their products yet, your facial hair is missing out!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little shine added but other than that</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t wait to try other products in this line!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small tin, but it looks like a little will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harder to work into the beard because of this, but presumably that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work because it&#x27;s heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Can be greasy if you over apply but the solution to that is use less...</li>
            <li> If my beard gets longer than half inch</li>
            <li> the wax gets cakey half way through the day.  </li>
            <li> Scent is black licorice.</li>
            <li> It seems I have much less dander</li>
            <li> apply the balm when my beard is slightly wet.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> I had previously been using a</li>
            <li> I cannot help but raise my previous two star rating to five stars.</li>
            <li> And they previously compared my beard to a wire brush.</li>
            <li> Plus I think it smells odd.</li>
            <li> but sometimes he looked like black beard.</li>
            <li> But I was looking for something to help make my beard look intentional without shining like vampires in Twilight (ie typical mustache wax)</li>
            <li> The heavy duty beard balm stays in my beard and stays active all day and night.</li>
            <li> I notice when I happen to get lazy and go without this for a few days because my beard gets all dry and unruly.</li>
            <li> From a curly flyaway mess to a tamed, shapeable goatee.</li>
            <li> The stuff is rather hard and dry and you&#x27;re supposed to rub it in your hands until it liquefies.</li>
            <li> The only part I&#x27;m not thrilled with is this &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; version has small beads that look like wax (maybe that&#x27;s what it is)</li>
            <li> and it arrived, I failed an annual cardiac stress test and now going in for a double bypass.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the negative reviews first</li>
            <li> beard and unlike other products, needed very little to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF</li>
            <li> Use it on your beard and rub a little into your hair.</li>
            <li> Now I just put a little in before I get in the water and a little after I get in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily, but it works.</li>
            <li> It controls a frizzy beard a little bit - but hey its a beard after all.</li>
            <li> To me, using to little and it does not get to everything.</li>
            <li> and I was a little apprehensive.  </li>
            <li> It gives a little control to my beard.  </li>
            <li> but it does help to give my beard a little shape as I rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> probably will have to hit it with a little wax to keep it a little straighter.</li>
            <li> It did soften and add a little control to my beard, but it did not give me the control I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application - It took a little while to get the hang of getting the product to &amp;#34;evenly liquify&amp;#34; before applying.</li>
            <li> I have little chunks in my beard that I couldn&#x27;t see on my hand.</li>
            <li> It makes it a little softer but eventually the effect goes away</li>
            <li> A little dab on the finger will do ya.</li>
            <li> I bought this when the other product I usually buy was out of stock.  </li>
            <li> For starters, my label was covered in hair out of the nifty little bag they sent it in.  </li>
            <li> I think it does have a little hold.</li>
            <li> I like the little scent that my beard oils have.</li>
            <li> Works well, can be a little on the greasy side before it dries.</li>
            <li> It conditions, but it&#x27;s a little greasy feeling and the smell can overwhelm a little.</li>
            <li> but it allows for a little styling as well, almost like mustache wax.</li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed with it...</li>
            <li> This tends to tame it, but so does the miracle salve for less of the price.</li>
            <li> And every time he gets to a certain length and it itches and he goes crazy and cuts it off.</li>
            <li> My beard is very thick and coarse, until I started using these soaps</li>
            <li> If you have a relatively tame beard this will help keep it tight.</li>
            <li> They told me the essential oils in this are cold pressed key lime, blood orange, eucalyptus, and spearmint.</li>
            <li> Says there&#x27;s &amp;#34;more control&amp;#34; but there&#x27;s almost no control after it&#x27;s been in for a few mins...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying the heavy duty out</li>
            <li> Not to heavy like the wax</li>
            <li> It makes my van dyke (often confused with a goatee) softer and also smell terrific.  </li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, buy them both.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Application: I prefer the Heavy Duty Balm.</li>
            <li> The Heavy Duty in the morning (after my beard has sufficiently dried after a shower) and the Leave-in Conditioner in the evening or immediately before bed.</li>
            <li> Balm not smooth it has granular texture.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this, its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago when they were promoting a deal where you purchase a can of this</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I won&#x27;t go without heavy duty beard balm</li>
            <li> we tried it for a few days even but just could stand the smell.</li>
            <li> still like the heavy duty stuff quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> If that is/was a concern, then you don&#x27;t have to worry about it with the heavy duty balm.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not as controlling as I was expecting, but after a few day I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can go on a bit thick and opaque if you aren&#x27;t careful:</li>
            <li> I will be buying heavy duty from now on.</li>
            <li> Harsh.</li>
            <li> My grooming now is to use the Heavy Duty Beard Balm after my shower, even if I used a conditioning shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Conditions my husbands beard without being a heavy product.</li>
            <li> I tried a few times, scooping about a pea-size portion and rub it..</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to use it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> My beard no longer itches, the hair is softer, and no longer messy.</li>
            <li> Works for a a few hours then gives out..</li>
            <li> Not too heavy to cause any underlying acne or bothersome residue.</li>
            <li> Now I can apply the Heavy Duty Balm in the morning and comb my beard.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it is missing a star.</li>
            <li> and then the Beardbrand  Tree Ranger oil after its dried..</li>
            <li> , i am not a huge fan of.</li>
            <li> It worked well to tame his beard hair and made his beard a little shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super controlling, but since it&#x27;s expensive, I&#x27;m using only a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> Shapes the beard well without being stiff and makes it shine like a glorious beacon of burliness for all the world to see.</li>
            <li> In could weather it got too stiff.</li>
            <li> Softens my stiff beard and moisturizing my face underneath.</li>
            <li> The scent is really not strong at all.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking that it would tame my unruly beard.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite tame my beard though.</li>
            <li> It is worth giving it a try to see if it meets your needs, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if anything can tame it.</li>
            <li> Do Not Melt Down And Use For Bikini Waxes!!</li>
            <li> Helps some with control but very little.</li>
            <li> no more dandruff or inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it usually arrives in 48 hours.</li>
            <li> , I wanted to grow my beard out a bit longer than I have in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I should try the oil or what now.</li>
            <li> It also has small chunks as if its beeswax or something, and I can never get it to dissolve in my hand as it says to do.</li>
            <li> I may have to try their slick wax as well.</li>
            <li> It seems like it works just as well, if not slightly better.  </li>
            <li> It does the job, but it seems to be greasier than what I usually use.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a funky batch or something, but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with the smell...</li>
            <li> Place a small portion on your palm, and it begins to melt immediately.</li>
            <li> The tin is a bit small.</li>
            <li> (My wife has been after me to shave it for the past 6).</li>
            <li> I have not had the dreaded beard itch as in times past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to describe the scent other than saying it&#x27;s manly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they approach their marketing strategy, but berating their consumers online via a review board is pretty stupid.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with beards who want to tame and condition there beards!</li>
            <li> Per Tin - After my first use I was doubtful</li>
            <li> Hard to explain the smell</li>
            <li> and when I put it on my beard, hardly anything applies</li>
            <li> Thank you guys for your hard work.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not sure if it was a bad batch, maybe melted during shipping, or this is just the way it&#x27;s made but when trying to apply this to my beard it would leave these small beads of what I would only assume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my beard out for 6 months, and plan on at least another 6.</li>
            <li> buddy da got duh goooooood stuff here</li>
            <li> It has already made my beard softer and controls the crazy hairs that I have,Plus the smell is a big plus.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I&#x27;m just not really getting the results that I was looking for from this product.</li>
            <li> At least this beard balm keeps it manageable.  </li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my thick beard under control without being overly greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but it&#x27;s not so bothersome as to reflect poorly on the product.</li>
            <li> because I feel it&#x27;s a little too expensive for the small quantity you receive.</li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;that feels like a porcupine&amp;#34; when my lady gets a kiss!</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s hair grease basically.  </li>
            <li> It will look very small when you see it but believe me</li>
            <li> Tame your beard!!</li>
            <li> but it is a little expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> The reason for the bad review is because I bought a second tin</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to prepare in your hands if its cold</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did very little in terms of control.</li>
            <li> I received a response on that review berating me about how I was wrong and that there was no better product on amazon.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wary, just use small amounts.  </li>
            <li> Scent was not great.  </li>
            <li> And my tin arrived dented as well, not unusable,  not great either.</li>
            <li> the wife was getting tired of the beard</li>
            <li> The heavy duty is very difficult to get all the chunks out rubbing in your hands.  </li>
            <li> I get complemented on the very subtle scent too.</li>
            <li> Not a good look!</li>
            <li> Maybe I had unrealistic expectations of what a beard wax can do.  </li>
            <li> I was recommended this and, skeptical of the price, decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> It has a faint scent that doesn&#x27;t over welm me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a smell you want to hurry and get to a shower to get off of you, and this, sadly, is like intentionally putting that smell on you.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> No overpowering smell, just a faint trace.</li>
            <li> I recommend this balm to ne one who is looking to help their beard get weird</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is obsessed with this...</li>
            <li> I figured maybe I was doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> No more itch!!!!</li>
            <li> It takes forever to melt them and is uncomfortable and awkward to do so.</li>
            <li> Im OCD about my hands being dirty.</li>
            <li> it really stinks and did not work</li>
            <li> When I go to bed, my beard can get crazy but</li>
            <li> This product is infuriating.</li>
            <li> Man, I have crazy beard and mustache</li>
            <li> and I was desperate to save it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I bought the wrong stuff :(</li>
            <li> However, too expensive!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and he obsessed with it!</li>
            <li> My beard grows like mad when I use this product so the makers of it must be doing something</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> The bad - it can give you beard dandruff if you don&#x27;t melt it before you apply.</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad at all.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it smells bad.</li>
            <li> and he is hard to please however not anymore!!!!</li>
            <li> and I was really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> So Iam disappointed, because it didn&#x27;t do what it waa advertised to do.</li>
            <li> beard was not beard enuff :(</li>
            <li> My kids hate it and my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> I hate lotion, so</li>
            <li> The wife hated it though.</li>
            <li> I tried waxes, but I hated everything about them from the difficulty applying to the look</li>
            <li> I cannot express how horrible the smell is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially bad on my neck.</li>
            <li> Not the worst, but has room for improvement.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible</li>
            <li> and it was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome  product! !! It has been great in my endeavor to grow a nice full beard.  I will be using it.</li>
            <li> Quality product, has completely softened my unruly beard. My only gripe is the cost and the small container size.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;With this beard wax, and a good beard brush, I can shape my beard to perfection, improving my appearance, and appeasing my wife. It requires very little per application, produces good hold, and has even helped reduce instances of flaky, dry skin under my beard. I won&#x27;t travel without this!</li>
            <li> This balm is fantastic! I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of balms and oils, and this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> This is a good heavy duty balm. When I first got it, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the consistency. One day I accidentally left it in the car and it melted into a liquid and then re-hardened. It was actually much better in terms of ability to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a great smell and a great hold.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold as good as my husband thought it would and it makes his beard very shiny</li>
            <li> This product is really good. I noticed my beard grows a lot faster than it was before. You only need a very little bit and it makes your beard look a lot more full.</li>
            <li> I have used several beard balms/oils for years and I was really disappointed with this product. The balm was chunky and gritty but after massaging it in my hands it melted smooth to apply. It was the smell that really got to me, like a musty, dirty hippy scent that I was glad to wash out. I have tried it repeatedly but still dislike it. I dont recommend it, try Beard Balm brand instead.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this Product again. Just wished I had ordered a larger size container.</li>
            <li> Use it on your beard and rub a little into your hair. The wife likes how it smells and how it makes my beard feel. I like not having my face itch at all, ever. The beard is darker and luxiourious.</li>
            <li> This is a good balm.  I thought it would have held the hair down a little more, but I&#x27;ll deal with it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either.</li>
            <li> A natural scent, conditions well.  A good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to strong perfumes and chemical smells, so I&#x27;m always hesitant when buying a product that will be so close to my nose. This has a pleasant, but very mild and natural scent. It also works well for its stated use, which is of course equally important. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Much milder smell than other balms I have used.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but has a smell I am not particularly fond of. I have worn this product and enjoyed the results. The shipping was very quick and the product very high quality. Many of my friends wear this product and love it.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.  I&#x27;m still a little new at trying to manage my wiry beard, but this product is the best of those I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s not super controlling, but since it&#x27;s expensive, I&#x27;m using only a little at a time.  Maybe a thicker application would do the trick, but I&#x27;m not made of money.  If I can get the hang of using it, I would most likely purchase more as I need the control.</li>
            <li> Great beard balm, but like other reviewers said it&#x27;s like a thick pommade. Great for conditioning and taming to a point, but I&#x27;ll probably be buying some wax for shaping too.</li>
            <li> Bought both heavy duty and regular and love them both. Heavy duty works better on my beard. Love the feel it gives, although doesn&#x27;t provide much hold for rogue hairs...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend.  He loves it. There is a light scent and it leaves his beard super soft. He has a very curly beard so it really helps with knots and tangles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this beard balm for my newly bearded boyfriend. After a lot of research and review-reading, I decided on this particular one. It smells great (nice clean scent without being overpowering), and has made his beard less frizzy and much more soft. Through trial-and-error, we discovered that a little goes a long way! Don&#x27;t use too much or you will end up greasy-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan has continued to use this daily for about a month now, so I assume this means he is pleased with it. As the non-user who has to smell and see the beard, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this for me and a buddy who have been growing our beards out. Just really softens it up and keeps it pretty maintained. Love it. Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have a thicker beard and this product not only has a nice aroma that is almost perfectly faint but present at the same time, but it also gives my beard a nice shine. Well priced and I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and smells nice. Can be greasy if you over apply but the solution to that is use less...</li>
            <li> Good product that meets expectations. Got it for my brother for his beard. He likes it.</li>
            <li> Says there&#x27;s &amp;#34;more control&amp;#34; but there&#x27;s almost no control after it&#x27;s been in for a few mins... Maybe I bought the wrong stuff :( 3 stars for smelling good.</li>
            <li> I started out using the regular beard balm, but soon started spending allot of time in the pool.  The pool water just really  made my beard like a wire brush.  I ordered this and it brought my beard back to soft and manageable in less than a week.  Now I just put a little in before I get in the water and a little after I get in the shower. This is a little thicker than the regular and has a much less pronounced anise scent (which never really bothered me). Nice and easy to use.  Throw some in right out of the shower (it absolutely works better in a wet beard than a dry one) and comb through.  This was my second purchase of the Heavy Duty, and will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells like a man, if a man were made of wax. This is the real deal. works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Nice product, leaves my beard easy to style. Smell is soft it doesnt compete with my perfume or the oil scent.</li>
            <li> A bit too oily but works well for conditioning and mild sculpting.  Beard feels soft and in-place come mid-day once the oils finally either come off on your hand (and then onto anything you subsequently touch) and/or get absorbed by your beard.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference. It does smell nice and makes me feel like a man when I use it, so there&#x27;s that at least.</li>
            <li> The heavy duty version helps tame my wild hairs.  my beard has always been curly on one side but not anymore thanks to this product.  Goes on clean and smells great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok. Won&#x27;t buy again. Not much of a difference. Smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Great softener and smells very nice. Recommend applying directly after showers.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, 3rd go of it and it wasnt near as scrachy. Its a pain (IMO) to get off your hands. Im OCD about my hands being dirty. Ill sure be buying more.</li>
            <li> Probably the best there is. Your beard will be happy and your wallet will be sad.</li>
            <li> My grandson said your product was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son, who has a full beard. From the first application, you could see a difference in the color of his beard - the dull red was now a deep, rich red. His beard is now a magnificent thing to behold!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. I have tried other beard balms and they were much more stiff and harder to work in and way thicker. Once u work this balm into your hands it goes on as easy as beard oil. I will definitely be getting more of the honest amish beard balm.</li>
            <li> Pros: gets the job done, softens and adds a great shine to your face mane. Love the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesn&#x27;t go as far as I would like...a larger size would be welcome, seems as though it really stiffens up in the cold, feels like I put gel in my beard if I&#x27;m working outdoors after application.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it daily and I rock a righteous beard thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Should be used in conjunction with beard wax for people with really Wirey beards. Wax first then balm. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Work pretty well, my beard is really course and it helps, it is not a miracle, but it does soften your beard</li>
            <li> Helps tame the wild!  Love this product.  If my beard gets longer than half inch or so this is a must otherwise it will just get out of control.  Makes your beard feel soft and smooth without feeling greasy or waxy. Make sure you brush you beard out (I recommend a boar hair brush) before applying this stuff.  You will have much better success that way.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard, if your man has a beard then you need to buy this product. It smells great, and makes that icky pokey rough and gruff stuff on his face amazing to touch. Best stuff in a jar ever bought on the internet. You will not regret your choice.</li>
            <li> This product came Ina timely manner and was in perfect condition. I was very easy to break down and apply to my beard but the major down side how oily my beard felt halfway through the day. I want my beard to be soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  I had a problem with flaking skin from my beard.  This not only controlled my beard and made it look good, it also stopped the flaking skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and the regular Honest Amish beard balm for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I think both these products are amazing and have recommended them as well as given them as gifts to friends.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product when my beard gets beyond about half an inch long. Its absolutely fantastic - smells great, makes my beard nice and soft and provides just enough control to keep a wild beard in check if you have a meeting to attend but doesn&#x27;t make it all waxy.&lt;br /&gt;Also - when first growing out a beard it keeps it from getting itchy so it doesn&#x27;t drive you nuts.</li>
            <li> Excellent, gives me great control ( I have a wicked thick beard), smell is NOT to strong, and it makes my beard nice and soft! Very very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of weeks ... Seems to do the job !</li>
            <li> If I could rate it 0 stars I would.  I have a substantial  (4 inch) beard, and was looking for control and conditioning.  This product misses the mark.  After experimenting over 2 weeks with how much to use, I found that I either get no softening and conditioning,  or the wax gets cakey half way through the day.  They e-mailed me twice, asking for a positive review or for the opportunity to make it right before I posted a review.  Both times my critique went unanswered.</li>
            <li> just amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros-&lt;br /&gt;everything! beard is nice and happy after use this balm, no more dandruff or inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con-&lt;br /&gt;wish they made a scented  balm, this balm just has no smell, which some people like, i am not a huge fan of.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift. It arrived well before expected which I was very happy about. The container is smaller than I envisioned but I&#x27;m sure like other reviewers mentioned, a little goes a long way. As for the smell; I was worried about it after reading so many mixed reviews. It smells wonderful! Just a nice citrus smell. Nothing too strong or too &#x27;perfumey&#x27;. It&#x27;s a natural smell that I expect will fade over time while wearing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m eager to have my fella try it and see what he has to say about it. I intend on updating this review once he&#x27;s had some time to play with it.</li>
            <li> Works as described and is a product that will serve you well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it and I wanna buy it again and again , I don&#x27;t have to shave my beard again , it now much smoother and I got many compliments ;)</li>
            <li> This is the first balm that I&#x27;ve bought for my beard and I love it. I use it two to three times a week the other days I use Honest Amish - Heavy Grit Wax another great product. The balm leave your beard in a managable condition so that you can brush your beard into a prosentable condition.</li>
            <li> Husband said it was perfect for his beard!</li>
            <li> The Honest Amish beard balm is a pretty good product. I&#x27;ve tried several beard balms and oils, and this one rates pretty high. It&#x27;s a little oily, but it works. I also enjoy the strange scent. I&#x27;d give it 4, maybe even 5 stars, but what burns me on this product stems from a previous review I left on another type of balm from Honest Amish. I reviewed a lighter version of this balm talking about how oily the product was and that there may be something better out there. I received a response on that review berating me about how I was wrong and that there was no better product on amazon. This response was obviously from someone representing HONEST AMISH. I&#x27;m not sure how they approach their marketing strategy, but berating their consumers online via a review board is pretty stupid. With that being said, I will never order another Honest Amish product. Screw you.</li>
            <li> I bought this balm for my boyfriend to use in addition to the leave in conditioner. He loves them both. He had been using the leave in conditioner for about three months which helped soften his beard but did not really condition or smooth out the curly, coarse hairs. The heavy duty balm has helped with those, in addition to, taming the wild, stray hairs. He loves them and so do I . 😀</li>
            <li> Nice smell and got rid of the dandruff</li>
            <li> 2nd time buying this product... The tin is small but last a long time! Love it and love the smell!! Great beard balm!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the beard. I like how you get some of the wax and rub it in your hands until it is more of a liquid. It spreads better that way. I really don&#x27;t see any real advantage to this over burts bee&#x27;s miracle salve. I have a very wiry and wild beard. This tends to tame it, but so does the miracle salve for less of the price. The scent is okay. I don&#x27;t mind it. My kids hate it and my wife likes it. So it&#x27;s pretty much hit or miss. But it is pretty strong of a scent. I will use this up after I run out of the miracle salve.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but not at all strong.  It&#x27;s a small tin, but it looks like a little will go a long way.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff tames my burly beard, all while feeling and smelling great. I can&#x27;t go out in public unless I use it. Shipping seemed instantaneously. I ordered it Tuesday and it arrived by Wednesday.</li>
            <li> Smelled of petroleum and tires. I cannot express how horrible the smell is.</li>
            <li> Best beard balm I&#x27;ve ever used.......Easy to apply...keeps those strays in line....I really like the aroma of this stuff.....</li>
            <li> Helps add softness and some hold to the beard. I do not use on a daily basis. Helpful stuff.</li>
            <li> I will always give my best review this product your smell I like you, really let my beard moisturized all day 24 hours no matter the weather</li>
            <li> Great products... After trying many different companies and oils I found I like these balls the best.  I&#x27;m still trying the heavy duty out but so far so good. Not to heavy like the wax but just enough to hold.</li>
            <li> Great product arrived very early I was expecting Friday got here on a Monday will do more business with them probably will get the wax too. Good product love the smell last long makes my beard look like I don&#x27;t have anything on it</li>
            <li> I have tried almost all of the beard care products available over the years. This one I would rate up there near the top. It gives your beard a shine, tames those troublesome stray hairs, and even smells good (kind of a citrus smell). Doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy either, a bonus in my book.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Best beard care company I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve gone through 4 tins already and will continue to be loyal.</li>
            <li> makes beard soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;i didnt like the smell at first but i got over it.</li>
            <li> The odor was so bad and strong I had to wash my beard and I put the product in the trash.</li>
            <li> This is my first try with any product like this and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Love the fact it&#x27;s all natural plus it&#x27;s easy to apply and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Works well, licorice scent.  The wife hated it though.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, especially for a long beard.  Nice amount of hold but keeps the beard soft.</li>
            <li> I have used Honest Amish products before I bought this, and they just simply don&#x27;t let you down. Great price and product! I would not recommend for a shorter beard, because this helps with the daily longer beard issues. But if you have a shorter beard there are plenty of other Honest Amish products to help with you beard needs!</li>
            <li> This is my third tin of Honest Amish Beard Balm, my first tin of the Heavy Duty product. It does provide a little more control, but is not as scented as the regular balm (I like the fragrance). This is great stuff. It keeps my door knocker and epic mustache looking great! My tin arrived a bit banged up, but that certainly doesn&#x27;t affect the product.</li>
            <li> It was hard to disolve the solid into the oil.  I thought it would be more of a cream, but kept getting little chunks of the stuff that would stick in my beard.</li>
            <li> Had my beard about 5 inches long this stuff was nice. Really helped soften my beard. As far as control, it didn&#x27;t do much but I think that&#x27;s just my beard. Super thick and wavy/curly. Almost like a wire brush. Don&#x27;t think anything can control it. Starred in beards gone wild.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few days, but my goatee does feel a bit softer. We shall see on how it works long term for healthiness. I have been growing my goatee for around 6 years and have never been able to get it longer than 4-5 inches without it going all scraggly, so hopefully this stuff well help. Only reason for only 4 stars is that I&#x27;m not that fond of the smell, takes some getting used to, especially if it was on a full beard closer to the nose.</li>
            <li> Great  product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This product feels great on my beard &amp; is easily manageable to apply. I wish I known about this product sooner.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, Easy to apply and definitely makes a difference with the beard.  My girlfriend is rather fond of the smell as well. I&#x27;m already planning to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not as much fly away control as I&#x27;d hoped. Scent is black licorice. Cool idea and packaging, not really for me.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard all my adult life, but I have never let it grow more the a inch or so. Three months ago I decided to see what it would look like after a year. It is around 4 inches now and I just did not like the way it was turning out. So before I cut it off I did so looking on line. I tried two other products before this one. I&#x27;m hooked. My beard is not going anywhere!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my manly bearded boyfriend. It took a bit to get him to try it but he finally did. It worked well to tame his beard hair and made his beard a little shiny. Doesn&#x27;t really have any scent, just a minor natural fragrance that you can&#x27; really smell. Seems like a good product, just didn&#x27;t take my boyfriend by storm.</li>
            <li> In order to avoid giving negative reviews, or understand why negative reviews were given - you&#x27;ll need to understand the purpose of this product and how to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;First, as some of you might think &amp;#34;Heavy Duty&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean it will harden your beard into one plastic looking block on your face, this is simply a very professional beard balm, with great smell, and quality ingredients + a little extra grip on your facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, and most importantly - &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Applying any beard product on your face will require using a proper beard brush&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;Without using a proper (boar bristle) beard brush, the product simply won&#x27;t get to its full potential.&lt;br /&gt;Take into consideration that using a proper quality beard brush does 80% of the work - the rest is subjective - (how good you feel about the smell, the feel of the hair, absorbing ability and so on).&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps, beards rock, Honest Amish is great.</li>
            <li> Scent:  It has a citrus scent with a spicy under-note.  The scent is really not strong at all.  I use the regular Beard Balm and lots of reviewers complain about that scent.  I really like them both. This scent is weaker and I notice it on me far less than the regular Beard Balm.  I also use a lot of this stuff and I find the scent fades away quickly.  (Update 3/31/15:  I got another tin of this this past Christmas and it seems to me that H.A. has actually toned the scent down a little.  The ingredient list on my new tin changed slightly from what it says on my old tin. I was kinda sad about that because I LOVE the scent of this stuff and didn&#x27;t consider it to be that strong in the first place. So, there you have it.  If you want less scent, their new formulation has less scent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold:  It&#x27;s not bad.  I use quite a bit--mostly for the conditioning--and I think it holds up pretty well even after my 9 or 10 hour work days.  It is really not a sculpting type of wax.  Think of this as being more like a mousse or pomade than a firm-hold hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioning:  It&#x27;s been every bit as good as the regular Beard Balm at softening, thickening, and keeping my beard itch and flake free.  It&#x27;s good stuff.  Makes me wonder what I was doing growing beards without a conditioning oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it greasy?  Well, it&#x27;s a conditioning oil.  It has a bunch of different oils in it.  If you&#x27;ve used a beard oil before, you know what you&#x27;re in for.  If you&#x27;re wary, just use small amounts.  With a small amount, your beard should soak it up quickly and you&#x27;ll hardly notice anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you use it?  As recommended, I &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; it in my hand and apply it to a damp beard.  At this point, I do a &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; styling with my comb and wait about 10 to 20 minutes for my beard to dry.  Once my beard is totally dry, I&#x27;ll get out the comb or a &amp;#34;barrel&amp;#34; brush and do a more aggressive shaping and fluffing.  At this point, the wax has set pretty well so you can move your beard around more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I buy the bigger tin?  If you have a big beard, you aren&#x27;t shaving it any time soon, and you want lots of conditioning and lots of hold--yes.  Otherwise, this smaller tin will last you two months or so--with everyday use--depending on how much you use each day.  I use the large tin and even using larger amounts it seems to last a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I get the regular balm instead?  If you aren&#x27;t concerned about shaping your beard and you want good conditioning--yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth the price?  Yes.  Shipping was really fast.  The tin is nice and sturdy.  Combine this with a good hair conditioner for the shower and you&#x27;ll love the results.  Even if I only got, let&#x27;s say, one month of use out of a tin, I&#x27;d still say that it&#x27;s worth it.  It really makes a big difference compared to growing a beard without it.retty well so you can move your beard around more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I buy the bigger tin?

            <li> I must say that I have strung curled beard hair and I tried a lot products to control the directions of my beard. Product looked promising, but it is not strong enough to hold my beard in place. So, I have to give it three stars for OK. For someone who has a regular beard it might work well.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that would soften and condition my raspy beard hairs.  Was skeptical on the cost but the reviews were good ao gave it a try.  I love this stuff. It makes my van dyke (often confused with a goatee) softer and also smell terrific.  Those close to me have noticed and commented favorably.  Also, I color my beard and I might be mistaken but I think it also makes the color last longer too. I carve out a dime-sized amount and massage it into my hand so it melts then apply it thoroughly with my finger.  I use this at night and the beard oil in the morning.  Helps to soften and smells great too.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to make your beard shiny, but not looking for any type of hold, or styling, then this is your stuff.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that will keep your beard in place, i&#x27;d recommend a different product.</li>
            <li> I love this beard balm. Pleasant aroma, amazing detangler (I have a long beard, so this is a real concern). Easily worked into the beard and skin.</li>
            <li> Really softens the beard a lot and has a very clean smell!  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the balm. It&#x27;s very hard to describe the scent other than saying it&#x27;s manly. The balm work as directed and I noticed an immediate improvement in my beard. I will be purchasing this product again and again.</li>
            <li> The product is as stated and I find it of the highest quality. I find their customer service to be of an even higher quality. They are great at follow-up and extremely conscientious. I will look to them for any beard products I need.</li>
            <li> Another great product from Honest Amish. If you haven&#x27;t tried their products yet, your facial hair is missing out!!</li>
            <li> Best beard balm I&#x27;ve used so far.  Works best when beard is wet before application</li>
            <li> This stuff holds your beard really nicely, holding down all of the crazy stray hairs! I like it better than any of the beard oils.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what proper beard maintenance could do.  Between the balm and a separate oil, my beard has never been better.  Most important, my wife is happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to having a full on beard, so I haven&#x27;t tried too many oils or balms yet, but I decided to trust this brand based on their claims of beard product experience. I must admit I prefer using this much more than I ever did any of the oils I have tried. It seems I have much less dander and I like the feel of my beard now much better. It was like steel wool until I started using some product. I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have bought it several times, and will continue to do so. As an added bonus, it usually arrives in 48 hours.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Very easy to use with no mess. It smells awesome and leaves my beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used both Honest Amish and Beard Balm, and in my best of observations, they are the same essentially.  I would not rate one higher than the other, because they both do what they say they will, soften your beard, give you some control, and a healthy shine.  I prefer, slightly, Honest Amish to Beard Balm due to the initial texture and consistency.  I find it is slightly easier to apply the Honest Amish, but I also like the control that I get from Beard Balm.  In my humble opinion, buy them both.  If you care about your beard, 30 dollars is a drop in the bucket, especially with the money you are saving from not buying Mach 3 razors.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and it really helps with extremely unruly beards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using honest Amish beard balm for severely months now, and as my beard has progressed I decided to step up to the heavy duty. I am able to use a significantly lesser amount of balm for the same hold, which will save me money!&lt;br /&gt;I apply the balm when my beard is slightly wet.&lt;br /&gt;I  rub the balm into my beard well with the palms of my hands, and finish it off with my boar bristle brush to really get the oils to distribute  evenly.</li>
            <li> Good product for holding the beard.</li>
            <li> My other half has been trying to grow his beard out for years. And every time he gets to a certain length and it itches and he goes crazy and cuts it off. We started with Honest Amish beard oil which substantially changed the conditioning of his skin and his beard making it more tolerable. Then we moved on to Beard Balm for manageability reasons once it got long enough. We both love it. It smells great.</li>
            <li> BEST BEARD BALM HANDS DOWN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sceptical at first but as soon as I put some on my beard it was smooth and my frizz was in control. You should use about half a penny size per use depending on how large your beard is mine is about 2-3 inches long. This is THE STUFF!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++++</li>
            <li> Decided to grow out a beard, a friend recommend getting some type of leave in conditioner. I found Honest Amish and a beard oil (different company). Definitely recommend the balm. It really helped in the ichy phase. I still use this stuff after showering. My wife remarked that it smells vagly like vix. I really do like the balm and can safely say that as long as I&#x27;m sporting a beard I&#x27;ll have a can of this somewhere.  -cheers</li>
            <li> offers ok control of wild hairs but smells great</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He is very pleased with it.  It tames the frizz in his beard and I love the spicy fragrance.</li>
            <li> First off, this product doesn&#x27;t describe itself as a wax or a holding agent, so I &#x27;m not sure why so many people are complaining about it not being a wax or styling agent. It says very clearly that it is a conditioner, and that it will tame unruly hair, not sculpt it. And that seems to be what it does. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and already my beard is softer, and the wiry gray hairs that I have been graced with since my mid-20s are more easily manageable than without any product at all. The smell is fine too. Lightly scented, but generally neutral. Doesn&#x27;t compete with my bay rum aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that it is super grainy, and those grains don&#x27;t seem to entirely liquify with friction. Once I get the grains combed out, my beard looks a bit shiny/oily but that doesn&#x27;t last very long. All in all, it&#x27;s fine, and I will use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I&#x27;ll probably look for something different after that.</li>
            <li> Ok, good product. It smells well enough.</li>
            <li> I like this product, wish it did a little more to help with the fly aways, but it takes care of my dry skin and makes my beard soft.</li>
            <li> I love how this smooths my husband&#x27;s beard, it smells good too. My husband puts this on almost daily now (followed by brushing with a boar hair brush) to tame his beard. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I ordered Heavy Duty Beard Balm and the Leave-in Conditioner (all natural). My beard is nearing two inches right now, so it had a nice poof to it. I began using the Balm/Conditioner a month ago. Overall, these two products work great. You just need to experiment a little with how and when you apply them and determine which product is right for you. As a side note, I generally have dry skin in the winter, therefore my face itched and my beard became brittle and at times a little bit itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: I prefer the Heavy Duty Balm. I am washing my beard ever 2-3 days and adding the balm daily. I will use a little bit at a time (enough to cover my finger tip) then rub two fingers together until the balm is liquid. Then I apply the balm to individual areas of my beard, to make sure it is evenly disbursed. I do scratch and dig into my beard a little bit prior to application just to separate hairs. This seems to help my face from itching less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time between uses: I use the balms 1-2 times a day. The Heavy Duty in the morning (after my beard has sufficiently dried after a shower) and the Leave-in Conditioner in the evening or immediately before bed. I may use a little more here and there if my face feels dry. (weather dependent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vs. The Heavy Duty gives my beard a little bit more structure and is not as oily as the Leave-In Conditioner. Maybe I am using too much of the leave-in, but from different approaches to how and when I apply each balm, for all day use, the heavy duty does the trick. The leave in is definitely good on my skin. I hate lotion, so I don&#x27;t like the feeling it leaves on my hands if I touch it at all through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: The smell is there. It is good. If you don&#x27;t like things that have a smell, then don&#x27;t use this. If you like smelling good, use this. (the smell has the girlfriend&#x27;s stamp of approval)</li>
            <li> It does help to soften my beard and smells great, it also provides a nice sheen or glossiness to beard but it lacks the control it boasts.  Helps some with control but very little.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish beard balm leaves my beard shiny and soft. The smell is not unpleasant; it sort of reminds me of tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Excellent product... been using this for years</li>
            <li> I love this product and I actually use it for my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your beard soft and fresh. Don&#x27;t forget to try different &amp;#34;application&amp;#34; methods aside from your beard.</li>
            <li> my beard is grey and coarse, and has a mind of it own, this is the only product that manages the long hairs from sticking out all over the place.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is growing a very long beard. This product has been working wonders. Before his beard was very coarse and knotted up very easily. Now that he&#x27;s been using it for a while, his beard is so much softer, and tamed! The product smells really good too!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to freeze every wild hair in place, this won&#x27;t do it. It will get most of your beard orderly though. When my beard grows more than an inch long it starts kinking out wildly. This helps a lot. At an inch long my beard is nice and uniform with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not over powering, but very manly. It&#x27;s something I smell, but those around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key thing is that this makes my beard much softer. This is important for times I need to mash it into her soft skin. So, she&#x27;s happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and was really excited , I used it it smelled good ,masculine, made by beard soft an all but were is \\&quot;EXTRA HOLD\\&quot;?? It says EXTRA HOLD but all it did was moisturizer, an make my beard feel good  but did not tame any wild stray hairs. So Iam disappointed, because it didn&#x27;t do what it waa advertised to do. Wish I didn&#x27;t spend this much money ob it in all reality,  honest amish should have a sample pack , that way we have a way of testing these products before purchasing them</li>
            <li> Balm not smooth it has granular texture. You can not apply it to you beard right from jar, you have to rub it between fingers until it became smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Bad product. Will never buy it again</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> First off, I just want to say that I think Honest Amish is a great company that cares about the product they sell. This in itself is a huge selling point for me. However this particular product didn&#x27;t quite deliver as well as I would have hoped. My beard is not coarse but it&#x27;s fairly &amp;#34;scraggly&amp;#34;, lots of fly away hairs. I went with the heavy duty balm thinking it would really help tame the loose hairs. Unfortunately it did very little in terms of control. It definitely promotes beard health but not a whole lot else for me. This product may be great for people who just need a little extra control but if you really need something to tame that fur this really isn&#x27;t the product for you. Honest Amish has some other products that I would like to try though.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit longer to liquefy in hands than the normal balm but does its job wants in your beard.  It won&#x27;t hold your beard hair like pomade for your hair but it&#x27;s not meant too.  It does help control the unruly hairs and help in keeping your beard soft.  I don&#x27;t use it daily (I use honest Amish beard oil daily) but on those occasions I want my beard to look it&#x27;s best, this is my go to product</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes the hair more workable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my beard out for 6 months, and plan on at least another 6. Bought this for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I like the way it makes my beard feel. I use this first out of the shower, and the Original Beard Wax after. It keeps my beard feeling a lot better, and much more controlled looking.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this, its a waste of money. at first i thought it was good when i used it, till an hour later when my beard started itching a lot. I did not think it was from this product so the next day when I showered and used it again i felt the itching again so i just stopped using it. I do not recommend this product and wouldnt buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try an Honest Amish product that I didn&#x27;t like. Everything from their beard wax to soaps are quality products and I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their beard balms are a lifesaver for my beard. I started out with the regular balm and quite simply it works. It softened my beard and made it healthier. I decided to give the heavy duty balm a try because my beard is a little wild. The heavy duty works just as good as the regular balm and it helps control those stray hairs. When I combine this with their beard wax my beard gets super soft. People are always asking how I get my beard to look so healthy and I have no problem telling them about Honest Amish. Try it and you will love it.</li>
            <li> the idea/formula is likely centuries old, and it still works.  keeps the tangles out, the frizzies to a minimum, and it even smells nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff really tames your beard!</li>
            <li> Loving this stuff! Have only been using it a few days but I can tell it&#x27;s quality. Can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects on the hair, but it does help tame the wild beast, it goes on easy and thoroughly, and from the burlap sack it comes in, to the tongue-in-bearded-cheek instructions, to the tin-filled product itself, there&#x27;s no doubt this is the top shelf stuff. It&#x27;s pretty great. Get some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(not 5 stars because I can&#x27;t verify it makes my beard softer, or stronger, or irresistible, or that it makes me Amish...  Yet. Maybe soon, though!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a good wax for me. I recommend it to you or to get someone as a gift.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be.  I purchased this a few weeks ago when they were promoting a deal where you purchase a can of this, you get a free bottle of beard oil.  Now, I&#x27;m not sure if it was a bad batch, maybe melted during shipping, or this is just the way it&#x27;s made but when trying to apply this to my beard it would leave these small beads of what I would only assume is some sort of wax, in my beard.  But no matter how much I tried working the beard balm in my hands before applying, the beads wouldn&#x27;t melt.  I ended up with dozens of tiny waxy beads in my beard and the only way to get them out was with a comb.  My personal opinion is I&#x27;m not a fan.  I think what I thought this was, was used more for control than anything else.  Like a beard wax or something similar.  It&#x27;s not that.  It seems to be more of a sold variation of what their oils are.  Sticking with their beard oils though for conditioning which are definite 5 star products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is freaking magic. A+ Product. Will buy forever.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of softening my coarse beard hairs, so kudos there. This stuff smells kinda funky, though, and the smell is somewhat strong. Like maybe cloves plus licorice. In any case, if you don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like a hipster, I recommend buying the UNSCENTED version.</li>
            <li> A little greasy, but good product for the man that grows his own scarf.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work nearly as well as beard oil. It controls a frizzy beard a little bit - but hey its a beard after all. As for softening it seems to do nothing at all. There&#x27;s a little shine added but other than that I don&#x27;t see much value in using it.</li>
            <li> Works well at taming my beard without looking greasy like some oils cause it to look.</li>
            <li> This stuff works way better than beard oils in my opinion is easier to apply and less oily and messy.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff! He would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft and easy to comb and style</li>
            <li> pretty good, however sometimes if you do not thin it out well enough it will clump back together on your beard.  I do however highly recommend the extra grit beard wax.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma, feels greasy in your hand but once you apply it that goes away. Leaves the beard soft and helps keep those wild hairs from sticking out all over the place. I keep buying more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good balm, does its job well. Just wish it had a bit more of a more pleasant smell. True, it&#x27;s faint and doesn&#x27;t last long, but a more piney or something would be nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had facial hair since I was 6. OK, maybe not that long, but I have had facial hair most of my adult life.  As I have become more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; and I have less hair on my head, I wanted to grow my beard out a bit longer than I have in the past.  As my beard grew, I instantly noticed that it was pretty untamed and hard to control, and my wife complained that it was a little course.  After searching through various beard oils and conditioners, I decided to give Honest Amish a try, primarily due to the long list of natural ingredients and a very fair price.  The Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm arrived in a small burlap bag (just like in the picture) and the first thing I noticed when I opened the can was a very pleasant aroma.  Not at all perfumy or overpowering and not overly musky like some men&#x27;s fragrances.  Just about right for me, and how a gentlemen&#x27;s beard should smell. I put a pea sized amount in my palms and rubbed them together to heat and spread the balm before applying to my beard.  After a quick brush, I noticed my beard was much more controllable without looking like I had anything on it.  After the balm settled in for a few hours, my beard was noticeably softer as well, and a lot more comfortable on my face.  My wife even noticed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that Honest Amish Beard Balm is the real deal, and worth every penny.  I am a very satisfied customer, and will order other products form them as well (like their handmade soaps!).</li>
            <li> I thought I had left a review already. I been using this a while now. To me, using to little and it does not get to everything. Use to much, and that&#x27;s a headache in itself. I seen people put off on the aroma, but it will dissipate quickly. I wear glasses full time and I know when I put to much on, my glassed end up smeared with it.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprise at the size of the can, sure seems small for what you pay. But like others have said, it does not take much to treat your beard.&lt;br /&gt;I mostly got this due to beard dandruff. I have recently been blissed with a skin problem but I have noticed it the most of the years on my chin. I get skin build up and then it get all itchy and then I shed like a snake. This helps a lot, but did not stop it.I&#x27;m good with that as any kind of relief is better than none.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my beard shinier. Even after vigorously working the product in my hands before applying I still find it to be a bit gritty. Not too find of the smell compared to other products. I do like their tins though. Very easy to open and a good seal on them.</li>
            <li> Only been a few days, and i can already tell a difference in the way my beard feels and looks. A truly great product. Will definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I am new to using products like this. I expected it would give more control of my beard but that&#x27;s just what I thought no claim was made by the seller. I do like t &amp; think I will keep using it. The directions were very clear &amp; it is packaged well.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to find the best beard balm and I believe this is it! A little goes a long way and I can really tell how it makes my beard more tame, more full, and the smell is pleasant and not strong. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me for my birthday and I was a little apprehensive.  I had never really considered using a balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard hair is pretty dry and can get somewhat unruly so I decided to give this a try and see how it worked.  Let me just say that I won&#x27;t go without heavy duty beard balm again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The smell is fantastic&lt;br /&gt;(2) It makes my beard really soft! I am a youth pastor and I have students who will come and &amp;#34;pet&amp;#34; my beard because they are surprised how soft it is.&lt;br /&gt;(3)  I love the sheen that it gives my beard.&lt;br /&gt;(4) It gives a little control to my beard.  This is not like a wax but it does help to give my beard a little shape as I rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and I have recommended it to many of my bearded friends.  If you&#x27;re looking for a beard oil or conditioner don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> this is a better product than its competition, a little bit will do, let it sit for a while, comb through and ur good to go, product has better control than blue b&#x27;s is cheaper and smells better</li>
            <li> If you have a relatively tame beard this will help keep it tight. Since I need great hold for my handlebar I had to find another product. The aroma is nice though.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got one of those fuzzy pretty beards, move on.  If you&#x27;ve got 4 inch barbed wire with a mind of its own, get this.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my thick beard under control without being overly greasy. It&#x27;s a mushy solid at room temp, but as soon as you scrape some out it melts in your hand. I use the back of my thumb nails to scrape a bit out on each hand before rubbing it together in my palms and then running it through my beard. This stuff has a nice, light smell too!</li>
            <li> When I bought it tought it will really keep calm my fly aways, but its not that different from the regular balm.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, applies easily, smells good, beard is softer, less itchy, helps with shaping, not as much as wax but it&#x27;s much easier to work with</li>
            <li> Before using this, my beard was flakey and unkempt.  This has really minimized my flakes and helps to keep my beard down.  When I get close to running out of this, I&#x27;ll be buying more.  I can&#x27;t imagine not using this stuff.</li>
            <li> it really stinks and did not work that great husband had to throw it away. we tried it for a few days even but just could stand the smell.</li>
            <li> Best product I ever used</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Keeps the beard soft and smells great. Not too strong of a hold, but you&#x27;d want a wax for that anyway.</li>
            <li> wonderful scent combined with strong hold, it also washes out easily and isn&#x27;t too oily or sticky. I definetly make sure to recommend it to my bearded friends.</li>
            <li> keeps my beard well conditioned and does OK on keeping it looking well groomed. probably will have to hit it with a little wax to keep it a little straighter.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for my husbands beard. He prefers it to the non-heavy duty. Has a pleasant scent and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband because he kept complaining about his beard. It just wasn&#x27;t staying shiny or in place like it used to. Now he uses a tiny bit when he gets out of the shower and it is obvious. Looks so shiny. Stays in place and feels softer! Its been about a month and he forgets it sometimes but I can&#x27;t tell. So I think over the long run its just getting healthier. Love this stuff. Oh…smells good too. Not over bearing at all.</li>
            <li> Great product from a environmentally responsible company.  The balm is easier to use than oil and it smells so nice!&lt;br /&gt; - the wife of a bearded man</li>
            <li> Wish I had found this stuff before purchasing the Honest Amish wax (the &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34; stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is like the standard balm combined with a little bit of wax.  I don&#x27;t think it actually has wax in it (probably just more shea butter or something), but it&#x27;s definitely much harder in the tin than the standard balm, I had to use a thumbnail to scrape it out unlike the normal balm which swipes out with a fingertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is similar to the standard balm, but I get more mint out of it, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.  I strongly dislike the scent of the wax (smells like putting crayons on my face, ugh), and it doesn&#x27;t soften the beard as nicely as this does.  My man-mane is several inches long and VERY curly and wiry, this is helping to tame down the strays and consolidate the bush into something a bit more sculpted.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. It has an interesting scent that is pleasant but a bit strong for my taste. It did soften and add a little control to my beard, but it did not give me the control I was hoping for. In it&#x27;s defense I do have a very wiry undisciplined beard... I&#x27;m not sure if anything can tame it. I didn&#x27;t care for the oily texture and noticed that it did not fair well in warm climates.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone with an actual beard. Smells clean and fresh, feels great and helps tame some of the wild hairs</li>
            <li> Holds up all day would buy again</li>
            <li> excellent awesome use it everyday, will most likely buy for the rest of my life. makes beard soft and tangle free reduces itch smells nice. convenient size tin,  lasts a long time. take enough to cover half your thumbnail for full/medium length beards. rub in comb smooth done.</li>
            <li> Great product overall. Has a good hold for an all natural product but it isnt gonna be as strong as something like hair glue. It doesnt have a very strong scent once you have it in your beard for a few minutes. I count that as a bonus because a lot of beard oils and balms are overly scented. The thing that makes this such a good product is the way your beard will feel. My beard feels softer for longer than with traditional beard oil.</li>
            <li> This was my first time growing a beard and buying beard products. I have been growing a beard for about 1 month and decided to try this product based on reviews. I really cant say to much since this is my first beard product but I wasnt too impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Condtioning, Smell , stops the itch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Greasy , Price , not much control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is ok but I probally might try another Beard Brand.</li>
            <li> This balm is great for conditioning my beard. I&#x27;ve been using my wife&#x27;s hair conditioner for months and it did help somewhat, but using a dab of this stuff right out of the shower makes it soft and easy to comb through. The smell is a little bit different but not unpleasant, and fades quickly which is ideal. The customer service for Honest Amish is amazing. Within a day of delivery I got an email asking if I was satisfied with the product. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. Smells great and leaves my beard soft, shiny and looking like it should. Beard power !!!!</li>
            <li> Yes this is one of the best.  This does has have a lingering perfume scent which is perfect, because makers of beard conditioners are forgetting that this perfume is right under you nose all day.  Others gave me headaches.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a week, but it is working great to help tame wild hairs and keep my cheeks under control.  I like the way it conditions compared to just using beard oils.</li>
            <li> as expected, good value</li>
            <li> Great oil,  smells great and makes my beard look much healthier.  By far the best oil I&#x27;ve used.  I recommend all Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells great. After using this balm for about a week I noticed my mustache and beard feel softer and it actually helps keep my skin from getting dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t control the strays as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple times and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> works amazing! my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  My wife compliments how my beard smells.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! Makes your beard nice and soft. It also works great on hair if you hate that super dry looking frizziness after shampooing. It gives your hair that natural sheen again and helps with styling.</li>
            <li> Best beard product I have ordered yet. Keeps the hair soft, and stops the itchiness from dry skin when you start growing it longer. My wife also loves the smell.</li>
            <li> i found it to be too greasy and the grit makes my beard sparkle, but hey maybe you are going for the sparkly look, does tame wild hairs very well</li>
            <li> Heard rave reviews and I can see why.  After just a few days I could notice a difference in my gnarly chin rug softening up, becoming less course, and much easier to tame.  The only part I&#x27;m not thrilled with is this &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; version has small beads that look like wax (maybe that&#x27;s what it is) so you really have to work it with your hand and fingers quite a while for it to liquefy.  If you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll end up with what look like boogers in your beard.  I&#x27;d also recommend not using too much to start (half dime size to start).  My beard is about 6 inches long and I was applying roughly a full dime size every time after showering and it started plugging up my pores and causing acne on my chin (my fault).    Aroma is pleasant and not overpowering - similar to fresh cut pine.  I&#x27;ll likely skip the heavy duty next time and try the regular out.  I would still highly recommend this as conditioning product.</li>
            <li> Great product that leaves my husbands beard soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I chose a five star rating because there was not a way amazon would let me rate it any higher. This stuff rocks and serves a purpose beyond just making your beard soft. it does add some control and it also makes my beard look more uniform. It smells extremely pleasant and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger. I don&#x27;t see a reason in purchasing anything else.</li>
            <li> The product does the job. I have quite a coarse and curly beard so I guess my expectations were a bit too high. I&#x27;m currently considering the waxes to see if those will offer a stronger hold. Nonetheless I continue to use this product because I DO notice an improvement.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great, love it. The best product Honest Amosh offers. I&#x27;ve ised all of them. I recommend this one cause it provide bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> First off this seller ships asap, came very fast in comparison to others on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding product. Really does what it says on the tin.&lt;br /&gt;I have a 5&amp;#34; beard and unlike other products, needed very little to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you have any kind of facial hair, please, please give this Honest Amish a chance.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll immediately think about ordering more in the future as I will.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great scent, lovely texture and general feel. Beard looks great, specially combined with the Extra Grit Wax. Only con (so far) is that it runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> I really really like this product. It smells nice, packaging is simple but elegant, etc. The only problem is, it didn&#x27;t work for me! I got the heavy duty because I thought with my thick and coarse hairs it would fair a lot better than the regular balm. After daily use for a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t see a difference though. I&#x27;m not sure if I should try the oil or what now. My three month growth is getting pretty wild!</li>
            <li> Great for the beard, especially for occasions where you want to it to be more neat than anything. I have on tried the regular/original Amish balm a few times and from when I can tell the original softens more but has less hold and the heavy duty keeps a good hold but does not soften as much. So pretty much put the heavy duty on before work and you&#x27;ll have a nicely crafted and shaped beard and then put on the original one before bed so that the ladies are happy. Thats pretty much it, using them both at the same time would make it too greasy but the heavy duty and original definitely have different purposes. If you are looking for more softness for your lady then go with the regular one, if you are going on an interview then use the heavy duty. Can&#x27;t explain it more clearly than that. Great product.</li>
            <li> Product was not as described - rather than a smooth balm or paste, it was congealed and oily with tiny beads of suspended wax throughout, as seen in other photo reviews.  The beads would not dissolve even after vigorous rubbing in hands or on beard and had to be combed out.  Scent was not great.  I&#x27;ve gone back to Mod Cabin which I thoroughly enjoy.</li>
            <li> Product works just as advertised - conditions, softens and helps shape beard. After 40 years of wearing a beard nice to have it not feel like a Brillo pad... Also great customer service - an inquiry I made about some variation in the product through 3 purchases resulted in an unsolicited replacement tin of Beard Balm. A thoughtful gesture from folks who stand by their products and understand that what you send out into the world comes back to you.</li>
            <li> I have used the balm and the heavy grit beard wax from Honest Amish.  First let me say that I love this company. They are great to work with.  I have around a 3 inch beard that I shape. Their wax I like but because of the hassle of the paste and it getting under my finger nails as it is dark and hard to remove from underneath on a daily basis, I thought I&#x27;d try the balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...the balm is a softener, but what I don&#x27;t like is how it crumbles when applying. I get it everywhere.  It does add a &amp;#34;glisten&amp;#34; to my beard, a kind of shine or sheen to it. I don&#x27;t mind that I guess, but I&#x27;m looking for shape, not shine. And in the shaping dept, the balm is not the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to tame the strays and add a nice sheen to your beard, this is it.  It works great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping from HA an in-between that shapes but doesn&#x27;t have the dark color and toughness that their wax has.  For now, I&#x27;ll be switching back to their wax when the balm is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard on bearded brethren!</li>
            <li> my hubby has very dry skin and his beard is dry he started  this product and raves about it and he is hard to please however not anymore!!!!</li>
            <li> Best beard stuff you can get online. Hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My going on three year beard is getting more and more unruly so I recently decided to check out the &amp;#34;Heavy Duty&amp;#34; beard balm (I&#x27;d been using the regular HA BB). Solid stuff! Smells slightly different then the other stuff (still good) but holds a little better! A great thing to have if you have  a big beard, for sure.</li>
            <li> Smells great, protects the beard very well.  The balm is a little gritty which means more rubbing to get it smoothed out without the little granules.</li>
            <li> Works very well for brushing your beard after a shower and leaves it feeling nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product for his beard. This is his second time purchasing it, and I&#x27;m sure he will buy many more in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this more than the oil. Beard balm works well. Just follow instructions, a pinch is all you need after a shower.  Fragrance is not bad at all. Will continue to use this product to keep beard soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Instant difference on this wiry out of control 3 week old beard. Softer, tamer and the scent is light enough for my over sensitive nose to be a nice hint that fades away.</li>
            <li> Kept my beard nice and tidy, plus soft according to the wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just need to grow it back</li>
            <li> I love that this company ships extremely fast. This product works good but it is a little expensive for what it does. It does condition and help make your beard a little more manageable. I think it works just as good as coconut oil in my opinion. I stopped using this stuff because the coconut oil did the same thing for me that this product does and it was a lot cheaper, lasts longer, smells better and is easier to get.</li>
            <li> Does what it says! Smells nice and keeps the beard looking good. I notice when I happen to get lazy and go without this for a few days because my beard gets all dry and unruly. This makes it soft and manageable. Great stuff guys!</li>
            <li> I was using a bay oil-based beard softener but decided to try something new; I&#x27;d had a good experience with their beard wax so this was a natural choice.  It softens very quickly in your hands and does a great job at softening your whiskers; I&#x27;ve found it makes my hair more manageable and controllable, as mine is frizzy by nature.  If I had to offer up one con it would be the smell; while not unpleasant it isn&#x27;t as olfactorily-pleasing as the oil I was using...being as the intent is beard control I can&#x27;t say this is a dealbreaker.</li>
            <li> As I get older (with a few more gray hairs) I&#x27;ve been finding more and more flyaway hairs in my beard that don&#x27;t want to stay in place. I&#x27;ve been wanting to grow my beard a little longer, but kept trimming it back because I couldn&#x27;t get a nicely groomed look. I decided it was time to give the Honest Amish - Heavy Duty Beard Balm a try. Here are my thoughts after three months of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses Per Tin - After my first use I was doubtful I&#x27;d make it past a month before needing to order more. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this tin lasted me a little more than three months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application - It took a little while to get the hang of getting the product to &amp;#34;evenly liquify&amp;#34; before applying. I use one finger to scoop up a small amount then, using just that one finger, rub the balm in my other palm until it is fully fluid. Then the balm is ready to be applied to my beard starting in the areas that need it most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent - I really, really love the smell. This is a really good thing, because the scent it pretty strong and lasts. Fortunately I really enjoyed smelling it through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Softens &amp; conditions&amp;#34; - After 3 months of regular daily use, I didn&#x27;t notice any softening or conditioning. It did add a nice healthy shine that I enjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Tames unruly beard hairs&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;magnificent beard control&amp;#34; - The balm didn&#x27;t lend much style control even though this heavy duty balm &amp;#34;gives more control&amp;#34; than their regular balm. It certainly didn&#x27;t do anything to tame my unruly beard hairs and it didn&#x27;t control my beard any more than a beard brush does on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY: I enjoyed using the product, I like the all natural ingredients and I love the smell. Still, I am able to get the same about of shine and &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; from the basic anti-frizz shine serum I use on my hair (which is cheaper). In the end the product didn&#x27;t deliver as promised for me. I&#x27;m back to exploring other options to shape my beard and control flyaway hairs.xploring other options to shape my beard and control flyaway hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking that it would tame my unruly beard. There are no more rules left in my beard now. The balm has made it unrulier. I thought that this was supposed to flatten my beard. $20 for such a tiny can, and the shipping took a week. Sure it smells great, comes in a cool tin and a fancy burlap sack. It is ok, we&#x27;ll see how things go, but all in all I am not satisfied with what I got, I expected more.</li>
            <li> I like the regular balm a lot better.  This holds well but the regular conditions better.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Nice for moisturizing beard. Looks good and helps a little with the rogue whiskers. I will reorder. 4 Stars because I feel it&#x27;s a little too expensive for the small quantity you receive.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I think it has a nice aroma; the wife says it smells spicy (and good). A little bit of it goes a long way in my (at the moment) 4-month beard.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using beard oil on some days but mostly I&#x27;m using  balm instead.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely adds more control than oil would but it&#x27;s not a heavy waxiness.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!  It works really well, and it smells great!  I don&#x27;t even have a beard anymore, and I still use it for moisturizing and the smell :)</li>
            <li> I like it. However, too expensive!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! It makes my uncontrollable beard lie down and look good. So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Works good, may be too heavy for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard was not beard enuff :(</li>
            <li> Fantastic beard balm.  A beeswax product that can style and condition your beard.  Leaves a nice sheen but is never oily like some beard wax. In full sun its a bit shiny for my taste but in ambient lighting it looks great.  The aroma is pleasant almost an oak/beeswax smell. Its a little hard to prepare in your hands if its cold but when the weather is warm its very easy to spread in your hands and apply.</li>
            <li> It leaves the beard feeling smoother, softer, and helps remove some natural curling. Nice consistency but not meant to hold.</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse beard, and it really doesn&#x27;t do anything to help it. It also has small chunks as if its beeswax or something, and I can never get it to dissolve in my hand as it says to do. I have little chunks in my beard that I couldn&#x27;t see on my hand. This is my first beard balm, and I&#x27;m not impressed so far. Hope to find something that works better.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have a very stiff beard and Honest Amish keeps it soft and manageable.  I have tried a number of balms and oils and this is my go-to now.</li>
            <li> I already have a review for the regular beard balm, so I&#x27;ll try to not repeat myself.  I liked the regular enough to give this a try.  It is definitely good stuff, however they are not really the same thing.  My initial assumption was that this product was the same as the regular, but it simply had more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular product is really great for conditioning.  Another reviewer said it best when they said that they really knew how good the product was when they quit using it.  The regular balm gradually conditions so that you hardly notice how much of a difference it makes until you stop using it for a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is that after using the heavy duty balm for about a week, I really noticed how much conditioning the regular balm does.  This product does not seem to soften the beard much at all.  Maybe it does, but compared with the regular product it does very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like the heavy duty stuff quite a bit.  As in most things in life it is a tradeoff. You trade some conditioning for additional control.  So now I use it when it is important to me to appear more neat or clean cut.  You can shape your beard significantly better with the heavy duty balm.  It is kind of fun to use because of it.  I don&#x27;t know if it is stiff enough for a handlebar mustache, etc., but you can definitely add some shape and tame a lot of those strays with it.  The two products complement each other very well, but they are not interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this product does not have the licorice smell that the regular balm has.  I don&#x27;t like licorice, but I did enjoy the scent of it in the regular balm.  I only mention it because many people said that it was strong, though I have never found it so.  If that is/was a concern, then you don&#x27;t have to worry about it with the heavy duty balm.</li>
            <li> I went into this as a skeptic.  I wanted my beard to be softer and less wild.  I tried the tips and tricks I found online to no avail.  I figured I&#x27;d give a beard-specific product a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm (I have very course facial hair) about a month ago.  When I started using the balm, the immediate difference was the shine.  It left my beard with a nice healthy looking shine.  The odor of the balm was a little overwhelming at first, but it does not linger throughout the day and I&#x27;ve actually grown to enjoy the smell.  After a few days, I could not tell if my beard was actually getting any softer, so I took a couple days off.  The difference was definitely noticeable.  My beard is MUCH softer when I use the beard balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s a great product.  My beard looks/feels great.  The price is very fair, considering this size will last you a good while.  I&#x27;ve already started recommending Honest Amish products to my bearded brethren.  Get on this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a beard wax before and thought this would work better to make all my stray hairs lie flat (I have a pretty wiry beard).  It works OK for this but not perfectly.  Maybe I had unrealistic expectations of what a beard wax can do.  Anyway, it does help the appearance of a beard and has a nice subtle smell to it.</li>
            <li> Product was dented and damaged on arrival</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and he obsessed with it! It ships very quickly! He smells delightful and he gets complimented very often on it.</li>
            <li> There are some mixed reviews and from what I mainly see is that some men expect this product to magically change their weak beards to strong beards. The balm can only help with what you genetically have. The heavy duty beard balm is for heavy duty beards that need something extra to help tame and condition it. If you can&#x27;t tell it helped you, you most likely didn&#x27;t need the heavy duty and should have gotten the regular.&lt;br /&gt;I have a full thick white/gray beard 6 inches long. When I was younger, my beard was brown/red. As my beard turned to white/gray, it got coarser, dryer and stiffer. Since I have been using the balm, I can definitely see a difference in my beard. It has softened it and tamed it. I take a shower and use a pine tar soap, then apply a generous amount of balm to a damp beard. I brush my beard and let the beard completely dry. When I go to bed, my beard can get crazy but the balm does it&#x27;s job and all I have to do is brush it out in the morning and my beard shapes right back up as if I never slept on it. Before I started using the balm, I had to rewet my beard down every morning and start again.&lt;br /&gt;I have used and still on occasion use beard oils. But the oils never seem to last long and require several reapplications to keep my beard soft and conditioned. The heavy duty beard balm stays in my beard and stays active all day and night. It does not make my imperfect beard perfect but it sure does help.&lt;br /&gt;When men see the words &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; they think they need it. But unless you have a full beard that is actually coarse, dry and stiff, you may not notice the benefit of this balm. If you have stubble or a week old beard, you may need the regular balm or some oils. You may need to let your beard grow out more to be able to see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;This balm works very well and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hold and finish. My only issue is it seems to flake more easily than other balms.</li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;that feels like a porcupine&amp;#34; when my lady gets a kiss! This stuff is great....beard hair seems to drink it!</li>
            <li> Definitely softens and helps control the beard, but don&#x27;t expect a heavy duty molding cream. The moisturizing and conditioning is top notch but i sometimes have to use a thicker gel or hair paste to help control this steel wool beard. (might be more of a personal problem). Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my beard for the first time. After having a mustache for many years, I knew going into it that my beard was going to be wirey and chaotic, just like my mustache. This stuff really allows me to tame and sculpts it. It&#x27;s nothing like mustache wax or hair gel sculpting, but it gives you the ability to adjust the form of it and condition those bushy edges. It also leaves your beard with a nice shine and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy application&lt;br /&gt;Fast Delivery&lt;br /&gt;Great smell&lt;br /&gt;Nice sheen&lt;br /&gt;Solid Hold&lt;br /&gt;Great conditioning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None as of yet</li>
            <li> My husband loves this for his beard - makes it very soft</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a Neutrogena Triple Moisture Touch Leave In conditioner/hair cream, and felt that my beard was &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; throughout the day, but soft.  I wanted to try something different, something more geared towards beards, so I tried this stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this would give slightly more control and conditioning, but this just leaves my beard feeling greasy and coarse.  It might have slightly better control than the Cream/Conditioner mentioned above, but It also leaves my face kind of greasy when applying it.  It has been pretty warm on the East Coast (mid to upper 80s), so maybe ambient temperature has something to do with it not taking to the beard.  Unless my beard miraculously feels softer from this and/or their Normal Beard balm, I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I didn&#x27;t even contact Honest Amish directly, just wrote the original review below, and the next day, they issued me a full refund, an email apology that their product didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, a list of honestly helpful tips for beard management and how to best use their product, and it even sounds like they&#x27;re sending me their wax product to see if that works better. Also, they used \\&quot;bearding\\&quot; as a verb which is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s honestly the best customer service I&#x27;ve ever experienced, so I&#x27;m raising my rating from 3/5 stars to 4/5. It&#x27;d still be weird for me to rate it a 5/5 even given that customer service because this is still a review of this product and my experience with it, but after the surprise refund and extremely kind message, I felt compelled to update my review and let everyone know. This is a fantastic company. I&#x27;m going to try their tips out and I&#x27;ll probably end up ordering this (or the wax) again. I wish they had a tip jar. Awesome people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL: I have incredibly coarse and curly beard hair to the point where my hairs curl over and get ingrown almost immediately whenever I shave. It&#x27;s especially bad on my neck. But sometimes I&#x27;ll let it grow so I won&#x27;t have to worry about the ingrown hairs as much and I like having a beard sometimes even if it is coarse. That&#x27;s why I bought this. I was hoping it&#x27;d soften my beard, make it feel nice, and maybe even straighten it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely softer when I use the balm, but you have to be careful not to use too much or it just feels greasy to the touch. If you use the right amount, it feels softer, but it&#x27;s still really curly and springy. It pokes. By the end of the day, the hair is pretty coarse again. That&#x27;s not the beard balm&#x27;s fault that my hair is like that, but it just doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot to help. It makes it a little softer but eventually the effect goes away and it&#x27;s definitely not helping long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal hair, I&#x27;m sure this product is great, but that&#x27;s why I got the heavy duty stuff. I was hoping it&#x27;d be able to handle my coarse, curly hair. I guess it&#x27;s untameable.</li>
            <li> Works great on my beard. Second purchase from Honest Amish. Now that I&#x27;ve tried it I can&#x27;t imagine ever using any other product on my beard.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it came quickly and nicely packaged. I was worried about it melting from the high heat we are having but it wasn&#x27;t an issue. They did include instructions on what to do if it does melt and how to use the product and just some other info. It smells good (not strong) and makes his beard tame which is wonderful in itself. I would recommend to any man with a beard...or woman ;-)</li>
            <li> If you have a beard you need this!!!! I&#x27;ve used all kinds of things in mine and this is hands down the best product, by far. It&#x27;s like buttering your beard but not in a greasy or oily way. It&#x27;s shiny for a couple minutes after you put it on but then it&#x27;s absorbed and you&#x27;re left with an extremely happy and soft beard. Again imo it&#x27;s the best product that should be used for beards.</li>
            <li> Smell is great but I think mostly would be useful if you were going for a crazy shaped mustache.</li>
            <li> left my scraggy beard smoother and softer. also gave it a nice sheen and had a great but subtle smell.</li>
            <li> My beard is getting pretty long...somewhere between outlaw biker and Viking long! A grape sized dab of this warmed up and worked into the beard worked miracles! From a curly flyaway mess to a tamed, shapeable goatee. Pretty amazing stuff. Its got a pleasant smell, its easy to work with and works great...just as they advertise! What a concept!!!! Buy it. Tame your beard!!</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely makes my beard look and feel healthier. It is significantly softer and has a lot more shine while not looking greasy at all. I&#x27;m going to give it five stars for that. It doesn&#x27;t quite tame my beard though. I may have to try their slick wax as well. It has a very light but pleasant spicy scent to it too.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Works great.....doesn&#x27;t take much....gives a luxurious feel to your beard. Lightly scented.</li>
            <li> The good - It really conditions your beard. The bad - it can give you beard dandruff if you don&#x27;t melt it before you apply. It&#x27;s gritty and you need to considerably mix it in the palm of your hand to melt it and be able to apply it. The smell is not bad, I kind of like it, although I understand how some people won&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not in love with that either, I wish it would smell like citrus or something more fresh than a glass of bourbon (or come in different smells?).... - Update - 3/18/15. I bought this a second time. After trying oils of different brands, and even some other products by honest Amish, I have to admit, this is the best beard balm I have tried and tested. I cannot help but raise my previous two star rating to five stars.</li>
            <li> The problem I have is that my facial hair grows down on one side and out to the side on the other side, so I look like I was out in a wind storm for a few hours. This product gets everything going the same way and does a good job of keeping my beard from looking messy. My beard is also a bit curly. This product does not (thankfully) get rid of all the natural shape.</li>
            <li> From the soap to the beard balm Honest Amish products are great. My beard is very thick and coarse, until I started using these soaps my beard was uncontrollable. Now is softer and is much more behaved.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but getting the beads to melt is a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Works very well for conditioning and makes my beard very easy to shape if I don&#x27;t use shampoo to wash it out the next day. I am dissapointed in its ability to tame the strays in my mustache and have found a very good wax for that instead</li>
            <li> I had used the &amp;#34;Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-in Conditioner&amp;#34; before and liked it so I figured I would try this one to see the difference.  It seems like it works just as well, if not slightly better.  I&#x27;ll most likely buy again when it runs out.  My only complaint is the tin wasn&#x27;t completely full; I&#x27;d say 10-15% was missing.  That&#x27;s not muchI guess, but when you pay almost $20 for a little tin of stuff it&#x27;d be nice if it was full.</li>
            <li> Leaves me soft and smooth and not oily feeling. wife and kid love it and the smell is not over welling.</li>
            <li> Really started to soften up my beard fairly quickly.  Happy with the product.  For my own personal liking, I cannot get used to the smell.  It does not smell bad at all.  It has a slight hint of a waxy smell (expected) and I should have purchased the scentless beard balm.  However, as far as softening up my beard it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the hubs. He likes it and I like it because he&#x27;s happy, happy, happy, happy and the stuff smells good!!</li>
            <li> This is the second different type of beard balm I have purchased.  This one is awesome. Smell is great.  Very easy to work into even think beards. It leaves my beard soft and looking great.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and love it. Better than I expected and enjoyed it. Would recommend it to you anytime.</li>
            <li> I recently grew my beard out and started using this product. I love the smell and the way it makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff tames my beard! I get complemented on the very subtle scent too. This is my first beard conditioner and it&#x27;s been top shelf all the way!</li>
            <li> I bought these as gifts for my husband and father, my husband likes because it helps the dry skin under his beard. He doesn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I tried many different things to try and make my beard soft and not wiry.  This does the trick. Has a pleasant smell, but not perfume like. Smell fades fairly quick, balm absorbs into your beard over time and makes soft to the touch. Also adds a little bit of control for those wild hairs, but not ridged like a wax or styling gel.  BTW I have a big beard, like Grizzly Adams or Duck Dynasty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing a beard for a while now, but had never used any sort of product on it. Naturally, it became very coarse and wiry. I was recommended this and, skeptical of the price, decided to try it out. I could not be happier with it. My beard went from wild and dull colored to appearing fuller and far more vibrant colors. I found out I have red in my beard!</li>
            <li> This the best beard balm available on the market hands down. All natural ingredients. It only takes a small amount to make your beard feel soft and manageable.  Check out their natural soaps too, they use the best natural ingredients, non-man made. You can tell the difference. It is worth giving it a try to see if it meets your needs, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The heavy duty beard balm is my favorite for everyday use. It helps keep my stray hairs under control and conditions at the same time. If you want a firmer hold you will have to use the wax. I use the wax occasionally when i want my beard to look perfect.</li>
            <li> excellent product. strongly recommend. it is more of a conditioner but has some hold to it as well. smells great</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal.  I LOVE the original balm, especially the scent.  I was looking for something with more hold though, so I decided to pick this up.  Unfortunately, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any scent on this balm at all, or if there is, it&#x27;s very mild.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be holding any better than the original, even though it&#x27;s a thicker balm, and not as oily.  It&#x27;s a little harder to work into the beard because of this, but presumably that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work because it&#x27;s heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Of course I messed this one up by the hot weather. Keep it at room temperature and you won&#x27;t have to buy another one until you run out.</li>
            <li> A good solid, beard balm. Light in scent and strong in hold.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product you can use on your beard! It holds extremely well without making my beard appear that I&#x27;ve put a ton of wax in it and keeps my beard nice and soft. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty unruly beard... It is very curly in some spots and straight in others and chock full of wild hairs that like to stand straight out. It&#x27;s also very coarse hair and I required something to keep it in line. This stuff works very well... You have to rub it in your hands to melt it, but once applied it softened up all my beard hairs and caused them to lay back down. My beard is still somewhat curly, but it isn&#x27;t wild anymore. It also has a very nice somewhat spearmint scent.</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s okay, I mean, it&#x27;s hair grease basically.  But it doesn&#x27;t have any funky smell and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I&#x27;m mixed breed and have wirey beard hair.  It does give my beard sheen and makes it easier to comb through during the day as opposed to not putting anything on it, which then I can&#x27;t comb it at all without alot of pulling.  So although I like it, again, it&#x27;s pretty much hair grease.  It does melt quickly on the fingers when you rubs them together and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all, a bit about the size of a pea will be plenty.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem extremely greasy, my fu manchu is much softer and manageable for having used it and the scent does not have me smelling like a little lamb around the muzzle and chin region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the purchase and would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a small(perhaps two oz?) container and for almost $20.00, is why it is not five star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards to my Amish brothers who labor to produce this product, it IS exceptionally good!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  Keeps the scraggly beard nice and shiny and soft!  I will keep purchasing this as I use it up way to fast!</li>
            <li> After search social media sites, internet blogs and hundred&#x27;s of product reviews I knew I did not want a wax. I wanted something to add natural oils back in, get rid of the somewhat unruly hairs. And most importantly to me soften it to the point my child would not pull away after they ask for a hug and kiss goodnight. So most of us know how honest children are and when they say Daddy your beard is as soft as their favorite stuffed animal. And they previously compared my beard to a wire brush. So I love the smell, I have extremely sensitive skin, no issues actually the relentlessly itching is gone and a nice side benefit it has helped my eczema. Once I have desired amount in my hand I simply rub my hands together until melted like butter and work into beard while still damp. I then brush it to get it laying down and styled. Now this is not like hair gel or wax. In my personal opinion it&#x27;s more like a leave in conditioner for beards. The manufacturer has a social media site check it out for additional information. Also you can get an idea of effect on facial hair. I get stopped and asked by wives and girlfriends when in public about what I use as they have never seen a beard look like mine except for magazines. I would give this 10 stars if Amazon had more than 5. All my male coworkers asked during November what I used so they could support mens health without the itch and stay the good graces of their wives and girlfriends.</li>
            <li> smell is intense at first but is a mans mans smell. works great. beard very shiny and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Only thing I&#x27;ve found to tame the beard into submission.  Holds all day,  never have to worry about my beard splitting in the center like I experienced with so many other products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works great and smells good too. I plan on checking out some other products from Honest Amish</li>
            <li> Works great! My beard&#x27;s never been so soft!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks. It works like advertised, makes your beard soft and manageable. A little dab on the finger will do ya. However I will not be ordering again, the odor is strange, &amp;#34;is that honey?&amp;#34; I kept asking myself, with a strange face. I didn&#x27;t leave a review because I felt the smell was misleading, but the product worked as advertised. The reason I am leaving a 5/5 star review is because honest amish emailed me today asking how I liked it and I expressed my concerns to them of the odor and they willingly said they would refund me, I didn&#x27;t even ask for one, that&#x27;s customer service! The guaranteed satisfaction they mention is no joke, if you aren&#x27;t happy they refund you. There are reviews I read that said they love the smell, to each their own. So if you are thinking of giving this product a try, do it. They told me the essential oils in this are cold pressed key lime, blood orange, eucalyptus, and spearmint. If that is your thing, this is your product. Thanks honest amish for backing your product, I will continue to look at your other products as I continue to grow my first large beard :-)</li>
            <li> As a beard guy, I have tried many different beard balms, oils, and conditioners. Honest Amish is by far top quality, I have been a repeat customer and will continue to be so!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It helps soften your beard and it helps the 2nd growth from itching when it comes it</li>
            <li> I could feel a difference in texture after the first use. It sounds like a gimick but I had two people ask me if my beard was longer within the first week of using this awesome stuff!!</li>
            <li> Ok ... kinda weird.. never used beard wax .. just hard to spread and  and doesnt control my wirey beard still. might look for another brand.</li>
            <li> Just as described, a very small amount keeps my beard in good condition. Purchased for a friend also and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great beard balm. Pleasant aroma followed by the fact that it holds for more than six hours.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the balm and how it applied to my beard.  Also liked the way it went into my skin.  My wife, however, did not like the smell.  It had a very light unoffensive fragrance to me.  I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, excellent product, works as expected.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard extra soft without being greasy.  Even my girlfriend who hates when I have facial hair has stopped complaining about my face being itchy.  Great manly smell as well.</li>
            <li> Worked well but bugs were attracted to my beard.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, and love how fast it came, 2 days! The fragrance is a nice soft smell, I got the cedar pine. Would recommend to anyone with beards who want to tame and condition there beards!</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this stuff. He says he gets that hair that he envies. lol.</li>
            <li> ... but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got to compare it to.  Both work as advertised, but the Honest Amish works better and so the tin lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this when the other product I usually buy was out of stock.  It does the job, but it seems to be greasier than what I usually use.  It stays on my hands for much longer and tends to get all over anything you touch in the first hour or so after application.  Also, I don&#x27;t like how you have to &amp;#34;melt it&amp;#34; in your hand before application.  The fragrance is a bit better than what I normally use, but I think I will only use this as my back up now that the other product is in stock.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this product is great because I don&#x27;t have to worry about ridiculous chemicals. Secondly, it moisturizes my skin and softens my coarse beard hair. Thirdly, it has a pleasant and manly scent. The residual balm can be rubbed into your head hair or face. Put this stuff on first and then put on some beard oil over it. You don&#x27;t need that much for application and you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday. If you have coarse and stubbornly curly hair you may find yourself using this daily to keep your beard kept up well for work or outings. If you have beard dandruff and flakey skin make sure to use a good beard soap/soap because this product will suspend those particles in your beard. Not a good look! All natural American made. Good beard-keeping.</li>
            <li> It is too gritty. Is does not dissolve well into the beard. The smell is also off putting.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Highly recommend to any and all. The only thing that would make it better for me, would be for it to be slightly more aromatic. Excellent nonetheless.</li>
            <li> A little on the greasy end but smells great and helps my beard from going everywhere and getting all puffy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this balm several times now and it goes on easily and last long.</li>
            <li> Great smelling and leaves my beard very soft and a bit easier to comb.</li>
            <li> This helps to make my beard more manageable and softer and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> I would not call this &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> arrived without any problem , it is perfect</li>
            <li> Way better than their regular beard balm.</li>
            <li> Good stuff makes facial hair soft and look good</li>
            <li> Ok, just got it. Sure I&#x27;m not giving this much time. I guess I&#x27;m going off just the first use but already I dont like the oily feel its leaving on my goatee, I didnt use much I can see the oil left on my finger tips from touching my goatee which makes sense. I am sure this works well if you enjoy a greasy beard that you cant touch through out the day but after years of having my goatee its hard to not touch it and break old habits. Also even though this says Prime this item took way longer to be delivered then expected by 2-3 extra days. I am returning this only because I dont like the greasy oil feel it leaves behind which cant be good for any skin. Headed for a wash, leavin conditioner vs an oil based balm.</li>
            <li> Great product, great smell.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have near the hold that I thought it would based on it being called &amp;#34;Heavy duty.&amp;#34; I guess I should&#x27;ve read more reviews first. It does work into your beard easily and I imagine that helps condition it pretty good, but I wanted something to tame the wild hairs a little more. Plus I think it smells odd. I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what the smell is but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Tried this after using the regular balm. There are a lot of little spec things in it that require you to either melt this thing completely beforehand or rub it in your hands for a long time. It didn&#x27;t do much more for me than their regular balm, so I switched back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other balms that were much more expensive and so not worth it. This stuff melts easily in your hands and works into your beard without a mess. Smells good and does its job. That&#x27;s honest if you ask me</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s beard felt stiff and dry before he purchased this product, our granddaughter didn&#x27;t like papa&#x27;s beard but now it is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Bought this based upon the reviews. This doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to grave before shave products. The softness and sheen are virtually nonexistent.  In a nutshell, honest amish is far less than I expected. And my tin arrived dented as well, not unusable,  not great either.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes even a wiry beard like mine soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much, but it does a great job taming most, not all, flyaways. Be careful how much you use... like I stated, I don&#x27;t use much but it leaves my skin and beard shiny. I just tamp it down with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m a redhead and my beard is very coarse, but after using this daily, it&#x27;s soft like normal hair, love it! Wife loves it :-)</li>
            <li> This beard balm is amazing! My beard has some wiry hairs and this holds them in place. Goes on great and basically disappears and just leaves my beard soft. The pine scent is cool too!</li>
            <li> Do Not Melt Down And Use For Bikini Waxes!!</li>
            <li> Shapes the beard well without being stiff and makes it shine like a glorious beacon of burliness for all the world to see. Knocked one star off as it can leave little pieces that won&#x27;t mix in and the scent is overly strong for a product that intended to be used two inches from your nose.</li>
            <li> Okay, but didn&#x27;t like the oily residue that never seemed to absorb despite the fact that I followed directions and have a thick beard. It smells good going on, but after couple of hours smells like spaghetti sauce. It left a ring around my collar during work.</li>
            <li> Terrific holding power, good scent, leaves the beard well conditioned and very healthy looking &amp; feeling.</li>
            <li> I have a 5 inch goatee style beard .I just got the balm today and I can say already that my bread is more moist and controlled. It has a faint scent that doesn&#x27;t over welm me. Applying is very fast and simple. The ingredients written on the side does sound like a very natural blend. No big man made sounding words. I&#x27;m hoping with continue use of this product my beard will look even better.</li>
            <li> i have a beard so yeah its cool</li>
            <li> Too shiny, itches and strong smell.</li>
            <li> good stuff here boy, i get my amish on everytime i go out to a fancy dancy resturantay. I tell you what boy this stuff will stiffen that scraggly beard hair to what ever way you want it mmmmhmmm yeah buddy da got duh goooooood stuff here</li>
            <li> really good for my beard.  Has to dry first, but after that comb it out and it works</li>
            <li> Great product makes my beard soft</li>
            <li> Great beard balm. Not as controlling as I was expecting, but after a few day I got the hang of it. I now put the balm in my beard then use beard trimming scissors to get rid of any hairs not controlled. It has made my beard much more presentable. The beard is also softer, less itchy and all around more awesome.</li>
            <li> Ok...I am totally not knocking the honest Amish products because since I&#x27;ve discovered their beard balms and leave in conditioners, I barely go a day without it and I&#x27;m a repeat customer. I&#x27;ve loved the regular leave in conditioner, it&#x27;s been amazing for softening and helping keep my beard manageable. Can definitely tell a difference from with to without. My beard is about 6-7 inches in length and it just looks way better with the conditioner in...that being said, I decided to try this to change it up and see if there was any difference. In all honestly, it may have a little better hold but it seems roughly the same....my biggest dislike with this product is the smell. The regular conditioner had a unique smell of its own as well but did not bother me as much as this. I&#x27;m sorry but for everyone saying how great of a smell it has...you must be high or never worked in a restaurant kitchen before, because in my opinion that&#x27;s exactly what it smells like...that lingering smell of fry grease after you&#x27;ve worked in a kitchen all day. That&#x27;s not a pleasant and delightful smell...it&#x27;s a smell you want to hurry and get to a shower to get off of you, and this, sadly, is like intentionally putting that smell on you. All of that being said...I stand behind the original conditioner 100%..will continue to buy it. I have found nothing better. But this I will not buy again. And hey...maybe I just got a funky batch and everyone else&#x27;s really smells great..so don&#x27;t let this deter you from buying from this company. Try em both and see what you think. Just a heads up from my experience.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this product does NOT provide the hold I needed.      Much has also been written about the scent, and I tend to agree that, at least at first, its quite strong.  After the first two weeks, I didn&#x27;t really notice it any longer.    I will say that it DID seem to condition my beard, but also left a slight, oily residue any time I touched my beard.    Bottom line, get the Beard WAX from the same brand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I like how easy it is to apply and how it conditions my beard. The description is very accurate as is the application method. This will be my product of choice for grooming my beard!</li>
            <li> I have only had this stuff for 3 days now and I as well as my Wife can already tell a difference in my beard. I use it after a shower and apply about a pea sized dot and I have a rather long,thick beard. A pea sized dot rubbed to liquid in my palms is plenty and not the slightest bit greasy. It has already made my beard softer and controls the crazy hairs that I have,Plus the smell is a big plus. Anyone who is offended by the smell needs to shave their beard and stick to Women&#x27;s cosmetics. I am a true fan of this stuff and look forward to trying more Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li> I had expected this &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; beard balm to have more hold when I purchased it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, twice a day. I HAVE noticed my beard has a better overall shine and soft feel to it, but as it&#x27;s getting longer I need some of those whiskers that are growing in a bit more wiry to be held in place.  This product doesn&#x27;t do that at all.  I&#x27;ve had better success with just straight SHEA butter. Perhaps this is my fault.  I may need to try Honest Amish&#x27;s Extra Grit beard wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely not get this product again because essentially I found this to be not much more than a &amp;#34;beard oil-like&amp;#34; product that comes in solid form but doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good or last as long.  If any type of HOLD or TAMING of whiskers that just wont lay down right/stay in place is what you need, this product is probably not at all what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Good beard product, but don&#x27;t expect it to shape your unruly beard! It works on my beard and gives it a slightly more casual appearance. If you want hold or styling, you&#x27;ll beed something stronger, like a beard wax. Great product if you know that it won&#x27;t hold your beard in place. Not greasy either.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff and I have a stubborn beard! Just wish there&#x27;s more per order!</li>
            <li> thicker oil than their &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; balm.  I still like their beard oil with dropper better.</li>
            <li> Good enough to order another 4 oz.</li>
            <li> This will be my exclusive balm for the winter months.  The smell is not as strong as the original balm from HA.  The addition of the wax is great for control and added moisture retention to keep the flakes at bay.  I like to mix in eucalyptus oil for the smell and it seems to soften the balm.  My beard is about two months growth and now I look forward to the winter months here in Ohio.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Just reordered more.</li>
            <li> Makes my shaggy beard buttery smooth! Best balm I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product is infuriating. It comes as granules that you have to melt in your hand before you apply. It takes forever to melt them and is uncomfortable and awkward to do so. Once it&#x27;s melted it works fine but not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never stuck with a beard because it looks to scraggly in spots, consider trying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Growing it out for 6-8 weeks and then trimming lightly to even up the slow vs fast&lt;br /&gt;2) Applying this product to the thinner and/or scraggly portions&lt;br /&gt;3) Using a good balm on the rest of the beard&lt;br /&gt;4) Growing out the moustache and using wax to keep it out of your mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect blend of wax and oils for the harder to maintain parts of the beard. Use a wax for the moustache, and a balm for most of the beard, and this for the sides and trouble spots. You could use this for the whole beard if you want, but it&#x27;s hard to apply than the balm, so I just use it for the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can go on a bit thick and opaque if you aren&#x27;t careful: make sure to melt it well between your hands, then apply and rub down/brush in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product the most useful and unique of the Honest Amish products, it fits a good niche: makes me look less like a vagrant.</li>
            <li> It worked for control but i got dandruff after a while. I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works exceptionally well on both my ex-husband&#x27;s and fiancee&#x27;s beards and mustaches. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but it&#x27;s not so bothersome as to reflect poorly on the product. And I&#x27;m an asthmatic if that helps anyone with the strength of the scent.</li>
            <li> As always i am very happy with all of the honest Amish products that i have got from them!! If you want a soft beard and you need to keep  wild hairs laying down then this is for you!! It has a great smell!!</li>
            <li> Much thicker than the regular beard balm. The regular one conditions just as well as this one, this one just has a tad bit more thickness. I will be buying heavy duty from now on.</li>
            <li> Mistakenly ordered this product as I didn&#x27;t read that it was beard balm instead of wax.  I had also ordered the beard balm in the same order.  Contacted the seller and he was great about helping me out and told me to try it out and let him know how the product was. The heavy duty beard Balm smells great and adds a nice shine to my beard. It does make my beard feel softer as well. Thanks again Wolfgang!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of beard maintenance so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose when it came to trying this product.  The product is excellent!  My beard is usually dry and coarse and becomes bothersome to me after a short amount of time.  This product leaves my beard soft, supple and healthy looking.  Best of all it keeps it from becoming unruly and out of control.  The scent is definitely masculine, but not too strong that it over powers other things.  My beard grows like mad when I use this product so the makers of it must be doing something right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a nice, quality product that I will certainly be purchasing again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I love it! Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> After giving Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm a long and drawn out testing stage, I feel compelled to share my experience with the rest of the beard nation! I was your typical everyday working man with a wild beard that could not be tamed. I tried every fancy fly by night brand looking to jump on the new beard fad band wagon and finally went to something good ole fashioned and hand made with natural ingredients. I start my day with dampening my beard and the applying the balm. Inside my tin the balm had separated but it became a relaxing ritual to slowly melt it all down in the palm of my hand (if you so choose you can melt the balm in a pan with warm water but I didn&#x27;t find this necessary). At night if I choose to wash my beard, I use old fashioned pine tar soap for that, I will apply the beard oil the Honest Amish also makes. My lesson has been learned, My beard is soft and manageable and has just the slightest hint of a pleasant licorice smell that will disappear after a short time. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy the fancy cans with crazy designs and logos, get this and have a beard that you and that significant other will enjoy</li>
            <li> This looks to be a great Balm and was very much looking forward to using it. Alas, I have been forced to wait a bit before testing its magic. Between the time I placed the order and it arrived, I failed an annual cardiac stress test and now going in for a double bypass. Doc made me shave the beard and mustache (along with other places I won&#x27;t go into) as an infection precaution.&lt;br /&gt;I am very much looking forward to using this fine product while I grow the new one out starting in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I should have stuck with the fantastic standard beard balm from Honest Amish.  The heavy duty is very difficult to get all the chunks out rubbing in your hands.  It does offer stronger hold, but maybe not quite what I needed.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps even the roughest beard as sweet and soft as puppy dreams.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have a very soft beard already so I use this to help keep it in check and looking good. Has a very nice scent also.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend says it works great, but doesn&#x27;t go very far. You have to use way more product than what is advertised. Over-priced for 2 ounces of product that won&#x27;t last more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard soft and shiny. Works better than any beard oil I&#x27;ve bought. Easier to apply as well.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> This makes me beard feel so smooth and soft. On the first day I used it I instantly feel in love with this product.</li>
            <li> A must have for beards imo.  It doesn&#x27;t take much either and works extremely well to tame beard and make it look awesome!</li>
            <li> I expected a better hold. However, the balm does smell good and conditioned the beard keeping it conditioned. However, it does not really hold your beard or mustache in place; though, it is really greasy.</li>
            <li> Bought this not knowing whether this stuff really works or not. After using it for a couple months, it has taken care of my split ends and has made my beard softer. I have a pretty curly beard which this helped straighten it out a bit. I ended needing to use Honest Amish&#x27;s Beard Wax to finish taming my beard but overall, the smell and functionality of this product is awesome. If you have a beard, you need this stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend who had been growing his beard for about 4 months. It was getting dry and itchy and with this beard balm it looks shiny and healthy and feels soft. highly recommended for the beard grower in your life!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!! made my husbands beard nice and soft (:</li>
            <li> I had been using the honest Amish original beard balm for some time now, and as my beard has grown longer and more unruly, I was delighted to see a heavy duty version. Let me first say that this stuff does it&#x27;s job! The hold and control is perfect - not stiff but keeps it all tamed and soft, shiny and strong. Five stars for that end of things. However...it doesn&#x27;t smell good. In fact, it smells bad. Like spoiled olive oil. The original was one of my favorite things to put on my face, with it&#x27;s sweet and spicy clove smell. Maybe I got a funky batch or something, but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with the smell...</li>
            <li> Harsh. Strong. Too expensive for what&#x27;s in it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and keeps my beard shiny and soft. It has a very mild organic type smell without any licorice odor like the parent product. It does not provide much control for unruly hairs, and is more of a conditioner/ protectent. It is made from several natural oils, but does not feel oily on your face or beard if used in the right amount. It seems to help keep the skin underneath moisturized and healthy as well. While it doesn&#x27;t feel oily on your skin, it will leave a residue on touch screen devices if you touch your beard and then use. Minor inconvenience for having a healthy beard. Can is very small, but only a touch is needed so it should last awhile. Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Gift-recipient was very happy with product</li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews on here, both good and bad, I decided to go ahead and give this balm a try. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2 weeks now, and I really don&#x27;t notice much difference. At least, not the kind of difference this product claims to give. The scent is not terribly pleasant and the balm itself does not do much in the way of taming my beard. I still have a good deal of unruly beard I can&#x27;t under control with this. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again and will be looking for an alternative before I am anywhere near out of this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell nice, and doesn&#x27;t even hold my whiskers in place!</li>
            <li> Just began using this so I can not comment on long term improvement an excellent product</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and as advertised. Hard to explain the smell but it is pleasant. Definitely not a feminine smell kind of woodsy but not overpowering. I only have about a a little over a week of growth and am at the itchy stage.  After appling the itch is gone.  It&#x27;s to early to say if it has any effect on the beard yet but will follow up on the review.</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps my beard smooth and in shape!</li>
            <li> This balm is appropriately advertised.  The smell is nice and not at all overpowering if you found you weren&#x27;t too fond of it.  My only issue is having to regularly re-heat the tin in the sun, as the balm repeatedly becomes separated into small beads of wax that just do not melt down well in your hand. It&#x27;s great for a couple of days when its freshly melted.</li>
            <li> Having no previous experience grooming a beard, I had high hopes but low expectations.  I now have used several products from other vendors (almost all rather disappointing) and the following from Honest Amish:  Beard Balm, Original Beard Wax and Heavy Duty Beard Balm.  Each Honest Amish product has been really good in its own way.  You will have to find the right combination for your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to experiment with how to use these products and learn by trial and error.  My beard has shapes it doesn&#x27;t want to give up and one area that is really like crinkled wires.  My grooming now is to use the Heavy Duty Beard Balm after my shower, even if I used a conditioning shampoo.  Then as I comb it, add just a tiny bit of the Original Beard Wax to the area of crinkled wires.  For the first time in my life, my beard looks smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your experience will likely differ from mine, but by trial and error you will have as good an experience as mine, I suspect.  It is only once I tried,these products that I&#x27;ve begun to understand how my great great grandfather groomed his beard 100 or more years ago.</li>
            <li> No, seriously! Just buy this stuff! I&#x27;m new to being a beardsman and love how it keeps my beard looking tight and groomed everyday. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell at first, but it&#x27;s very mild and very manly and disappears pretty quickly. Given that you don&#x27;t wash your beard everyday (which you shouldn&#x27;t) this is the maintenance product that keeps it fresh and handsome!</li>
            <li> Never used anything on my beard before and this worked great. I have a very coarse and curly beard. This helped straighten it out and made it much softer.</li>
            <li> I thought with a name like &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; it would provide more hold. It didn&#x27;t and to top it off all the grease makes the area around my stache break out. If palm oil or something like it is what tames your facial hair then have at it. For me a very big disappointment and a waste of good money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the product I normally use was out of stock. I will definitely buy it again! It has a consistency similar to butter. Other wax-based products require heating with a blow dryer or lots of rubbing to melt, but Honest Amish Beard Balm melts at body temperature. Place a small portion on your palm, and it begins to melt immediately. I use it not only on my beard, but I also rub it into my hands, face, and mostly bald head. The smell is very pleasant, the consistency is not greasy, and it makes my beard look shiny and smooth. I have stopped blow drying my beard since I started using this product, and it looks better than ever. I blow dried mostly so that my chin and cheeks would not stay wet, but the skin conditioners in this product keep me from having any flakiness, irritation, or itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any guy with a beard, or even to guys with short hair who want something natural to use on their scalp. This is a very high quality product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Its okay stuff. It&#x27;s Probably better for the long beards. But I think I prefer the oils more. .. ..</li>
            <li> In could weather it got too stiff. Consider it for hot weather locations.</li>
            <li> Been growing a beard for years and I really enjoy this product. It&#x27;s a bit grainy but as soon as you work it into your hands it turns into a nice smooth balm. Minimal if any scent associated with this use. Doesn&#x27;t build up, easy to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend purchasing some essential oils to add a scent if you want it. Don&#x27;t forget your boar hair brush! This will help to spread the oils out evenly and keep you from using a great deal.</li>
            <li> Works great. Conditions my husbands beard without being a heavy product. Just be careful if ordering during the hot months because it will arrive melted. We placed it in the fridge and it solidified with no problem.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was really surprised how tiny the can is. Not sure why expected something different, but for some reason 2-inch-diameter can really baffled me.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I can&#x27;t get a handle on how to apply it. The stuff is rather hard and dry and you&#x27;re supposed to rub it in your hands until it liquefies. I tried a few times, scooping about a pea-size portion and rub it.. It liquefies alright, but by the time it does, it is all over my palms and when I put it on my beard, hardly anything applies (since at that stage it&#x27;s not really a liquid balm in my hands, but grease all over my palms and fingers). So with this application, *I think* there is slight difference with my beard (it&#x27;s not that long by the way), but at this point nothing significant. Maybe I just need to use it for a few weeks, maybe I need to scoop much more balm out of the can so that there is more stuff on the beard - but this way $17 (+S/H) can will last me a week...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------UPDATED-------------&lt;br /&gt;Raised my rating, just for the sole fact of a great and quick response from the Honest Amish representative. I&#x27;ll keep trying :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------January 2014 UPDATE-------------&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love it! After a few months of use I can&#x27;t leave without it, makes the beard really soft and also adds volume. Thanks Honest Amish!! Sorry for the negative reviews first</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My beard is now glorious.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Follow the instructions.  Softens beard and helps a bit controlling the wild, stray beard hairs.  If if leaves your beard looking greasy; you just used too much.  Leave a very light, mild, masculine scent.  Wish it made my beard a little more softer than it does, but I have only been using for five days.  This is only the 2nd leave-in beard balm I have ever used, the other being Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Saver.  Both are very good products.  While I would give the edge in conditioning to the Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Saver, I would say the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm does a better job of managing (i.e. &amp;#34;shaping) your beard.  Again, I have only used for five days so far, but it seems like this tiny 2-ounce tin would last me longer than the 4 ounce Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Saver.  Then again, I may have been using way too much of that other product. I would use again.</li>
            <li> Softens my stiff beard and moisturizing my face underneath. Also helps keep beard dandruff in check. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with facial hair... It smells good , iseasy to apply, and i have received numerous compliments on how shiny my beard is.  I will be trying other products made by honest Amish as I am sure the quality will be the same</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff!  We also bought a couple for Christmas gifts and they were a hit! He can&#x27;t wait to try other products in this line!</li>
            <li> Overall liking this beard conditioner but was hoping for more hold and control. Perhaps I&#x27;ve just got an unwieldy beard. Pros: Light pleasant fragrance, all natural high quality organic ingredients, works in easily to the beard, nice absorption and conditioning, softens beard hair. Cons: while the name says &amp;#34;heavy duty,&amp;#34; I find the grooming and control qualities more on the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; side. The tin is a bit small. I&#x27;d recommend this product as a conditioner and softener - but for coarser, curlier beards, I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect grooming product.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 19 yr old son for Christmas.. he loves it!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells awesome and helps tame the curly, wild mess of a beard that hangs from my face.</li>
            <li> It did take a few days to get used to, but once I did, I really enjoy how it controls the beard and puts a healthy shine to it.  I wash it with shampoo, spray leave-in conditioner in it, blow dry it and top it off with this balm.  It is a bit oily if you touch it with your hand but it doesn&#x27;t make my clothes oily (shirt collar and such).  And yes, it doesn&#x27;t take much, make sure to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; it down in the palms of your hands before applying.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I use it every day.  Keeps everything in place and doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bees knees. I have tried numerous beard balms, oils, waxes, but this one is the best so far. This is probably the 12th can of this stuff I have purchased. I am not going to be coy; my beard is epic, and I owe it to this product and the good people at Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend, he says, &amp;#34;it worked.&amp;#34; Lol. That&#x27;s all I could get out of him. I like the way it smells and it makes his beard very soft. And I LOVE that it is vegan.</li>
            <li> Not for me, but for my son.  He loves it and swears by it.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and does add slightly more beard control and luster.  However, for the average guy with a beard I find it tedious to apply and the results aren&#x27;t really worth the extra effort of fluffing my beard.  I&#x27;ll just continue to let my beard do its own beard stuff. It doesn&#x27;t need to be pampered.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick. The product works exactly like it should and gives you a soft, smooth beard quickly. The smell is nice, earthy but kinda citrusy. It is pretty expensive for a tiny little can. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again, only due to the price, but I surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Nothing&#x27;s gonna make your beard not look like pubes.&amp;#34; Well folks, my wife was pretty much right about that, my beard hair is still coarse and wavy. BUT! Using this balm about twice a week after shampooing has definitely made my beard softer and more manageable, and my beard skin less itchy. It&#x27;s definitely taking better care of my whiskers than I was before, so I don&#x27;t look like such a bum. And my wife loves the smell. She likes to curl up and nuzzle into my beard, and I absolutely love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard has a couple strong &amp;#34;cowlicks&amp;#34; that this stuff doesn&#x27;t fix, but I didn&#x27;t fully expect it to. It does help, though. A proper trim deals with that better than any product, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a pro tip for itchy beards: use dandruff shampoo once or twice a week, and blow dry your beard after shower so your skin doesn&#x27;t stay moist. That plus this beard goop have pretty much eliminated all my Winter beard itch problems.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to put in my husbands beard for months now! This product relaxed his coarse, brittle, curly hair and really helped soothe his irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews of people complaining about the smell, but I LOVE it! I massage the conditioner in his beard every night and the smell lingers onto the next day. Its an amazing earthy/woodsy smell. So if you don’t like that- don’t buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Honest Amish! I will be placing an order here soon- hoping to try out your bar soaps!</li>
            <li> it doesnt leave your beard greasy! but considering the ingredients it makes sense that it does a good job at bear conditioning.</li>
            <li> This works well on a white, thick beard.  Holds better than oils alone and the light licorice scent is pleasant while it lasts.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get something to tame my wild man beard, but this was a huge disappointment!  For starters, my label was covered in hair out of the nifty little bag they sent it in.  What appears to be human hair was caked to the label then they just slapped it on anyways.  Makes me wonder about how clean the product is.  The smell is like peppermint and not what I was hoping for.  The product is very thin, melts very easily, and has no hold to it.  It might moisturize the beard a little, but a conditioner works much better.  I melted the product with some beeswax and added some of my own essential oils and now it has some hold and smells more like a man should, but for almost $20, you should try something else.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas.  He absolutely loves it.  The only negative he said was that the smell was a bit feminine.  I think it smells like a nice after shave though.  In the end he has found a product that he will stick with.</li>
            <li> I started using the heavy duty beard balm and oil recently. My beard was dry and flaky. It was also hard to keep straight and control. The balm is not a wax, but it has helped me get my beard manageable and healthy. I wish I had started using these products earlier!</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Goes on well with no clumps.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  I have been growing my beard for 9 months now (My wife has been after me to shave it for the past 6). The longer it got the more wirey it got. This beard balm took care of all of that. When applied it makes my beard soft and it stays in place. Even my wife likes my beard now!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I have been using this for about 3 years now and it is great. keeps the beard soft, controllable (I have an especially bushy beard) and the scent is great too.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish beard balm keeps my beard soft and manageable. Some may not like the smell, but I think it is rather nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I use it every day and it does everything I expected. Easy to use and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for more than 20 years. This product, the Heavy Duty Beard Balm is the first product I have found that works to condition, and keep my beard in place and looking good all day. I like the fact that it contains all natural ingredients, has a pleasant smell and conditions (softens) the beard while holding it - no stray flyaways.  I use their Slick Beard Soap first, then the balm  before drying the beard. Totally sold on the Honest Amish products I have used!</li>
            <li> Honest Amish products are the best!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that works as advertised.  Provides control and conditioning.</li>
            <li> Love it works great! Really helps make my beard feel softer and quickly. Also stopped my dry skin!</li>
            <li> This is my first beard balm and I have a fairly thick beard I have grown out for the first time.  I have not had the dreaded beard itch as in times past.  The smell is pleasant and and it is easy to apply.  As the beard as grown in I just include a bit more to spread it around.  Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  I don&#x27;t have near the beard that I want yet, but it does help keep down the wild hairs.  No overpowering smell, just a faint trace.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve got a pretty unruly beard so when I needed something to put in it, I decided to give this a try.  It leaves my beard nice and smooth and pretty shiny.  Not a huge fan of the shine but meh, not  a big deal.  It also keeps the skin moisturized under my beard so I don&#x27;t get that dreaded beard dandruff.  Once this tin runs out, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> The item was as described , delivered on time ,quality is really good ,great packaging and i really satisfied about the all shipment,hope to have business together again</li>
            <li> it keeps the beard conditioned, when used with oils it is a great combination to maintain the health of your beard.</li>
            <li> this is great, my wife complemented me on my beard after the first day of use,  gave it a healthy shine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple of days now and unfortunately I&#x27;m just not really getting the results that I was looking for from this product. My beard is very curly and tends to get a lot of stray hairs that don&#x27;t seem to obey my comb so my hope was that this would give me a bit more control while also conditioning my beard. This may work for some people but it just really doesn&#x27;t hold up against my beard.</li>
            <li> Definitely not for styling, smell is a bit strong I think at times, but is nice as it keeps the skin under the beard nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Made a big difference according to my son!</li>
            <li> This is the first thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for my beard aside from a comb so I have no real basis to compare this to but I think it&#x27;s AWESOME. My beard feels softer and it smells great. I recommend this balm to ne one who is looking to help their beard get weird</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my bearded husband and he loves it!!!! I&#x27;m so glad I went with this certain one. It doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell at all. And it makes his beard shiny and clean. I would recommend this to anyone with a beard! Thank you Honest Amish!</li>
            <li> Just got this product yesterday and I love it! My beard no longer itches, the hair is softer, and no longer messy. There is very minimal scent and it smells very pleasant! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Spent 4 weeks using it but getting an unexpected result. Got in touch with Honest Amish and they helped me understand how I should use it properly. At the end, all things worked perfectly. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love my boyfriends beard but sometimes he looked like black beard. Honest Amish really tamed that puppy down! Great Product!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this stuff at first.  It seems much thicker than nay other beard balm I had tried before.  After the first couple of uses though, I was hooked.  IT doesn&#x27;t leave a sheen like some others, but the hold is incredible.  The conditioning is way better too.  I have a longer beard and it&#x27;s never looked so good.  Really.  Just looks fuller and definitely holds shape better.  I will be using Honest Amish from here on for sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s their regular balm kicked up a notch. I have thicker facial hair, so the original did the job, but the heavy duty balm goes above and beyond the call of duty.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy the 4 oz can...more for your money and you will need more at some point unless you shave, but hey, real men don&#x27;t shave!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now, and it is not as good as everyone is making it out to be. First off it is VERY oily so much so that you can see it from across the room. This may be my preference but it makes you look grimy. Second it does not have a &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; at all the stray hairs are still there, but now they are like a piece of glass glimmering in the sunshine because the product is too oily. I would not recommend this to a friend or an enemy at that. Did I mention that it is too oily.</li>
            <li> I use the heavy duty beard balm and the regular beard wax. My only complaint is that it is a little oily but if you rub it into your beard, comb, leave for a few minutes, and then re-comb, it is awesome. Enjoy! If you want more control get the regular beard wax!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product. It has a very enjoyable sent and seems to have good hold in my beard. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Soften up the beard has a funky smell but it really dont last all day think i will try another brand on the next go round</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered. That seems like the best endorsement I could give it. And I&#x27;ll re-order again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> This product is a little more difficult to use than the regular beard balm. It&#x27;s thicker and requires more heat/manipulation to spread around. The texture is really gritty/grainy until you get it sufficiently melted. Several times, I&#x27;ve had to use a hair dryer to heat it up in my hands and then apply it to my beard. I find that it provides much more control than the regular beard balm. I also think it smells better.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff. I also love the smell. This is a must if you have a beard and want to control it somewhat</li>
            <li> Eh.... YMMV but didn&#x27;t work as well for me as other brands. Works for a a few hours then gives out.. Again YMMV</li>
            <li> Best beard product in the market. If you don&#x27;t like your beard oily, this product may not be best for you. It will look very small when you see it but believe me it&#x27;s good for at least 4 to 6 months.</li>
            <li> My company does not mind my beard, but requires it to appear neat and professional. With this, I can grow it as long as I want and maintain a tame, professional and show worthy beard!</li>
            <li> This is the first Honest Amish product I have purchased. It turned my dry, wiry, brittle beard hairs soft and supple. It&#x27;s so much easier to brush and comb now. I find the balm is easier to apply than a beard oil. Love the scent, but can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it. Sometimes it&#x27;s a little anise, sometimes barely a hint of mint, and this may sound weird, but sometimes it smells a little like sassafras or root beer. Love it! I apply it in the morning before work, and the scent has pretty much dissipated by lunch time. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully at conditioning and controlling a beard with a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! It makes my beard shine as well as bring out the color in it. I won&#x27;t hesitate to tell friends. I will definitely be a return customer!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works great to tame my beard. I use oil first and foremost then after a couple minutes use a hairdryer to heat this up and work it into my beard. Gives an excellent all day hold and keeps my beard from drying out along with my face on these harsh winter days. Not too heavy to cause any underlying acne or bothersome residue. I&#x27;ve already told multiple people to buy it and I&#x27;ll do the same for you.</li>
            <li> I really like this as a change of pace from beard oil. It keeps your beard very well moisturized. I think it does have a little hold. My only problem is there is little to no scent. I like the little scent that my beard oils have. If you are looking for a scentless product, this is for you.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is obsessed with this...he puts it on his beard every single day... its growing in much thicker and thankfully its softer!</li>
            <li> Works well, can be a little on the greasy side before it dries. otherwise works as intended.</li>
            <li> Excellent balm. Stays nicely and control my wild beard hairs!</li>
            <li> If you are new to beard products, this is where you should start. And it may also be where you end. This is almost certainly the only beard product I will be buying form now on (though I might try other well-received balms just to see).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard was just too scraggly for an office and I wanted to continue to grow it out. So I initially started using this balm at night and the Honest Amish beard wax (Original or Extra Grit) in the morning for more control. But I found after a while that the balm eventually became sufficient for both tasks. I think this is because my beard had never really been conditioned before and just became more manageable and softer over time with use of a balm. Now I can apply the Heavy Duty Balm in the morning and comb my beard. At that point, my beard still usually does not look properly coifed. But by the time I get dressed and make coffee, the balm is sufficiently adsorbed (and maybe even stiffened a bit) that I just need to recomb my beard for it to look sufficiently groomed for an office. If there are just a few stray hairs, I&#x27;ll then trim them for a better defined beard outline. This enables me to continue to grow my beard and never have it looked scraggly when I leave the house. The balm is also far less greasy than the wax. I really don&#x27;t want anyone touching my beard when I have the wax in (I have kids) as it just gets all over your hands and isn&#x27;t simply wiped off easily. But I don&#x27;t care with the balm since my beard won&#x27;t really feel oilier than my face after a little while. Just a fantastic product. I can&#x27;t imagine a fall/winter (I trim short in spring/summer) without it anymore.</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard super greasy! No Bueno!</li>
            <li> this things am are a great stuff for use on face hairs or lower head hairs. make dem shiny smell</li>
            <li> I use this from time to time to keep my beard more tame. The smell it emits is fantastic. You don&#x27;t need a lot of this stuff for the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Great product , leaves beard manageable , helpful for those that die the beard doesn&#x27;t affect  the coloring ,.</li>
            <li> I had been using the regular version of the Honest Amish beard balm and I liked what it was doing for my beard, but I needed a bit more hold to tame my 5 month growth. I tried waxes, but I hated everything about them from the difficulty applying to the look and then the clean up afterwards. The Heavy Duty Balm gives enough hold to keep my untrimmed beast presentable at work without the side effects of the aforementioned wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con of this and almost any of these products is the smell. I don&#x27;t mind it, but it really clashes with my cologne. Please Honest Amish, come up up a truly scent free version. That&#x27;s why it is missing a star.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it! Great combination of conditioning and control. Smells awesome. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Does What it&#x27;s Suppose to Do... Keeps My Wiskers Right, Skin Moisturize and Tight, Fragrance is Very Light... RoCk On!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t my first time getting this wax, I have a very rebel bear... But not any more.  Keeps all together and shiny.</li>
            <li> good for after you you wash your beard to get some moisture back in it.  Use the regular beard balm after that and then the Beardbrand  Tree Ranger oil after its dried..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m simply amazed at the quality of this product. I&#x27;ve tried other beard care products and never had the success this has given me on simply the first use. I will never use another company for my beard care as long as these guys are in business!</li>
            <li> I have a very wiry beard and this stuff calms it down to a degree. It&#x27;s all natural ingredients and made by hand by the Amish workers. Sure that is a plus to me.</li>
            <li> Husband is very happy with this. His beard Is so soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple different products for my beard and so far this is my favorite. It gives my beard a great silky feel and is easily malleable in order to control some of the crazy &#x27;rogue&#x27; hairs. My favorite part is the fact that the scent is very mild and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like many of the beard oils...so if you are looking for a product that will give you an all-day scent this is NOT the one for you.</li>
            <li> Best thing for beard on the market</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance.. he absolutely loves it. He&#x27;s always checking his beard out in the mirror.. or even past anything that reflects lol. He loves the stuff, will be ordering more as he never wants to run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For him, when applying the balm it put some order in his beard. Hairs weren&#x27;t every which way, plus instead of his beard going outward kinda (if that makes sense?) his beard now can be combed down longer giving his beard extra length. The pouch it comes in is pretty cool too. He will not throw it away. Ha.</li>
            <li> Great product as usual been ordering this for quite often and it&#x27;s the best for conditioning and taming my beard and I&#x27;ve tried several other brands</li>
            <li> This item arrived fast and works great.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love Honest Amish Beard Balm. It is easy to use, smells great, and leaves my beard feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Its not as strong as a wax but still holds beard in place.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Smelks great keep this bushy lon beard in check. I&#x27;d buy this again</li>
            <li> amazing beard hydration with just the right amount of wax to add a little extra control of your beard. The scent is very light but pleasant.</li>
            <li> Best i have tried so far</li>
            <li> Seems to be roughly the same product as Dr. Ganix Bombeardier Beard Balm (both are made by the same company).  Has a semi-granular consistency that must be &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; by rubbing in palm with finger(s) before applying to the beard.  The scent is light yet different, more citrus, than Dr. Ganix, which has a an almost leathery smell, in my opinion.  I actually like both scents, but my wife thinks the Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm smells like citronella (which she doesn&#x27;t like) - bummer.  I will probably alternate between this and Dr Granix just to add some variety to the smell of my beard.</li>
            <li> i really like how it works, but i don&#x27;t care for the smell of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tin of Honest Amish now.  I love the smell and it keeps the crazy down in my beard daily.  I tried one other brand of beard balm and was nowhere near as impressed as I am with Honest Amish Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> My go to product to deal with my unruly beard. Love this stuff! I use the Honest Amish Classic Oil then brush this in. It smells great, holds great, and doesn&#x27;t stiffen up or leave those pesky wax clumps after a few hours. This will be a staple in my beard care for a long time to come. Everything these guys make is the best you&#x27;ll find. Bar none!</li>
            <li> Seriously considering becoming Amish because of this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really but it is pretty awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Honest Amish products for about a year now. The heavy duty beard balm makes his beard smooth and shiny and also helps keeps the strays in place. He will only use honest amish products for his beard now.</li>
            <li> First time beard owner. Friend of mine recommend this stuff and sold me by saying using this product makes his beard super soft and that his wife said the difference was night and day. It couldn&#x27;t hurt, I wasn&#x27;t using anything before and the hair was extremely dry and sometimes brittle.&lt;br /&gt;At first I&#x27;d put a bit in in the morning and continued to wash it daily. Something wasn&#x27;t right though. The night and day effect wasn&#x27;t as significant as  I hoped. I figured maybe I was doing something wrong. Emailed the company, got a friendly response the very next morning. Long story short, it&#x27;s all about hydration. Me washing it daily was drying it out. The hair doesn&#x27;t get near the amount of oil your head hair does. Now I rinse it only when I take most showers and wash it about every third day. Night and day achieved!&lt;br /&gt;Holy moly the difference. It&#x27;s softer, more controllable, and doesn&#x27;t smell. I wonder what their other products do. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> It conditions, but it&#x27;s a little greasy feeling and the smell can overwhelm a little.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product &amp; regularly recommends it to anyone he knows that is even thinking  about growing a beard.</li>
            <li> Decided to give the beard balm a try after reading many places about how awesome the balms and conditioners leave a beard feeling. I was a little worried about the small size at first when ordering but a tiny dab goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;There was an issue during shipping but the folks at Honest Amish were awesome and a replacement arrived very shortly after I had contacted them.&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of use my beard is much more tame and healthy, I could not be more happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Honest Amish products, and this is no exception.  If you&#x27;re a fan of their regular beard balm but want/need a little more control, this is the stuff.  I use it in conjunction with their beard wax.</li>
            <li> Not the worst, but has room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I am a novice and bearding and its accoutrements so this was my first foray into the realm of beard-keeping products.  Man, I have crazy beard and mustache so I needed to throw something on it.  This does indeed aid in control of said craziness and it makes the hair feel softer (which my girls love).  I hesitate to recommend the scent only because it seems to scream &amp;#34;I have something in my beard!&amp;#34; but it is not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> works great, though the smell is a bit strong to me</li>
            <li> Worked well for my husband&#x27;s beard. Pleasant smell and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week now and it works great. It works as well as beard oil but it allows for a little styling as well, almost like mustache wax. The smell is great but faint, so it vanishes after a few minutes. The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t use enough and so my beard still felt scratchy. The second day, I used too much and my beard looked a bit shiny. After a little experimentation, I found the right amount for me. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a softer and healthier beard</li>
            <li> High quality leave in beard conditioner. When I bought this I was actually looking for more of a wax that will help me guide where I want all this man fur on my face to go. So if you; like me, are looking for a shaping wax/balm this is not that.  This product does have an incredibly good scent that is very mild.  I will be looking through there inventory and buying some beard wax from them as well. Thank you guys for your hard work.</li>
            <li> As advertised it controls my beard better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ll be staying with this from now on.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my boyfriend. He likes it very much. After one use he noticed his beard was much softer and tamer and his skin was less itchy as well. It also worked well to shape his mustache. I would say he is a happy camper.</li>
            <li> It helps me control my beard every morning i use it after i shower</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible I&#x27;ll stick with the the original Amish beard balm it smells better plus easier to groom</li>
            <li> No more itch!!!! and it smells great</li>
            <li> Gives awesome shine and smells clean!</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to do a better job of taming my beard</li>
            <li> The best beard care products, period.</li>
            <li> Smells is subtle and great, at first it reminds me of burts bees wax, but I barely notice the smell it it does not linger. I have a small/medium length beard it is very easy to apply and adds a minimal healthy-looking (not overly) shine to it. As to say it looks as though I take care of my beard whereas before it looked like I was a homeless lumberjack. It also helps straighten hairs out but not to much that I completely lose the curl character and it definitely keeps the rouge hairs in check all day. Was very skeptical about using anything and was torn between a lot of products, will be a life long honest amish user now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a particularly long beard, just over 1.5 inches for now. But I was looking for something to help make my beard look intentional without shining like vampires in Twilight (ie typical mustache wax) the wife was getting tired of the beard and I was desperate to save it. Despite the rave reviews that all Honest Amish products seem to carry I was rather skeptical that it could be that great. Well the product arrived several days before Amazon estimated and I couldn&#x27;t help but try it out immediately. It doesn&#x27;t take much for me, maybe half the size of my thumbnail. I worked it in and straightened up my beard with just my fingers. I showed the wife and immediately she said I could keep the beard if I kept using this balm. It has solid hold for the length of my beard, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t make my beard shiny, everything I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Honest Amish for saving my beard!</li>
            <li> I like their products. Have tried oils, but the balm conditioner works excellent.</li>
            <li> After much research on a healthy beard product to help maintain my husbands beard, this was the product for him. It nurishes the hair and the skin while keeping the beard nicely groomed. After trying the very first time, he fell in love!! Thank you Honest Amish for a life changing product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really help tame my beard and gave it softer feel.</li>
            <li> Great product but the wife doesn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Great for control and managing the main</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. Leaves my beard shiny and soft. Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have to go middle of the road here. The first one was pretty good. I have tried a few others, but they best I have every found was at a farmers market that conditioned so well it worked through the next day and was not greasy. I know theres an equal out there! This does have a good hold on longer beards and tames pretty well, but is slightly more oily when you apply that much for the hold. The reason for the bad review is because I bought a second tin and it was awful. Gritty, smelled like dental floss, and didn&#x27;t have any hold at all. It was more like Grave Before Shave beard Bomb. Just a conditioner that left my beard flat. You can mail it back to the company, but I didn&#x27;t bother wasting money doing that. I just gave it to a friend with a smaller beard. He hates the smell but it makes his beard softer.</li>
            <li> good conditioning, nice smell, not too heavy.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish is the only beard product l use and will use. My beard length is around 10 inches and thick, the beard balm makes my beard soft and easy to shape in the morning.  The smell dissipates in 15 mins. And does not irritate the skin, excellent product</li>
            <li> I have a monster thick beard that is tough to keep tidy, so perhaps that&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars.  At least this beard balm keeps it manageable.  Good product and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product. Makes my beard look healthy and with more control. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I expected a less grease balm with a good smell... I was a little dissapointed with it... But i have no complains about the seller or the process itself. Thank you very much.</li>
