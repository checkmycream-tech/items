            <li>but everything else is fantastic.  </li>

            <li>&quot; brushes, much better quality and worth the $$.</li>
            <li>I was soo excited to get it</li>
            <li>Its fun, its easy, but</li>
            <li>Very pleased with all the purchases from Bare Minerals/Escentuals.</li>
            <li>I tried other drugstore mineral foundations - neutrogena and l&#x27;oreal - and thought that if they were pretty good, then this would be even better -</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals covers nicely and doesn&#x27;t make your face look powdery.</li>
            <li>I bought this Bare Minerals starter kit from QVC in medium, because I am not that light and the lady said most people are medium</li>
            <li>I am a mature skin type, when applied I am always pleased with my results.</li>
            <li>You get great coverage with a total natural look.</li>
            <li>Application is quick, easy, and never messy.</li>
            <li>Once you use it, nothing else will ever feel right on your skin.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals bareMinerals covers better and goes on smoother.  </li>
            <li>Point is, I love Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I love the Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>Purchasing through Amazon is easy and my shipments always arrive early.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and in the humid hot summers, it is fantastic because I need coverage</li>
            <li>I first bought this off of an infomercial 3 years ago hoping that the claims were correct.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product at a regular store (Ulta) and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love it because it is a powder but ends up looking so sheer like a cream.</li>
            <li>Has not caused any breakouts since first use.</li>
            <li>It has full coverage for ANY blemish, feels weightless, looks like your natural skin, and lasts all day through any amount of sweat!  </li>
            <li>The ID Bare Minerals Make-Up is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They cannot compare with the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Others really stand out and can be seen on the face.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>When I run out I use liquid as my backup and really miss my BE Mineral Makeup, my skin \\&quot;feels\\</li>
            <li>&quot; like I have foundation on, when I use the mineral makeup I can&#x27;t really feel it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Bare Minerals products for several years and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels very natural.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals is natural looking, and covers any imperfections very well.  </li>
            <li>When you first put it on it may appear that it looks somewhat cakey, but once you go outside the moisture and air makes it look absolutely natural.</li>
            <li>It evens out uneven skin tones, covers redness very well (like mild rosacea)and</li>
            <li>Well let me tell you, that was a  HUGE waste of money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried to go the cheaper route and buy the new department store stuff that pretends to look like Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>It can be messy but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is a must have!  </li>
            <li>It really evens out my skin, and it lasts such a long time.  </li>
            <li>BARE MINERALS IS A LIFE SAVER.</li>
            <li>... and I&#x27;ve only had to buy 2 jars so far.</li>
            <li>I am hooked on Bare Escentuals -</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Minerals for the last four years and will not use anything else.  </li>
            <li>Also the coverage was nothing special and actually made pores and lines (I&#x27;m 21 and have hardly any) appear.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Also the coverage was nothing special and actually made pores and lines (I&#x27;m 21 and have hardly any) appear.</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way, and when you think about it, for the price, you&#x27;re actually paying LESS than you normally would buying refills every other month for the chalky looking makeup that does nothing for your skin.</li>
            <li> Dark circles, pimples, red zits, and those hickies from your husband/ boyfriend!</li>
            <li> This time the containter was in pieces and all of the powder was loose inside the package.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t clog up my skin like all the other make-ups I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> there are other mineral make-ups out there that do not contain bismuth oxychloride.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now, it&#x27;s definately expensive but seems to be worth it.</li>
            <li> Also warmth is sooo dark and orange looking.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with adult acne and have noticed a dramatic decrease in my breakouts.</li>
            <li> , the brushes they carry are a little</li>
            <li> but it does not feel heavy or \\&quot;slide</li>
            <li> I find if I&#x27;m to lazy to take it off at night it doesn&#x27;t bother my face with breakouts</li>
            <li> I used it for about a week, decided I hated it, and went back to my Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve wasted my money on messy, fake looking liquid foundations all my life.  </li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed that the shade I purchased was not as medium as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend going to sephora and trying out the colors if you&#x27;re having a difficult time deciding on a shade.</li>
            <li> However, it DOES NOT give you that ugly foundation line by your ears and jaw line.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed yet, in any of their products.  </li>
            <li> how annoying!!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I adore this product and recommend it to all my friends.  It&#x27;s very natural-looking, while still covering up some spots or uneven coloring on your face that you don&#x27;t want shown!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic. However the company is not. It always takes forever to recieve anything that I buy from there. This time the containter was in pieces and all of the powder was loose inside the package. I returned it and have never recieved a replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought this Bare Minerals starter kit from QVC in medium, because I am not that light and the lady said most people are medium and she said it blends well anyway. I was soo excited to get it I even paid extra for priority shipping making my cost 75 dollars! Well let me tell you, that was a  HUGE waste of money. At first I loved it and thought, well this is great so I threw the box away. Another mistake. A week in to it I noticed my face in another light (I work at a hospital) and yuck!! It looked so orange and you could see the line where it ended. Also warmth is sooo dark and orange looking. I applied it the way the dvd said and still yuck. I couldn&#x27;t send it back but I am avidly looking for another good make up. Also the coverage was nothing special and actually made pores and lines (I&#x27;m 21 and have hardly any) appear.</li>
            <li> WHAT MORE CAN I SAY BUT THANK GOD FOR THIS MAKEUP. IT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE. I COULD NEVER WEAR LIQUID FOUNDATION BECAUSE OF MY ACNE PRONE SKIN. BARE MINERALS IS A LIFE SAVER. PERFECT COVERAGE EVERYTIME. I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT. A+++++++++++</li>
            <li> This is the best kind of makeup that you can purchase that is great for your skin. You look flawless and great in photos. It can be messy but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup I use, feels like silk and like not wearing makeup but looks great!</li>
            <li> I love this make-up.  It really evens out my skin, and it lasts such a long time.  It also doesn&#x27;t clog up my skin like all the other make-ups I&#x27;ve tried.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I tried other drugstore mineral foundations - neutrogena and l&#x27;oreal - and thought that if they were pretty good, then this would be even better - but I was a little disappointed that the shade I purchased was not as medium as I thought it would be.  I understand that I would probably achieve better results with the kit so that I could mix the colors in the hopes of getting closer to my skin tone.  I would recommend going to sephora and trying out the colors if you&#x27;re having a difficult time deciding on a shade.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months, and love it.  The best part is not having to deal with the lines at the mall and having it delived to my door.</li>
            <li> I first bought this off of an infomercial 3 years ago hoping that the claims were correct.  I have not been disappointed yet, in any of their products.  The foundation covers all of my discolorations and evens out my complexion beautifully.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have tried the \\&quot;knockoffs\\&quot;.  They cannot compare with the real thing.  Bare Escentuals bareMinerals covers better and goes on smoother.  Others really stand out and can be seen on the face.  Bare Escentuals covers nicely and doesn&#x27;t make your face look powdery.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Bare Minerals products for several years and my skin has never looked better.  It evens out uneven skin tones, covers redness very well (like mild rosacea)and is so light that you don&#x27;t even realize you are wearing any makeup.  I use the foundation, warmth, mineral veil, and eye shadow.  Not really a big fan of the shadow because it gets everywhere when you try to apply it but everything else is fantastic.  The colors are so easy to blend to get a perfect match.  Very pleased with all the purchases from Bare Minerals/Escentuals.</li>
            <li> ... and I&#x27;ve only had to buy 2 jars so far. A little really does go a long way, and when you think about it, for the price, you&#x27;re actually paying LESS than you normally would buying refills every other month for the chalky looking makeup that does nothing for your skin. I&#x27;ve even tried to go the cheaper route and buy the new department store stuff that pretends to look like Bare Minerals.

Point is, I love Bare Minerals and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else! :)</li>
            <li> But it does cover well, and lasts on even in the summer... Purchasing through Amazon is easy and my shipments always arrive early.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love, love love it! It&#x27;s has the best coverage of anything I have found and no one even knows that you are wearing makeup!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a regular store (Ulta) and fell in love with it. It does not look caked on and it covers most flaws: Dark circles, pimples, red zits, and those hickies from your husband/ boyfriend! :) It evens out your skin tone and gives your face a universal color. When you first put it on it may appear that it looks somewhat cakey, but once you go outside the moisture and air makes it look absolutely natural. I love it because it is a powder but ends up looking so sheer like a cream. However, it DOES NOT give you that ugly foundation line by your ears and jaw line. Buy it...this shade is for a woman who has a naturally light tan, but during the winter gets whiter. It gives you some warmth to your skin without looking like your putting bronzer from a bottle on your face. :)</li>
            <li> I am hooked on Bare Escentuals - it provides the best coverage of anything I&#x27;ve tried and you don&#x27;t feel like you have anything on!&lt;br /&gt;However, the brushes they carry are a little disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I bought \\&quot;Prescriptives\\&quot; brushes, much better quality and worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Quality of product was excellent as described. Powder is light and easy to apply on. Has not caused any breakouts since first use. Will definitely continue to purchase this foundation after I finsh using this current one. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.. people always comment on what nice skin I have when I wear it. It looks and feels very natural.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is a must have!  It has full coverage for ANY blemish, feels weightless, looks like your natural skin, and lasts all day through any amount of sweat!  I live in Florida and in the humid hot summers, it is fantastic because I need coverage (I am NOT a sans make-up kind of girl!) but it does not feel heavy or \\&quot;slide off\\&quot;  or even LOOK like i am wearing makeup!</li>
            <li> I love the Bare Minerals.  Very happy with this product and with the timely shipping.</li>
            <li> Best makeup product I have ever used!  I have used Bare Minerals for the last four years and will not use anything else.  I am a mature skin type, when applied I am always pleased with my results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve wasted my money on messy, fake looking liquid foundations all my life.  Bare Escentuals is natural looking, and covers any imperfections very well.  I do like to combine it with the bisque for maximum coverage.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for the girl who wants a light make-up that will still cover blemishes up. I love how smooth it makes my skin feel and how it NEVER clogs my pores. Application is quick, easy, and never messy. I recommend that everyone try this product.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever made.  Really.  Its fun, its easy, but best of all it looks GREAT!</li>
            <li> The ID Bare Minerals Make-Up is fantastic. You get great coverage with a total natural look. I find if I&#x27;m to lazy to take it off at night it doesn&#x27;t bother my face with breakouts</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for 2 years thinking its \\&quot;good\\&quot; for my skin!  only to find out after some research (finding the ingredients was a task in itself), that it contains a lead byproduct that irritates and causes breakouts! how annoying!!!  they claim its \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and free of chemicals, bull!!!! there are other mineral make-ups out there that do not contain bismuth oxychloride. [...]. If you have problem/blemished skin, i would avoid this bismuth oxychloride, as it states it specifically \\&quot;can\\&quot; cause break-outs. uggg....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now, it&#x27;s definately expensive but seems to be worth it. I have a problem with adult acne and have noticed a dramatic decrease in my breakouts. When I run out I use liquid as my backup and really miss my BE Mineral Makeup, my skin \\&quot;feels\\&quot; like I have foundation on, when I use the mineral makeup I can&#x27;t really feel it.</li>
