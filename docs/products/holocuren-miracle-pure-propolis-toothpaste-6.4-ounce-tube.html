            <li>It does not get any better than this</li>
            <li>My gum feels a lot better and don&#x27;t bleed almost at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s beneficial, but I can&#x27;t continue to use it</li>
            <li>I am sure it will work for you (barring any allergies to bee products).</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product, but the delivered time was grossly overstated.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a huge improvement in my gums since using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Great quality toothpaste that actually tastes and looks like something from the bee hive.</li>
            <li>This is a real deal!!!</li>
            <li>If anyone is familiar with this (bee propolis)</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed in any way with the product and will purchase it again unless I die in the interim.</li>

            <li>I love and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Not surprisingly, Ken&#x27;s tastes the best.</li>
            <li>Holocuren&#x27;s Pure Propolis Toothpaste comes in a large size and has an interesting taste--kinda like concentrated Pepsi.</li>
            <li>Helped to calm swollen and abscess gums.</li>
            <li>and I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It also leaves the mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>And right before go to bed</li>
            <li>Pure Propolis, Ken&#x27;s Cinnamon and the red clay kind in cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!tried it about a year ago and this is my 3rd tube.</li>
            <li>I definitely like this brand the most.</li>
            <li>But the highlight of the regimen is the use of the Pure Propolis Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It looks too much like goose pooh to keep putting in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Like it so much I&#x27;ve ordered it again.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t make your mouth squeaky clean like some chemical products, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li>I paid quite a bit more from the other source (which shall remain nameless LOL)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>THIS DOESNT FOAM LIKE NORMAL TOOTHPASTE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not your normal paste.</li>
            <li>My regimen of natural products in the fight against gum disease include swishing (for 20 minutes) with extra virgin coconut oil followed by brushing with salt toothpaste followed by brushing with Pure Propolis.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves this stuff and has helped immensely with my gum disease.</li>
            <li>It seems that there is debate whether Xylitol is considered natural or not.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s acceptable for a natural product.)  </li>
            <li>then you opt for natural remedies.</li>
            <li>Often I follow this with a natural mouthwash (PerioWash).</li>
            <li>Works great, eliminates bad breath.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a life long convert as long as this company keeps making this product.</li>
            <li> My gums and teeth are happier than they&#x27;ve been in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Then that dr told me that my gum is having gingivitis just a little bit and needs only regular cleaning!!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s too liquidity and too messy.  </li>
            <li> but once you get past spitting that into the sink, I feel like my mouth is healthier after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> No more sensitivity or soreness in my tender (almost 70-year-old) mouth.  </li>
            <li> When you suffer from dental problems, for whatever reason, and you don&#x27;t want to needlessly ingest antibiotics, analgesics or any other made-made substance that will be metabolized in the liver</li>
            <li> Color and taste were a little weird.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> then you know how difficult it can be to take in liquid form.</li>
            <li> Well, Ken&#x27;s failed the ingredients test in that regard.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a real deal!!! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as described.  No problems with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say how well it works.  Only used it a couple of times.  It looks too much like goose pooh to keep putting in my mouth.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> brown, yes, but once you get past spitting that into the sink, I feel like my mouth is healthier after 2 months of use. My routine is to use this in the morning after oil pulling and regular toothpaste at night. Great product!</li>
            <li> Color and taste were a little weird. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement over any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste! Has a cinnamon flavor to it. Cleans teeth well and feels upscale.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!tried it about a year ago and this is my 3rd tube. I mix it with my arm and hammer toothpaste and i feel like I&#x27;ve left the dentist each time!it truly has changed my guns and mouth over all.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. Does the job and isn&#x27;t as drying as some toothpastes. Like it so much I&#x27;ve ordered it again.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste ever. My whole family loves this stuff and has helped immensely with my gum disease. It&#x27;s notbkathery like the toothpaste we are used to but it cleans so much better. I add a pinch of baking soda and I hear a choir sing as I&#x27;m brushing. I&#x27;m a life long convert as long as this company keeps making this product.</li>
            <li> This is a really wonderful product. I have tried all sorts of toothpastes and \\&quot;tooth soaps\\&quot; looking for the perfect non-fluoride way to brush my teeth and this is IT.  It really does everything it says it does, and it tastes good, and you just feel good knowing it&#x27;s good for you! I just kick myself for not knowing how poisonous the toothpaste I grew up on and used for over 50 years was! Who knew? Anyway, I have been using this for a while now (on second tube) and it&#x27;s a keeper. I will be getting it on Amazon from now on - I paid quite a bit more from the other source (which shall remain nameless LOL)</li>
            <li> I wish I knew it had Xylitol in it. It seems that there is debate whether Xylitol is considered natural or not. I don&#x27;t appreciate the fact that the company (Holocuren) doesn&#x27;t mention it on their website or this site.</li>
            <li> THIS DOESNT FOAM LIKE NORMAL TOOTHPASTE BUT IT IS REFRESHING AND MAKES MY MOUTH FEEL GREAT YOU CAN SMELL THE TEA TREE OIL THRU THE PACKAGING SO U KNOW ITS MORE THAN JUST A DROP</li>
            <li> Great tasting.  Great cleaning.  (Unattractive, brown colored gel, but that&#x27;s acceptable for a natural product.)  Yes, I&#x27;ll use it again and recommend it, however, its kinda runny and sometimes drips out of tube/ toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, but the delivered time was grossly overstated.  It was delivered after 8:00 pm.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge improvement in my gums since using this toothpaste. I love and would highly recommend. It does not get any better than this and I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Works great, eliminates bad breath.</li>
            <li> Just started to use this toothpaste and IPSAB gum treatment 5 days ago. On the same day, my dentist said I&#x27;m having middle stage gingivitis and recommended me deep cleaning. 3 days later, I had to go different dentist for consultation of root canal. Then that dr told me that my gum is having gingivitis just a little bit and needs only regular cleaning!! My gum feels a lot better and don&#x27;t bleed almost at all now!&lt;br /&gt;I use this toothpaste after breakfast&amp;dinner following no rinsing. And right before go to bed, I apply IPSAB gum treatment (Heritage) to gum with qtips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually like to give this 4.5 stars. It won&#x27;t make your mouth squeaky clean like some chemical products, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> I like this tootpaste.  It makes my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your normal paste. It&#x27;s too liquidity and too messy.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s beneficial, but I can&#x27;t continue to use it</li>
            <li> When you suffer from dental problems, for whatever reason, and you don&#x27;t want to needlessly ingest antibiotics, analgesics or any other made-made substance that will be metabolized in the liver then you opt for natural remedies. I tried several of them (with the exception of a couple shots of Scotch Whiskey) which included the use of bee propolis tincture. If anyone is familiar with this (bee propolis) substance then you know how difficult it can be to take in liquid form. After a couple of times I immediately set out to find bee propolis in another form. Holocuren&#x27;s Pure Propolis Toothpaste comes in a large size and has an interesting taste--kinda like concentrated Pepsi. My regimen of natural products in the fight against gum disease include swishing (for 20 minutes) with extra virgin coconut oil followed by brushing with salt toothpaste followed by brushing with Pure Propolis. Often I follow this with a natural mouthwash (PerioWash). But the highlight of the regimen is the use of the Pure Propolis Toothpaste. I should mention that I also take bee propolis capsules now (in place of the tincture) along with either a garlic or garlic/ginger capsule. Quantum&#x27;s Lysine product includes several other natural remedies in it so I take it as well to help the gum tissue to recover. Oh, and don&#x27;t forget to invest in an ultra-soft toothbrush--several of them. Bee Propolis toothpaste has worked for me I am sure it will work for you (barring any allergies to bee products).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It tastes very good, leaves my mouth feeling much cleaner than ever.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few different types of non-fluoride toothpaste in the last few months: Pure Propolis, Ken&#x27;s Cinnamon and the red clay kind in cinnamon. I definitely like this brand the most. I read a book about natural dental hygiene and found that glycerin is an unwanted ingredient that natural toothpastes unfortunately include sometimes. Well, Ken&#x27;s failed the ingredients test in that regard. Not surprisingly, Ken&#x27;s tastes the best. Gee I wonder why? Anyway, the taste of Pure Propolis is actually very good. It also leaves the mouth feeling fresh. I was not disappointed in any way with the product and will purchase it again unless I die in the interim.</li>
            <li> Great quality toothpaste that actually tastes and looks like something from the bee hive. Helped to calm swollen and abscess gums.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I decided this toothpaste was just what I needed.  I was right!  My gums and teeth are happier than they&#x27;ve been in a long time.  No more sensitivity or soreness in my tender (almost 70-year-old) mouth.  Thank you Bees!</li>
