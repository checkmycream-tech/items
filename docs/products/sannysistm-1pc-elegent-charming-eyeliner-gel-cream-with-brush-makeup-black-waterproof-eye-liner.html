    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s elegant!!!</li>
            <li>Do not buy it barley works but good condition</li>
            <li>good quality, just wont go pass a month.</li>
            <li>came exactly as promised I am a happy customer !!!</li>
            <li>Its lighter and comes off very easily</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say the most, 8 hrs.</li>
            <li>What more do you want???</li>
            <li>it smears so easily</li>
            <li>It is not like water proof, it is fine.</li>
            <li>I love this product it is awesome,unlike liquid eyeliners that are going to go on however dark or light they want with the first application, this you have your brush and can level it out and get your perfect color you want.</li>
            <li>goes on well but does not stay on well at all, brush appears to be used and is cheap</li>
            <li>I thought it was cheap.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure the brush is horse hair</li>
            <li>Other then that the gel itself is great and could easily be mistaken for EyeStudio gel in look and application.</li>
            <li>and since this is more of a creamy product rather than liquid when it dries it looks smooth and neet rather then like some liquid eyeliners that look dry and get crackley...</li>
            <li>It was an overall good product better than expected</li>
            <li>Ok, the gel is fantastic, only disappointing thing is that the brush isn&#x27;t the greatest.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the formula is not waterproof.</li>
            <li>The brush that it comes with is huge and obviously not for eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It really was tacky all day making my lids feel sticky, and smudging oh my gosh</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not water proof and it is very oily...</li>
            <li>love it very soft black cream</li>
            <li>first of all its almost sheer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay straight for long.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it is very chalky, the brush it comes with is too thick and the bristles are cheap and uneven.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s just like black tar or oil in a tiny tube w a tiny brush.  </li>
            <li> And the only other thing is, I can&#x27;t wear it all day because it eventually gets into my eyes and makes them water.</li>
            <li> The product is fair, but the brush is horrible.</li>
            <li> But not even and hour after I had a black ring around my eye</li>
            <li> I wasted my money &amp; time...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product...</li>
            <li> The liquid was dried up upon arrival, never even got to use this product.</li>
            <li> The brush is useless and the eyeliner itself is like rubbing actual grease across your eyelids.</li>
            <li> Really small</li>
            <li> its way too small</li>
            <li> This product sucks...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good...</li>
            <li> Terrible purchase, not worth a dime.</li>
            <li> and I hate it</li>
            <li> Worst eye liner ever, it&#x27;s the smears everywhere</li>
            <li> it was terrible to take care of throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It was a terrible purchase.</li>

            <li> It is not like water proof, it is fine.</li>
            <li> This is trash... It&#x27;s not good... I wasted my money &amp; time... When you use there is smaude stains all over your eyes.. &amp; flows to your nose. Smh this is wickedness</li>
            <li> Do not buy it barley works but good condition</li>
            <li> Only gave 4/5 stars because the brush it comes with it impractical for gel application. Other then that the gel itself is great and could easily be mistaken for EyeStudio gel in look and application. And for this price?? What more do you want???</li>
            <li> its way too small but then so was the price. good quality, just wont go pass a month.</li>
            <li> It really was tacky all day making my lids feel sticky, and smudging oh my gosh it was terrible to take care of throughout the day. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product...</li>
            <li> It was a poorly made brush and extremely cheap eyeliner. When you put it on it smudges almost immediately. It was a terrible purchase.</li>
            <li> This product sucks... I got it to wear for like when u hang out with freinds or for summer... The day I got it I put it on to try it out and wear it for the day. But not even and hour after I had a black ring around my eye and I don&#x27;t even know how...it&#x27;s not water proof and it is very oily... The brush that it comes with is huge and obviously not for eyeliner. Do NOT buy this you will waiste your money!!!</li>
            <li> The liquid was dried up upon arrival, never even got to use this product. You get what you pay for on this one</li>
            <li> if it had no stars that&#x27;s what I would give this product.  &#x27;elegent&#x27;? NO it&#x27;s elegant!!! smh.... this thing claims to be water proof etc.... first of all its almost sheer. it smears so easily and it&#x27;s just like black tar or oil in a tiny tube w a tiny brush.  DO NOT BUY THIS RUBBISH!!!!</li>
