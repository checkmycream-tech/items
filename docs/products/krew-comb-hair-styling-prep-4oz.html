            <li>Great product to hold your hair from moving, just like it said.</li>
            <li>Great product, he has been using hair wax for years.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>If you want it a bit thicker just leave the lid off for a day or two which thickens it up nicely!  </li>
            <li>It is a good product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing without having to be like glue like others are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and found it to be the absolute best for getting your hair to stand at attention.</li>
            <li>so it is that kind of a shop.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he liked it.</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for a flat top!</li>
            <li>My dad loves this for his crew cut top.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff for my quickweaves.</li>
            <li>Now have to buy more from someone else.</li>
            <li>Best hair product for short spiked styles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ideal for making a flat top or crew cut stand up, and lends itself well to the &#x27;bed head&#x27; look.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the right stuff to keep my husband&#x27;s hair looking great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>it washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic hold.</li>
            <li>Great for Flat Tops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also washes off your hands cleanly after you have finished rubbing it through your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scentless and washes out with shampoo pretty easily, but without shampooing it can build up in your hair.  </li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t sticky, blends into blonde hair and holds nicely.  </li>
            <li>it has a medium hold and gives the hair a nice shine when i run my flat iron over it.</li>
            <li>fast and secure shipping Thanks A++++</li>
            <li>Krew Comb is ideal for Flat Tops, butches, or pretty much any short hairstyle that requires standing up.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried so many newer products on the market, but they don&#x27;t compare to this old classic.  </li>
            <li>Anyone with a short hair style would be satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I always try to make sure I&#x27;ve got Krew Comb in my bathroom cupboard for when I&#x27;m wearing my hair short (crew-cut or flat-top style).  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for use with long hair, but for short styles that don&#x27;t need movement, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>When I got my first flat top haircut this was recommended to me.</li>
            <li>My hair looks the same for over 24 hours...cheap and easy..</li>
            <li>Krew Comb, on the other hand, has a light, clean, soap-like fragrance...not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Great product that is not available in traditional places any longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this Amazon, since it can&#x27;t be found in stores.</li>
            <li>If you have an old school flat top this product is a must.</li>
            <li>I first found this in a old fashion barber shop I use to go to, even as a kid</li>
            <li>Little hard to wash out but still excellent product for hair control.</li>
            <li>less seems better.</li>
            <li>Next, brush that flat top to a verticle.</li>
            <li>Only way to do a proper flat top!</li>
            <li>I have been using Krew Comb since the early 90&#x27;s with a flat top and various short cuts.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day long and holds it better than any other product.</li>
            <li>Krew Comb doesn&#x27;t dry like a gel, it&#x27;s dense and makes the hair kind of stiff but still flexible.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and last all day.</li>
            <li>it allows the hair to blend seamlessly.</li>
            <li>it gives a natural look.</li>
            <li>Unlike butch wax and some pomades which are often heavy, sticky and hard to shampoo out of your hair, Krew Comb has a light, creme-like texture that easily shampoos out every time you shower.  </li>
            <li>There are periods I totally get away from those styles and wear my hair longer, so I can tell you the stuff doesn&#x27;t go bad; the last tub I bought was probably about 6 years ago, and I recall I had to buy it from a beauty supply place, so glad it&#x27;s available here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My hair pretty well stays in place all day without looking oily or heavy...</li>

            <li> Does not hold sides flat as expected.</li>
            <li> After showering and towel drying my hair I will brush it in place and then finish dressing....which allows the hair to partially dry....</li>
            <li> To get a \\&quot;spiking\\&quot; effect, you can put a little extra on the tips of your fingers and rub through the ends.</li>
            <li> It has a pink colour in the jar, but when applied to the hair, it is not detectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those who&#x27;ve never used it, it&#x27;s a pink paste, about the color of Pepto Bismol and the consistency of a paste car wax.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To use, simply rub a small amount between your palms, then rub in through damp hair.  </li>
            <li> I wet my hair, apply a little product, and then spray...</li>
            <li> I then take a dab, maybe just less than the size of a pencil eraser and rub it into my hands and then thoroughly into my hair and brush.</li>
            <li> not quite as stiff as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay to be a well groomed man.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the spray, glue, gel etc and wanted something that would hold my hair in place but not give it an oily or wet look.</li>
            <li> I put a small bit (about the size of a pea) in my hands and rub them together, then run my hands through my hair.  </li>
            <li> A lot of hair products on the market today are very heavily perfumed.  </li>
            <li> it is not sticky, thick or doesnt leave behind any build-up.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Try it, you wont be sorry!</li>

            <li> I used to use this product when I was younger and was trying to find out again since I couldn&#x27;t find anything else that worked. This stuff is amazing without having to be like glue like others are. It doesn&#x27;t take much and last all day.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for years.  It&#x27;s perfect for his hair.  Was happy to find it again.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My barber recommend it</li>
            <li> Great product that is not available in traditional places any longer.</li>
            <li> We learned about this product when I changed barbers for my boys.  We&#x27;ve tried so many newer products on the market, but they don&#x27;t compare to this old classic.  It smells GREAT, isn&#x27;t sticky, blends into blonde hair and holds nicely.  I tried this also on my short pixie cut, but will continue to use my girly products.  Thanks for carrying this Amazon, since it can&#x27;t be found in stores.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this for his crew cut top.</li>

            <li> Only way to do a proper flat top!</li>
            <li> Great Product.  A little goes a LONG way.  Great for Flat Tops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying from my Barber though.  He only charges me $5.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen (and ladies?)! I&#x27;ve used this product for years and found it to be the absolute best for getting your hair to stand at attention. If you have an old school flat top this product is a must. It&#x27;s easy to use and does what it needs to do. Apply some to the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and put rub it in your hair. Next, brush that flat top to a verticle. Be warned! The chicks won&#x27;t leave you alone! It&#x27;s a small price to pay to be a well groomed man.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff for my quickweaves. it has a medium hold and gives the hair a nice shine when i run my flat iron over it. it allows the hair to blend seamlessly. it is not sticky, thick or doesnt leave behind any build-up. good stuff!</li>
            <li> I use this product sparingly on med length hair. I was tired of the spray, glue, gel etc and wanted something that would hold my hair in place but not give it an oily or wet look. After showering and towel drying my hair I will brush it in place and then finish dressing....which allows the hair to partially dry....say 75% or so...I then take a dab, maybe just less than the size of a pencil eraser and rub it into my hands and then thoroughly into my hair and brush. My hair pretty well stays in place all day without looking oily or heavy...it gives a natural look. I caution that you must experiment with the amount....less seems better.</li>
            <li> Product works great on my sons hair.</li>
            <li> my brother in law was very happy</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 60 years.  It is a good product.  Anyone with a short hair style would be satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It is exactly the right stuff to keep my husband&#x27;s hair looking great.  He&#x27;s bought it from barbershops, but Amazon price and convenience win out from now on.</li>
            <li> Sorry but this product don&#x27;t work to me, I think work to me but no, I don&#x27;t like but I will stay with the product</li>
            <li> Barbers cannot be without this.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for a flat top! Best product I&#x27;ve tried. Lasts all day long and holds it better than any other product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Krew Comb since the early 90&#x27;s with a flat top and various short cuts. If you want it a bit thicker just leave the lid off for a day or two which thickens it up nicely!  Try it, you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> Ordered six tins. None of them are usable. Now have to buy more from someone else. Do yourself a favor and just buy from someone else</li>
            <li> excellent product and rec&#x27;d timely</li>
            <li> not quite as stiff as I had hoped.  But I do like it.  it washes out easily.  Probably would not reorder</li>
            <li> Does not hold sides flat as expected.</li>
            <li> Best hair product for short spiked styles. A hurricane won&#x27;t move your hair!  Been using for 22 years.</li>
            <li> I always try to make sure I&#x27;ve got Krew Comb in my bathroom cupboard for when I&#x27;m wearing my hair short (crew-cut or flat-top style).  There are periods I totally get away from those styles and wear my hair longer, so I can tell you the stuff doesn&#x27;t go bad; the last tub I bought was probably about 6 years ago, and I recall I had to buy it from a beauty supply place, so glad it&#x27;s available here on Amazon.

It&#x27;s ideal for making a flat top or crew cut stand up, and lends itself well to the &#x27;bed head&#x27; look. You can brush it if you wish, but I can&#x27;t imagine trying to get a comb through it.  It&#x27;s scentless and washes out with shampoo pretty easily, but without shampooing it can build up in your hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for use with long hair, but for short styles that don&#x27;t need movement, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I first found this in a old fashion barber shop I use to go to, even as a kid it was the same barbers so it is that kind of a shop. When I got my first flat top haircut this was recommended to me. Love it, Love it! Have used it ever since and that was over twenty years ago.</li>
            <li> fast and secure shipping Thanks A++++</li>
            <li> Great product to hold your hair from moving, just like it said. Little hard to wash out but still excellent product for hair control.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he liked it. Great product, he has been using hair wax for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since 1992, just over 20 years. If you have a short haircut, it is a must. I wet my hair, apply a little product, and then spray...My hair looks the same for over 24 hours...cheap and easy..I will be ordering this until I am in my 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Fantastic hold. This stuff comes out when you wash your hair, and even without washing I don&#x27;t find that it &amp;#34;waxes&amp;#34; by pillowcase and sheets.</li>
