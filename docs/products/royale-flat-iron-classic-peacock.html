            <li>The design is beautiful and it&#x27;s truly an amazing flat iron.</li>
            <li>I got a much better value by ordering online but they are worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved Royale flat irons since the day I was tricked into buying one at the mall for more than I should have paid.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair look, a huge difference from my old straightener!</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because this flat iron is really good.</li>
            <li>this will be my new favorite straightner it leaves my hair silky and shiny no complaints</li>
            <li>It did not look new but works ok</li>
            <li>Did not like it did not straighten as good as I thought it would made my hair very dry</li>
            <li>My first one still works after 3 years but I dropped it and broke the plastic case</li>
            <li>I was considering going to the mall to buy a $200 straightener but found this first.  </li>
            <li>They refused to do anything about it..said I should have opened the box and checked it first (as he always did with his purchases).  </li>
            <li>They can stop fighting over the first one I bought them to share.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to catch and tear my hair, but I changed my technique and set the temperature higher</li>
            <li>My first one lasted for over a year before I dropped it and one of the plates broke.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>The tip of it gets EXTREMELY hot and will really put a burn on your fingertip.</li>
            <li>i love this flat iron so much.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the mall guys had me almost ready to plop down $250 before I decided to check with Amazon, so I guess I should be glad I got it fro the right price.</li>
            <li>so now the iron wiggles too much.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfactory service.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It really works well for my hair.</li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and i really wanted it but</li>
            <li>Have to be careful as it can easily break</li>
            <li>It also helps keep your hair straight longer than with any other kind of flat iron.</li>
            <li>Just priced way too high.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot almost instantly, and retains the temperature throughout the whole process.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t 100 % satisfied but waited to long to send back.</li>
            <li>It appears to be the exact thing they sell in the malls for a lot less money.  </li>

            <li> This is my second Royale flat iron.</li>
            <li> My niece purchased a set of these flat irons from a kiosk in the mall.  </li>
            <li> I saw this flat iron at the mall.</li>
            <li> at the mall is cost 350$ i came online and  brought it for 37$ the flat iron</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and never have to wait for the flat iron to get hot between sections of hair like other straighteners.  </li>
            <li> and I may even venture to try it on wet hair someday; but am not happy that it was listed as new when the seal on the package had clearly been opened  and the envelope for the instructional dvd is torn open.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair and this leaves my hair silky straight in record time.</li>
            <li> It was heavy duty, had the adjustable temperature gage, and did straighten my hair after several passes.  </li>
            <li> It works, however not like the one at those little center things in the mall.</li>
            <li> I bought in the mall for half the price</li>
            <li> came less then a week</li>
            <li> And was delivered before expected date!!!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how well this product will work for those with thick hair.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> You know how women are they hate to share with the price it was easier to have two of these items.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works as good as the Royal I bought in the mall for half the price</li>
            <li> This is my second Royale flat iron. My first one still works after 3 years but I dropped it and broke the plastic case so now the iron wiggles too much. Dropping and braking is not covered in the warrenty. Love this company love there products.</li>
            <li> I was considering going to the mall to buy a $200 straightener but found this first.  I am extremely satisfied with the flat iron.  It gets hot almost instantly, and retains the temperature throughout the whole process.  I have thick hair and never have to wait for the flat iron to get hot between sections of hair like other straighteners.

            <li> Works well! And was delivered before expected date!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfactory service.  I purchased from this company and the irons were warped.  They refused to do anything about it..said I should have opened the box and checked it first (as he always did with his purchases).  This is purchasing in person...online there is no warranty and according to the salesman there is no money back policy at all.</li>
            <li> love it better than a ghd</li>
            <li> loved it works great this will be my new favorite straightner it leaves my hair silky and shiny no complaints just buy it</li>
            <li> This was better made than another one I purchased at amazon.  It was heavy duty, had the adjustable temperature gage, and did straighten my hair after several passes.  The problem, the one at the mall straightened my hair in one pass, not several.  The ceramic plates were sticking to my hair, causing my hair to snag and break.  Decided to return it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  Just priced way too high.  Have to be careful as it can easily break which is why I ended up buying this one.</li>
            <li> The cost was great now my wife and Daughter both have their own. They can stop fighting over the first one I bought them to share. You know how women are they hate to share with the price it was easier to have two of these items. Thanks</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because this flat iron is really good. It really works well for my hair. I like the way it makes my hair looks and feel.</li>
            <li> Its works really wells and heats in about 30 seconds. It also helps keep your hair straight longer than with any other kind of flat iron.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter. She had seen one at the mall and wanted it, so I started researching it and found this one. It was just like the one at the mall but much cheaper. She is very happy with it. Thanks</li>
            <li> have to purchase this. im picky about irons and this one is a must  works great with all hair types</li>
            <li> I really do like this product-it does a wonderful job and I may even venture to try it on wet hair someday; but am not happy that it was listed as new when the seal on the package had clearly been opened  and the envelope for the instructional dvd is torn open. Nonetheless, the mall guys had me almost ready to plop down $250 before I decided to check with Amazon, so I guess I should be glad I got it fro the right price. BTW- I got the Royale comb for $25 that they use and push for $40, thinking I had gotten a bargain until I saw it on Amazon for $7.95. Oh well, I know where to look next time.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I think it works as good as the demo they do in the malls.  It appears to be the exact thing they sell in the malls for a lot less money.  The color is also gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Did not like it did not straighten as good as I thought it would made my hair very dry would not recommend buying</li>
            <li> I got this within about a week after I ordered it. At first it seemed to catch and tear my hair, but I changed my technique and set the temperature higher and my problem was solved. I love how it makes my hair look, a huge difference from my old straightener! For reference, I have very thin hair so I don&#x27;t know how well this product will work for those with thick hair.</li>
            <li> My niece purchased a set of these flat irons from a kiosk in the mall.  I had to buy my own after borrowing hers!  I got a much better value by ordering online but they are worth the money.  They actually deliver the results advertised.  They straighten, curl, and remove frizz all while leaving hair shiny!  I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> It did not look new but works ok</li>
            <li> Wife loves it works great best flat iron!</li>
            <li> Same as the mall for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Royale flat irons since the day I was tricked into buying one at the mall for more than I should have paid. My first one lasted for over a year before I dropped it and one of the plates broke. It would then pull my hair... bought this one about two months ago and I love it! The design is beautiful and it&#x27;s truly an amazing flat iron. I have very long and thick hair and this leaves my hair silky straight in record time.</li>
            <li> Love it using it with no complains</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t 100 % satisfied but waited to long to send back. It works, however not like the one at those little center things in the mall. The tip of it gets EXTREMELY hot and will really put a burn on your fingertip.</li>
            <li> I saw this flat iron at the mall. and i really wanted it but at the mall is cost 350$ i came online and  brought it for 37$ the flat iron came less then a week and it works just like the one in the mall . one difference is the one I got online looks better then the one in the mall i love this flat iron so much.</li>
