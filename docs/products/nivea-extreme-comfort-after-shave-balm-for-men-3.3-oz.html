            <li>This does exactly that.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Since then I have found the product that I should have gotten ino the first place.</li>
            <li>This does a nice job healing all those would-be red splotches where the sensitive skin tends to complain after a shave.</li>
            <li>and this is the first that really knocks it out.  </li>
            <li>It has a similar pleasant subtle smell like my most used product, Nivea Replenishing</li>
            <li>Very soothing and cooling on the skin.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is very subdued so it doesn&#x27;t bowl you over.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for a problem with razor bumps and irritation. Very soothing and cooling on the skin. Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ...after your daily duel with a razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a dedicated blade shaver, you know that some days are better than others when it comes to the battle between face and razor (especially during the winter or in dry climates). Especially on those days when your face is begging for relief, this product is an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispenses easily in controlled amounts from the squeezable container. Very mildy scented, it offers relief to your razor-ravaged face without being greasy, without burning. It is very mildly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long-time user of another [[ASIN:B00008PC1W Nivea after shave product]]. The Extreme Comfort offering may have the edge because of its plastic container (instead of glass) and easily controlled dispensing.</li>
            <li> This particular product (High Performance - Shave Balm) isn&#x27;t sold everywhere. I prefer my husband to where this after-shave rather than cologne. LOVE the smell. Product was new as described. Shipping was a little late but no big deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this after looking for a calm and nice smelling post shave balm to use on my face. This does exactly that. I find that I get no irritation later in the day or any kind of burn feeling (sometimes I would get this from changing the blades) when I use this product.    This has a great, light, smell. It does NOT smell like a old mans cologne or aftershave at all, in fact if that is the smell you are going for - this is not the product for you.    I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> My son was getting rashes on his face after shaving. I looked on Amazon, found this balm that had very good reviews and decided to try it. My son says it has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Very good, I recommend everyone to try it! Clears irritated skin and gives a smooth feeling after shave. In addition, price is very low when compared to producst of the same kind.</li>
            <li> I hate aftershave almost as much as I hate razorburn.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of aftershaves and creams to minimize this and this is the first that really knocks it out.  This immediately soothes my irritated skin without any of the burn I became accustomed to</li>
            <li> This is an Excelent Product...Great Aftershave Balm!    But it is to expensive, if you compared with others   Nivea Balm, for the same price you can get 4 Packs instead of 3:    http://www.amazon.com/Nivea-Sensitive-Soothing-3-3-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B000FKJPII/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_hpc_4    Also found to difficult to open...</li>
            <li> This does a nice job healing all those would-be red splotches where the sensitive skin tends to complain after a shave. It has a nice modern refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> this product did nothing to relieve the pain burning irritation. I wound up using just plain old petroleum jelly. Since then I have found the product that I should have gotten ino the first place. Only problem is it is very expensive. George F Trumpet skin food.</li>
            <li> this product is great on sensitive skin.  the fragrance is very subdued so it doesn&#x27;t bowl you over.  we&#x27;re both happy!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive-dry face skin,thick beard and need shave all the days.I used all the type of Nivea aftershave.After comparing,the best that worked on my face is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;NIVEA EXTREME COMFORT\\&quot; this is a clear green balm whitout smell,after the early morning shave i apply a small quantity in my face and neck,(you dont need use too much)in a short time the burning sensation gradually disappears,my face feels smooth and relaxed.Do not let dry or cracked skin like other products,is completely absorbed,without leaving oily face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;NIVEA Q10 DOUBLE ACTION BALM is another option to consider,with a similar effect on your face,whit the plus this have coenzime Q10 that moisturizes your face after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,YOU CANT GO WRONG WHIT THIS!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used, don&#x27;t be fooled by other Nivea aftershaves.  This one is the king.  I live in the harsh dry-heat of arizona so this really helps.  The fragrance it has is unnecessary but goes away after a while.  It seems Nivea is phasing this one out because i no longer see it in stores.  Also, the last time i bought it came in a white squeezable plastic bottle w/o a box.  I&#x27;m not sure if this one is glass or not like some of the new ones.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  The smell is very muted, but very pleasant and I like that.  It feels good on your face after a shave and leaves your skin feeling refreshed.  I will keep using this product unless Nivea comes out with a better one.</li>
            <li> NIVEA HIGH PERFORMANCE--EXTREME COMFORT IS THE BEST AFTER SHAVE MY HUSBAND HAS EVER USED, HOWEVER VERY FEW STORES STILL CARRY IT ON THEIR SHELVES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY? WOULD LIKE TO FIND IT AT EITHER  CVS, RITE-AID WALMART OR TARGET STORES.</li>
            <li> After an aggressive shave with some rash maybe a nick or two. Slide a wet alum block over you damp face to close things up and let dry for a minute or two. Now a nice refreshing cold water rinse, pat dry and put on a liberal amount of  Nivea Extreme Comfort After Shave Balm for Men.&lt;br /&gt;What a great healing pleasant feeling, I love it. I don&#x27;t use  Nivea Extreme after every shave, just the rough ones I have occasionally. It has a similar pleasant subtle smell like my most used product, Nivea Replenishing After Shave Balm. Pros: Feels great after it&#x27;s on, for those occasional aggressive shave you may get from time to time , nice pleasant subtle smell. Cons: Goes on more like lotion than a aftershave balm.</li>
            <li> This cream is really nice, and it treats even broken or cut skin with no sting.  The scent is very light.</li>
            <li> I bought this on recommendation and I love the smell! My husband loves it too and now it&#x27;s all he uses.</li>
            <li> The smell is...offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as though my grandfather got up this morning to shave, but instead, chugged a quart of old spice, wretched the entire contents of his stomach into a small plastic bottle, and labeled the concoction &amp;#34;Nivea: For Men&amp;#34;. Did I mention grampy&#x27;s been dead and buried for 8 years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The generous binary star rating is only for the fact that this product does indeed add moisture to my skin. The trade off is not worth it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh god, that odor rivals the climax of my worst fever dreams. I may actually bring up the half digested Korean BBQ I had for lunch and smear it across my face in a futile attempt at reducing this violent aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just...don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I just picked this up at Wally World for around $6-7 just to try it out.  This stuff is amazing.  After you shave, you apply about the amount of your pinky nail on your face and instantly a warming sensation envelops over your skin and it&#x27;s very relaxing.      It has a nice, subtle scent and leaves your skin moisturized and very smooth.  I approve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it is so different, but it&#x27;s flat out the nicest stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of the Nivea and Gillette and Art of Shaving balm&#x27;s among others and none provides the quality of this stuff. No burning, good moisture and feel, pleasant mild scent etc.  Comfort really is the best word for it, your face just feels pleasant after it. Much better than anything else I&#x27;ve found by a significant margin.</li>
            <li> Just a face lotion, I bought every different Nivea aftershave to try them out and compare which one I liked the best. They are all just face lotions that smell different except for the replenishing balm (original or sensitive). I prefer the replenishing balm hands down, it feels more like and aftershave.</li>
            <li> Best for a heavy handed shaver... I love it.</li>
            <li> Nivea extreme comfort after shave balm for men is really one of the best after shave I  have ever used .</li>
