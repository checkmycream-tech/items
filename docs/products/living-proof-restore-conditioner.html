    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Restore is an excellent formula for those with severely damaged tresses, either from coloring or heat styling.  </li>
            <li>One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Best Hair product out there!</li>
            <li>This is the best!</li>
            <li>Very good conditioner for dry/damaged/chemically treated (or just over-stressed) hair.  </li>
            <li>Great conditioner, kepps</li>
            <li>Smells great, too.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li>Great for color treated hair</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Always makes my look great.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and this together are amazing!</li>
            <li>I guess my hair is in better condition than I thought it was, lol!  </li>
            <li>This is great and I love it!</li>
            <li>but I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>I truly do LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very good at holding your damaged hair cuticle together, which makes it look shiny and smooth, more like uncolored virgin hair.  </li>
            <li>Am extremely happy with both my purchase and the company that filled the order.</li>
            <li>I gave this shampoo and conditioner a try after reading many reviews (I have a separate review for the shampoo).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this conditioner four stars because it truly does work and is the perfect formula for those whose strands need extra TLC.  </li>
            <li>you are better off buying Pantene.</li>
            <li>Well, this is all it claims to be and MORE.</li>
            <li>This is outstanding.</li>
            <li>love all living proof products</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I subsequently tried the Perfect Hair Day formula and finally found the perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>excellent for dry or frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Great line for soft, healthy and shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair was not any better than cheap conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t have strong smells either.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using the Restore Shampoo/Conditioner, I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo &amp; conditioner is absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>only Con: it is pricy, more than was accustomed to spending, but worth it if you want great hair.</li>
            <li>And so it is very much worth it!</li>
            <li>I originally orderd the try me size to see if I like it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have over processe d hair, and this is the first product that leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy,</li>
            <li>I still have some Restore s/c left and will gladly use it up when I feel my hair has been abused more than usual, but I am a true convert to Perfect Hair Day.  </li>
            <li>and I can testify that it&#x27;s true).  </li>
            <li>So it is safe to say it is very overprocessed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not the right fit for me.</li>
            <li>Discovered this, and while it seems like a strong citrusy smell, it rinses out mostly, leaving a pleasant, low key orange smell.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I  have found for my hair type:  dry, brittle, wild, colored, pretty much ruined.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price tag if you really need the hair help!  </li>
            <li>certainly order again from this supplier!  </li>
            <li>I have gray, always dry hair, and used to pile on both rinseable conditioner and leave on conditioner, which made my hair sometimes less than wonderful.</li>
            <li>My hair is bouncy and light, soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>No Shine line first</li>
            <li>I can go nearly a week without shampooing, and keeping hair clean longer is one of the company&#x27;s claims (</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I think I may have used too much already.</li>
            <li>It really does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>Received quickly, very well priced, saved money .Will</li>
            <li>I received it in a timely manner and my purchase came in a cute pink resuable shopping bag.  </li>
            <li>It is still way to much money</li>
            <li>I love this and look forward to trying their other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to hear the product worked for other people</li>
            <li>I use it with regular grocery store shampoo, L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong Anti-Breakage shampoo, which is cheap, works great and is sulfate-free (it&#x27;s in a dark green tube).</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny again and looks so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and very shiny for about a week.</li>
            <li>My hair is color treated and I frequently use a curling iron</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>Every time I switch I am sorry, hair never looks as good with this stuff.</li>
            <li>initially, I thought the price point was high, as I wash my hair every day, and it is eight ounces.</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo for two weeks, as recommended by the company, and although it cured the dryness completely and took care of the frizz, my hair was rather limp and needed washing more often than I would have expected.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair look dry and damaged, did absolutely nothing to it.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and the ends are not dry at all.  </li>
            <li>is apparently not dry enough nor damaged enough to require this much of a &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>While it did make my hair feel soft and tangle free while wet, after blow drying and using a flat iron my hair looked and felt very dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair was fine the day after using Restore s/c, but the 2nd day, it was limp and by the 3rd it needed washing.  </li>
            <li>I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, because I&#x27;m kind of hooked on this brand.  </li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and packed extremely well, &amp;#</li>
            <li>I had my colored hair stripped of color to let my natural hair color (grey) grow in.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using conditioner on my hair because it is fine and thin.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like using conditioner on my hair because it is fine and thin.  </li>
            <li> but it held it together and made it look good enough to keep until I could grown it long enough to cut the bad off -</li>
            <li> and I found that the No Frizz Shampoo/Conditioner made my hair too flat</li>
            <li> It is definitely hard to justify such a high price tag but my post-natal hair needed it!  </li>
            <li> this did not completely repair the damage I had</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair which always looked dry, frizzy &amp; dull.</li>
            <li> and when it is dry, my hair has a noticeable shine.</li>
            <li> This made my hair so incredibly dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> and I finally broke down and bought the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> After giving birth to my son, my hair went from thick, luscious, shiny pregnant hair to wiry, thinning and dull.  </li>
            <li> I think what happened was this:  this conditioner (and the companion shampoo) are intended for very dry, damaged hair and my hair</li>
            <li> I think the Restore formula was simply too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I gave it about 4 tries and had to stop due to scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is extremely shiny &amp; and the curls are defined and not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so will probably this every other time I need shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> And because I live in Florida, the humidity and frizz made it even worse.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but a little goes a long way, and it helps improve the overall condition of the hair with multiple uses.</li>
            <li> This smooths my hair without weighing it down making it easier to style.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have silicates in it, which can weigh hair down and make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but a little goes a long way, and I use just this conditioner now.</li>
            <li> What I have learned though, is that I use a small dollop, about the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li> It gets dull a couple of weeks after processing and the ends get brittle.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Maybe just for a day or two, but at least I get a day or two of boost until I have to wash again  </li>
            <li> my thick wavy hair tamed.</li>
            <li> I may have order the wrong type for my hair, (I&#x27;m assuming that there are other types)</li>
            <li> I have tried everythingg, and I mean that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very confused by all of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Maybe worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I have ever used, left my hair almost sticky and lifeless with no conditioning elements whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It was so expensive</li>
            <li> my hair was burned bad at a salon - had it not been for this</li>
            <li> (it was BAD BAD BAD)</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to hate this</li>
            <li> This conditioner saved my hair after a particularly brutal hair-coloring experience.&lt;br /&gt;Check out my review under the Living Proof Restore Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shampoo is terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave this shampoo and conditioner a try after reading many reviews (I have a separate review for the shampoo).  Based on the price, this conditioner just did not meet my expectations.  While it did make my hair feel soft and tangle free while wet, after blow drying and using a flat iron my hair looked and felt very dry.  My conclusion is that this product just does not work for my hair but may work for someone else.</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and I frequently use a curling iron so dryness is always an issue.  My hair is medium textured, wavy and prone to frizz.  I used this shampoo for two weeks, as recommended by the company, and although it cured the dryness completely and took care of the frizz, my hair was rather limp and needed washing more often than I would have expected.  I think what happened was this:  this conditioner (and the companion shampoo) are intended for very dry, damaged hair and my hair is apparently not dry enough nor damaged enough to require this much of a &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;.  My hair was fine the day after using Restore s/c, but the 2nd day, it was limp and by the 3rd it needed washing.  I subsequently tried the Perfect Hair Day formula and finally found the perfect fit.  It hydrates just enough and totally eliminates my frizz without sacrificing body.  My hair is bouncy and light, soft and supple.  I think the Restore formula was simply too heavy.  I guess my hair is in better condition than I thought it was, lol!  I still have some Restore s/c left and will gladly use it up when I feel my hair has been abused more than usual, but I am a true convert to Perfect Hair Day.  I can go nearly a week without shampooing, and keeping hair clean longer is one of the company&#x27;s claims (and I can testify that it&#x27;s true).  Restore is an excellent formula for those with severely damaged tresses, either from coloring or heat styling.  Even those with breakage can definitely benefit.  I&#x27;m giving this conditioner four stars because it truly does work and is the perfect formula for those whose strands need extra TLC.  It&#x27;s just not the right fit for me.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, kepps my thick wavy hair tamed.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is terrible. Made my hair look dry and damaged, did absolutely nothing to it. Also over priced- you are better off buying Pantene.</li>
            <li> One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. This produce truly conditions your hair &amp; the results are noticeable all day. My hair is softer, stronger &amp; lusher. Smells great, too. A little of this product goes a long ways. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Hair was not any better than cheap conditioner.  Maybe worse.  Haven&#x27;t finished product.</li>
            <li> Wow. So I am a self professed conditioner addict. I have shoulder length highlighted hair. It gets dull a couple of weeks after processing and the ends get brittle. I read about Living Proof in several publications and became intrigued. Then I read an article about Jennifer Anniston using it and thought, what the heck. Well, this is all it claims to be and MORE. initially, I thought the price point was high, as I wash my hair every day, and it is eight ounces. What I have learned though, is that I use a small dollop, about the size of a quarter. The snarls come out in the shower (!!!) and when it is dry, my hair has a noticeable shine. I love this and look forward to trying their other products. This is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. This is great and I love it!</li>
            <li> This conditioner saved my hair after a particularly brutal hair-coloring experience.&lt;br /&gt;Check out my review under the Living Proof Restore Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything from Biolage, to Aveda, to Redken, and everything in between: NOTHING even came close to the results I got with Living Proof.</li>
            <li> I may have order the wrong type for my hair, (I&#x27;m assuming that there are other types) It made my hair oily and greasy feeling. Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, because I&#x27;m kind of hooked on this brand.  It makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> Best Hair product out there! I have tried everythingg, and I mean that. This is outstanding. Great for color treated hair</li>
            <li> Great line for soft, healthy and shiny hair.  Worth the price tag if you really need the hair help!  After giving birth to my son, my hair went from thick, luscious, shiny pregnant hair to wiry, thinning and dull.  And because I live in Florida, the humidity and frizz made it even worse.  After two weeks of using the Restore Shampoo/Conditioner, I noticed a huge difference.  My hair is soft and shiny again and looks so much healthier.  I had tried the Living Proof No Shine line first and I found that the No Frizz Shampoo/Conditioner made my hair too flat it lacked body. The Restore line fights my frizz while still maintaining the bounce and body. It is definitely hard to justify such a high price tag but my post-natal hair needed it!  And so it is very much worth it!</li>
            <li> love all living proof products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very confused by all of the other reviews. This made my hair so incredibly dry and tangled. I have waist length color treated hair and found this product completly unusable. I gave it about 4 tries and had to stop due to scalp irritation. I wish I could return it but I think I may have used too much already. I&#x27;m glad to hear the product worked for other people but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> excellent for dry or frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I have gray, always dry hair, and used to pile on both rinseable conditioner and leave on conditioner, which made my hair sometimes less than wonderful. I can&#x27;t have strong smells either. Discovered this, and while it seems like a strong citrusy smell, it rinses out mostly, leaving a pleasant, low key orange smell. Expensive, but a little goes a long way, and I use just this conditioner now. Leaves my hair soft and very shiny for about a week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using conditioner on my hair because it is fine and thin.  This smooths my hair without weighing it down making it easier to style.  I truly do LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Terrible! Worst shampoo I have ever used, left my hair almost sticky and lifeless with no conditioning elements whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I  have found for my hair type:  dry, brittle, wild, colored, pretty much ruined.  None of the products I brought from the beauty salon, drug store, grocery store, ever, ever, left my hair feeling this moisturized.  Even when I used the products that  my stylist recommended.  Then one day my nephews wife (who is a hair stylist) put on her facebook that this was &amp;#34;the bomb&amp;#34;.  So I purchased it.  It worked!  My hair feels silky and soft.  Maybe just for a day or two, but at least I get a day or two of boost until I have to wash again  Enuf said.</li>
            <li> I originally orderd the try me size to see if I like it. I have now ordered the 8oz size. This shampoo &amp; conditioner is absolutely fabulous. My hair looks so much better since I started using this product. It really does wonders for my hair. I have very curly hair which always looked dry, frizzy &amp; dull. Now my hair is extremely shiny &amp; and the curls are defined and not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I wold definately recommend. Shipment was fast and packed extremely well, &amp;#34;this Co. cares&amp;#34; and they always include a sample product, which is welcoming.&lt;br /&gt;The only Con: it is pricy, more than was accustomed to spending, but worth it if you want great hair.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.  My hairdresser used it and gave me a sample to take home.  After using the sample I just had to get it.  It is pricey.  But the comb just glides through my below-my-shoulders length hair after using.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Great product. Received quickly, very well priced, saved money .Will certainly order again from this supplier!  I have over processe d hair, and this is the first product that leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy,</li>
            <li> This product has restored my color treated hair.  It came from a company called AveYou.  I received it in a timely manner and my purchase came in a cute pink resuable shopping bag.  They also sent a 25.00 off 100.00 purchase.  Am extremely happy with both my purchase and the company that filled the order.</li>
            <li> I had my colored hair stripped of color to let my natural hair color (grey) grow in.  So it is safe to say it is very overprocessed.  This conditioner is very good at holding your damaged hair cuticle together, which makes it look shiny and smooth, more like uncolored virgin hair.  It doesn&#x27;t have silicates in it, which can weigh hair down and make it look greasy.  It is very expensive, but a little goes a long way.  I use it with regular grocery store shampoo, L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong Anti-Breakage shampoo, which is cheap, works great and is sulfate-free (it&#x27;s in a dark green tube).</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner for dry/damaged/chemically treated (or just over-stressed) hair.  It is expensive, but a little goes a long way, and it helps improve the overall condition of the hair with multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted. This is the best! The shampoo and this together are amazing!</li>
            <li> my hair was burned bad at a salon - had it not been for this I would have had to cut my hair all off - this did not completely repair the damage I had (it was BAD BAD BAD) but it held it together and made it look good enough to keep until I could grown it long enough to cut the bad off - I am thankful for it!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to hate this but I love it.  It was so expensive and I finally broke down and bought the shampoo and conditioner.  I was hoping it was not going to work.... but I loved it.  It made my hair so soft and the ends are not dry at all.  It is still way to much money so will probably this every other time I need shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Always makes my look great. Every time I switch I am sorry, hair never looks as good with this stuff.</li>
