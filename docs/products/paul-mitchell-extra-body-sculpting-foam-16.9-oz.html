            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this</li>
            <li>Just gathering it up into a ponytail was challenging.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair body booster.</li>
            <li>I love the product and would order from the company again.</li>
            <li>This foam defines my curls pretty good and works well in conjunction wight</li>
            <li>Gives a nice gently hold with my set and feels nice on the hair.....</li>
            <li>I was fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I have fine silvery hair</li>
            <li>The first one of these I ordered was damaged and Amazon sent me a replacement right away with no trouble, so excellent customer service amazon!</li>
            <li>Great extra help with blow-dryer.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nice, feels nice all day long</li>
            <li>It smells great and is not filled with alcohol.</li>
            <li>On Amazon, it is cheaper and comes right to my door!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left it looking exceptionally fat...which was great to have long droopy hair being totally plumped up.</li>
            <li>As you can see in the pics, I am a color treated natural and my color is just fine.</li>
            <li>Since then I have ised so many different ones</li>
            <li>has a pretty pi eapple smell also.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells really good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair too stiff but helps give it some body.</li>
            <li>The $21.59 current price including super saver shipping is about as reasonable as the price gets, but it is worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li>and I rememberd how much I used to like it</li>
            <li>I used it in conjunction with Keune Absolute Volume Karotin Volumizer.</li>
            <li>This product is one of the luxuries for myself that over the years has really become a necessity.  </li>
            <li>pun intended...to the regular foam with the red dispenser top.</li>
            <li>It really depends upon how often you shampoo your hair each week and how long your hair is as to whether this large size is economical.</li>
            <li>(I know, most grey hair becomes coarse...</li>
            <li>Teasing the crown and then TRYING to smooth it over was what has me turning awayfrom the extra body foam and going back to my roots...</li>
            <li>Every time I step away &amp; use another brand, I always wonder why I left Paul Mitchell in the first place.  </li>
            <li>My  hair still looks clean on the third day if for some reason I don&#x27;t wash it and blow it dry again.</li>
            <li>Also, because I have fairly short hair, the 16.9 ounce bottle can be too much for me to use up before</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair light and fluffy(even as a firm hold like this one).</li>
            <li>Be careful how much you push the lever -</li>
            <li>so you have to be careful not to press out too much from the dispenser.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t stand it in my extra fine somewhat thin hair.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have fine silvery hair (I know, most grey hair becomes coarse...mine didn&#x27;t)  I use this after washing and the style remains in for two days.  My  hair still looks clean on the third day if for some reason I don&#x27;t wash it and blow it dry again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a product that doesn&#x27;t give out after a few hours. This sculpting foam keeps my hair the way I want it for hours. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very little affect very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great extra help with blow-dryer.  Works well, without sticky feeling.  Be careful how much you push the lever - it expands quite a bit and you could be left with wasteful foam in your hand.</li>
            <li> The only one for my type of hair.  I get the volume I need without any stickiness.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but have to go to a salon or hair product company to purchase - too much trouble!  On Amazon, it is cheaper and comes right to my door!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it is the best hair mousse I have ever found.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your hair, and does not weigh hair down with heaviness.  Even my husband now uses this product!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li> I used this product many many uears ago and loved it then. Since then I have ised so many different ones but my hairdresser used this recently and I rememberd how much I used to like it......so now I am back to using it! Gives a nice gently hold with my set and feels nice on the hair.....has a pretty pi eapple smell also.</li>
            <li> Every time I step away &amp; use another brand, I always wonder why I left Paul Mitchell in the first place.  It really is the best out there,&amp; this foam is no exception. Makes my hair look fuller &amp; thicker &amp; no stickiness or yuckiness you find in similar products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this but I couldn&#x27;t stand it in my extra fine somewhat thin hair. It left it looking exceptionally fat...which was great to have long droopy hair being totally plumped up. However, there was the weirdest almost rubbery feeling to my hair that was EXTREMELY grabby. So much so that it was unbearablly difficult to style. Just gathering it up into a ponytail was challenging. Teasing the crown and then TRYING to smooth it over was what has me turning awayfrom the extra body foam and going back to my roots...pun intended...to the regular foam with the red dispenser top.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair too stiff but helps give it some body.</li>
            <li> The product was not as advertised and I was given no way to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it.  Makes my scalp itchy..  Should last a long time for those who buy it.  Very little creates lots of volume.</li>
            <li> Very good mousse. Holds my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair body booster. Perfect transaction. I love this product and so does my hair!</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, feels nice all day long and it keep my wondering very short hair in place.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. Item was delivered as described and in a timely manner</li>
            <li> My hairddresser used this product on me and I like it.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down yet it keeps it under control.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.  It still moves and looks natural without that stiff look.  It may even add body when used with a dryer and my hair looks fuller after blow drying.</li>
            <li> Good body. It makes a difference with my thin hair. I used it in conjunction with Keune Absolute Volume Karotin Volumizer.</li>
            <li> great product I have used this for years</li>
            <li> This product is one of the luxuries for myself that over the years has really become a necessity.  I have been using this product exclusively for over 15 years, no matter the cost.  The $21.59 current price including super saver shipping is about as reasonable as the price gets, but it is worth it to me.  My hair has always been thin, limp, dull and frizzy.  This foam does give my hair body, some shine and eliminates the frizzles.  There are a couple of things I have learned in using it, however.  Too much of a good thing will make my hair get oily faster, so I use it sparingly.  Also, because I have fairly short hair, the 16.9 ounce bottle can be too much for me to use up before the pressure in the can dissipates to the point that it will not dispense the product (takes about a year for this to happen).  It really depends upon how often you shampoo your hair each week and how long your hair is as to whether this large size is economical.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Lots of volume &amp; shine! Used it for over 5 years!</li>
            <li> The first one of these I ordered was damaged and Amazon sent me a replacement right away with no trouble, so excellent customer service amazon! I am a woman of color with natural thick curls and this foam mouse works very well on my hair. It leaves your hair light and fluffy(even as a firm hold like this one). It smells great and is not filled with alcohol. My only complaint is that the foam is very very loose so you have to be careful not to press out too much from the dispenser. This foam defines my curls pretty good and works well in conjunction wight he Paul mitchell extra body gel. I have no frizz. Don&#x27;t be afraid of the words &amp;#34;extra body&amp;#34; on this foam, it leaves your hair light and fluffy..NOT poofy. It does leave your hair with a slight crunch, but its very slight. As you can see in the pics, I am a color treated natural and my color is just fine. This product is a go!</li>
            <li> The product came in the mail prior the scheduled date. I was fast and in good condition. No leaking. I love the product and would order from the company again.</li>
