    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Tea Tree is the best.</li>
            <li>but it works great with no issues!</li>
            <li>Best conditioner on the planet!</li>
            <li>Excellent conditioner which helps my scalp psoriasis</li>
            <li>also works great for kids to keep lice away</li>
            <li>Not oily, but shiny, healthy and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a NGTTCC user for 6 years and for good reason.</li>
            <li>Its good shampoo.</li>
            <li>; the matching shampoo is even better!</li>
            <li>I love the scent - very refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is the best solution I have come across so far (aside from a prescription).</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>this is the best contiioner i&#x27;ve ever found especially for tangels in girls hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner itself is great, the bottle not so much.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair, smooth, clean, fragrant and silky!</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it so much, we already need more!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product at an Amish store in MI.</li>
            <li>Silicone-free, sulfate-free conditioner that smells good but is not overly sweet or fruity like other brands.</li>
            <li>I ordered this along with the shampoo, but conditioner I have ever used,  Keeps my scalp healthy and my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it because it actually helps with my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>This tea tree conditioner also doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like many other tea tree products - it&#x27;s pleasant and subtle.</li>
            <li>so I find it takes some 20-30 pumps to get enough to really condition lightly at all, and often need to get some more after starting.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t provide deep condtioning but does work to smooth hair a bit</li>
            <li>I think the tea tree oil really helps, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my scalp since.</li>
            <li>Work okay, leaves my hair a little dry/brittle.</li>
            <li>A very good conditioner, not loaded with artificial junk.</li>
            <li>We use this conditioner everyday and love it.  </li>
            <li>The larger bottle seemed useful, but honestly a smaller squeeze bottle will be much easier to deal with.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it had a little more mint and tea tree power for a tingly scalp as well.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp and have tried a variety of tea tree products.</li>
            <li>Her skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li>The pump squirts very little and gets clogged easily</li>
            <li>But Bottle came damaged with broken top.</li>
            <li>(mine is frizzy auburn that tends to be dry) and really does soothe dry, itchy scalp.  </li>

            <li> I have a sensitive scalp and have tried a variety of tea tree products. This is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve used.  A very good conditioner, not loaded with artificial junk.</li>
            <li> Work okay, leaves my hair a little dry/brittle.</li>
            <li> We use this conditioner everyday and love it.  It can be pretty thick and I find that adding a bit of water to it before putting it on my hair makes it go on easier.</li>
            <li> My thick curly and dry hair looooovesss this conditioner. Not oily, but shiny, healthy and smells delicious. Tea Tree is the best.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money, this conditioner did not do anything to my hair. My hair felt brittle and I couldn&#x27;t detangle it after I shampooed because it did not condition my hair. Very dissapointed</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t provide deep condtioning but does work to smooth hair a bit (mine is frizzy auburn that tends to be dry) and really does soothe dry, itchy scalp.  This tea tree conditioner also doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like many other tea tree products - it&#x27;s pleasant and subtle.</li>
            <li> I use this with the North Gate tea tree oil shampoo on my very thick, oily, wavy hair and it leaves it very shiny, manageable and soft.  Plus I can go an extra day if I need to without washing my hair as it helps control the oil.</li>
            <li> I get an EXTREME rash on my scalp near my neck (to the point that I have gone to the Dr.) This is the best solution I have come across so far (aside from a prescription). I am thinking it works so well because it isnt a bunch of chemicals. I will buy this from now on.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it so much, we already need more! Her skin is so sensitive so i was worried but it works great with no issues!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner on the planet!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product at an Amish store in MI. I absolutely love it because it actually helps with my psoriasis. It makes you so relaxed after you shower or bathe.</li>
            <li> this is the best contiioner i&#x27;ve ever found especially for tangels in girls hair. also works great for kids to keep lice away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a NGTTCC user for 6 years and for good reason. I have very dry scalp and this conditioner is the only product that calms my raging scalp. I love the scent - very refreshing. It does wonders on my hair as well.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair dry and stringy.</li>
            <li> Silicone-free, sulfate-free conditioner that smells good but is not overly sweet or fruity like other brands. I have been using this stuff since my scalp started getting red and flaky a few months back. I think the tea tree oil really helps, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my scalp since. And my hair is soft and shiny without being weighed down, too. My only wish is that it had a little more mint and tea tree power for a tingly scalp as well. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Terrible-my hair felt like straw after using this product.  My fault for straying from my Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo (which NEVER left my hair feeling so dry!).  If anything this MADE my scape itch.  I discarded this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with the shampoo, but conditioner I have ever used,  Keeps my scalp healthy and my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> left hair brittle and waxy</li>
            <li> Leaves hair, smooth, clean, fragrant and silky!</li>
            <li> Its good shampoo. But Bottle came damaged with broken top.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner which helps my scalp psoriasis; the matching shampoo is even better!</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is great, the bottle not so much. The pump squirts very little and gets clogged easily so I find it takes some 20-30 pumps to get enough to really condition lightly at all, and often need to get some more after starting. The larger bottle seemed useful, but honestly a smaller squeeze bottle will be much easier to deal with.</li>
