            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>the price is great.  </li>
            <li>I managed to floss all my teeth without breaking or stretching out the floss which was a great accomplishment.</li>
            <li>If you can find these for a couple bucks in the store they are a great alternative to Platypus flossers.</li>
            <li>:) Great deal!</li>
            <li>Two people in our household have braces and we&#x27;ve found Plackers to be the best way to floss easily, instead of threading floss through each tooth.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to having an easier way of flossing with braces, but just stick with the good ole floss threaders.</li>
            <li>perfect for cleaning my teeth and getting around my braces to ensure they are clean; convenient for taking with you anywhere</li>
            <li>Great, well-made product with great strong floss.</li>
            <li>My gums love love love these!!!!!</li>
            <li>VERY SATISFIED ...........</li>
            <li>$1.99 per pack is an awesome price and it arrived right away.  </li>
            <li>Never heard of this product before - I can&#x27;t believe more people with braces haven&#x27;t spread the word!  </li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I thought these would have a better design, thinner, but nope!</li>
            <li>They are costly, but are way better than using wire to floss!</li>
            <li>Nice flosser for those with braces.</li>
            <li>but this one works great when you don&#x27;t have time and need a quick floss.</li>
            <li>Was real excited when i bought these</li>
            <li>It is really good for a quick flossing, but I wouldn&#x27;t replace it for every flossing.  </li>
            <li>More orthodontists need to recommend these to their patients.</li>
            <li>My daughter tried these and said they work well, much better than Platypus which orthodontist gave us.  </li>
            <li>Best floss for braces, no need to weave floss with regular floss.</li>
            <li>tried these out and love them.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I love being able to floss with braces.  </li>
            <li>So, they are functional just not terribly durable.</li>
            <li>Love these for our patients.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I recommend it to everyone I know who has braces.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I found them.</li>
            <li>Awesome is the only word to describe these flossers.</li>
            <li>They really do work and are great for front teeth that have brackets.</li>
            <li>This is more than my third order, and these things have to be the best on earth for someone with braces!</li>
            <li>So happy to have found a reasonably priced flosser for braces.</li>
            <li>They also have a toothpick thingy on the tip to help with the removal of more debris.</li>
            <li>Best way to floss is to still use an actual floss with the floss threader</li>
            <li>So much better than threading the floss under every wire and between every tooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about the WaterPik as well and would love to give it a try at some point, but right now the SoftPick is the best cheaper alternative to flossing that I have found for my particular teeth and my particular braces.</li>
            <li>Works great for my 10 year old and his braces.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t easy to use with my braces as described.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and durable.  </li>
            <li>The floss frays rather easily.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and get in where they need to be to get food particles out.  </li>
            <li>These are just okay, but I felt I had to use too many to get the job done right.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, great value, my son uses them daily and prefers these to all the other Braces cleaners.  </li>
            <li>They are also a slimmer design and work just fine if you don&#x27;t have braces.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be good for quick &#x27;touch ups&#x27; but there is too much slack on the floss</li>
            <li>BUT again I think the plastic part that goes between the braces wire &amp; tooth could be smaller and the product still work great.</li>
            <li>After looking and finding nothing I saw one pack of these left at Walmart and they worked great.</li>
            <li>the flossers don&#x27;t fit underneath the brace wire</li>
            <li>In some places, my brackets were too close together for me to fit the plastic part in between them</li>
            <li>These flossers certainly fit the bill in that regard.  </li>
            <li>great - Dentist couldn&#x27;t praise him enough.  </li>
            <li>but they do nit fit between the brace wire and the tooth.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I bought these from Walgreens and they accepted my return and promptly refunded my money.</li>
            <li>Although these have a slim edge to fit between braces, it doesnt fit between all of mine.  </li>
            <li>I tried to buy them from you first!!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll probably use them just not when I first get a tightening!!</li>
            <li>The toothpick on the end is decent and it&#x27;s a nice touch</li>
            <li>and keep it clean until you need to use it.</li>
            <li>My daughter keeps her teach clean, and they don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>It feels like I&#x27;m rubbing a gummy bear over my gumline, but it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be able to dislodge any food between my teeth OR braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reviews seemed alright but after using these I&#x27;ve determined that they work perfect (at least for my braces).</li>
            <li>Before I had braces I used non-braces specific floss sticks and those would often break or split before I was done flossing but the quality on these is superior</li>
            <li>Best flossers for braces, hands down!!!</li>
            <li>Flossers work great with my sons braces, and so much better than the string floss with the hard end to thread it through.  </li>
            <li>They are so convenient to carry around and make quick work of flossing.</li>
            <li>The ortho gave us a sample pack of these, and they worked perfectly for her on every wire space upper and lower, front and back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like they were never practically tested them with real modern braces.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Platypus wins by a slight margin in that they seem to fit better in between my braces.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would have been as disciplined using regular floss since it is so much more of a pain.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t have a lot of space to work with, you&#x27;d be better off with a traditional floss threader.</li>
            <li>I feel so fresh with these on hand and ready to eat anything.</li>
            <li>They are okay in my opinion if your only going after a couple of teeth.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing with braces so much easier!  </li>
            <li>Flossing with braces is so much easier with these!</li>
            <li>Wish I would have thought of it in the first place.</li>
            <li>very dissappointing!</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they are supposed to and</li>
            <li>In a couple places, I was able to get the flosser under the wire but could not pull it back out without the &amp;#34;knot&amp;#34; of floss catching on and plucking the wire... not very comfortable for me</li>
            <li>The price with free shipping from Amazon made shopping super simple, and so much cheaper than Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Used together with regular brushing and my teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>I have Gotten braces again as an Adult and wanted something to quickly floss my teeth.</li>
            <li>These you pop in right behind the braces because the flat side fits perfectly and floss.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super soft and doesn&#x27;t really act like a pick.</li>
            <li>Only a couple of them (out of many packs over a year and a half of having braces) broke, so I am pleased also with the quality.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal, it is too hard to find these in the store to purchase.</li>
            <li>My son is very grateful to have these.</li>
            <li>Floss is very durable.</li>
            <li>I use a 2-3 flossers each time I floss all of my teeth just to keep from spreading around the bacteria, but these flossers really hold up.  </li>
            <li>I currently carry nimbus toothbrushes, travel pro-enamel toothpaste, TotalCare Listerene (Alcohol free) and some placker flossers.</li>
            <li>They are so much cheaper than the Platypus flossers.</li>
            <li>Some of the brackets were really close to one</li>
            <li>Work very well.  </li>
            <li>Only one spot where the flosser didn&#x27;t fit but could still use a threader for that area.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the space between your arch wire and tooth will dictate how much of the length of the floss can be used.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit between the braces to get proper flossing</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like that pressure</li>
            <li>but it still much easier than the alternative.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand for kids and adults with braces!  </li>
            <li>In other places, the wire was too close to my teeth to be able to squeeze the flosser underneath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s there for, honestly.</li>
            <li>This product is great and works for half the cost of other brands I&#x27;ve seen out there.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find ortho specific flossers, these are great.</li>
            <li>There is a tiny pouch in the bag where you can place 1 floss and this pouch can be placed on your wallet or purse for when you are out with your friend and you need a quick floss.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes when I got them for my braces.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who has a child with braces.</li>
            <li>I love these little things.  </li>
            <li>they take a little time to get used to since they do feel different from regular floss, but they seem to do a very good job of between-teeth cleaning, and even with my very crowded mouth there is only one pair of teeth</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay for shipping as you can find them on other websites with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I have small self ligating brackets, and the plastic arm that is supposed to fit between the wire and the tooth is too big to really fit on a lot of teeth.</li>
            <li>They make a huge difference and clean what brushing leaves behind, which leads to fresher breath.</li>
            <li>These make it easy and they are the strongest ones I&#x27;ve found - I use them a few nights before tossing them.</li>
            <li>I am only at month 3 of my first braces experience ever as an adult</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure not very good for my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is an extremely tight fit no matter</li>
            <li>These really helped me floss regularly while I had braces.</li>
            <li>I am an adult with braces and I have been using these since I got my metal mouth</li>
            <li>It did start to fray by the time I was 1/3rd of the way through, but didn&#x27;t completely break or get caught in my braces.  </li>
            <li>There is also some sort of pick thing on the other end which may or may not be useful, I use those teeny pipe cleaner brushes designed for cleaning around braces and teeth instead.</li>
            <li>so it was difficult to use these with some of them, but overall, I really liked them!</li>
            <li>They actually fit behind my braces and make my teeth feel like I really am flossing them!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a dozen or so brands sold in your typical brick and mortar store with the same design that won&#x27;t fit in between the bar and the tooth.</li>
            <li>The gap between the wire and her teeth was to small for the floss stick to fit through.</li>
            <li>and my teeth are very close to each other.</li>
            <li>It was very stressful for him to use the other method of flossing that the Ortho Dr. gave him.</li>
            <li>There are some teeth that you cannot use this with as they are too tight together (thus the braces), but the majority of the teeth get flossed pretty well.</li>
            <li>The description for this item says that it&#x27;s good for use with braces because one of the tines is supposed to be small enough to get behind the wire.  </li>

            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m rubbing a gummy bear over my gumline, but it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be able to dislodge any food between my teeth OR braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed alright but after using these I&#x27;ve determined that they work perfect (at least for my braces).</li>
            <li> Before I had braces I used non-braces specific floss sticks and those would often break or split before I was done flossing but the quality on these is superior</li>
            <li> Best flossers for braces, hands down!!!</li>
            <li> Flossers work great with my sons braces, and so much better than the string floss with the hard end to thread it through.  </li>
            <li> They are so convenient to carry around and make quick work of flossing.</li>
            <li> The ortho gave us a sample pack of these, and they worked perfectly for her on every wire space upper and lower, front and back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they were never practically tested them with real modern braces.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Platypus wins by a slight margin in that they seem to fit better in between my braces.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would have been as disciplined using regular floss since it is so much more of a pain.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t have a lot of space to work with, you&#x27;d be better off with a traditional floss threader.</li>
            <li> I feel so fresh with these on hand and ready to eat anything.</li>
            <li> They are okay in my opinion if your only going after a couple of teeth.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing with braces so much easier!  </li>
            <li> Flossing with braces is so much easier with these!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have thought of it in the first place.</li>
            <li> very dissappointing!</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they are supposed to and</li>
            <li> In a couple places, I was able to get the flosser under the wire but could not pull it back out without the &amp;#34;knot&amp;#34; of floss catching on and plucking the wire... not very comfortable for me</li>
            <li> The price with free shipping from Amazon made shopping super simple, and so much cheaper than Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Used together with regular brushing and my teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> I have Gotten braces again as an Adult and wanted something to quickly floss my teeth.</li>
            <li> These you pop in right behind the braces because the flat side fits perfectly and floss.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super soft and doesn&#x27;t really act like a pick.</li>
            <li> Only a couple of them (out of many packs over a year and a half of having braces) broke, so I am pleased also with the quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal, it is too hard to find these in the store to purchase.</li>
            <li> My son is very grateful to have these.</li>
            <li> Floss is very durable.</li>
            <li> I use a 2-3 flossers each time I floss all of my teeth just to keep from spreading around the bacteria, but these flossers really hold up.  </li>
            <li> I currently carry nimbus toothbrushes, travel pro-enamel toothpaste, TotalCare Listerene (Alcohol free) and some placker flossers.</li>
            <li> They are so much cheaper than the Platypus flossers.</li>
            <li> Some of the brackets were really close to one</li>
            <li> Work very well.  </li>
            <li> Only one spot where the flosser didn&#x27;t fit but could still use a threader for that area.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the space between your arch wire and tooth will dictate how much of the length of the floss can be used.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit between the braces to get proper flossing</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like that pressure</li>
            <li> but it still much easier than the alternative.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brand for kids and adults with braces!  </li>
            <li> In other places, the wire was too close to my teeth to be able to squeeze the flosser underneath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s there for, honestly.</li>
            <li> This product is great and works for half the cost of other brands I&#x27;ve seen out there.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find ortho specific flossers, these are great.</li>
            <li> There is a tiny pouch in the bag where you can place 1 floss and this pouch can be placed on your wallet or purse for when you are out with your friend and you need a quick floss.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I got them for my braces.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who has a child with braces.</li>
            <li> I love these little things.  </li>
            <li> they take a little time to get used to since they do feel different from regular floss, but they seem to do a very good job of between-teeth cleaning, and even with my very crowded mouth there is only one pair of teeth</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay for shipping as you can find them on other websites with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have small self ligating brackets, and the plastic arm that is supposed to fit between the wire and the tooth is too big to really fit on a lot of teeth.</li>
            <li> They make a huge difference and clean what brushing leaves behind, which leads to fresher breath.</li>
            <li> These make it easy and they are the strongest ones I&#x27;ve found - I use them a few nights before tossing them.</li>
            <li> I am only at month 3 of my first braces experience ever as an adult</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure not very good for my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is an extremely tight fit no matter</li>
            <li> These really helped me floss regularly while I had braces.</li>
            <li> I am an adult with braces and I have been using these since I got my metal mouth</li>
            <li> It did start to fray by the time I was 1/3rd of the way through, but didn&#x27;t completely break or get caught in my braces.  </li>
            <li> There is also some sort of pick thing on the other end which may or may not be useful, I use those teeny pipe cleaner brushes designed for cleaning around braces and teeth instead.</li>
            <li> so it was difficult to use these with some of them, but overall, I really liked them!</li>
            <li> They actually fit behind my braces and make my teeth feel like I really am flossing them!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a dozen or so brands sold in your typical brick and mortar store with the same design that won&#x27;t fit in between the bar and the tooth.</li>
            <li> The gap between the wire and her teeth was to small for the floss stick to fit through.</li>
            <li> and my teeth are very close to each other.</li>
            <li> It was very stressful for him to use the other method of flossing that the Ortho Dr. gave him.</li>
            <li> There are some teeth that you cannot use this with as they are too tight together (thus the braces), but the majority of the teeth get flossed pretty well.</li>
            <li> The description for this item says that it&#x27;s good for use with braces because one of the tines is supposed to be small enough to get behind the wire.  </li>
            <li> Took about half the time that using the threader floss normally does.  </li>
            <li> There are some similar items at the store or on amazon, but those don&#x27;t have that flat part which fits under the wire.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you have a very crowded mouth as I do, it doesn&#x27;t work very well practically.</li>
            <li> It is not appropriately advertised since I cannot floss on my braces and also the pick part is too soft!</li>
            <li> This less expensive version of same item just won&#x27;t fit between my wires and teeth.  </li>
            <li> Even worse, where it does fit, the slim side bends when trying to push the flosser in narrow gaps between teeth.</li>
            <li> Definitely cuts down on the time it takes to floss.</li>
            <li> The flossers work really well in the hard to reach spots!  </li>
            <li> The more expensive version has a thinner base and slips easily between.  </li>
            <li> floss head is a little to big for my braces, works but have to be careful not to pop my brackets.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to fit for some teeth</li>
            <li> Not very convenient.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not very crowded</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not much, so there&#x27;s no room to move the floss in or out, or maneuver it below the gumline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 different times over the period of 2 days; and I was unable to fit the plastic behind the brace wire on 7 of my 22 wired-spaces.</li>
            <li> However they are not as sturdy as some other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> the pick on the other end is too flexible for me</li>
            <li> Buy in bulk for an even greater value - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, this toothpick thingy is useless as it&#x27;s just too soft and flexible to actually work.</li>
            <li> sounded really time intensive and difficult for her.</li>
            <li> The way the dentist said to floss was thread a hoop shaped gadget that is slightly thicker than floss with your floss, insert between teeth and braces wire, floss and then repeat for all teeth.</li>
            <li> Will not repurchase these, obviously my teeth will only get closer together and render these completely useless.</li>
            <li> I bought them at Wal-mart for less than $2.  </li>
            <li> Seriously fit in 2 areas in my mouth :(</li>
            <li> I destroyed 2 flossers because the floss did indeed shred and tore apart around molars with tight contacts.  </li>
            <li> I like that each pack has a little travel case so you can take a placker/flosser in your purse, backpack, pocket, etc.</li>
            <li> a little over a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little tricky, but I worked it out.  </li>
            <li> Be careful as they can irritate your gums if you push too hard.</li>
            <li> But the slim side still does not fit in a couple of spots where the cable is close to the tooth.</li>
            <li> These were a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get into some narrow places.</li>
            <li> I have varying spaces between my teeth (month 4, 1st time adult wearer) and found it difficult to maneuver the floss under the gum line, as floss is meant to be used.  </li>
            <li> I used the threader flossers before, but my mouth is small and I secretly think it&#x27;s causing wrinkles around my mouth from all the work of threading through my back teeth!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have been told I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> too bulky for my small mouth.</li>
            <li> Too bulky for my small teeth and braces.</li>
            <li> Now we have an open pack of useless floss picks until after the braces come off in two years.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, these do not fit behind the wire in her braces.  </li>
            <li> There is no better way to floss the teeth of a kid in braces!  </li>
            <li> Then the difficulty of remembering which ones I was unable to floss, it&#x27;s just not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> But seriously $7.00 for 24?</li>
            <li> She told me that she can&#x27;t get it behind the wire.  </li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s utterly useless.</li>
            <li> the threading of the floss between each tooth is tedious and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was sad</li>
            <li> She had a really difficult time flossing with them.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> Difficult to maneuver because u need to &#x27;bend&#x27; the product in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 10th month of braces, so flossing has become a very tedious and tiresome chore by now.</li>
            <li> buy the Dentek Floss Picks--they don&#x27;t have the bump that makes using the Plackers picks so difficult and painful when teeth are aching from having had the braces tightened.</li>
            <li> Too bad both sides are not slim.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> These are useless!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible product .  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cannot use with braces even though advertised! It is not appropriately advertised since I cannot floss on my braces and also the pick part is too soft!</li>
            <li> Works well for braces...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. I think the plastic side that goes between the brace wire &amp; tooth could be smaller and still work well. It is an extremely tight fit no matter what brace / tooth you are working on. I&#x27;ve tried 3 different times over the period of 2 days; and I was unable to fit the plastic behind the brace wire on 7 of my 22 wired-spaces. Then the difficulty of remembering which ones I was unable to floss, it&#x27;s just not worth it to me. I might as well just use regular floss with a threader. I am only at month 3 of my first braces experience ever as an adult and I have been told I have a small mouth and my teeth are very close to each other. Maybe I can use these towards the end of my 2 years in braces. Great, well-made product with great strong floss. BUT again I think the plastic part that goes between the braces wire &amp; tooth could be smaller and the product still work great.</li>
            <li> My daughter just got her braces so I ordered several different brands to see how they worked.  The gap between the wire and her teeth was to small for the floss stick to fit through.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. They make a huge difference and clean what brushing leaves behind, which leads to fresher breath. More orthodontists need to recommend these to their patients. I give them two thumbs up! Only a couple of them (out of many packs over a year and a half of having braces) broke, so I am pleased also with the quality. I like that each pack has a little travel case so you can take a placker/flosser in your purse, backpack, pocket, etc. and keep it clean until you need to use it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t easy to use with my braces as described.</li>
            <li> My son is very grateful to have these. It was very stressful for him to use the other method of flossing that the Ortho Dr. gave him. Great invention! Wish they were sold in regular stores!!</li>
            <li> These are useless!!!! My daughter can&#x27;t get them under her wires and they are supposed to be made for people with braces.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I got them for my braces. But the slim side still does not fit in a couple of spots where the cable is close to the tooth. Even worse, where it does fit, the slim side bends when trying to push the flosser in narrow gaps between teeth. So it&#x27;s utterly useless. Threw them out and got a waterpik instead.</li>
            <li> After running out of the floss I got from my dentist I was in need of braces specific floss. After looking and finding nothing I saw one pack of these left at Walmart and they worked great. The reviews seemed alright but after using these I&#x27;ve determined that they work perfect (at least for my braces). Before I had braces I used non-braces specific floss sticks and those would often break or split before I was done flossing but the quality on these is superior and you don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking the floss. The toothpick on the end is decent and it&#x27;s a nice touch but the floss is enough to get the job done! I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works great for my 10 year old and his braces.Easy to use. Highly recommend to anyone who has a child with braces.</li>
            <li> These really helped me floss regularly while I had braces. I don&#x27;t know if I would have been as disciplined using regular floss since it is so much more of a pain. These make it easy and they are the strongest ones I&#x27;ve found - I use them a few nights before tossing them.</li>
            <li> If you have braces and want to floss , this is the only thing you need too buy. Floss is very durable.</li>
            <li> This less expensive version of same item just won&#x27;t fit between my wires and teeth.  The more expensive version has a thinner base and slips easily between.  These were a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Bouldght these for my daughter who just got braces. She loves them!</li>
            <li> I bought these because it&#x27;s such a pain to floss with braces...the threading of the floss between each tooth is tedious and time consuming.  When I saw these I thought my frustrations would finally be solved.  This was not the case....the flossers don&#x27;t fit underneath the brace wire (yes, I followed the directions).  So I&#x27;m back to threading floss between my teeth....</li>
            <li> Nice flosser for those with braces.</li>
            <li> My daughter tried these and said they work well, much better than Platypus which orthodontist gave us.  I bought at Walgreen.</li>
            <li> Great concept. Unfortunately, if you have a very crowded mouth as I do, it doesn&#x27;t work very well practically. In some places, my brackets were too close together for me to fit the plastic part in between them (it is about the width of 1/2 to 2/3 of a bracket.) In other places, the wire was too close to my teeth to be able to squeeze the flosser underneath. In a couple places, I was able to get the flosser under the wire but could not pull it back out without the &amp;#34;knot&amp;#34; of floss catching on and plucking the wire... not very comfortable for me and I&#x27;m sure not very good for my braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sad this didn&#x27;t work for me since I am a big fan of Plackers flossers and used them all the time before I got my braces. If you have plenty of space between your brackets and between the wire and your teeth, then I would definitely give this product a try... but if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t have a lot of space to work with, you&#x27;d be better off with a traditional floss threader. I&#x27;m also a big fan of GUM SoftPicks... they take a little time to get used to since they do feel different from regular floss, but they seem to do a very good job of between-teeth cleaning, and even with my very crowded mouth there is only one pair of teeth I can&#x27;t get a SoftPick between. I&#x27;ve heard great things about the WaterPik as well and would love to give it a try at some point, but right now the SoftPick is the best cheaper alternative to flossing that I have found for my particular teeth and my particular braces.</li>
            <li> Best floss for braces, no need to weave floss with regular floss. As an add on item, these were a great value as well.</li>
            <li> There is no better way to floss the teeth of a kid in braces!  These are easy to use and durable.  I visited 12 stores and couldn&#x27;t find them- a must &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; item for your amazon order.</li>
            <li> work great for my daughter in braces</li>
            <li> These flossers save tons of time when flossing with braces. The way the dentist said to floss was thread a hoop shaped gadget that is slightly thicker than floss with your floss, insert between teeth and braces wire, floss and then repeat for all teeth. That was time consuming. These you pop in right behind the braces because the flat side fits perfectly and floss. There are some teeth that you cannot use this with as they are too tight together (thus the braces), but the majority of the teeth get flossed pretty well. There are some similar items at the store or on amazon, but those don&#x27;t have that flat part which fits under the wire. There is also some sort of pick thing on the other end which may or may not be useful, I use those teeny pipe cleaner brushes designed for cleaning around braces and teeth instead. Used together with regular brushing and my teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> buy the Dentek Floss Picks--they don&#x27;t have the bump that makes using the Plackers picks so difficult and painful when teeth are aching from having had the braces tightened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 10th month of braces, so flossing has become a very tedious and tiresome chore by now. I used the threader flossers before, but my mouth is small and I secretly think it&#x27;s causing wrinkles around my mouth from all the work of threading through my back teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these out and love them. They are so convenient to carry around and make quick work of flossing. I use a 2-3 flossers each time I floss all of my teeth just to keep from spreading around the bacteria, but these flossers really hold up.  They keep taut and hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t understand is the gum stimulator... it&#x27;s super soft and doesn&#x27;t really act like a pick. I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s there for, honestly. It feels like I&#x27;m rubbing a gummy bear over my gumline, but it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be able to dislodge any food between my teeth OR braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a staple in my daily bracesl kit.  I currently carry nimbus toothbrushes, travel pro-enamel toothpaste, TotalCare Listerene (Alcohol free) and some placker flossers. I feel so fresh with these on hand and ready to eat anything. Even...a salad.</li>
            <li> I am astounded that this product is not sold in any of the stores I have been to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the BEST flossers for people with braces. I am an adult with braces and I have been using these since I got my metal mouth a little over a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a dozen or so brands sold in your typical brick and mortar store with the same design that won&#x27;t fit in between the bar and the tooth. These do! They do the job perfect! And I keep them in my car so I can floss while I drive, because I don&#x27;t need to look in the mirror as I floss.</li>
            <li> Two people in our household have braces and we&#x27;ve found Plackers to be the best way to floss easily, instead of threading floss through each tooth. They are so much cheaper than the Platypus flossers.</li>
            <li> These are just okay, but I felt I had to use too many to get the job done right. They are okay in my opinion if your only going after a couple of teeth.</li>
            <li> Never heard of this product before - I can&#x27;t believe more people with braces haven&#x27;t spread the word!  It is really good for a quick flossing, but I wouldn&#x27;t replace it for every flossing.  Took about half the time that using the threader floss normally does.  It did start to fray by the time I was 1/3rd of the way through, but didn&#x27;t completely break or get caught in my braces.  Some of the brackets were really close to one another so it was difficult to use these with some of them, but overall, I really liked them!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get my kids to floss regularly until I bought these.  Makes flossing with braces so much easier!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love being able to floss with braces.  These flossers certainly fit the bill in that regard.  However they are not as sturdy as some other brands I have tried.  The floss frays rather easily.  So, they are functional just not terribly durable.</li>
            <li> They are flimsy, did not like them at all for flossing with braces.</li>
            <li> Great help for getting in between teeth with braces on.</li>
            <li> too bulky for my small mouth.</li>
            <li> If you have  braces, these are a must.  The flossers work really well in the hard to reach spots!  Yeah!</li>
            <li> I love these! They actually fit behind my braces and make my teeth feel like I really am flossing them!  My gums love love love these!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these little things.  My daughter keeps her teach clean, and they don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This product is great and works for half the cost of other brands I&#x27;ve seen out there.  Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> So I decided to buy this in bulk from Amazon. It&#x27;s cheaper with the Subscribe &amp; Save discount and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out. I can always delay the subscription if I have some left. :) Great deal!</li>
            <li> Love these for our patients. Hopefully they will floss if you make it easier for them. Amazon has the best prices.</li>
            <li> Flossing with braces is so much easier with these! We heard about them from one of my daughters&#x27; friends and looked for them at several stores.  They were either not sold there or sold out.  Decided to check on Amazon.com and, of course, they had them! Wish I would have thought of it in the first place. Best flossers for braces, hands down!!!</li>
            <li> A must have for braces!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for braces! I always carry some with me. There is a tiny pouch in the bag where you can place 1 floss and this pouch can be placed on your wallet or purse for when you are out with your friend and you need a quick floss. I find that being able to bend the flosser is also helpful in flossing my molars (something that I find difficult to do with superfloss). I love this product and I recommend it to everyone I know who has braces.</li>
            <li> These were recommended by the dentist and the girls like them.  They are easy to use and get in where they need to be to get food particles out.  Love them.</li>
            <li> My daughter has braces and these flossers are the only thing that keeps her flossing! I am glad that I found them.</li>
            <li> Awesome is the only word to describe these flossers. I have braces and these things keep food/plaque out of my teeth without a hassle. I would recommend stocking up on these if you have braces.</li>
            <li> I bought these becuase I have Gotten braces again as an Adult and wanted something to quickly floss my teeth. I could insert the flosser through going up but the knot of the floss would catch on the wire when I tried to remove the flosser from between my teeth</li>
            <li> These are great flossers that my daughter prefers.  Just as an FYI, you can get them for 2 for $5.00 at Walgreens.com.  Come on Amazon!!  I tried to buy them from you first!!  Keep your prices competitive!!</li>
            <li> Not very convenient. Can&#x27;t get into some narrow places. I still prefer to use  &amp;#34;needle and thread&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you have a child with braces, this is a must have for them.&lt;br /&gt;Floss and brush every night! This is a good deal, it is too hard to find these in the store to purchase. So I purchase online!</li>
            <li> floss head is a little to big for my braces, works but have to be careful not to pop my brackets.  the pick on the other end is too flexible for me</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, great value, my son uses them daily and prefers these to all the other Braces cleaners.  Buy in bulk for an even greater value - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hard to find ortho specific flossers, these are great.</li>
            <li> If you have braces or ur kids do then purchase these. Don&#x27;t pay for shipping as you can find them on other websites with free shipping. They really do work and are great for front teeth that have brackets.</li>
            <li> My son has braces and uses these to floss.  His teeth and gums look great - Dentist couldn&#x27;t praise him enough.  Everyone with braces should use these.</li>
            <li> Was real excited when i bought these but they do nit fit between the brace wire and the tooth. very dissappointing! Fortunately, I bought these from Walgreens and they accepted my return and promptly refunded my money.</li>
            <li> These are the one&#x27;s you need if you have braces.  They are also a slimmer design and work just fine if you don&#x27;t have braces.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they are supposed to and the price is great.  My son prefers them to an electric flosser.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a faster way to floss around my braces on the go and decided to try these.  Although these have a slim edge to fit between braces, it doesnt fit between all of mine.  Too bad both sides are not slim.  I have varying spaces between my teeth (month 4, 1st time adult wearer) and found it difficult to maneuver the floss under the gum line, as floss is meant to be used.  I destroyed 2 flossers because the floss did indeed shred and tore apart around molars with tight contacts.  I like the orange tip, which can be used as a toothpick or gum massager.  And I found the white tip can be used to help me place my elastics, it&#x27;s a little tricky, but I worked it out.  Will not repurchase these, obviously my teeth will only get closer together and render these completely useless.</li>
            <li> My daughter just got braces and the procedure for threading floss sounded really time intensive and difficult for her. The ortho gave us a sample pack of these, and they worked perfectly for her on every wire space upper and lower, front and back. The price with free shipping from Amazon made shopping super simple, and so much cheaper than Walgreens.</li>
            <li> This is more than my third order, and these things have to be the best on earth for someone with braces!</li>
            <li> Too bulky for my small teeth and braces. Couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> perfect for cleaning my teeth and getting around my braces to ensure they are clean; convenient for taking with you anywhere</li>
            <li> The description for this item says that it&#x27;s good for use with braces because one of the tines is supposed to be small enough to get behind the wire.  That is why I bought them for my daughter because she prefers the flossing sticks and she recently got braces.  She told me that she can&#x27;t get it behind the wire.  Being a teenage girl, I know her propensity for dramatics, so I asked her to show me.  Lo and behold, these do not fit behind the wire in her braces.  Now we have an open pack of useless floss picks until after the braces come off in two years.</li>
            <li> My daughter can now floss without having to thread floss between each of the braces.  Work very well.  Only one spot where the flosser didn&#x27;t fit but could still use a threader for that area.  Definitely cuts down on the time it takes to floss.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she didn&#x27;t like them.  She had a really difficult time flossing with them.&lt;br /&gt;She just got her braces off so she can use them still, but she didn&#x27;t feel that they worked well with braces.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not very crowded and I have no problem flossing with regular threader floss. I thought these would be good for quick &#x27;touch ups&#x27; but there is too much slack on the floss and it won&#x27;t actually go between my teeth. I have small self ligating brackets, and the plastic arm that is supposed to fit between the wire and the tooth is too big to really fit on a lot of teeth. Plus, the space between your arch wire and tooth will dictate how much of the length of the floss can be used. For me, it&#x27;s not much, so there&#x27;s no room to move the floss in or out, or maneuver it below the gumline. I like the idea of these but I couldn&#x27;t make them work at all. It&#x27;s like they were never practically tested them with real modern braces.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to having an easier way of flossing with braces, but just stick with the good ole floss threaders. I thought these would have a better design, thinner, but nope! Seriously fit in 2 areas in my mouth :(</li>
            <li> Wish I could find these in the store. Great for people with braces!</li>
            <li> Horrible product .  Doesn&#x27;t fit between the braces to get proper flossing</li>
            <li> They are costly, but are way better than using wire to floss! Be careful as they can irritate your gums if you push too hard.</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED ........... EXCELLENT VERY GOOD QUALITY GOOD OPTION FOR THE PRICE AND RECOMMEND ... MUYBUEN BUY QUALITY, EXCELLENT DURADERO</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like that pressure the pick up on my wire wish is was slimmer on the parts that goes in between tooth and wire 😒but easier than threading floss through so I&#x27;ll probably use them just not when I first get a tightening!!</li>
            <li> So happy to have found a reasonably priced flosser for braces. I bought them at Wal-mart for less than $2.  They are very similar to the Platypus flossers that we have been using but at a fraction of the cost.  I managed to floss all my teeth without breaking or stretching out the floss which was a great accomplishment. If you can find these for a couple bucks in the store they are a great alternative to Platypus flossers.</li>
            <li> These are great for braces! It&#x27;s a little difficult to fit for some teeth but it still much easier than the alternative.</li>
            <li> Not great. Difficult to maneuver because u need to &#x27;bend&#x27; the product in order for it to work. I recommend the Dentek Pick Floss for braces. That one is 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 packs of these to try out, 72 total, to see how they compared to Platypus flosser. Overall, they compared favorably. Platypus wins by a slight margin in that they seem to fit better in between my braces. However, these are only around 33% the price of the the Platypus. They also have a toothpick thingy on the tip to help with the removal of more debris. However, this toothpick thingy is useless as it&#x27;s just too soft and flexible to actually work. I just use this flosser along with a plastic toothpick and these two items gets rid of all food particles stuck in my braces. Best way to floss is to still use an actual floss with the floss threader but this one works great when you don&#x27;t have time and need a quick floss.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. So much better than threading the floss under every wire and between every tooth. But seriously $7.00 for 24? Walgreens has 48 for $5.</li>
            <li> Flossers work great with my sons braces, and so much better than the string floss with the hard end to thread it through.  He will actually floss with these.  $1.99 per pack is an awesome price and it arrived right away.  Highly recommend this brand for kids and adults with braces!  They work great!</li>
