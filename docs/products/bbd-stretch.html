            <li> My hair is encounters quite a bit of shrinkage because I live in a very dry climate.  It is difficult to maintain moisture.  When my hair feels dry, I apply this product and immediately, my shrinkage disappears and the moisture is retained for 5 to 6 days.  It stops breakage when I wear a straight style and get new growth.</li>
            <li> It was kind of high but overall i like it the product made my hair a lot softer and it also made it grow</li>
            <li> excellent product, a bit pricy.  Soften, detangles and stop breakage!  Results are almost immediately!  I recommend this product to anyone looking to improve the health of their hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product. It is great on my hair. I can see the difference in how stronger my hair feels when I use this. This is great for women with relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product at all. Made my hair dry and irritated my scalp. Didn&#x27;t do what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> I had searched for BBD Stretch products and was glad to find it on Amazon; not only does STRETCH moisture the hair and the folicles, but also stops the breakage.</li>
            <li> Leaves a film on my hair. Again it claim to be all natural but no ingredients are listed! No, I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it. Helps perm last longer. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for the past 6 years or so, that should tell you how awesome it is. It&#x27;s keeps my hair from breaking, adds strength to it. This jar will last a long time. I also use it as a pre-poo before shampooing.</li>
            <li> Great product does work. It was a good price and I think this a great way to shop I love the availability</li>
            <li> This is not the Jar I received, I was told to specificly get the one on the brown Jar, a blue Jar was sent instead, When I wanted to return it I was told all the products come in a blue jar now! so I really don&#x27;t know how to rate this I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several years and love the results. great moisturizer and helped to grow my hair. no breakage.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product a month ago and have been truly please with the results. It takes just a tiny amount goes a long way putting moisture back into your hair. Excellent product</li>
            <li> Good product.. my daughter&#x27;s hair is growing like wild weeds..lol also feels like she has a perm when she doesn&#x27;t. .and make s hair glossy.. no grease ever again!</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells, i use only a quarter size in the morn&#x27; and before going to bed super moisture for my hair i wear my hair natural my hair loves this stuff</li>
            <li> Do not be sucked into buying this product, it is not worth the money.  Go to your neighborhood drugstore or beauty supply store and purchase your products, it does not work. I give it 1/2 star.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived I was very excited having used it before,For some reason or another after a few days it had a terrible odor. The product made my hair have a smely odor too. Finally had to give in and throw it out. The product itself is a good, Will not be purchasing it again from this seller.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this product on my hair years ago. My hair was strong and long. My stylist had moved and I was not able to find this product. I am pleased I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair had been very dry and breaking alot. I washed my hair and used the BBD stretch and my hair was immediately soft and silky. I let my hair air dry half way then I used a heat protectant on my hair and blow dry dried straight. The smell is wonderful. I used the BBD cream when my ends are a little dry. I am seeing alot less breakage. Ive been using it for about 2 weeks now. I am happy with the results so far. My mother loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived earlier than expected. I am pleased with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical in purchasing this product and decided to go ahead and get it. In doing so I decided to use it as a 2x a day moisturizer and to seal my hair with argan oil every time. Being natural I do not want to apply to much heat so instead of using a blow dryer or flat iron on hair I would rub one drop of argan oil in my hands until I felt heat, and clap my hands together with hair in the middle of hands from scalp to ends to create a little heat. It was amazing! I can tell the strength that this product has caused in my hair. I have never seen my hair this strong. Others may not have the same results maybe because they are not using it correctly. It states that this product does not work unless heat is applied, (even if it is a little). I will defintely purchase again. I even used on daugther&#x27;s hair and within about 2 weeks time I have noticed that her hair has even retained length by not breaking. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I heard so much about BBD stretch I wanted to try it so I did. I love the product it make my hair feel very soft.  I use BBD Stretch everyday it make my hair feel very soft.</li>
