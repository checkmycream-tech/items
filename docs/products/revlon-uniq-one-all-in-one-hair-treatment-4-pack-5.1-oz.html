            <li> Whether I cut it short or left it long, the ends continued to zap like &amp;#34;Z&amp;#34; no matter what I did to try to repair it.</li>
            <li> this product has not fixed the problem, and I no longer use regular conditioner/repair serums, other than this product which I spray into my palm and finger it through my hair only after washing.  </li>

            <li> It only a few pumps and no more tangles.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, due to medial issues and a lot of medications (that I am now off of)</li>

            <li> A few years ago, due to medial issues and a lot of medications (that I am now off of) my hair became fried. I mean FRIED.

I tried conditioner after conditioner, thinking my hair was too dry but my stylist mentioned to me that I may be using too much conditioner so I stopped using all conditioners completely. It didn&#x27;t help. After about 18 months of struggling with this problem (I could straighten my hair with a flat iron only to hide the &amp;#34;Z&amp;#34;&#x27;s on the end but any moisture in the air would eliminate it), my stylist gave me a sample of this Revlon product and within 2 or 3 days, the zapping was 95% better!
