            <li>If you like matte finish, use this more liberally.</li>

            <li>I use it to set my concealer under my eyes mostly, but have used it all over my face as well</li>
            <li>Love this translucent powder.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth, silky look this powder gives.  </li>
            <li>Not being someone who likes makeup in general, this product is great for shine control.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up in general, so this is a nice addition for those warm, shiny days.</li>
            <li>Feels light weight.</li>
            <li>A bit light for summer.</li>
            <li>This powder keeps my makeup in place and my face oil free.</li>
            <li>I apply this to my nose creases, a bit on the forehead, and around my chin and mouth area after a full makeup application (creme foundation and light finishing powder).</li>
            <li>I use the tinted moisturizer from Laura Mercier, so I am familiar with the quality of their beauty products.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is you need to buy a good brush if you don&#x27;t already have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The most natural look available.  </li>
            <li>They come in various shades and are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Great shine control without leaving a heavy powder trail on your face.  </li>
            <li>I do feel like i go through it very fast for the price though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and a little goes a very long way as with most Laura Mercier products.</li>
            <li>It lasted about 6 months for me the first time I bought it, and I used it just about every day.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well and didnt make my skin feel clogged or greasy.</li>
            <li>if you have very oily skin and start to shine an hour after applying makeup, this product is a must!</li>
            <li>I pat it on exactly as I used oil blotting papers.  </li>
            <li>This last a lot longer and is a better buy when you compare product life.  </li>
            <li>I have found that when you wear just the tinted moisture, which you don&#x27;t need a lot of in the first place, your forehead gets a bit shiny if you don&#x27;t set it with powder.</li>
            <li>Has a lot of green in it which is good for me as I have a lot of redness in my skin town.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is that it applies really white on your face but just use a dusting brush or any large powder brush over your face and your good to go.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>This compact works really well and does not leave my face feeling too powdery.  </li>
            <li>GreT for shine control I have really oily skin, have tried everything.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$$ for sure,  I use all over my face if I&#x27;m going out to set my makeup or just a touch on my nose and chin to dull the shiny spots.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not oily in those key areas you may not need this, you&#x27;d probably be ok with foundation and regular pressed powder.</li>
            <li>use this compact on the go, and it really does last all day, I rarely have to reapply to stop shine issues.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite pressed powder, I have used it exclusively since I stumbled on it a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and can&#x27;t afford to have that all over matte look - my face is already pretty dry.</li>
            <li>This is a whitish powder that appears clear if not over-applied.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am so happy I listened to her advice because this powder actually works!</li>
            <li>The consistency is waxy, so it seemed strange at first for something that is supposed to stop shine.</li>
            <li>Love the coverage - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with a little redness in some areas, so the pale green tint actually helps even my skin tone.</li>

            <li> Love the coverage - a little goes a long way.  Great for setting makeup.  Only complaint is the finish, although it says &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; is just a tad white so don&#x27;t use too much.  I love that it&#x27;s virtually odorless and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like almost every product on the planet does. Worth the $$$ for sure,  I use all over my face if I&#x27;m going out to set my makeup or just a touch on my nose and chin to dull the shiny spots.  I&#x27;m older and can&#x27;t afford to have that all over matte look - my face is already pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my nose creases, a bit on the forehead, and around my chin and mouth area after a full makeup application (creme foundation and light finishing powder). It&#x27;s very effective and a little goes a very long way as with most Laura Mercier products. If you&#x27;re not oily in those key areas you may not need this, you&#x27;d probably be ok with foundation and regular pressed powder. My skin goes from dry to oily and back again so I need this product to control unwanted shine. If you like a dewy appearance as I do, don&#x27;t apply this to cheeks or skin bordering the hairline, your makeup with appear matte. If you like matte finish, use this more liberally. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Now I know why all the movie stars use this to prevent shine. Truly a &amp;#34; NO COLOR &amp;#34; beautiful addition to any foundation or just on clean skin. The most natural look available.  Thank You Laura !</li>
            <li> I use the tinted moisturizer from Laura Mercier, so I am familiar with the quality of their beauty products.  This compact works really well and does not leave my face feeling too powdery.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up in general, so this is a nice addition for those warm, shiny days.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this compact!! I have very fair skin with a little redness in some areas, so the pale green tint actually helps even my skin tone. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s green enough to make your whole face look green - if you use it correctly you don&#x27;t need to put much on. If you need a heavier powder, try Laura Mercier&#x27;s setting powders. They come in various shades and are AMAZING. Only downside is you need to buy a good brush if you don&#x27;t already have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this compact on the go, and it really does last all day, I rarely have to reapply to stop shine issues. It lasted about 6 months for me the first time I bought it, and I used it just about every day.</li>

            <li> Has a lot of green in it which is good for me as I have a lot of redness in my skin town.  I&#x27;d recommend this product as a good face power/ make up setter.  Feels light weight.</li>
            <li> Great setting powder. One of the few products I have actually hit pan on. I have almost finished it. Highly recommend. Use with a big fluffy powder brush.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth, silky look this powder gives.  Best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does, mattifies perfectly for an all day shine free result. Only thing is that it applies really white on your face but just use a dusting brush or any large powder brush over your face and your good to go.</li>
            <li> A bit light for summer.</li>
            <li> This powder keeps my makeup in place and my face oil free. Lasts for hours. You just need a little&lt;br /&gt;and it works.  I apply it after my makeup is on.</li>
            <li> Love this translucent powder. She also has great foundation too. I like the fact I didn&#x27;t have to go into the mall to get what i wanted.</li>
            <li> The consistency is waxy, so it seemed strange at first for something that is supposed to stop shine. It works pretty well and didnt make my skin feel clogged or greasy. I do feel like i go through it very fast for the price though. I only used it for a couple weeks before it started to get down to the bottom of the case :/</li>
            <li> if you have very oily skin and start to shine an hour after applying makeup, this product is a must! keeps you matte for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> Great shine control without leaving a heavy powder trail on your face.  I pat it on exactly as I used oil blotting papers.  This last a lot longer and is a better buy when you compare product life.  A must have.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite pressed powder, I have used it exclusively since I stumbled on it a few years ago. It sets my foundation and does a descent job of shine control for my oily skin. This is a whitish powder that appears clear if not over-applied. I use a Duo FIber brush to apply powder over to foundation. The Duo Brush prevents one from over applying powder and looking like they have been rolled in flour.</li>
            <li> I bought this on recommendation of a Sephora consultant to keep the shine down to a minimum, especially later into the day. I was a bit skeptical at first because I was returning Urban Decay&#x27;s de-slick powder meant for the same thing (and to which I had no results). Needless to say I am so happy I listened to her advice because this powder actually works! No more oily t-zone and shiny face at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> GreT for shine control I have really oily skin, have tried everything. This pressed powder works great. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I put this on after applying Laura Mercier tinted moisture. I have found that when you wear just the tinted moisture, which you don&#x27;t need a lot of in the first place, your forehead gets a bit shiny if you don&#x27;t set it with powder. This does the trick. It&#x27;s perfectly translucent. It looks like it would leave a faint green color trace, but it doesn&#x27;t. I am always switching up my makeup regime. Not being someone who likes makeup in general, this product is great for shine control. I highly recommend this product.</li>
