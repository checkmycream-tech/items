            <li>Love the product and</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t stop examining my skin because it&#x27;s such a great change!</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks much better after using Mistaya Skincare.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the citrus fragrance and the texture of this.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, it works for most skin types, but not mine.  </li>
            <li>definitely worthwhile</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this product.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can use it under my eyes too.</li>
            <li>She was especially happy with the results on her neck where many other products did nothing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about product and company!</li>
            <li>I received my order very quickly and had no problems whatsoever with the order.</li>
            <li>My skin looks toned, the fine lines are diminishing, and my pores are looking clearer.  </li>
            <li>It clears up spots and reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li>Also, I feel confident putting this stuff on my skin: it has no artificial colour or fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love that this product has been so thoroughly researched and tested, as well as certified organic - it feels good to know that there is a skincare product I can trust that also actually works!  </li>
            <li>There’s a really nice light citrusy scent, which I really like in Vitamin C products.</li>
            <li>Very fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>And I love the fresh mild scent of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done.</li>
            <li>As a consumer I am continuously looking for Organic products that are budget friendly and work well.  </li>
            <li>Mistaya offers a wonderful line of organic facial products.  </li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant scent and is very economical because you use very little of the product.</li>
            <li>Skin feels fresh and light, not gooey and sticky.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh, citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>I really try to use organic beauty products any chance I have because I believe they have to be so much better than the chemical loaded products.  </li>
            <li>She was very impressed with the results as she has tried many other big name brand products that did not work.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>One person half-jokingly asked me if I was pregnant</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serum is so light that it doesn&#x27;t add to the oily build and so effective that I can actually use it without moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I did not know that it would smell this good, and feel this natural, and feel so gentle and as light as it does - I really had to experience it for myself to see what people meant by that, because they all seemed to be saying it.  </li>
            <li>Your skin has such a healthy glow!”</li>
            <li>I received my Mistaya serum very quickly, and overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It absorbed easily yet didn’t “disappear” into my skin, but left it looking healthy.  </li>
            <li>The texture is silky smooth and it doesn&#x27;t take a large amount of serum to cover my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>This is great for your skin now, and also offers anti-aging benefits, so you are caring for your future skin, as well as your current skin…all with amazingly beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li>My husband likes the fresh scent when I come to bed.  </li>
            <li>Because it is made from natural ingredients, I feel confident applying it around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This serum is a little thicker than most serums but it glides on your skin so very easily.</li>
            <li>It seeps right into your skin immediately and you can notice the softness within a minute.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this serum and for know I only will by this anti-aging serum my face look more clear from the sun damage&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>It feels silky and smooth while going on and has a fresh, natural fragrance and feel.  </li>
            <li>I use vitamin C serum on a regular basis, usually Mychelle&#x27;s Perfect C serum.</li>
            <li>I missed using it a couple of times when I was in a rush, and I noticed the difference in the way my skin felt, and made sure to use some later in the day.  </li>
            <li>Please put more of your products on Amazon - I am definitely a customer for life, now!  </li>
            <li>My first impression...</li>
            <li>My first impression..</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>a user of Estee Lauder products for a very long time, repeatedly using the  Estee Lauder Idealist Pore Minimizing Skin Refinisher &amp; the Estee Lauder - Perfectionist [CP+R] Wrinkle Lifting/Firming Serum , I would definitely give this product superior reviews  with the overall texture and initial results, but what makes it that much more appealing are the all organic ingredients and the far more reasonable price</li>
            <li>After only 2 weeks of use, I cannot believe the positive changes in my skin; the fine lines around my eyes and mouth slowly diminishing, the light weightless feel of the product leaving my skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated, and the natural fresh scent are amazing.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied Mistaya I used too much.  </li>
            <li>She also mentioned the serum just felt good on her skin and that a small amount was all she had to use each day.</li>
            <li>I received my product very quickly and started using it the same evening.  </li>
            <li>After cleansing my skin, I applied a small amount per the instructions, and it felt so refreshing and so natural to me; there was no tightness to my skin, no greasy, cloying feeling of a product sitting on my face, and my skin looked healthy and glowing, not “shiny.”  </li>
            <li>Makes it so soft and bright less wrinkles and frown lines.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Mistaya Organic Skincare!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all very healthful.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see much difference in skin, somewhat drying</li>
            <li>This is more than your average serum.</li>
            <li>AAA+++++ new product on the market!</li>
            <li>, or people just ask me what I’m doing for myself because I look so vibrant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be reordering in the future and watching for more products to adopt into my daily regime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer for life!</li>
            <li>It absorbs right into my skin, and even after applying my daily moisturizer, my skin does not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have recommended this product to others as well and we look forward to trying some of the the other Mistaya Organic products as they become available.</li>
            <li>This is a slightly thicker formula than I&#x27;m used to, but fine for nighttime use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to comment on the anti-wrinkle aspect, but my skin looks fresher, cleaner, and more hydrated after only a week of using!  </li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old female who has used skin care products regularly for the past 10 years and this one has most definitely stood out as a fabulous new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this product at night - I tried using it in the morning, but found it didn&#x27;t absorb fast enough to use under makeup.</li>
            <li>Ingredients are natural and organic, which provides confidence in the product.</li>
            <li>I live in the high desert where the climate is especially drying.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of eczema, and the Mistaya Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging / Anti-Wrinkle Face &amp; Eye Skin Care didn’t sting or irritate it, either, but actually helped it heal and clear up in within a couple of days!!  </li>
            <li>This is organic and there is also aloe, spirulina, Japanese green tea, blue-green algae, tons of vitamins, and more than 20 Organic Botanical extracts and essential oils in it!</li>
            <li>The serum has a nice smell, like green tea, but it is a little stronger than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Other reviews are very promising.</li>
            <li>This is probably best for someone new to serums - once you get into expensive products you&#x27;ll notice subtle differences (that probably aren&#x27;t necessary).</li>
            <li>In other areas of my face, my skin is so greasy that if I use too heavy of a moisturizer it leads to more oil build-up and</li>
            <li>It takes very little to cover my face and neck, so it is more cost efficient than some other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend, especially if you have extremely sensitive facial skin.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to comment on the anti-wrinkle aspect, but my skin looks fresher, cleaner, and more hydrated after only a week of using!  </li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old female who has used skin care products regularly for the past 10 years and this one has most definitely stood out as a fabulous new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this product at night - I tried using it in the morning, but found it didn&#x27;t absorb fast enough to use under makeup.</li>
            <li> Ingredients are natural and organic, which provides confidence in the product.</li>
            <li> I live in the high desert where the climate is especially drying.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of eczema, and the Mistaya Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging / Anti-Wrinkle Face &amp; Eye Skin Care didn’t sting or irritate it, either, but actually helped it heal and clear up in within a couple of days!!  </li>
            <li> This is organic and there is also aloe, spirulina, Japanese green tea, blue-green algae, tons of vitamins, and more than 20 Organic Botanical extracts and essential oils in it!</li>
            <li> The serum has a nice smell, like green tea, but it is a little stronger than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Other reviews are very promising.</li>
            <li> This is probably best for someone new to serums - once you get into expensive products you&#x27;ll notice subtle differences (that probably aren&#x27;t necessary).</li>
            <li> In other areas of my face, my skin is so greasy that if I use too heavy of a moisturizer it leads to more oil build-up and</li>
            <li> It takes very little to cover my face and neck, so it is more cost efficient than some other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend, especially if you have extremely sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all greasy and hydrated my skin that gets incredibly dry in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> In some areas of my face, my skin is so dry that I can&#x27;t leave the shower without putting on moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this product is 100% organic as she has become very careful about using synthetic products and the long term effect they may have.</li>
            <li> This product seems to last forever because you use so little.</li>
            <li> This one has such things as green tea, aloe vera, and spirulina.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small application as the serum can be spread over your face and neck with a single pump.  </li>
            <li> It takes VERY little product to cover my entire face.  </li>
            <li> As someone with extremely sensitive skin, I am always skeptical about commercial beauty products, but this was recommended by a friend,  and since it is USDA certified organic, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> if the packaging said what the percentage of vitamin C is in the product - my typical serum is 17% vitamin C, I&#x27;d like to know how this compares.</li>
            <li> There’s also a little airless pump, which makes application easier.</li>
            <li> Not sure what would happen if I continued using it for another month, though.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love the scent and the texture. Dries quickly. Skin feels fresh and light, not gooey and sticky. Also, I feel confident putting this stuff on my skin: it has no artificial colour or fragrance. I believe this is nutritious food for my cells!</li>
            <li> I received my Mistaya serum very quickly, and overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product. I use vitamin c serum every day, so this affordable price is great. This is probably best for someone new to serums - once you get into expensive products you&#x27;ll notice subtle differences (that probably aren&#x27;t necessary). It would be nice if the packaging said what the percentage of vitamin C is in the product - my typical serum is 17% vitamin C, I&#x27;d like to know how this compares. This is a slightly thicker formula than I&#x27;m used to, but fine for nighttime use.</li>
            <li> I use vitamin C serum on a regular basis, usually Mychelle&#x27;s Perfect C serum. Comparably, Mistaya is much more affordable. I received my order very quickly and had no problems whatsoever with the order. The packaging is nice and the bottle has a generous amount of product. The serum has a nice smell, like green tea, but it is a little stronger than I&#x27;d like. It feels very nice going on - a smooth texture that spreads easily over the face and neck. I would recommend using this product at night - I tried using it in the morning, but found it didn&#x27;t absorb fast enough to use under makeup.</li>
            <li> After reading the description and hearing it recommended, I was hoping this product would be good.  I knew I’d be trying it and was prepared to give it some time to see if it worked for me and how my skin responded to it.  I did not know that it would smell this good, and feel this natural, and feel so gentle and as light as it does - I really had to experience it for myself to see what people meant by that, because they all seemed to be saying it.  After cleansing my skin, I applied a small amount per the instructions, and it felt so refreshing and so natural to me; there was no tightness to my skin, no greasy, cloying feeling of a product sitting on my face, and my skin looked healthy and glowing, not “shiny.”  It absorbed easily yet didn’t “disappear” into my skin, but left it looking healthy.  I had a bit of eczema, and the Mistaya Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging / Anti-Wrinkle Face &amp; Eye Skin Care didn’t sting or irritate it, either, but actually helped it heal and clear up in within a couple of days!!  I missed using it a couple of times when I was in a rush, and I noticed the difference in the way my skin felt, and made sure to use some later in the day.  My skin looks toned, the fine lines are diminishing, and my pores are looking clearer.  I love that this product has been so thoroughly researched and tested, as well as certified organic - it feels good to know that there is a skincare product I can trust that also actually works!  I keep receiving compliments like, “Your skin has such a healthy glow!”, “You look so radiant!”, or people just ask me what I’m doing for myself because I look so vibrant.  One person half-jokingly asked me if I was pregnant - they blanched visibly when I said that I am 47, and that I didn’t think so. (I LOVE this product!) Please put more of your products on Amazon - I am definitely a customer for life, now!  Thank You for creating this product!!</li>
            <li> As someone with extremely sensitive skin, I am always skeptical about commercial beauty products, but this was recommended by a friend,  and since it is USDA certified organic, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am THRILLED to report ZERO allergic reaction, plus I can already tell a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  The scent and texture of the serum is wonderful.  It takes very little to cover my face and neck, so it is more cost efficient than some other products I have tried.  It absorbs right into my skin, and even after applying my daily moisturizer, my skin does not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, especially if you have extremely sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT!  My first impression...I LOVE the smell!  Light, fresh, citrus smell.  The first time I applied Mistaya I used too much.  It takes VERY little product to cover my entire face.  It&#x27;s not at all greasy and hydrated my skin that gets incredibly dry in the winter months.  I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to comment on the anti-wrinkle aspect, but my skin looks fresher, cleaner, and more hydrated after only a week of using!  I highly recommend Mistaya Organic Skincare!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Vitamin C Serum for about 2 weeks and I love it!  It feels silky and smooth while going on and has a fresh, natural fragrance and feel.  I noticed this morning that my complexion appears more even and healthy.  You only need a small application as the serum can be spread over your face and neck with a single pump.  Love the product and how it makes my skin look and feel!</li>
            <li> This is more than your average serum. It has Vitamin C, anti-aging ingredients, and is Certified Organic. There’s a really nice light citrusy scent, which I really like in Vitamin C products. It feels nice on the skin and can be worn under any moisturizer or makeup. This is organic and there is also aloe, spirulina, Japanese green tea, blue-green algae, tons of vitamins, and more than 20 Organic Botanical extracts and essential oils in it! You can even use this serum around the eyes and on the neck. It isn’t greasy, so it won’t clog your pores or make you break out. There’s also a little airless pump, which makes application easier. This is great for your skin now, and also offers anti-aging benefits, so you are caring for your future skin, as well as your current skin…all with amazingly beneficial ingredients. And there’s a 2 year guarantee on this, so you’re bound to love it!</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t expect it but saw a softening of lines around my mouth within a couple of weeks. This product seems to last forever because you use so little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this serum and for know I only will by this anti-aging serum my face look more clear from the sun damage&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Buy this!!!!!!!! You will notice an improvement within a couple days!!!  Ordering more for my family because I am so impressed. Can&#x27;t stop examining my skin because it&#x27;s such a great change! Also EXCELLENT customer service. I received within 3 days of order and they have followed up with me twice to ensure I&#x27;m satisfied!!! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about product and company!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an organic product for your skin don&#x27;t look any further.  Mistaya offers a wonderful line of organic facial products.  I received my product very quickly and started using it the same evening.  My first impression.. the smell is incredible and its feels so fresh and clean when applied.  The texture is silky smooth and it doesn&#x27;t take a large amount of serum to cover my face and neck.  As a consumer I am continuously looking for Organic products that are budget friendly and work well.  Mistaya meets this criteria.  I have used the Anti-Aging / Anti Wrinkle Serum for over a week and can feel the softening on my face and neck.  My husband likes the fresh scent when I come to bed.  Mistaya is a product line that I will continue to use in my daily routine. This is a terrific find!</li>
            <li> This is like magic awesome surum for the face. Makes it so soft and bright less wrinkles and frown lines. I did receive the product for review</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling skincare serum I have ever smelled.  The first thing I check when I purchase something is the smell and this one is wonderful. It is a cross between a cucumber, and an orange.  Very fresh smelling. I tried the Mistaya Organic Skincare Vitamin C serum this evening before I went to bed. This serum is a little thicker than most serums but it glides on your skin so very easily. It seeps right into your skin immediately and you can notice the softness within a minute.  I really try to use organic beauty products any chance I have because I believe they have to be so much better than the chemical loaded products.  This one has such things as green tea, aloe vera, and spirulina.  All are said to promote healthier and younger looking skin. I am going to continue with this lotion to see what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced price in return for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a staple product for any season, any climate. My skin feels and looks much better after using Mistaya Skincare. Amazing product!  Customer for life!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the citrus fragrance and the texture of this. It feels nice on skin. However, I couldn&#x27;t give it a 5-star because I noticed no improvement. Not sure what would happen if I continued using it for another month, though. Other reviews are very promising. Perhaps, it works for most skin types, but not mine.  09/11/2015 I&#x27;m adding to my review. I love this product! The ingredients are all very healthful. It must be helping. I live in the high desert where the climate is especially drying. This product moisturizes without any oily residue. I wish it came in a larger size. I would like to see a hand lotion by Mistaya; I imagine that it would be awesome.</li>
            <li> AAA+++++ new product on the market! A definitely worthwhile buy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product feels like silk going onto my skin, and leaves a beautiful healthy glow. After only 2 weeks of use, I cannot believe the positive changes in my skin; the fine lines around my eyes and mouth slowly diminishing, the light weightless feel of the product leaving my skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated, and the natural fresh scent are amazing. I am a 40 year old female who has used skin care products regularly for the past 10 years and this one has most definitely stood out as a fabulous new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a user of Estee Lauder products for a very long time, repeatedly using the  Estee Lauder Idealist Pore Minimizing Skin Refinisher &amp; the Estee Lauder - Perfectionist [CP+R] Wrinkle Lifting/Firming Serum , I would definitely give this product superior reviews  with the overall texture and initial results, but what makes it that much more appealing are the all organic ingredients and the far more reasonable price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering in the future and watching for more products to adopt into my daily regime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer for life!</li>
            <li> I love the scent! It feels really light on skin, and my skin looks great after I used it for a week. It&#x27;s the best skin care product I have ever had in all these years.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see much difference in skin, somewhat drying</li>
            <li> I have particularly sensitive skin and am really careful about what I put on it, especially on my face. In some areas of my face, my skin is so dry that I can&#x27;t leave the shower without putting on moisturizer. In other areas of my face, my skin is so greasy that if I use too heavy of a moisturizer it leads to more oil build-up and problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C Serum is so light that it doesn&#x27;t add to the oily build and so effective that I can actually use it without moisturizer. The bonus for me is knowing that I&#x27;m not applying a bunch of chemicals and toxins on my skin. And I love the fresh mild scent of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this product. I apply it twice a day under my regular moisturizer. It is not greasy and does not affect the application of my makeup. Because it is made from natural ingredients, I feel confident applying it around my eyes. It has a very pleasant scent and is very economical because you use very little of the product. The packaging is nicely done; I especially love the pump dispenser so the product does not get contaminated. Great product!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to order this product for her and she has used it for about 3 weeks. She was very impressed with the results as she has tried many other big name brand products that did not work. She was especially happy with the results on her neck where many other products did nothing. She also was very happy with the fact this product is 100% organic as she has become very careful about using synthetic products and the long term effect they may have. She also mentioned the serum just felt good on her skin and that a small amount was all she had to use each day. We have recommended this product to others as well and we look forward to trying some of the the other Mistaya Organic products as they become available.</li>
            <li> Just got this product and I already know I&#x27;ll buy it again. It smells so refreshing, feels great on my skin and I love that I can use it under my eyes too.</li>
            <li> Product is great. Has a wonderful scent. It clears up spots and reduce fine lines. I use it around my eyes, face, and neck. Ingredients are natural and organic, which provides confidence in the product. I brought several bottles after initial purchase as I fear the price will go up after people start discovering its benefits.</li>
