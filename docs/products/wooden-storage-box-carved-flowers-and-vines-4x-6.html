            <li>they are nice.</li>

            <li>Just started studying Tarot and need a nice bag or box for my cards.</li>
            <li>Nicely made.</li>
            <li>Surely it&#x27;d be a nice stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>My Rider Waite tarot pack fitly nicely inside the box, which I bought it for, but I collecting boxes anyway.  </li>

            <li>Love these boxes -</li>
            <li>The workmanship on the boxes construction could have been better but was acceptable for the price.</li>
            <li>and I am able to smell what I think is the wood stain, but it certainly isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering... or even noticable from more than an inch away.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good price.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping more beautiful in person than the add.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll even enjoy just touching the intricate carving.</li>
            <li>carving is much as it appears in the photo here, though the picture doesn&#x27;t give a good sense of scale.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those unique pieces that just looking at,  would cheer you up, and make you feel better.</li>
            <li>Then I put some really strong incense in it.</li>
            <li>No huge deal, but it could use a bit more on the finishing aspect for it to be perfect.</li>
            <li>The smell is unmistakable and strong.  </li>
            <li>If it would deal better when you close it that would be cool.</li>
            <li>or otherwise they won&#x27;t fit in the box.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, just as described.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using and even just looking at this box.</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re great for spare change, small jewelry or just a great, all-around box.</li>
            <li>I had originally chosen this item to go with my Japanese/cherry blossom themed room.</li>

            <li>The package came right on time too.</li>

            <li>Useful for many different things.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not magic in the manufacture or workmanship; it&#x27;s the joy you take in having possession of such a lovely piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>One was made quite nicely the other ....</li>

            <li>This is a beautiful little wooden box.  </li>
            <li>I really like the carving on the box.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t complain that much.</li>
            <li>Really like, but know what 4x6 is</li>
            <li>I have actually bought several of these great wooden boxes.  </li>
            <li>Rustic hand carved look and fast delivery</li>
            <li>It is a very versatile piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not so much.  </li>
            <li>But they absolutely serve my purposes.  </li>
            <li>Very nice box thought it was goin to b a little bit bigger</li>
            <li>Is a little bit small but is perfect for the decoration of my bedroom</li>
            <li>this is a great small wooden box</li>
            <li>This is a nice and inexpensive small wooden box suitable for storing a standard size tarot deck.</li>
            <li>The box is adequate to hold a pack of cards, which means that it&#x27;d also be nice as a small jewelry box (such as for a 13-year-old who hasn&#x27;t acquired much yet).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice small box.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad looking box for the price, but it is obvious they used motor oil to stain the wood.  </li>
            <li>They are wooden and just the perfect size to keep some jewelry in or other little trinkets.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy thick wood and nicely stained.  </li>
            <li>the inside was not finished like the outside, kind of rough fuzzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>recommend this box highly.</li>
            <li>The box does have a slight smell but nothing too strong, you cant smell it unless it is within an inch or two of your face.</li>
            <li>Be sure you want a small box.</li>
            <li>This is one of the &#x27;Small Treasures&#x27;, you could afford to buy for yourself, but would love receiving from someone else.</li>
            <li>This box is very pretty and ornately carved, however, the box does not stay closed.  </li>
            <li>It has an old fashioned feel to it.</li>
            <li>I really needed a larger box, but that has nothing to do with the Box, Itself.</li>
            <li>The fit and finish is fine, and the carving is a little on the rough side, but I don&#x27;t feel any sharp edges or anything with it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;d be fine for you-and-me, but it&#x27;s hard to wrap.</li>
            <li>The box is small enough to fit on the side table and decorative</li>
            <li>I gave it to my grand child, because the outside measurement does not match the inside measurement, therefore I was unable to really put anything in it.</li>
            <li>The pattern is a familiar one to me since days long past.  </li>
            <li>I just bought a pair of earrings as a present, and while they are very pretty their \\&quot;packaging\\&quot; was a small cloth bag.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t matter to me that much if the box is closed completely,  or not.  </li>
            <li>Has a slight odor I fixed with some peppermint essential oil, other than that, the box is small, if using it to hold tarot cards, make sure your cards are about the size of a bicycle deck</li>

            <li> The fit and finish is fine, and the carving is a little on the rough side, but I don&#x27;t feel any sharp edges or anything with it.</li>

            <li> It did have a slight smell which is the only complaint I had, but since I am storing Bakhoor incense in it, that isn&#x27;t going to be an issue for me.</li>
            <li> Seeing that I rubbed them down well with a cloth and had no issues.</li>

            <li> I was really excited to receive this, but when I did I was slightly disappointed.  </li>

            <li> This box was meant to be a treasure box for my daughter. That&#x27;s not happening. The box is old; it is roughly carved with sharp edges and has rusted screws holding the hinges on. It stinks so horribly that I left it outside, it smells like diesel fuel. I am thinking it will just be a porch ornament.</li>
            <li> Extremely well made for the price. Very pretty. I use it for small jewelry.</li>
            <li> It is a great box and for the price is a steal. I am not sure why previous people were so upset with the quality cause they are nice. The box does have a slight smell but nothing too strong, you cant smell it unless it is within an inch or two of your face. I did order this one and got the darker colored box in the mail, which is why i give this 4 stars. I am happy with the darker colored one but it really is not what i ordered.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased one of these to ship my mustache to a friend.  It was essential that the box be roughly the width of my face, be semi-fancy, and have a hinge.    Also it&#x27;s pretty cheap.    See it in action:[...]</li>
            <li> Just got my box today and it looks wonderful.... it will be used to hold prayers on a Christian altar... we write our prayers on small sheets of flash paper  they are put in the box... at the end of the service will pray over the prayer requests ...then using one of the candles on our altar we will burn them up.... flash paper burns with no ash the burning of the flash paper is the symbolic act releasing our prayers to God... this is a great small wooden box it&#x27;s pretty and was a great price....</li>
            <li> I really like the carving on the box. It has an old fashioned feel to it. It is as described and was shipped quickly and with care.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> The box was perfect! You could tell it was hand made and is perfect for the keepsake that we wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It arrived safe and sound, and it&#x27;s exactly what i expected. I don&#x27;t expect perfection for the price I paid, but it&#x27;s darn close! It did have a slight smell which is the only complaint I had, but since I am storing Bakhoor incense in it, that isn&#x27;t going to be an issue for me. (I think the smell was from some kind of oil they used to finish the box) The fit and finish is fine, and the carving is a little on the rough side, but I don&#x27;t feel any sharp edges or anything with it. The wood has nice natural variations in color and it&#x27;s a sturdy nice little wooden box. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Smells strongly like old motor oil. It has a yellow oil on it that comes off on your hands. I scrubbed it with murphy&#x27;s oil soap and rubbed orange oil and bee&#x27;s wax into it several times. Then I put some really strong incense in it. Hopefully this will help.</li>
            <li> Just started studying Tarot and need a nice bag or box for my cards. Perfect for my needs and very pretty.</li>
            <li> other reviews didnt give this itrem justive. i think the box is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this box! The lid on it doesn&#x27;t just lift open, but isn&#x27;t hard to lift either. It makes it so that if it were to fall all of your items wouldn&#x27;t just pop out on you. For me, I use this box for my 20+ belly button rings and I have plenty of space left. The price was a steal. Yes, the box does have a smell... it smells like wood, people! It&#x27;s not pungeant at all and you can&#x27;t smell it unless you stick your nose in it. Also, my hinges are fine and I have no trouble opening the box. The carvings aren&#x27;t rough at all and the little crevices work wonders for jewelry lovers who don&#x27;t want their belongings rolling around and getting lost during a change. I am so happy with this and have absolutely no problems. I had originally chosen this item to go with my Japanese/cherry blossom themed room. The item looks exactly like it does in the photo. If I ever need another one, I won&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> Does NOT CLOSE!!! There is an inner lip on the lower half that meets the upper half and it is cut crooked so one side sticks up higher making it impossible to close the box. VERY MAD! This was a gift and I cannot give it to someone broken!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy thick wood and nicely stained.  The pattern is a familiar one to me since days long past.  But still a very nice pattern, indeed.  A small box for a couple of smail decks to be stored in.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is BEAUTIFUL!! The box has such wonderful detail all over it and it is absolutely beautiful! So glad I got this!!</li>
            <li> Box is came darker than pictured. It has a weird odor. It smells like an herb. Pretty sturdy box but it is somewhat hard to open. I am using it for my jewelry and it does its job so can&#x27;t complain that much. Pretty good price.</li>
            <li> Really like, but know what 4x6 is, I wish I&#x27;d gotten a larger size to match my other wooden box</li>
            <li> Is a little bit small but is perfect for the decoration of my bedroom</li>
            <li> This box is very pretty and ornately carved, however, the box does not stay closed.  It stays open about a quarter of an inch.  I don&#x27;t know if there is something wrong with the hinge, or if the wood is warped or something.  I keep my tarot cards in the his box, so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me that much if the box is closed completely,  or not.  It just isn&#x27;t as well made as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a tad bigger but other than that I&#x27;m very happy with this! The package came right on time too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice small box.  The lid is tight and sticks, so it is hard to open.  Be sure you want a small box. I didn&#x27;t find that it had an odor or sharp edges.</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing! came in perfect condition and is perfect for what i needed it for!! will definitely order from them again!</li>
            <li> I have actually bought several of these great wooden boxes.  They are beautiful and very well made.  They are wooden and just the perfect size to keep some jewelry in or other little trinkets.  They make great gifts as well.  The design on the box is flowers and vines.  It is so well made and so beautiful and it is a great price too.  The size is accuate at being 4\\&quot; x 6\\&quot;.  I think it is a great box!</li>
            <li> Very nice box thought it was goin to b a little bit bigger then it was but still very nice box</li>
            <li> The box was very nice and decorative. My wife loves it and it in display in the living room.  I will purchase another as a gift in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a great box.  It is sturdy and I love the design.  I used it to hide a clue in a scavenger hunt and ended up giving it away to my girlfriend to use a jewelry box.  She loves it.  It is a great size, sturdy build, and the design is great. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this storage box for my husband to store his e-cigarette cartridges inside. The box is small enough to fit on the side table and decorative so I like that it is on display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some of the other reviews, the wooden box did not have any strong odors and it was in perfect condition upon arrival.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty box, the carvings are beautiful, but mine was a bit uneven and I have to re-nail the hinges. No huge deal, but it could use a bit more on the finishing aspect for it to be perfect. Has a slight odor I fixed with some peppermint essential oil, other than that, the box is small, if using it to hold tarot cards, make sure your cards are about the size of a bicycle deck or otherwise they won&#x27;t fit in the box.</li>
            <li> Nicely made. Good box for my tarot cards.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something small, wooden, &amp; pretty to keep just a few jewelry items in.  This box was my perfect choice.  I read some other reviews that complained of an odor and I am able to smell what I think is the wood stain, but it certainly isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering... or even noticable from more than an inch away.  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to a friend.  :)</li>
            <li> I picked this item because this will be use for my tarot cards when I use them for my services.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the purpose. Rustic hand carved look and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I just bought a pair of earrings as a present, and while they are very pretty their \\&quot;packaging\\&quot; was a small cloth bag. That&#x27;d be fine for you-and-me, but it&#x27;s hard to wrap. When I was putting in a larger order, Amazon offered me this box, without shipping costs, at a discount. I decided to get this small box as a conveyance (it&#x27;s nicer than a throwaway cardboard box!), and it looks like it&#x27;ll do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carving is much as it appears in the photo here, though the picture doesn&#x27;t give a good sense of scale. The box is adequate to hold a pack of cards, which means that it&#x27;d also be nice as a small jewelry box (such as for a 13-year-old who hasn&#x27;t acquired much yet). The construction is not incredible (don&#x27;t expect this to become a family heirloom) but it&#x27;s good enough for casual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think a gift recipient would swoon over this small carved box, but it&#x27;s certainly pretty and inexpensive. Surely it&#x27;d be a nice stocking stuffer. Besides, my mom taught me, \\&quot;What do you get someone who has everything? a box to keep it in!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> There is NOTHING WRONG with this Box Except that I underestimated the Size that I needed ! I really needed a larger box, but that has nothing to do with the Box, Itself.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping more beautiful in person than the add. I sent it to my mother for a mothers day present for her jewelry and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful little wooden box.  Good quality, perfect size, beautiful color.  The carvings are lovely too.  Very happy with this purchase!  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Lid was crooked, didn&#x27;t  shut properly!!</li>
            <li> I have many of this type of box. I order them frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 1 in 7 that I order is defective in some way. But if you get a good one, it&#x27;s a great little box, ideal for storage of small items.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, just as described.</li>
            <li> This box is definitely fancy enough for a small treasures storage box. You&#x27;ll even enjoy just touching the intricate carving. The workmanship is excellent. The hinged lid works well, and fits the box snugly. I enjoy using and even just looking at this box. It is definitely a &#x27;display&#x27; piece, and would look well on dressing tables, bureaus, desks, bookcases, cabinets, etc. It is a very versatile piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this box for storing My Radiant Tarot Deck. The box is lovely, and fits the card deck very well.  It is decorative enough that I can store the cards in plain sight, and have them near when I want them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable for the workmanship. This is one of the &#x27;Small Treasures&#x27;, you could afford to buy for yourself, but would love receiving from someone else. It&#x27;s one of those unique pieces that just looking at,  would cheer you up, and make you feel better. We call them &#x27;Dellights to the Heart&#x27;. It&#x27;s not magic in the manufacture or workmanship; it&#x27;s the joy you take in having possession of such a lovely piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this box highly.</li>
            <li> The box arrived promptly and was as described. The carvings are rough, but well defined and it gives it that hand made feel. The box had just a hint of the chemical smell others have mentioned but I think,it was just the stain used on the box. All in all, for the price it is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Not a bad looking box for the price, but it is obvious they used motor oil to stain the wood.  The smell is unmistakable and strong.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different ways to get rid of the smell but it persists, and makes it pretty much unusable.</li>
            <li> This storage box is not big but just perfect for jewelry and such. The box looks very good only desk and does not stand out looking odd like others boxes I have had. The craftsmanship on the box is very good I feel.</li>
            <li> Love these boxes - They look good on the dresser and seal tightly. They&#x27;re great for spare change, small jewelry or just a great, all-around box.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this, but when I did I was slightly disappointed.  The only things wrong were:&lt;br /&gt;1. the inside was not finished like the outside, kind of rough fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;2. box does not close 100% because the inside is slightly mis-measured.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! One of mine did have a crack in it though.</li>
            <li> This box literally feel apart in multiple areas when I opened it. It did provide some entertainment and laughter as it was a birthday gift and we were all shocked at the poor  quality. The scent from the wood was to be expected. (Because Amazon is awesome they refunded our purchase.). Unless you don&#x27;t mind doing a little woodworking and being prepared to reglue and nail your new purchase you may want to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Fits a regular Tarot deck but not oracle cards.  Got two.  One was made quite nicely the other .... not so much.  But they absolutely serve my purposes.  Oh, but the oil does need to be blotted.  The boxes they came in were oil stained.  Seeing that I rubbed them down well with a cloth and had no issues.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product... I ordered it for my father&#x27;s ashes.  Useful for many different things.  The carving is amazing!</li>
            <li> My Rider Waite tarot pack fitly nicely inside the box, which I bought it for, but I collecting boxes anyway.  All around satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and inexpensive small wooden box suitable for storing a standard size tarot deck. The floral carving on the box is pretty. The workmanship on the boxes construction could have been better but was acceptable for the price. The only really negative thing I would say about it is the smell. No doubt something used in coloring the wood.</li>
            <li> If it would deal better when you close it that would be cool.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a four star ratting because i thought it was wonderful. No damage and excelent shipping time. But it was a little darker in person than it was on the screen but thats bound to happen so the all over review its a wonderful deal and its a good product.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my grand child, because the outside measurement does not match the inside measurement, therefore I was unable to really put anything in it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend, who is into tarot, as a nice way to store his tarot cards.  He loves it, though, he was puzzled when he opened it because he said it looked like a box to store your &amp;#34;stash&amp;#34;... Once he realized what it was, he was very happy with it and said his cards fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well made and delicately carved and for a great price.  If you are looking for a place to store your tarot cards or your stash, this is a great item.</li>
