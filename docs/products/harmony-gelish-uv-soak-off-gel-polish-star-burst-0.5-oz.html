            <li>Great for fall</li>

            <li>Gelish polishes are wonderful, do not clump, goes on smoothly!  </li>
            <li>Good for Spring 2015.</li>
            <li>but once you do the cleanser step you will have perfectly harden and smooth nails.</li>
            <li>Loved the color.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t surprising considering where I was.</li>
            <li>, this still looks good and is still sticking.</li>

            <li>Absolutely LOVE this color and LOVE Gelish period!!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this color after I get four coats on!</li>
            <li>Love gelish!</li>
            <li>If your hands aren&#x27;t in water all the time, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>This color is amazing.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice but will need 3 coats.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as a warm medium grapey purple.  </li>
            <li>and I would say the shimmer to be a warm pinky purple....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice sparkly purple color.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage.</li>
            <li>looks so nice on nails.</li>
            <li>Also make sure you wipe off all excess nail polish that might get on your skin around your nail after each step before you put it in the lamp or it will harden on your skin and than when it peels off it will peel off the nail polish from your nail and ruin your good looking nail polish.</li>
            <li>so I bought my own.</li>
            <li>I will say that after a month, the color has kind of grown on me, though once in awhile</li>
            <li>But I am thinking, if you had some nice effect topcoats, it COULD be salvageable.sing considering where I was.</li>

            <li>But I am thinking, if you had some nice effect topcoats, it COULD be salvageable.</li>
            <li>Covered nicely with 2 coats.</li>
            <li>great polish color, The color swatch is true to the shade</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product for my daughter to go along with her new gel manicure set.  </li>
            <li>would love to give this product a great review but in light of my experiences I can not.</li>
            <li>This color is very cute and it works great with the LED light or Uv light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to the Gelish line, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing deal on a product I love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice purple &amp; it&#x27;s very rich.</li>
            <li>Also its VERY nice to go right to doing things like washing the dishes like mins after finishing your nails,</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the Gelish line and am very pleased with this color.</li>
            <li>We layered June Bride over it and it looked fine, but it wasn&#x27;t anything like the swatch!  </li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love the color-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this color.</li>
            <li>Love this color.  </li>
            <li>negatives, but could be better if it&#x27;s the color shown on the monitor.</li>
            <li>She has most colors swatched</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I did two coats of color but think 3 coats would of given me better coverage.  </li>
            <li>Color is fantastic!</li>
            <li>The color is more of a purplish / magenta with shimmer.</li>
            <li>and I received many compliments.  </li>
            <li>One was more of a pinkish color, lovely for summer but not PURPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with this color.  </li>
            <li>how many girls would love to do their nails one a month?</li>
            <li>more violet.</li>
            <li>It has become one of my favorite Gelish shades.</li>
            <li>I love the gelish nail process.</li>
            <li>I have now fallen in love with this brand name and type of nail polish.</li>
            <li>Make sure you pair these nail polishes with the foundation, top coat, uv gel lamp, and gel cleanser</li>
            <li>and I love the gel polishes no problem.</li>
            <li>Thanks Harmony for a great product.</li>
            <li>and I love the gel polish.</li>
            <li>My favorite gel polish color.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I love the color and, like all Gelish polish, it lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li>and I had many compliments after applying this shade.</li>
            <li>I love it for summer but would not hesitate to use it in fall</li>
            <li>But compared to regular polish it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>While I love the selections of colors, after using Harmony Gelish for over 3 months, my nails are trashed.</li>
            <li>but looking at this color and seeing her struggle with it, I don&#x27;t think I could have gotten any better results with it.</li>
            <li>This color looks more of a grape color on the picture-that&#x27;s why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>It is actually more of a magenta based purple.</li>
            <li>I like Berry Buttoned Up better</li>
            <li>This will be one of my favorite colors for this spring and summer:-)</li>
            <li>My favorite color.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous about trying the purple color, but glad I took a chance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i love</li>
            <li>one of my favorite colors of gel polish.</li>
            <li>This color swatch on line is more off than others-</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>Because of the pink/purple undertones of this polish, I think the color combinations when layering will be interesting.  </li>
            <li>More to follow soon.</li>
            <li>Love the gelish nail color...</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this color of gelish.  </li>
            <li>My  nails are always on point with my favorite gelish polish  </li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>The most accurate swatches I&#x27;ve found are here:</li>
            <li>Best money I ever spent!</li>
            <li>Applies easily</li>
            <li>Goes on easy.</li>
            <li>Hands down the BEST nail polish ever!</li>
            <li>I painted my six-year old daughter&#x27;s nails with Star Burst, and it didn&#x27;t look anything like the swatch, which is a bright purple.  </li>
            <li>I have had the same nail polish on for a 1.5 weeks and it still looks great.</li>
            <li>Smooth application.</li>
            <li>I tried it alone, then layered it with Night Reflection and the results were fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The formula went on smoothly without any streaking.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and great product will order again thanks</li>
            <li>Just the color I was looking for it is not dull as the picture looks even better on!</li>
            <li>I love this color and it is very very close to the color depicted in the picture.</li>
            <li>It did take me three layers off polish to archive an even and rich purple color.</li>
            <li>Works great and lasts long!</li>
            <li>I painted my 16-year old daughter&#x27;s nails today with it, and although it did look better on her nails (probably because there&#x27;s more surface on them), it still took three coats to make it a saturated color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect if you want a dark color but still pretty.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the deep purple, but this is just pretty light purple.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing remarkable about this except farily easy application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By far my favorite one!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true to the photo.  </li>
            <li>this color is gorgeous, the color is the same as what u see.</li>
            <li>The color is true to the picture.</li>
            <li>polish is a true purple.  </li>
            <li>One of the top 3 colors they do and very versatile as well.</li>
            <li>The soak off is not bad if you use a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>I think because it is pretty sheer with one coat it will go very nicely with Night Reflection.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that they&#x27;re usually pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>It is a VERY pretty shimmery purple.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle  shimmer to it and would look great with a glitter on top.</li>
            <li>This is one of my new Favorite colors.</li>
            <li>is so pretty!</li>
            <li>It coats very evenly and smoothly</li>
            <li>I think this color is pretty true to the pic on the computer.</li>
            <li>was so hoping this would be worth the money we invested.</li>
            <li>I have had to take nippers and clip the top, as it lifted near my cuticles.</li>
            <li>I have had to take nippers and clip the top, as it lifted near my cuticles.</li>
            <li>They are very fast on delivery and products are new &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>is just right</li>
            <li>I am very busy and hard on my nails and this color holds up perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful purple, with a subtle sparkle to it.  </li>
            <li>We layered June Bride over her nails also and it really is a pretty color, but just not what the Gelish swatch is on the Gelish website, and way off from the Amazon swatch.  </li>
            <li>Pretty shade in plum-tone.  </li>
            <li>Gelish is great for a long lasting manicure!</li>
            <li>love how simple it is and the lasts 3 weeks</li>
            <li>This color is exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you get everything you need to do the application properly.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more colors.</li>
            <li>but it is a pretty shimmer purple color</li>
            <li>Berry Buttoned Up is more shimmery than this one and a very similar color.  </li>
            <li>Many times the color on the swatch doesn&#x27;t match the actual color but this one is pretty dang close.</li>
            <li>This combination yields a color almost exactly the same color as the swatch shows with more shimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve posted the pic with my first layering experiment.  </li>
            <li>A good few weeks on my nails and two months on my toes.</li>
            <li>I received this color today and am very pleased it is slightly lighter than pictured with two coats applied.</li>
            <li>It is not too dark and not too light, just a good basic purple.</li>
            <li>I love the gelish system don&#x27;t know if I will go back to normal POLISH!</li>
            <li>Its slightly lighter than the picture, but still a nice color.  </li>
            <li>, I would certainly  recommend  </li>
            <li>its amazing no more waiting 24 hours to make sure it is set properly before you do anything with your hands or put shoes on.</li>
            <li>I really like this color.  </li>
            <li>It looked more of a washed-out baby pink with a purple tint.  </li>
            <li>polish arrived so fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very close to the picture.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast with no issues</li>
            <li>This arrived safely and quickly in careful packaging.</li>
            <li>I really like this color.</li>
            <li>It has a metallic sheen, and goes on very well, but the picture is misleading.</li>
            <li>Color was very close to the picture.</li>
            <li>It is a lot more pink than indicated on line-</li>
            <li>ONly took 30 seconds-1 minute to set under the uv light.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well from this seller.</li>
            <li>and it really pops for summer.</li>
            <li>Ok not exactly grape</li>
            <li>Seems to be better quality than other gel polish I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>I have bought several colors of gel polish hoping go find a true purple.  </li>
            <li>The quality is nice and a manicure could last at a minimal of 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It is kind of flashy but still rich in quality and coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is easy and fast fast fast no more smudges in my nail polish.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty color!</li>
            <li>i put it on like normal nail polish</li>
            <li>She loves the color, which looks like a dark-ish bright pink with a slight purple tint.  </li>
            <li>Love the color plain or with glitter to jazz it up a bit.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to Gelish or gel nails, or need some tips and tricks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to put at least 3 coats on to get a good solid purple.</li>
            <li>I would call it a royal purple (not bright though) with a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you do THIN layers, the first time i did it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sheer, so you will need three or four coats to get the dark shiny purple, but being sheer it can also be put over another color to create your own shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very fun color, used it with Black for a reverse mani</li>
            <li>The gel cleanser you need because after you dry the top coat it will still feel like its wet and sticky</li>
            <li>You can only see the shimmer if you look very closely.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using Gelish  2 months</li>
            <li>I wanted strength along with beauty on my natural nails.</li>
            <li>But... I do work in a hospital with frequent hand washing</li>
            <li>By far one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>So far all my colors that I got</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the color or application of this compared to the other Gelish products.  </li>
            <li>The second time i took my time and make sure i had little polish on my brush for each step to do thin layers and it turned out 100% better.</li>
            <li>In general the tech didn&#x27;t seem to truly know what she was doing</li>
            <li>We have switched back to a clear OPI gel in hopes my nails will heal some.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: So far several strangers have commented that they like my nail polish color, however....</li>
            <li>no regrets this is</li>
            <li>The sparkles are small more like a shimmer, not large flakes of glitter.  </li>
            <li>I think that is because it is pretty sheer in comparison to the other Gelish polish.  </li>
            <li>I placed other polish orders a day earlier, yet this one came first.  </li>

            <li> Color stays true for two weeks and LASTS!!!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a beautiful shade of almost purple.</li>
            <li> color was beautiful</li>
            <li> I take this to my nail salon and it looks beautiful on</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit lighter, but the color is still beautiful.</li>
            <li> Two coats makes for beautiful color.</li>
            <li> I just got around to trying this color out and am very pleased!  </li>
            <li> did two coats, very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Gelish is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great purchase.</li>

            <li> Great color.</li>
            <li> and I was completely happy.</li>

            <li> Polish was great.</li>
            <li> but this is still a great color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pinkish purple and great for any season.</li>
            <li> Great transaction.</li>
            <li> Great for fall</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful choice without being garish or inappropriately bright.  </li>
            <li> Purple is my favorite color and this one looks great!</li>
            <li> Gelish polishes are wonderful, do not clump, goes on smoothly!  </li>
            <li> Good for Spring 2015.</li>
            <li> but once you do the cleanser step you will have perfectly harden and smooth nails.</li>
            <li> Loved the color.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t surprising considering where I was.</li>
            <li> , this still looks good and is still sticking.</li>
            <li> , this still looks good and is still sticking.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> good product,nice price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This color is sooo pretty!!I would imagine the color would look good on any skin tone.</li>
            <li> the gelish seems to stay on even longer than 3 weeks and still looks good.  </li>
            <li> the quality of the Polish is  good</li>
            <li> If you love purple this will make you happy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this color and LOVE Gelish period!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this color after I get four coats on!</li>
            <li> Love gelish!</li>
            <li> If your hands aren&#x27;t in water all the time, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Love this color!</li>
            <li> This color is amazing.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice but will need 3 coats.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as a warm medium grapey purple.  </li>
            <li> and I would say the shimmer to be a warm pinky purple....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sparkly purple color.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage.</li>
            <li> looks so nice on nails.</li>
            <li> Also make sure you wipe off all excess nail polish that might get on your skin around your nail after each step before you put it in the lamp or it will harden on your skin and than when it peels off it will peel off the nail polish from your nail and ruin your good looking nail polish.</li>
            <li> so I bought my own.</li>
            <li> I will say that after a month, the color has kind of grown on me, though once in awhile</li>
            <li> But I am thinking, if you had some nice effect topcoats, it COULD be salvageable.sing considering where I was.</li>

            <li> Covered nicely with 2 coats.</li>
            <li> great polish color, The color swatch is true to the shade</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product for my daughter to go along with her new gel manicure set.  </li>
            <li> would love to give this product a great review but in light of my experiences I can not.</li>
            <li> This color is very cute and it works great with the LED light or Uv light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to the Gelish line, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal on a product I love</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice purple &amp; it&#x27;s very rich.</li>
            <li> Also its VERY nice to go right to doing things like washing the dishes like mins after finishing your nails,</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the Gelish line and am very pleased with this color.</li>
            <li> We layered June Bride over it and it looked fine, but it wasn&#x27;t anything like the swatch!  </li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love the color-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this color.</li>
            <li> Love this color.  </li>
            <li> negatives, but could be better if it&#x27;s the color shown on the monitor.</li>
            <li> She has most colors swatched</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I did two coats of color but think 3 coats would of given me better coverage.  </li>
            <li> Color is fantastic!</li>
            <li> The color is more of a purplish / magenta with shimmer.</li>
            <li> and I received many compliments.  </li>
            <li> One was more of a pinkish color, lovely for summer but not PURPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with this color.  </li>
            <li> how many girls would love to do their nails one a month?</li>
            <li> more violet.</li>
            <li> It has become one of my favorite Gelish shades.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish nail process.</li>
            <li> I have now fallen in love with this brand name and type of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Make sure you pair these nail polishes with the foundation, top coat, uv gel lamp, and gel cleanser</li>
            <li> and I love the gel polishes no problem.</li>
            <li> Thanks Harmony for a great product.</li>
            <li> and I love the gel polish.</li>
            <li> My favorite gel polish color.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I love the color and, like all Gelish polish, it lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> and I had many compliments after applying this shade.</li>
            <li> I love it for summer but would not hesitate to use it in fall</li>
            <li> But compared to regular polish it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> While I love the selections of colors, after using Harmony Gelish for over 3 months, my nails are trashed.</li>
            <li> but looking at this color and seeing her struggle with it, I don&#x27;t think I could have gotten any better results with it.</li>
            <li> This color looks more of a grape color on the picture-that&#x27;s why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> It is actually more of a magenta based purple.</li>
            <li> I like Berry Buttoned Up better</li>
            <li> This will be one of my favorite colors for this spring and summer:-)</li>
            <li> My favorite color.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous about trying the purple color, but glad I took a chance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i love</li>
            <li> one of my favorite colors of gel polish.</li>
            <li> This color swatch on line is more off than others-</li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> Because of the pink/purple undertones of this polish, I think the color combinations when layering will be interesting.  </li>
            <li> More to follow soon.</li>
            <li> Love the gelish nail color...</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this color of gelish.  </li>
            <li> My  nails are always on point with my favorite gelish polish  </li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> The most accurate swatches I&#x27;ve found are here:</li>
            <li> Best money I ever spent!</li>
            <li> Applies easily</li>
            <li> Goes on easy.</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST nail polish ever!</li>
            <li> I painted my six-year old daughter&#x27;s nails with Star Burst, and it didn&#x27;t look anything like the swatch, which is a bright purple.  </li>
            <li> I have had the same nail polish on for a 1.5 weeks and it still looks great.</li>
            <li> Smooth application.</li>
            <li> I tried it alone, then layered it with Night Reflection and the results were fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The formula went on smoothly without any streaking.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and great product will order again thanks</li>
            <li> Just the color I was looking for it is not dull as the picture looks even better on!</li>
            <li> I love this color and it is very very close to the color depicted in the picture.</li>
            <li> It did take me three layers off polish to archive an even and rich purple color.</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts long!</li>
            <li> I painted my 16-year old daughter&#x27;s nails today with it, and although it did look better on her nails (probably because there&#x27;s more surface on them), it still took three coats to make it a saturated color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect if you want a dark color but still pretty.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the deep purple, but this is just pretty light purple.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing remarkable about this except farily easy application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By far my favorite one!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s true to the photo.  </li>
            <li> this color is gorgeous, the color is the same as what u see.</li>
            <li> The color is true to the picture.</li>
            <li> polish is a true purple.  </li>
            <li> One of the top 3 colors they do and very versatile as well.</li>
            <li> The soak off is not bad if you use a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I think because it is pretty sheer with one coat it will go very nicely with Night Reflection.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that they&#x27;re usually pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> It is a VERY pretty shimmery purple.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle  shimmer to it and would look great with a glitter on top.</li>
            <li> This is one of my new Favorite colors.</li>
            <li> is so pretty!</li>
            <li> It coats very evenly and smoothly</li>
            <li> I think this color is pretty true to the pic on the computer.</li>
            <li> was so hoping this would be worth the money we invested.</li>
            <li> I have had to take nippers and clip the top, as it lifted near my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have had to take nippers and clip the top, as it lifted near my cuticles.</li>
            <li> They are very fast on delivery and products are new &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> is just right</li>
            <li> I am very busy and hard on my nails and this color holds up perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful purple, with a subtle sparkle to it.  </li>
            <li> We layered June Bride over her nails also and it really is a pretty color, but just not what the Gelish swatch is on the Gelish website, and way off from the Amazon swatch.  </li>
            <li> Pretty shade in plum-tone.  </li>
            <li> Gelish is great for a long lasting manicure!</li>
            <li> love how simple it is and the lasts 3 weeks</li>
            <li> This color is exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you get everything you need to do the application properly.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more colors.</li>
            <li> but it is a pretty shimmer purple color</li>
            <li> Berry Buttoned Up is more shimmery than this one and a very similar color.  </li>
            <li> Many times the color on the swatch doesn&#x27;t match the actual color but this one is pretty dang close.</li>
            <li> This combination yields a color almost exactly the same color as the swatch shows with more shimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted the pic with my first layering experiment.  </li>
            <li> A good few weeks on my nails and two months on my toes.</li>
            <li> I received this color today and am very pleased it is slightly lighter than pictured with two coats applied.</li>
            <li> It is not too dark and not too light, just a good basic purple.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish system don&#x27;t know if I will go back to normal POLISH!</li>
            <li> Its slightly lighter than the picture, but still a nice color.  </li>
            <li> , I would certainly  recommend  </li>
            <li> its amazing no more waiting 24 hours to make sure it is set properly before you do anything with your hands or put shoes on.</li>
            <li> I really like this color.  </li>
            <li> It looked more of a washed-out baby pink with a purple tint.  </li>
            <li> polish arrived so fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very close to the picture.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast with no issues</li>
            <li> This arrived safely and quickly in careful packaging.</li>
            <li> I really like this color.</li>
            <li> It has a metallic sheen, and goes on very well, but the picture is misleading.</li>
            <li> Color was very close to the picture.</li>
            <li> It is a lot more pink than indicated on line-</li>
            <li> ONly took 30 seconds-1 minute to set under the uv light.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well from this seller.</li>
            <li> and it really pops for summer.</li>
            <li> Ok not exactly grape</li>
            <li> Seems to be better quality than other gel polish I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> I have bought several colors of gel polish hoping go find a true purple.  </li>
            <li> The quality is nice and a manicure could last at a minimal of 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It is kind of flashy but still rich in quality and coverage.  </li>
            <li> It is easy and fast fast fast no more smudges in my nail polish.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color!</li>
            <li> i put it on like normal nail polish</li>
            <li> She loves the color, which looks like a dark-ish bright pink with a slight purple tint.  </li>
            <li> Love the color plain or with glitter to jazz it up a bit.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to Gelish or gel nails, or need some tips and tricks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to put at least 3 coats on to get a good solid purple.</li>
            <li> I would call it a royal purple (not bright though) with a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you do THIN layers, the first time i did it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sheer, so you will need three or four coats to get the dark shiny purple, but being sheer it can also be put over another color to create your own shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very fun color, used it with Black for a reverse mani</li>
            <li> The gel cleanser you need because after you dry the top coat it will still feel like its wet and sticky</li>
            <li> You can only see the shimmer if you look very closely.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using Gelish  2 months</li>
            <li> I wanted strength along with beauty on my natural nails.</li>
            <li> But... I do work in a hospital with frequent hand washing</li>
            <li> By far one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> So far all my colors that I got</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the color or application of this compared to the other Gelish products.  </li>
            <li> The second time i took my time and make sure i had little polish on my brush for each step to do thin layers and it turned out 100% better.</li>
            <li> In general the tech didn&#x27;t seem to truly know what she was doing</li>
            <li> We have switched back to a clear OPI gel in hopes my nails will heal some.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: So far several strangers have commented that they like my nail polish color, however....</li>
            <li> no regrets this is</li>
            <li> The sparkles are small more like a shimmer, not large flakes of glitter.  </li>
            <li> I think that is because it is pretty sheer in comparison to the other Gelish polish.  </li>
            <li> I placed other polish orders a day earlier, yet this one came first.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my bottle was in the heat too long when it got shipped?  </li>
            <li> Regular nail polish wouldn&#x27;t even last 12 hours on my nails with being a mom and my hands always doing thing, especially with harsh chemicals/soaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;like to use it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;color</li>
            <li> This product will save you money in the long run because it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> It lasts so long!</li>
            <li> but i couldnt get it to dry to save my soul.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost the color in the picture with little sparkles mixed in.  </li>
            <li> Not quite pink</li>
            <li> Picture shows absolutely no justice.  </li>
            <li> It seems werid to rub something onto your nail when it feels wet still</li>
            <li> The color was as expected.</li>
            <li> Their selection of colors was limited; I was looking for black or grey but settled on what appeared to be a deep dark black purple in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this problem with my other Gelish colors, so</li>
            <li> Not exactly a grape,</li>
            <li> not sure if i was not supposed to 2nd coat?</li>
            <li> The shimmer is pink!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and will not buy any more of this brand.</li>
            <li> I had to clip off my long nails because they split so badly if they tore it would be down to the quick.</li>
            <li> This color is not a cream color due to the slight shimmer.  </li>
            <li> You know how the Gelish bottles are, it&#x27;s hard to tell what the ACTUAL color is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her bottle was also quite thick, I was going to attribute this to the fact that it&#x27;s a huge bottle of salon product and has probably been used a lot, but I see other people unhappy with the application</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve put it on over a base coat of either a dark purple or light pink, which helps</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically go for purple polish, but,  this color is a winner.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the color is much less saturated and lighter than it seems in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This one is slightly shimmery and Berry Buttoned Up is quite shimmery.  </li>
            <li> I have used other gel products for several years and never had my nails peel and be so thin as I have with Gelish,  They are sore and hurt .</li>
            <li> and I had to do three coats on her little nails to make it even.  </li>
            <li> I have worn it quite a few times...</li>
            <li> My manicurist and i both purchased quite a few colors.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t an outfit IN MY CLOSET that would in any way match or coordinate with this radioactive waste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge purple lover</li>
            <li> but if you like less shimmer this is the color for you!</li>
            <li> and I received the product in just a few days!</li>
            <li> As usual, Gelish did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> She had to apply three coats of this color, and even then I&#x27;m not happy with how little opacity it has.</li>
            <li> But it sucks.</li>
            <li> This color just sucks.</li>
            <li> how this looks, on my pinkish-pale skin tone, this looks garish and cheap and disgusting.</li>
            <li> and it was too thick and caused it to peel faster than it should.</li>
            <li> (she did the base at 3 minutes, really???)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the seller sold a bad batch or what, but it peels and hands down the worst Gelish color I own.</li>
            <li> It sounds weird, but it happens every time I use this polish and doesn&#x27;t happen with the other Gelish colors.</li>
            <li> I was getting sick of paying $30 twice a month to get my nails done at the salon, this seller has made it possible for me to do this myself and saved me a ton of money for years to come.</li>
            <li> my nails are weak</li>
            <li> I knew I&#x27;d hate it, but she had already started and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with starting over.</li>
            <li> then you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried OPI and it stinks.</li>
            <li> I notice just how bad it looks against my skintone and have a moment of regret.</li>
            <li> I notice just how bad it looks against my skintone and have a moment of regret.</li>
            <li> I just hate using this color.  </li>

            <li> I really like this color.  For some reason though I experience a lot of shrinkage.  I don&#x27;t have this problem with my other Gelish colors, so I know it&#x27;s not a technique issue.  I love the color- it&#x27;s true to the photo.  I just hate using this color.  Maybe my bottle was in the heat too long when it got shipped?  Who knows.  But it sucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost the color in the picture with little sparkles mixed in.  I&#x27;m still getting used to the Gelish line, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.  It&#x27;s been on for a week with no chipping!</li>
            <li> Not quite pink but it&#x27;s a beautiful shade of almost purple. Goes on very smoothly. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this color.</li>
            <li> I received this color today and am very pleased it is slightly lighter than pictured with two coats applied. It coats very evenly and smoothly I love the gelish system don&#x27;t know if I will go back to normal POLISH!</li>
            <li> Gelish gel polish is the best!!! N this color is gorgeous, the color is the same as what u see. A lot of gelish gel polishes don&#x27;t match the color swatches but this one does. always look up color swatches on gel/nail polish before ordering. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this color.  Gelish is a great product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the deep purple, but this is just pretty light purple.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing remarkable about this except farily easy application.&lt;br /&gt;No negatives, but could be better if it&#x27;s the color shown on the monitor.</li>
            <li> I painted my six-year old daughter&#x27;s nails with Star Burst, and it didn&#x27;t look anything like the swatch, which is a bright purple.  It looked more of a washed-out baby pink with a purple tint.  It&#x27;s very thin and I had to do three coats on her little nails to make it even.  We layered June Bride over it and it looked fine, but it wasn&#x27;t anything like the swatch!  I painted my 16-year old daughter&#x27;s nails today with it, and although it did look better on her nails (probably because there&#x27;s more surface on them), it still took three coats to make it a saturated color. Her thumbs probably could have used a fourth coat.  She loves the color, which looks like a dark-ish bright pink with a slight purple tint.  We layered June Bride over her nails also and it really is a pretty color, but just not what the Gelish swatch is on the Gelish website, and way off from the Amazon swatch.  The most accurate swatches I&#x27;ve found are here: [...]  She has most colors swatched and I&#x27;ve found that they&#x27;re usually pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome purple color with lots of shine. It is a beautiful choice without being garish or inappropriately bright.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color! Goes on nice but will need 3 coats.</li>
            <li> The color is true to the picture. The quality is nice and a manicure could last at a minimal of 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Pretty shade in plum-tone.  Good for Spring 2015.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this color and LOVE Gelish period!! Hands down the BEST nail polish ever! No chipping for weeks and stays Shiny!! I will never go back to regular polish or even to the nail shop again!!</li>
            <li> I just got around to trying this color out and am very pleased!  I would describe it as a warm medium grapey purple.  It is a shimmer polish and I would say the shimmer to be a warm pinky purple....It is definately a purple polish, but not a really garish purple and definately wearable by people who like a brighter polish, but don&#x27;t necessarily go for really wild shades...did two coats, very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sparkly purple color. The sparkles are small more like a shimmer, not large flakes of glitter.  I did two coats of color but think 3 coats would of given me better coverage.  Gelish is great for a long lasting manicure!</li>
            <li> Color is fantastic! Does not fade, chip or peel.   The soak off is not bad if you use a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the color or application of this compared to the other Gelish products.  I had to use 3 coats in order to get an even application, whereas I would normally only use 2 coats.  I think that is because it is pretty sheer in comparison to the other Gelish polish.  The color is more of a purplish / magenta with shimmer. You can only see the shimmer if you look very closely.  Definitely not my color. I will eventually try this over Night Reflection.  I think because it is pretty sheer with one coat it will go very nicely with Night Reflection. I will post a picture when I try it out!</li>
            <li> Picture shows absolutely no justice.  Awesome color and I received many compliments.  Applies easily and I received the product in just a few days!</li>
            <li> I have bought several colors of gel polish hoping go find a true purple.  One was more of a pinkish color, lovely for summer but not PURPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish is a true purple.  Not exactly a grape, and it is a color that you can wear and not be too \\&quot;flashy\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s very sheer, so you will need three or four coats to get the dark shiny purple, but being sheer it can also be put over another color to create your own shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with this color.  If you love purple this will make you happy.</li>
            <li> color was beautiful but i couldnt get it to dry to save my soul. Used hair dryer, used nail drying spray.  ended up having to remove it.  will try again later.  not sure if i was not supposed to 2nd coat?</li>
            <li> I love this color and it is very very close to the color depicted in the picture. It also apples smoothly, perfect consistency.</li>
            <li> Best money I ever spent! perfect color every time. love how simple it is and the lasts 3 weeks how many girls would love to do their nails one a month?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically go for purple polish, but,  this color is a winner. It is not an eggplant purple...more violet. It has become one of my favorite Gelish shades.</li>
            <li> I think this color is pretty true to the pic on the computer. It&#x27;s a nice purple &amp; it&#x27;s very rich. Nice coverage.</li>
            <li> looks so nice on nails. i get a lot of compliments. my friends always demand this color when i do their nails</li>
            <li> I love the gelish nail process. It is easy and fast fast fast no more smudges in my nail polish. This color is very cute and it works great with the LED light or Uv light</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites... I have worn it quite a few times... Love it!!! I will recommend it to all...</li>
            <li> This color is exactly as shown.  I would call it a royal purple (not bright though) with a nice sheen.  I&#x27;m not a huge purple lover but I like this because it&#x27;s a nice/neutral purple.  Not too light/not too loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish arrived so fast.  I placed other polish orders a day earlier, yet this one came first.  In fact I&#x27;m still waiting for a polish that was supposed to come today, yet didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have now fallen in love with this brand name and type of nail polish. Regular nail polish wouldn&#x27;t even last 12 hours on my nails with being a mom and my hands always doing thing, especially with harsh chemicals/soaps. I have had the same nail polish on for a 1.5 weeks and it still looks great. Just make sure you get everything you need to do the application properly. I used the gelish website and under their tab that says application to teach me how to do it properly and what all i needed. Make sure you pair these nail polishes with the foundation, top coat, uv gel lamp, and gel cleanser or you will not get the results you want. Make sure you do THIN layers, the first time i did it i put it on like normal nail polish and it was too thick and caused it to peel faster than it should. The second time i took my time and make sure i had little polish on my brush for each step to do thin layers and it turned out 100% better. Also make sure you wipe off all excess nail polish that might get on your skin around your nail after each step before you put it in the lamp or it will harden on your skin and than when it peels off it will peel off the nail polish from your nail and ruin your good looking nail polish. The gel cleanser you need because after you dry the top coat it will still feel like its wet and sticky but once you do the cleanser step you will have perfectly harden and smooth nails. It seems werid to rub something onto your nail when it feels wet still but it won&#x27;t ruin your polish like you would assume it just takes off the sticky stuff some how. Awesome stuff and i can not wait to grow my color collection. Saves tons of money since i don&#x27;t have to go to the salon for my nails anymore. Also its VERY nice to go right to doing things like washing the dishes like mins after finishing your nails, its amazing no more waiting 24 hours to make sure it is set properly before you do anything with your hands or put shoes on. I have instantly after doing my nails did dishes and folded laundry and my nails would still be perfect afterwards.</li>
            <li> order was on time. product was perfect!!</li>
            <li> Loved the color. It&#x27;s very close to the picture. A deep purple with shimmer- but not sparkle. As usual, Gelish did not disappoint. Smooth application. I could have gotten away with 2 coats, but went for a deeper color with 3. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a technique issue or what, but I find this color tends to \\&quot;run\\&quot; a lot when applying it and moves all over the place. I have to go back over and repaint the tips because the polish moves off of them. It sounds weird, but it happens every time I use this polish and doesn&#x27;t happen with the other Gelish colors. Not one of my favorites at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Changed my review to one star. This color just sucks. I&#x27;m not sure if the seller sold a bad batch or what, but it peels and hands down the worst Gelish color I own. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using Gelish  2 months and I love the gel polishes no problem. Two coats and it shows the actual color.</li>
            <li> very beautiful color I have always had great experience with Harmony gelish polish. I will be back for more colors. Thanks Harmony for a great product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful purple, with a subtle sparkle to it.  It did take me three layers off polish to archive an even and rich purple color.</li>
            <li> Color looks great on.  One of the top 3 colors they do and very versatile as well. Buy it yourself!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy. Great color.</li>
            <li> Ok not exactly grape but it is a pretty shimmer purple color and I love the gel polish. This is one of my new Favorite colors. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My favorite gel polish color. My salon ran out and never restocked so I bought my own.</li>
            <li> I love this color after I get four coats on! As others have said, the color is much less saturated and lighter than it seems in the bottle. In fact, it&#x27;s so sheer that I if I don&#x27;t put on four coats, it&#x27;s streaky and unattractive. However, I&#x27;ve put it on over a base coat of either a dark purple or light pink, which helps but I still end up using three coats of this color. Nevertheless, I love the color and, like all Gelish polish, it lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> I think the color was represented well and was very happy with the finished product. it has a hint of sparkle to it</li>
            <li> great polish color, The color swatch is true to the shade and I had many compliments after applying this shade.</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous!! It&#x27;s perfect if you want a dark color but still pretty. Shipped fast with no issues and I was completely happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this polish for several weeks and just tried it this weekend.  It is kind of flashy but still rich in quality and coverage.  I love it for summer but would not hesitate to use it in fall but that may be because I wear what I want no matter the season (except no white shoes/clothes after Labor Day...I&#x27;m a Jersey Girl..it&#x27;s just not done: LOL).  I would order it with confidence and if pinks and purples suit you then you can&#x27;t go wrong.  This arrived safely and quickly in careful packaging.</li>
            <li> Purple is my favorite color and this one looks great! Love gelish! It lasts so long! A good few weeks on my nails and two months on my toes. The only problem is once it grows out it does start to peel and sometimes my hair gets caught in the edges. But compared to regular polish it is wonderful. Will never go back to regular after using gel.</li>
            <li> While I love the selections of colors, after using Harmony Gelish for over 3 months, my nails are trashed. I have used other gel products for several years and never had my nails peel and be so thin as I have with Gelish,  They are sore and hurt . I had to clip off my long nails because they split so badly if they tore it would be down to the quick. My manicurist and i both purchased quite a few colors. My manicurist had to take the gelish off her nails as well for the same reason.&lt;br /&gt;I was so hoping this would be worth the money we invested. We have switched back to a clear OPI gel in hopes my nails will heal some.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to give this product a great review but in light of my experiences I can not.</li>
            <li> If you are new to Gelish or gel nails, or need some tips and tricks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWRFDI073BON/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R3VWRFDI073BON&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my nails done at a salon while traveling, and Gelish was the only brand they had. Their selection of colors was limited; I was looking for black or grey but settled on what appeared to be a deep dark black purple in the bottle. You know how the Gelish bottles are, it&#x27;s hard to tell what the ACTUAL color is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the tech applied this, I wanted to throw up. I knew I&#x27;d hate it, but she had already started and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with starting over. She had to apply three coats of this color, and even then I&#x27;m not happy with how little opacity it has. Her bottle was also quite thick, I was going to attribute this to the fact that it&#x27;s a huge bottle of salon product and has probably been used a lot, but I see other people unhappy with the application so I will make mention of it. In general the tech didn&#x27;t seem to truly know what she was doing (she did the base at 3 minutes, really???) but looking at this color and seeing her struggle with it, I don&#x27;t think I could have gotten any better results with it. She actually persevered through this, whereas I would have given up, thrown out the bottle and maybe asked my client to pick another color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is like....someone threw up Barney on my nails. I *loathe* how this looks, on my pinkish-pale skin tone, this looks garish and cheap and disgusting. It looks like I don&#x27;t know how to do my nails and just bought some ten cent polish at a garage sale and went at it. There isn&#x27;t an outfit IN MY CLOSET that would in any way match or coordinate with this radioactive waste color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color shown onsscreen is so pretty! But what&#x27;s on my nails is like its far-distant nuclear-tainted cousin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So far several strangers have commented that they like my nail polish color, however....it wasn&#x27;t surprising considering where I was. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m going to say.&lt;br /&gt;I have had this on a month now and I&#x27;ll give it credit, despite the problem the tech had applying it, this still looks good and is still sticking. I have had to take nippers and clip the top, as it lifted near my cuticles. I will say that after a month, the color has kind of grown on me, though once in awhile I notice just how bad it looks against my skintone and have a moment of regret. It&#x27;s just so---not for me. But I am thinking, if you had some nice effect topcoats, it COULD be salvageable.sing considering where I was.

            <li> I take this to my nail salon and it looks beautiful on but I suggest having them put on three coats to get the color as shown</li>
            <li> The delivery was prompt, packaged well. The color was as expected. It stayed on for the two weeks and did not  chip.</li>
            <li> I really like this color. It is a VERY pretty shimmery purple. I think the color is lighter that the one shown in the Gelish picture. The shimmer is pink! Covered nicely with 2 coats.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t quite the same as the one pictured.  Also, it did not last/have the same quality as another brand.  I was disappointed and will not buy any more of this brand.</li>
            <li> This color looks more of a grape color on the picture-that&#x27;s why I purchased it.  It is actually more of a magenta based purple. and way lighter than I thought it would be.  It has a metallic sheen, and goes on very well, but the picture is misleading.</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit lighter, but the color is still beautiful.</li>
            <li> Gelish is always wonderful and this color is beautiful!!!  This color is not a cream color due to the slight shimmer.  Berry Buttoned Up is more shimmery than this one and a very similar color.  This one is slightly shimmery and Berry Buttoned Up is quite shimmery.  I like Berry Buttoned Up better but if you like less shimmer this is the color for you!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a hell of a lot cheaper than beauty supply which sells it for twenty bucks.  Works great and lasts long!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal on a product I love I was getting sick of paying $30 twice a month to get my nails done at the salon, this seller has made it possible for me to do this myself and saved me a ton of money for years to come. They are very fast on delivery and products are new &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought the gel products bc my nails are weak n I wanted strength along with beauty on my natural nails. The application would only last a week. But... I do work in a hospital with frequent hand washing</li>
            <li> Awesome color!  Gelish polishes are wonderful, do not clump, goes on smoothly!  Would recommend to anyone wanting to have their nails done at home, inexpensively.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product for my daughter to go along with her new gel manicure set.  Good quality product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the Gelish line and am very pleased with this color. Many times the color on the swatch doesn&#x27;t match the actual color but this one is pretty dang close. This will be one of my favorite colors for this spring and summer:-)</li>
            <li> My favorite color.  I wear it constantly.  Goes well with my skin tone and I get lots and lots of compliments on the color.  Wears well...2 weeks and sometimes into 3 weeks.  I was nervous about trying the purple color, but glad I took a chance.  This is perfect!</li>
            <li> good product,nice price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like to use it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;color is just right&lt;br /&gt;i love gelish&lt;br /&gt;happy buyer</li>
            <li> Polish was great. Color was very close to the picture. Seems to be better quality than other gel polish I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> This color is sooo pretty!!I would imagine the color would look good on any skin tone.Color stays true for two weeks and LASTS!!!!</li>
            <li> Gelish gel polishes are very good quality, and all the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Great polish and great brand! Love the color plain or with glitter to jazz it up a bit.  Will continue to buy this brand.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite colors of gel polish. Stayed on for well over the 2 week time period. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This color swatch on line is more off than others- but this is still a great color. It is a lot more pink than indicated on line- I got a ton of compliments when I used this with vegas nights over it.</li>
            <li> I love this color. You have to put at least 3 coats on to get a good solid purple. ONly took 30 seconds-1 minute to set under the uv light.</li>
            <li> I had to try this polish the day I got it.  I tried it alone, then layered it with Night Reflection and the results were fantastic.  I used two coats of Night Reflection then one coat of Star Burst. This combination yields a color almost exactly the same color as the swatch shows with more shimmer. Because of the pink/purple undertones of this polish, I think the color combinations when layering will be interesting.  I&#x27;ve posted the pic with my first layering experiment.  More to follow soon.</li>
            <li> Gelish brand is definitely the gel polish brand to go with. I&#x27;ve tried OPI and it stinks. And the Shellac brand doesn&#x27;t have all the colors that Gelish does.</li>
            <li> Love the gelish nail color...the gelish seems to stay on even longer than 3 weeks and still looks good.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous!  It&#x27;s a pinkish purple and great for any season. The formula went on smoothly without any streaking. Two coats makes for beautiful color. By far one of my favorites.  Fast shipping as well from this seller. Great transaction.</li>
            <li> Just the color I was looking for it is not dull as the picture looks even better on! fast shipping and great product will order again thanks</li>
            <li> This color is amazing. I got tons of compliments on it. A very fun color, used it with Black for a reverse mani and it really pops for summer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this color of gelish.  I have several colors and I find that this color stays on the longest of all the shades I have. I am very busy and hard on my nails and this color holds up perfectly.  By far my favorite one!</li>
            <li> So far all my colors that I got I have no complains I always take my polish to the salon. My  nails are always on point with my favorite gelish polish  the quality of the Polish is  good I get lots of complement  the color of the Polish is the same as the picture  , I would certainly  recommend  no regrets this is were I get all my gel polish       Thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> I love this color. It is not too dark and not too light, just a good basic purple. Great for fall or if you wear a lot of purple like I do. It has a subtle  shimmer to it and would look great with a glitter on top.</li>
            <li> This product will save you money in the long run because it lasts so long. If your hands aren&#x27;t in water all the time, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Love this color! Its slightly lighter than the picture, but still a nice color.  Had to use three coats though to get the perfect coverage and shade.</li>
