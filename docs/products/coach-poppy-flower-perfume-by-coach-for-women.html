            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love this scent better than Poppy.  </li>
            <li>One of the better perfumes I have sampled.  </li>
            <li>But I love it, very clean smell.</li>
            <li>I love the light, lovely scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery,  good product. .</li>
            <li>The item came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>they love the true scent.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it smells so pretty and bottle is stunning.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that is not overbearing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a light floral scent.  </li>
            <li>It was a genuine Coach product in the manufacture&#x27;s box and plastic.  </li>
            <li>this is just to give you an idea of the family of things I like to wear and where a scent like this would fit it.  </li>
            <li>It is a great size and should last for months...</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>It had the original coach box and even the bottle was original</li>
            <li>Amazon was cheaper :) The perfume is sweet, but not too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>but I get tons of complements on how good I smell daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice soft floral smell.  </li>
            <li>Have to check  the local Target store for another coach perfume because this kind was to strong for me and my step daughter</li>
            <li>it smells super sweet.</li>
            <li>Quick quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It is worthy and meet my expectation.</li>
            <li>Be safe and spend the extra $20 to buy from a reputable seller.</li>
            <li>My old favorite, L&#x27;Effleur, was discontinued years ago.  </li>
            <li>This is the first scent that can hold a candle to it.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this fragrance again. :-)</li>
            <li>I would absolutely order again!</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s exactly what</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but I agree with another post, the smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying this perfume</li>
            <li>Buy it if you can get it, if not the other Coach fragrances are similar and pretty good too!</li>
            <li>To help give you a reference of my personal favorite scent, my go to perfume is Escape.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The perfume and its packaging were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It seems to last a good long while, too.  </li>
            <li>This has a strong, longer lasting flowery scent yet not gagging to be around, just pleasurable!  </li>
            <li>The perfume has a really good scent and it last for quite long time.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; (sometimes I get scared buying fragrances online rather than walking straight into Sephora, etc.).  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was packaged very well by the vendor, OxKom.  </li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>It came reaaalllllllyyyyyyyy fast</li>
            <li>The seller was fast and sent me what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping is fast (no waiting 3-4 days jut for it to ship like with some fragrance shippers)</li>
            <li>It was shipped fast with no issues.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Bottle is very decorative as well.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but cap seal broke after a few weeks</li>
            <li>At least it smells good.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to open it.</li>
            <li>I know that this is her second bottle of it and will most likely end up buying it again.</li>
            <li>Decent price for a discontinued perfume.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never worn this fragrance before I would highly suggest it.  </li>
            <li>But isn&#x27;t it wild how our bodies react to certain perfumes?</li>
            <li>Smelled like a cheap imitation perfume from the flea market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely, but not overwhelming fragrance that doesn&#x27;t fade as the day progresses.</li>
            <li>It is pretty enough to display on the vanity.</li>
            <li>love, love this perfume, Poppy Flower not to be confused with the other 2  in this collection Coach.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 and it doesn&#x27;t smell too young for me as I thought it would</li>
            <li>near the inflated price.</li>
            <li>Some other fragrances I wear are Marc Jacobs Daisy, Dolce and Gabanna Light Blue, and Burberry....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend only purchasing in a sealed package.  </li>
            <li>Had a little difficulty with shipping but the product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>it was a reasonable price i looked other places and smaller ounces</li>
            <li>not lasting barely scented, has no lingering smell almost non existent, did not return since its being used, wouldn&#x27;t mind refund</li>
            <li>Now this is the deal, I have been wearing this perfume for 2 years , this particular bottle, the only one ordered online, smells the same, but  the fragrance does not last as long.</li>

            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The perfume and its packaging were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> It seems to last a good long while, too.  </li>
            <li> This has a strong, longer lasting flowery scent yet not gagging to be around, just pleasurable!  </li>
            <li> The perfume has a really good scent and it last for quite long time.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; (sometimes I get scared buying fragrances online rather than walking straight into Sephora, etc.).  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was packaged very well by the vendor, OxKom.  </li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> It came reaaalllllllyyyyyyyy fast</li>
            <li> The seller was fast and sent me what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Thanks...</li>
            <li> Also, the shipping is fast (no waiting 3-4 days jut for it to ship like with some fragrance shippers)</li>
            <li> It was shipped fast with no issues.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Bottle is very decorative as well.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but cap seal broke after a few weeks</li>
            <li> At least it smells good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to open it.</li>
            <li> I know that this is her second bottle of it and will most likely end up buying it again.</li>
            <li> Decent price for a discontinued perfume.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never worn this fragrance before I would highly suggest it.  </li>
            <li> But isn&#x27;t it wild how our bodies react to certain perfumes?</li>
            <li> Smelled like a cheap imitation perfume from the flea market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely, but not overwhelming fragrance that doesn&#x27;t fade as the day progresses.</li>
            <li> It is pretty enough to display on the vanity.</li>
            <li> love, love this perfume, Poppy Flower not to be confused with the other 2  in this collection Coach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 and it doesn&#x27;t smell too young for me as I thought it would</li>
            <li> near the inflated price.</li>
            <li> Some other fragrances I wear are Marc Jacobs Daisy, Dolce and Gabanna Light Blue, and Burberry....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend only purchasing in a sealed package.  </li>
            <li> Had a little difficulty with shipping but the product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> it was a reasonable price i looked other places and smaller ounces</li>
            <li> not lasting barely scented, has no lingering smell almost non existent, did not return since its being used, wouldn&#x27;t mind refund</li>
            <li> Now this is the deal, I have been wearing this perfume for 2 years , this particular bottle, the only one ordered online, smells the same, but  the fragrance does not last as long.</li>
            <li> I received my order on time if not a little earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I could smell her all night long.</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;exactly&amp;#34; the same fragrance I had gotten my wife previously at Macy&#x27;s, but no&lt;br /&gt;where</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t small like old lady, powder, or anything else that I&#x27;ve run into with other \\&quot;floral\\&quot; scents.  </li>
            <li> This has not only been a waste of time, but of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 years and will continue as long as I can get it from Amazon!</li>
            <li> The one I received, felt, watered down?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad it has been discontinued, but hopefully I stocked up enough to last for a little while!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate and found 4 bottles after it was devastatingly discontinued several months ago.  </li>
            <li> Thought I would save a few dollars and buy here.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wearing almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Also came with a few samples of perfumes and a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> i usually LOVE this ,but unfortunately the bottle i recieved, i believe was either a fraud knock off bottle or a bad batch</li>
            <li> I buy this at Kohls usually.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is from storage or its a knock off.</li>
            <li> People either water these down or fake them altogether.  </li>
            <li> This product did come in a timely manner, however it was the WRONG product.</li>
            <li> Sadly my wife was wrong</li>
            <li> so I got the wrong perfume</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong thing, meant to purchase coach poppy.</li>
            <li> And not to mention this cheap horrible disgusting fake smell fades off within an hour if that</li>
            <li> Which would be awkward.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed never will I order perfume online from theses places unless it&#x27;s Macys.</li>
            <li> but what smell it did have was like musty mothballs :(&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> but then when I spray it it was horrible</li>
            <li> smelled so awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, smells great!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these for for sister and a friend, both love the fragrance and receive compliments for it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I received my order on time if not a little earlier than expected. I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  Have been using it since it came out. It has a light scent that is not overbearing</li>
            <li> I buy this at Kohls usually.  Thought I would save a few dollars and buy here.  Big mistake.  It is diluted and smells week.  I have also noticed I am having a reaction when I spray it on my chest and it stings my wrist.</li>
            <li> Better as described! And this scent is absolutely amazing, I cant stop smelling myself when I wear it and I got so many compliments I even bought the Coach lotion to go with it.</li>
            <li> Quick quick shipping. Perfect product. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> My old favorite, L&#x27;Effleur, was discontinued years ago.  This is the first scent that can hold a candle to it.  It&#x27;s got a light floral scent.  Doesn&#x27;t small like old lady, powder, or anything else that I&#x27;ve run into with other \\&quot;floral\\&quot; scents.  My husband and my 8 y/o son both love it, too.  It seems to last a good long while, too.  It&#x27;s a sophisticated floral, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> This product did come in a timely manner, however it was the WRONG product. As stated in the description for the item, it is Coach Poppy Flower. The order I received was Coach Poppy. Additionally, I cannot return the item because it is &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; since it&#x27;s flammable. This has not only been a waste of time, but of money.</li>
            <li> was given as a gift.  they love the true scent.  very pleased</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter.  It arrived very quickly and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this smell!  It arrived on time and was packaged very well by the vendor, OxKom.  It was a genuine Coach product in the manufacture&#x27;s box and plastic.  It arrived undamaged and in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> Beautiful flowery scent. Not overpowering at all. Received nonstop compliments on how great it smells. I will definitely purchase this fragrance again. :-)</li>
            <li> I still have this Perfume and it smells so good.It also came in great condition and I recommend you to go out and buy it.</li>
            <li> I love loved the smell in the store but for some reason - when I put it on...it smells super sweet. I do wear it...occasionally and feel 16 again, every time. And Lord knows I&#x27;m so not 16. I&#x27;m a weirdo who likes to wear different smells depending on the season and activity. This tends to be my spring date night. Haha. It smells divine on my sister inlaw however. I could smell her all night long. Which would be awkward. So I don&#x27;t. But isn&#x27;t it wild how our bodies react to certain perfumes? Smell it! Wear it! And then decide if you&#x27;re prepared to smell sweet and innocent!!</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell. Great size. perfect for my daughters gift.  she loves it.</li>
            <li> Good quality item. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely order again! My perfume arrived on time as promised at a great price!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,  good product. .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price</li>
            <li> Great delivery.  Item was just as described.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a cheap price. I ordered hoping I wasn&#x27;t going to get scammed. And that&#x27;s exactly what I got SCAMMED!!!!! It came reaaalllllllyyyyyyyy fast I was so excited to open it. It had the original coach box and even the bottle was original but then when I spray it it was horrible smelled so awful. Smelled like a cheap imitation perfume from the flea market. I was so disappointed never will I order perfume online from theses places unless it&#x27;s Macys. Waste of money. And not to mention this cheap horrible disgusting fake smell fades off within an hour if that but that&#x27;s a good thing you wouldn&#x27;t wana be smelling like that.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but cap seal broke after a few weeks so now it will evaporate faster. My hubby likes me to wear it often.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but I agree with another post, the smell doesn&#x27;t last. I feel it&#x27;s a knock-off after trying this perfume at Macy&#x27;s - though it smelled the same, the one in the store stayed with me longer. The one I received, felt, watered down? If you will.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying this perfume and I will stick to it for a while. The scent is unique and wonderful. I get a lot of compliments on it. It isn&#x27;t too overpowering and it lasts through the work day.</li>
            <li> The seller was fast and sent me what I wanted.  Sadly my wife was wrong I so I got the wrong perfume; I got this scent for her last year and she wanted Poppy Blossom.  I can&#x27;t return it because the factory plastic wrap was removed.  Oh well, the seller was good on their part.  Thanks...</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, decent price!  This has a strong, longer lasting flowery scent yet not gagging to be around, just pleasurable!  Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate and found 4 bottles after it was devastatingly discontinued several months ago.  They replaced that scent with another but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as amazing.  I have strangers complimenting me regularly and all of my friends ask for a spritz every time they come over, and now I have to say no because I&#x27;m hoarding it. Buy it if you can get it, if not the other Coach fragrances are similar and pretty good too!</li>
            <li> love, love this perfume, Poppy Flower not to be confused with the other 2  in this collection Coach. Now this is the deal, I have been wearing this perfume for 2 years , this particular bottle, the only one ordered online, smells the same, but  the fragrance does not last as long. I don&#x27;t know if this is a knock off or if the Coach people have changed the formula.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. I know that this is her second bottle of it and will most likely end up buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It isn&#x27;t overpowering, lasts all day and I get tons of compliments on it! It&#x27;s all I wear.</li>
            <li> I love my Coach Poppy flower Eau De Parfum Spray ... It arrived on time.. It smells Wonderful.. so everywhere I go .. I arrive smelling Beautiful ..</li>
            <li> I came across this perfume in a local store and compared the price to Amazon. Amazon was cheaper :) The perfume is sweet, but not too much. The smell last all day. To help give you a reference of my personal favorite scent, my go to perfume is Escape.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Great price( on sale)!  My grand daughter was thrilled with it!!!  She loves  the smells of Coach products!</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it it was a reasonable price i looked other places and smaller ounces cost more</li>
            <li> Perfume don&#x27;t smell good</li>
            <li> came quickly, smells great</li>
            <li> Great purchase!  This is absolutely &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; (sometimes I get scared buying fragrances online rather than walking straight into Sephora, etc.).  If you&#x27;ve never worn this fragrance before I would highly suggest it.  It is something that would work for anyone and for both day and night occasions.  I always get compliments on it.  Also, it is a fragrance that lasts!  Definitely go for the 3.4 oz bottle, as you&#x27;re going to want to have it around for a while!  Some other fragrances I wear are Marc Jacobs Daisy, Dolce and Gabanna Light Blue, and Burberry....this is just to give you an idea of the family of things I like to wear and where a scent like this would fit it.  It&#x27;s amazing!  Also, the shipping is fast (no waiting 3-4 days jut for it to ship like with some fragrance shippers) so, If in doubt go ahead....it&#x27;s great :)</li>
            <li> Wearing almost everyday. Its smells divine.Heavenly&lt;br /&gt;People stop me to ask what I am wearing</li>
            <li> Had a little difficulty with shipping but the product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Was an excellent gift!</li>
            <li> PERFECT!!! THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Poppy Flower parfum spray before, so I knew what I was getting. It&#x27;s a lovely, but not overwhelming fragrance that doesn&#x27;t fade as the day progresses.</li>
            <li> I love it, it smells so pretty and bottle is stunning. I&#x27;m 35 and it doesn&#x27;t smell too young for me as I thought it would but I get tons of complements on how good I smell daily.</li>
            <li> I love the light, lovely scent. The bottle has a generous amount of product. It is pretty enough to display on the vanity. I always get compliments when I use this scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance, and the price was perfect!  The item came very quickly.  It was packaged perfectly!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love Love this product.... This is one of my favorite smells in a perfume. The sweetness that this perfume has is amazing... I have gotten so many compliments each time i have worn it out.  It&#x27;s a perfume that once you put it on you feel Beautiful .....  It is a great size and should last for months...</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume for years and love it. It was shipped fast with no issues.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Coach perfume. I&#x27;m so sad it has been discontinued, but hopefully I stocked up enough to last for a little while!</li>
            <li> Smell is great but the perfume looks yellowed ... Not sure if this is from storage or its a knock off. Decent price for a discontinued perfume. At least it smells good.</li>
            <li> The perfume has a really good scent and it last for quite long time. It is worthy and meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and it smells amazing (: love love love it!!</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments from wearing this perfume! I highly recommend it! It lasts a while after you put it on.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It smells so good. This was a very good value for the money.  You can&#x27;t seem to buy the big bottles in department stores or through coach</li>
            <li> not lasting barely scented, has no lingering smell almost non existent, did not return since its being used, wouldn&#x27;t mind refund</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soft floral smell.  One of my favorite perfumes!</li>
            <li> Love Coach, excellent scent, perfect size, I gave for a gift, and it was the best for a gift, very good scent, long lasting.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume ! I wear it everyday. I am very happy with fast delivery and the good packaging plus the price was&lt;br /&gt;Very good! A great deal , Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great price. Fast shipping. Great scent. Also came with a few samples of perfumes and a nail clipper. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> As described and received on time.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Hubby picked it out for me and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dads girlfriend for christmas, she loves it!</li>
            <li> Love this scent better than Poppy.  I have both on my bathroom counter.  Bottle is very decorative as well. Try it</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;exactly&amp;#34; the same fragrance I had gotten my wife previously at Macy&#x27;s, but no&lt;br /&gt;where near the inflated price. My wife loves this perfume and... actually, so do I &#x3D;^)</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong thing, meant to purchase coach poppy. But I love it, very clean smell. Decided to keep it and I am so glad I did!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend because the smell is so good! One of the better perfumes I have sampled.  BUT BEWARE! There are a lot of counterfeits out there, especially sellers who sell UNBOXED items! I highly recommend only purchasing in a sealed package.  People either water these down or fake them altogether.  Be safe and spend the extra $20 to buy from a reputable seller.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  Every time I wear it, I get lots of compliments.  It&#x27;s light and refreshing.  Great perfume!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 years and will continue as long as I can get it from Amazon!</li>
            <li> i usually LOVE this ,but unfortunately the bottle i recieved, i believe was either a fraud knock off bottle or a bad batch, it smelled NOTHING like it should,hardley had any smell at all but what smell it did have was like musty mothballs :(&lt;br /&gt;but normaly this is a great parfum with a nice clean scent,one of my fave..</li>
            <li> I ordered for a Christmas Present for my Grandaughter.  She loves the Coach Parfum.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it so its a 5 star.</li>
            <li> very good price, and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Have to check  the local Target store for another coach perfume because this kind was to strong for me and my step daughter</li>
            <li> The perfume and its packaging were exactly what I wanted.</li>
