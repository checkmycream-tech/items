            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product  before, it&#x27;s excellent.  </li>
            <li>but once you start running your hands thru it, it&#x27;ll lossen up but the best part, leaves no flakes or residue.</li>
            <li>So, I will spend the $ for what looks great!  </li>

            <li>This is great for my curly hair.</li>

            <li>It works great, no greasy appearance like the Pureology brand was creating.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great foam...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very glad I did</li>
            <li>I love this mousse!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, like coconut.</li>
            <li>the can is held while dispensing, but upon air contact does immediately foam up nicely.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s huge!</li>
            <li>I love it and use it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>its my favorite mousse.</li>
            <li>As much as I love it, I won&#x27;t buy it unless it is on sale.  </li>
            <li>I am also pleased that this is a cruelty-free product from a cruelty-free</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>(Note: I never order any hair products on line that I haven&#x27;t already tried and loved first)  </li>
            <li>I have been on a long search for great mousse, I think this is it!</li>
            <li>One of the greatest differences I have noticed between this and previous brands is that if I am playing with my hair, or resting my hand in my hair, my hand does not come away feeling sticky like I have product on it.</li>
            <li>sculpting foam inside the can is fine, it&#x27;s the can/spout</li>
            <li>, it still looks natural, just a tad bit better! :)</li>
            <li>i bought it because it is a cruelty free product.  </li>
            <li>And giving hair manageability and control with a light to medium hold.  </li>
            <li>It does add shine, while leaving the hair feeling light.  </li>
            <li>great product..love the smell...adds volume and conditions at the same time.</li>
            <li>It has indeed given me defined curls, with body and fullness; it does prevent frizz to a significant degree.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of the warm coconut smell either!</li>
            <li>It is tipped to be able to make waves with smooth, static-free style; create defined curls, or set hair straight.</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell Sculpting Foam has turned my hair from one big frizz ball to cute and sexy curls that I get complimented on all the time.  </li>
            <li>Does the job adequately for my hair, but I also don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>And you can comb through it easily with a pick and still have nice body at the end of a long day.  </li>
            <li>Just scrunch it in, in your areas that appear flat and air dry or use a defuser on your hair dryer and your hair will look great!  </li>
            <li>Has made my hair shiny and beautiful (even in rain when usually gets frizzy).</li>
            <li>I use about a handful (tennis ball) size and it leaves my curls soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>You only need to use it where you want more fullness, curl or body.  </li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite, I bought this giant bottle</li>
            <li>Comes out a bit more wattery than I am used to but does firm up and goes on hair easily.</li>
            <li>The product, they add, will work on all hair types, including naturally curly or textured hair, reducing frizz significantly, taking control of flyaways, smoothing the surface of the hair.</li>
            <li>The makers further state that its Hawaiian awapuhi extract will add moisture, prevent moisture loss and add shine while styling and bodifying agents combined with panthenol provide a strong hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to order it on line.  </li>
            <li>This product is priced too high here!  </li>
            <li>But this price is too high!  </li>
            <li>the mouse comes out very watery, then puffs up a bit, but just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>When I searched for this sculpting foam, knowing that Paul Mitchell offers this with two different types of spouts, I looked for one with the more durable spout as shown here.</li>
            <li>its lighter and fluffier than other sculpting mousses and its a cruelty-free product from a cruelty-free company :)  </li>
            <li>Most were not strong enough or made my hair not even bendable (like really strong hairspray would do).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the second Paul Mitchell hair product I have recently tried; I have been using it for two or three weeks, and I am even happier with it than I was with the Paul Mitchell Super Clean Sculpting Gel which I also reviewed on its page.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m also realistic in my spending.  </li>
            <li>this is a high quality mousse and highly recommend it, keeps your hair in place</li>
            <li>I love the ease of finding the products I need online at Amazon, which I have trouble finding on store shelves these days, with our economy the way it is.  </li>
            <li>If you have a perm that has relaxed and you want to bring back the curl, just scrunch and let dry and you will love this product too.</li>
            <li>Bottle is HUGE so will last months even with daily use.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and although mousse is always recommended for root lift, I use it to create hold throughout my hair to hold curl and shape in general and smooth ends.</li>
            <li>Huge can and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve never found &amp;#34;anything better&amp;#34; to bring out the natural body, waves and volume in my fine, long, bleach blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I have super, super thick, long hair as well, so my hair can really poof up.  </li>
            <li>It comes out as a liquid and is completely unusable.</li>
            <li>I also use a curling Iron to add volume when needed and this keeps the body and curl looking natural.  </li>
            <li>Because I am 51 years young</li>
            <li>its lighter than hair spray and adds soft structure to hair.  </li>
            <li>I used to not be able to control my thick, frizzy, curly hair and I had tried almost every frizzy/curl product you could think of.  </li>
            <li>The only negative thing I can say about this mousse is that it comes out very watery, but within seconds it foams right up and is very smoothe when applied.</li>
            <li>I put a little in, let my hair dry and then use the flat iron to curl my hair (if this sounds weird; yes, you can curl your hair with a flat iron, it works great!).  </li>
            <li>I have had problems with the dispensing the product in the past, due to the faulty, and rather skimpy red &amp;#34;spout&amp;#34; at the top of the can (it wears out and breaks off before I can use all of the product).</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine, but the can arrived with the nozzle broken.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff will do the trick on it and last all day long.  </li>
            <li> Oh, I also use this in my hair before I curl it with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I use this product sparingly and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when the product arrived, it came with the super flimsy spout that I DID NOT want.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair with a tendency to frizz, and it is very difficult to control in the long hot humid summers of North Carolina.  </li>
            <li> Because i was cursed with that really thick, coarse, Italian hair, I had given up hope</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of $ on trying salon products for over 33 years!  </li>
            <li> I never wore my hair down because it is too curly and would become a frizzy mess..</li>
            <li> I little weird, but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I have awkward wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t quite want to curl, but with this product, my hair is curly and holds its shape throughout the whole day with no frizz.</li>
            <li> This without the feel of a heavy chemical build-up.</li>
            <li> Product comes out watery and stays heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li> No strong smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair fanatic!  </li>
            <li> truly recomend this product if you have unruly thick and frizzy hair that you can&#x27;t control!</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m not happy with.</li>
            <li> So for me, this product is useless.</li>
            <li> That makes it impossible to use without foam squirting out everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy with it.</li>

            <li> This is great for my curly hair. I use about a handful (tennis ball) size and it leaves my curls soft and frizz free. Smells great1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product  before, it&#x27;s excellent.  It&#x27;s so much easier to order it on line.  I&#x27;ll definitely do that again.</li>
            <li> Product does not foam. It comes out as a liquid and is completely unusable.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Sculpting Foam has turned my hair from one big frizz ball to cute and sexy curls that I get complimented on all the time.  I used to not be able to control my thick, frizzy, curly hair and I had tried almost every frizzy/curl product you could think of.  Most were not strong enough or made my hair not even bendable (like really strong hairspray would do).  Because i was cursed with that really thick, coarse, Italian hair, I had given up hope untill I tried this product.  It makes my hair without frizzies, shiny, and bouncy- it felt like i wasn&#x27;t even wearing any product in my hair.  I love it and use it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;I truly recomend this product if you have unruly thick and frizzy hair that you can&#x27;t control! (until now...) I hope it helps!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Has made my hair shiny and beautiful (even in rain when usually gets frizzy). Comes out a bit more wattery than I am used to but does firm up and goes on hair easily. Smells a bit coconut-like. Once on, the results are great. Bottle is HUGE so will last months even with daily use.</li>
            <li> Light-weight, not sticky, bouncy hold for curly hair.</li>
            <li> this is a high quality mousse and highly recommend it, keeps your hair in place but once you start running your hands thru it, it&#x27;ll lossen up but the best part, leaves no flakes or residue. its my favorite mousse.</li>
            <li> I will not pay the listed price for it!  Even though I&#x27;ve never found &amp;#34;anything better&amp;#34; to bring out the natural body, waves and volume in my fine, long, bleach blonde hair.  This product is priced too high here!  It does hold your style beautifully without any residue or stickiness.  And you can comb through it easily with a pick and still have nice body at the end of a long day.  You only need to use it where you want more fullness, curl or body.  You don&#x27;t have to put it all over your hair. Just scrunch it in, in your areas that appear flat and air dry or use a defuser on your hair dryer and your hair will look great!  I also use a curling Iron to add volume when needed and this keeps the body and curl looking natural.  It conditions as well as helps hold style.  I love the ease of finding the products I need online at Amazon, which I have trouble finding on store shelves these days, with our economy the way it is.  But this price is too high!  As much as I love it, I won&#x27;t buy it unless it is on sale.  I keep an eye out for it everywhere I shop for hair products.  (Note: I never order any hair products on line that I haven&#x27;t already tried and loved first)  Because I am 51 years young and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of $ on trying salon products for over 33 years!  I&#x27;m a hair fanatic!  So, I will spend the $ for what looks great!  But I&#x27;m also realistic in my spending.  Having 2 best friends &amp; a sister as beauticians.  I&#x27;ve tried things at discount prices for years!  Only to give them away to friends if they don&#x27;t work for me.  This works Great for me!  I use it daily!  If you have a perm that has relaxed and you want to bring back the curl, just scrunch and let dry and you will love this product too.</li>
            <li> recommended by a co-worker for managing hair.  its lighter than hair spray and adds soft structure to hair.  No strong smell.</li>
            <li> I have been on a long search for great mousse, I think this is it! I have long hair and although mousse is always recommended for root lift, I use it to create hold throughout my hair to hold curl and shape in general and smooth ends. It works great, no greasy appearance like the Pureology brand was creating. One of the greatest differences I have noticed between this and previous brands is that if I am playing with my hair, or resting my hand in my hair, my hand does not come away feeling sticky like I have product on it. It smells nice, like coconut. It does come out watery, no matter the shaking or position the can is held while dispensing, but upon air contact does immediately foam up nicely. I little weird, but I can live with it. Huge can and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> i bought it because it is a cruelty free product.  the mouse comes out very watery, then puffs up a bit, but just don&#x27;t like it. Does the job adequately for my hair, but I also don&#x27;t like the smell. won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Sculpting Foam, 16.9 Ounce is a combination styling and conditioning foam that the manufacturers state will enhance hair’s texture with long-lasting memory. It is tipped to be able to make waves with smooth, static-free style; create defined curls, or set hair straight. The makers further state that its Hawaiian awapuhi extract will add moisture, prevent moisture loss and add shine while styling and bodifying agents combined with panthenol provide a strong hold. The product, they add, will work on all hair types, including naturally curly or textured hair, reducing frizz significantly, taking control of flyaways, smoothing the surface of the hair. And giving hair manageability and control with a light to medium hold.  This without the feel of a heavy chemical build-up. I am also pleased that this is a cruelty-free product from a cruelty-free company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second Paul Mitchell hair product I have recently tried; I have been using it for two or three weeks, and I am even happier with it than I was with the Paul Mitchell Super Clean Sculpting Gel which I also reviewed on its page.  I have naturally curly hair with a tendency to frizz, and it is very difficult to control in the long hot humid summers of North Carolina.  This product  does not require the use of a hair dryer.  It has indeed given me defined curls, with body and fullness; it does prevent frizz to a significant degree. It does add shine, while leaving the hair feeling light.  And, best of all, it lasts for a day or two or three.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, but the can arrived with the nozzle broken.  That makes it impossible to use without foam squirting out everywhere.  So for me, this product is useless. I will have to throw it away.  Very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Product comes out watery and stays heavy on my hair. Would not use again. (Yes, I shook it and followed all the instructions).</li>
            <li> I love this mousse! Definitely my favorite, I bought this giant bottle and I&#x27;m very glad I did, it&#x27;s huge! I won&#x27;t be needing to buy another for months! The only negative thing I can say about this mousse is that it comes out very watery, but within seconds it foams right up and is very smoothe when applied. I can&#x27;t get enough of the warm coconut smell either! Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great foam... its lighter and fluffier than other sculpting mousses and its a cruelty-free product from a cruelty-free company :)  I use this product sparingly and it goes a long way.  I have super, super thick, long hair as well, so my hair can really poof up.  This stuff will do the trick on it and last all day long.  The smell of it is very pleasant as well.  Oh, I also use this in my hair before I curl it with a flat iron.  I put a little in, let my hair dry and then use the flat iron to curl my hair (if this sounds weird; yes, you can curl your hair with a flat iron, it works great!).  It helps keeps the curls together instead of them separating and frizzing.  And I know what you&#x27;re thinking,.. no, it doesn&#x27;t make your curls look crispy, it still looks natural, just a tad bit better! :)</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
            <li> Good foam for body!!!</li>
            <li> The image of the item is inaccurate. I have had problems with the dispensing the product in the past, due to the faulty, and rather skimpy red &amp;#34;spout&amp;#34; at the top of the can (it wears out and breaks off before I can use all of the product). When I searched for this sculpting foam, knowing that Paul Mitchell offers this with two different types of spouts, I looked for one with the more durable spout as shown here. Unfortunately, when the product arrived, it came with the super flimsy spout that I DID NOT want. I feel like this was a bait and switch since what I purchased, using the information provided in the description, including the photo, was NOT what I paid for or received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sculpting foam inside the can is fine, it&#x27;s the can/spout that I&#x27;m not happy with.</li>
            <li> I have tried several mousses and gels to get my hair to stay curly and this is the only one that works.  I have awkward wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t quite want to curl, but with this product, my hair is curly and holds its shape throughout the whole day with no frizz.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 24 years.  Nothing compares.  Its the best!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..great product..love the smell...adds volume and conditions at the same time.</li>
            <li> I love it... I never wore my hair down because it is too curly and would become a frizzy mess.. Until now.. This product is wonderful</li>
