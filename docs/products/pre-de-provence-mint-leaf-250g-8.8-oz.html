    <ol>
            <li>Sometimes, the best products to buy are the simplest ones.  </li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Turn your shower into a Great Escape!</li>
            <li>In all seriousness, this soap is some of the very best.</li>
            <li>I like it, affordable, minty and I like feeling like a happy Leprechaun!</li>
            <li>not as smelly as some of the others I have tried, but very good soap.  </li>
            <li>Another great fragrance of Pre De Provence soaps.</li>
            <li>This is great soap for anyone with oily skin like me.</li>
            <li>Very nice Mint aroma, leaves skin feeling great, and a great exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, great size, feels great.</li>
            <li>, it is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Smells good but will not use it again.  </li>
            <li>Loved it, but couldn&#x27;t find it in my area.</li>
            <li>I received a sample box of this brand some time ago and loved every one of the samples.</li>
            <li>Was delighted to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Good delivery and packaging.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering what kind of gift to buy for somebody or what to do with that Amazon gift card, why not give this mint soap a try?  </li>
            <li>(If you want exfoliation, look elsewhere; like Sage &amp; Honey Almond) You won&#x27;t get a nice foamy lather from Mint Leaf-</li>
            <li>If guys are looking to try PdP, Mint Leaf would be a nice place to start.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super creamy and awesome smelling, I feel really clean after using it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin and a very good size.</li>
            <li>Liked it better than Claus Porto &amp; all others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great emollients improve your skin.</li>
            <li>Originally got a couple of bars at a craft fair and have been reordering it ever since.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to get a good scrub out of it!</li>
            <li>I love the mint smell on this soap.</li>
            <li>This might just be the favorite soap of all time.</li>
            <li>Fantastic gift and an affordable luxury!</li>
            <li>Ordered this for spouse to use, and fell in love with it myself too.</li>
            <li>I love every fragrance I have tried.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap and the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a very nice balance of \\&quot;the best stuff\\&quot; common to all the PdP soaps in Mint Leaf.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not to strong or light.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong for a mint-based soap; it&#x27;s not burning your nostrils.</li>
            <li>The three of use in our family will have a reaction to soap and this was fine for us.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you have super oily skin it will work better for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy but a woman would enjoy this soap too.  </li>
            <li>I really like how the smell of the mint isn&#x27;t overpowering and this makes for a nice shower experience.  </li>
            <li>Great bar size but the soap actually stings in places</li>
            <li>nowhere near as good as BLISS minty soap.</li>
            <li>Very nice, big, lightly fragranced soap.</li>
            <li>Great smell and texture and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Soap is supposed to be used to clean your body and this soap does just that, not leave a lingering chemical scent on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love it almost as much.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, long-lasting tingly (be careful about any really sensitive areas) soap!</li>
            <li>Love the way it leaves my skin soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This might be my new favorite Pre de Provence soap...</li>
            <li>I just may have to go back and buy some more!</li>
            <li>Great soap, but a little pricey.</li>
            <li>I love different soaps, and pre de is my favorite by far!!</li>
            <li>This soap smelled devine, it lathered nicely, and it lasted a long time, too!</li>
            <li>Also, buying a couple of these guys makes for a nice little beside-the-tub decor (since a couple of theses large bars look nice stacked on top of each other).</li>
            <li>I first bought this soap on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.</li>
            <li>It did smell very nice at least.</li>
            <li>I no longer remember how long it lasted but was about six weeks or more.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll certainly feel softer.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pre de Provence for several years now, and Mint Leaf has quickly become my second favorite soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and minty, and a little tingly on the skin, which probably is TMI.</li>
            <li>Huge, solid, hand-milled looking bar of bath soap.</li>
            <li>I Really I felt like a Leprechaun.</li>
            <li>Leaves are really in there.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want it too, refreshing in other places.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and a bar</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Linden is my other favorite, but mint definitely beats it with the lather.</li>
            <li>The mint is a natural antibiotic for the skin and the oatmeal exfoliates so well.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft from this.</li>
            <li>I really thought I was going to like this soap based on the reviews, but it was kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li>Buy this handmade Pre de Provence soap made of natural ingredients you&#x27;ve actually heard of before.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not too weak, nor too strong.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering what kind of gift to buy for somebody or what to do with that Amazon gift card, why not give this mint soap a try?  Sometimes, the best products to buy are the simplest ones.  This mint soap may just be soap, but nowadays can those supermarket soaps with chemicals, sodium lauryl sulfate, synthetic materials, and words you&#x27;ve never heard of before actually be called a soap anymore?  Buy this handmade Pre de Provence soap made of natural ingredients you&#x27;ve actually heard of before.  I&#x27;m a guy but a woman would enjoy this soap too.  I really like how the smell of the mint isn&#x27;t overpowering and this makes for a nice shower experience.  The bits of mint leaf aren&#x27;t meant to exfoliate your skin but spread the scent.  After all, wet leaves don&#x27;t exfoliate but I didn&#x27;t buy this soap for exfoliation.  I also noticed after stepping out of the shower that my skin felt softer (likely due to the shea butter).  After leaving the bathroom, my skin smells odorless so not much mint smell (if at all) remains and I don&#x27;t mind this at all.  Soap is supposed to be used to clean your body and this soap does just that, not leave a lingering chemical scent on the skin.  I highly recommend it and a bar this big will last for months.</li>
            <li> I love the mint smell on this soap. Gentle on the skin and a very good size. Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Great bar size but the soap actually stings in places you don&#x27;t want it too, refreshing in other places.  Would think a cut might be painful...  Probably something to do with the Mint Leaf.  Smells good but will not use it again.  All three family members had the same problem.</li>
            <li> I have used pre de provence lavendar soap, but had never tried the mint before.  I love it almost as much.  I love different soaps, and pre de is my favorite by far!!</li>
            <li> This might just be the favorite soap of all time. Minty fragrance rejuvenates the senses-mind &amp; body!  Turn your shower into a Great Escape! Liked it better than Claus Porto &amp; all others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great emollients improve your skin. Fantastic gift and an affordable luxury!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pre de Provence for several years now, and Mint Leaf has quickly become my second favorite soap. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong for a mint-based soap; it&#x27;s not burning your nostrils. And unlike other PdP soaps with organic matter that can be abrasive, the matter in Mint Leaf isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all. Apart from leaving some leaf in the tub, it&#x27;s actually quite pleasurable for an every-day soap.  And it&#x27;s silky without being slippery. (If you want exfoliation, look elsewhere; like Sage &amp; Honey Almond) You won&#x27;t get a nice foamy lather from Mint Leaf- but you&#x27;ll certainly feel softer.     There&#x27;s a very nice balance of \\&quot;the best stuff\\&quot; common to all the PdP soaps in Mint Leaf. If guys are looking to try PdP, Mint Leaf would be a nice place to start.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, long-lasting tingly (be careful about any really sensitive areas) soap! Originally got a couple of bars at a craft fair and have been reordering it ever since.</li>
            <li> Great soap, but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, great size, feels great.</li>
            <li> Divine. It&#x27;s like washing your body with a piece of divinity. In all seriousness, this soap is some of the very best. Great smell and texture and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> not as smelly as some of the others I have tried, but very good soap.  Will try a different fragrance next time.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for spouse to use, and fell in love with it myself too. Very nice Mint aroma, leaves skin feeling great, and a great exfoliate.The scent is not too weak, nor too strong. I used it as well and there is NO burning or stinging with this soap, it is quite pleasant. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Huge, solid, hand-milled looking bar of bath soap. Lasts a long time. Also, buying a couple of these guys makes for a nice little beside-the-tub decor (since a couple of theses large bars look nice stacked on top of each other).</li>

            <li> Another great fragrance of Pre De Provence soaps. I love every fragrance I have tried. Love the way it leaves my skin soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the one my hubby nabbed and uses in the shower!</li>
            <li> This might be my new favorite Pre de Provence soap... Linden is my other favorite, but mint definitely beats it with the lather. It&#x27;s super creamy and awesome smelling, I feel really clean after using it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger. Using a pouf/loofah type thing helps make it last even longer! Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I first bought this soap on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Loved it, but couldn&#x27;t find it in my area. The seller had it to my house in 3 days!! The mint is a natural antibiotic for the skin and the oatmeal exfoliates so well. My skin is so soft from this. Won&#x27;t use any other soap again.</li>
            <li> I Really I felt like a Leprechaun. It felt while using there was some almond shells to exfoliate. I am used to using gell body wash so don&#x27;t call me an expert on this. I like it, affordable, minty and I like feeling like a happy Leprechaun!</li>
            <li> This is mint leaf soap.  Leaves are really in there.  Looks like tea leaves.  The three of use in our family will have a reaction to soap and this was fine for us.  Didn&#x27;t dry our our skin.  I no longer remember how long it lasted but was about six weeks or more.</li>
            <li> This soap dried out my skin.  The smell is nice and not to strong or light.  Maybe if you have super oily skin it will work better for you.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this soap and the fragrance. I received a sample box of this brand some time ago and loved every one of the samples. Was delighted to find it on amazon. Good delivery and packaging.</li>
            <li> This is great soap for anyone with oily skin like me. Not recommended for people with dry skin though. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to get a good scrub out of it! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I keep it in my gym bag and use it after I run. It&#x27;s nice and minty, and a little tingly on the skin, which probably is TMI. I will keep buying this as long as they still make it.</li>
            <li> Very nice, big, lightly fragranced soap.</li>
