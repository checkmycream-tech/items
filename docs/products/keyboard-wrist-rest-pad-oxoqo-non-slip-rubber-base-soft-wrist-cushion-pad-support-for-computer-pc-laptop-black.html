            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to control how much oil you pick up</li>
            <li> Item arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> I used these to apply castor oil to my lashes at night before buying an empty mascara tube.</li>
            <li> Erm, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; disassemble the entire feeder - base, top, flowers and middle - and scrub the little nooks an crannies with these little mascara wands and crazy hot water.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is the metal part of which the wands are attached ,I&#x27;d prefer plastic being that close to my eye .</li>
            <li> take a few weeks to get them ,</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and firm, not cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Already handed out quite a few to friends.</li>
            <li> I am a pro makeup artist and I&#x27;m often shocked at how expensive lash wands can be.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>

            <li> The shipping took forever, but it is ok, good thing i didn&#x27;t need it right away, so it didn&#x27;t bother me that much! but the item is amazing, really nice quality!</li>
            <li> Works great. Used to put Castor Oil on my eyelashes to make them grow. Does the trick!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you think.</li>
            <li> Love these. Even though I thought they&#x27;d be longer, they work fine! Not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal for so many brushes! I keep some in my purse, at my desk at work, and of course at my makeup vanity. I&#x27;ve given some to friends and still have plenty left. Love them and the shipping time was decent.</li>
            <li> took like over a month to get....I had forgotten about it...good product, just don&#x27;t be in a hurry</li>
            <li> Great value...must have for makeup artists!</li>
            <li> I need disposal mascara wands for sanitary reasons when working with clients, and these are perfect. You can find these disposable spoolies being sold everywhere on the internet at very many different price points. These are just your typical ones that are slightly tapered at the top. Good quality brushes that aren&#x27;t going to break the bank.</li>
            <li> I would of prefer the plastic wand no the medal.</li>
            <li> I first bought 100 of these for myself and love them!! They are get quality and have a full brush. Very close comparisons to maybelline full and soft wands or loreal voluminous mascara wand. I then ordered 200 for my sister who is an esthetician. They are fuller &amp; cheaper than what she bought from sallys beauty supply store! She loves them as well. I highly recommend these wands!!</li>
            <li> My wife bought these for her business and it handles the mascara she uses perfectly. I&#x27;m just typing what she says.</li>
            <li> Item arrived sooner than expected. Great purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> I love my Eyelash Mascara thank you !!</li>
            <li> Great for shaping and separating eye lashes when using mascara</li>
            <li> bought these to use with oils that I put on my eyelashes at night very easy since they are throw aways</li>
            <li> Shipping took awhile, but love the product.</li>
            <li> As expected. Good deal!</li>
            <li> thanks. everything giod. arrives earlier.</li>
            <li> They came more quickly than I expected.  Very good quality.</li>
            <li> Just what my kit needed.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for cleaning the tiny feeding holes in my hummingbird feeders. They work very well. The brush tip is bendable and fits easily in curved places.  As others have noted, the order took over a month to arrive, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> high quality ! take a few weeks to get them ,</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here, but I got them and for the price they are perfect and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I only need them for one time sampling, so they do the job.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Will buy again from seller!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but looked better than the ones at the store and a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> I use these for grooming my eyebrows and for applying coconut oil to my eyelashes at night to promote eyelash growth. :)</li>
            <li> These disposable wands are great for applying mascara on clients. They apply well and are very helpful. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and they are very good quality also . I&#x27;m a makeup artist and need to keep everything clean and sterile these save me money !</li>
            <li> The bristles could be a bit stiffer for more control, but it&#x27;s exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using these to clean my hummingbird feeders out.  LOL I stored them from last year and had some moldy issues with them early on.  I&#x27; disassemble the entire feeder - base, top, flowers and middle - and scrub the little nooks an crannies with these little mascara wands and crazy hot water. Did the job very nicely!  And for the price, I don&#x27;t mind throwing one away when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive eyes, so I may venture into a DIY mascara formula and I will be using these for my trial applications.</li>
            <li> Great little brushes, can already see so many uses for them. They are sturdy and firm, not cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I love these! When I got them I thought they might have totally scammed me but I was wrong! Very nice, good quality and now I can keep my mascara longer without getting germs in it!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, easy to use.</li>
            <li> No problem with this item...perfect for sampling mascara.</li>
            <li> Love them and it came a lot faster than I thought it would. It only took about 16 days.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> I use these for everything, not just mascara.  they are well made, don&#x27;t shed and I like the longer length.  Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> These are nice to have on hand to use for serums and etc.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li> work well.  shipping took forever though.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, product is as described</li>
            <li> I loved that i saved money but i didn&#x27;t like that it took me a month to receive the products.:(</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but there perfect for what I&#x27;m gonna be doing with them! 😊</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use with my Castor Oil on my lashes at night.  I can&#x27;t believe how many you get in a package for such a low price, and free shipping!  The brush is comparable to Maybeline brushes.  Excellent deal! :)</li>
            <li> Will be ordering some more definitely!</li>
            <li> Nice disposable brushes, very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this wand more than my high end one.</li>
            <li> come in 2 zip lock bags, so I&#x27;m a little unsure as to how clean they are. they take a long time to come so be aware of that. The price is good for what you get</li>
            <li> I use these mascara wands to apply an eyelash serum before bed. They work great and aren&#x27;t flimsy. I will definitely buy again once I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Goes on very easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These spoolies remind me of the ones they have in cups around Sephora so that you can test mascara formulas. Perfect if your just trying to test a product, or brush your eyebrows/eyelashes out. Awesome &amp; cheap! :-)</li>
            <li> I actually bought these for crafts but they work well as their intended use which is applying mascara.  I like that I can control how much I get on the brush whereas the one that comes with my mascara gets, what&#x27;s the word, gloppy!</li>
            <li> These are a make up staple for me. Can&#x27;t live without them.  I NEVER have clumpy mascara thanks to these.  They are also great for grooming and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These are awesome for cosmetic use &amp; for eyelash extensions. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great quality for price and quantity</li>
            <li> I used these to apply castor oil to my lashes at night before buying an empty mascara tube. They work well but it&#x27;s hard to control how much oil you pick up so I basically just left one on a clean soap dish and reused it forever until the oil was gone. At this price you could easily use a new one every night but I didn&#x27;t see the need.</li>
            <li> Perfectly sized spooleys for make-up in great quality! Can&#x27;t beat the price either. Already handed out quite a few to friends.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday and I love them! :)</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my order. Reasonable and good quality.</li>
            <li> I like the quantity and price range of this product . The only complaint that I have is the metal part of which the wands are attached ,I&#x27;d prefer plastic being that close to my eye . No other complaints, overall good product .</li>
            <li> Great item. Wonderful price and great shipping</li>
            <li> Perfect for lash extensions</li>
            <li> Serves my purpose very well</li>
            <li> These work great!Better than the brush that comes with my mascara brand and 100 of them will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to apply Castor oil to my eyelashes, and also special dye to darken the tips. The brushes are well made and just the right size. They are so sturdy that I have actually cleaned one (as a test) and used it more than once.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product</li>
            <li> The only flaw of this product is that it&#x27;s not hypoallergenic and it often make your eyes reddish and itchy. However, this is really great!</li>
            <li> I use these for my Lush mascara that has a very short wand.  These work great.  It really helps to control the makeup as I am putting it on.  I will buy these again when I run out.  Shipping did take quite a while, though, so keep that in mind if you are in a rush to get them.</li>
            <li> I bought these to apply castor oil to my eyelashes nightly. They are way too large! Too big to really work well for my small eyelashes. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Erm, not what I expected. But still very ok. Plus the price was really cheap. Generally okay for the purpose for which I got it which was to apply a homemade eyelash serum. Its generally satisfactory.</li>
            <li> No problems work great!</li>
            <li> Shipping took way too long, but product was excellent.</li>
            <li> Good quality mascara wands for the right price.  I am a pro makeup artist and I&#x27;m often shocked at how expensive lash wands can be.  I was almost reluctant to order these because they seemed too reasonably priced.  But alas, they are perfect.  Hallelujah!</li>
            <li> Bought this to apply a product on my eyelashes and they were great. Cheap and are disposable. Great size and they arrived quick.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes to apply an eyelash tint.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and these work great. Shipped super fast as well!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i ordered.good quality</li>
            <li> These are great! Love them.</li>
            <li> This came a lot earlier than the estimated delivery date.  They are very sturdy.  These will last a long time.</li>
            <li> They came in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality item A+</li>
            <li> Fast, and high quality</li>
