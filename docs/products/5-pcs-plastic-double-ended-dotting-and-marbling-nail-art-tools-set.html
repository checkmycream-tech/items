            <li>It was so dirt cheap that I had to get it.  </li>
            <li>So cheap I bought 3 sets two to pass out for gifts.</li>
            <li>very useful for nail art.</li>
            <li>i have just started doing cool stuff with my nails and these tools are great for dots, it takes a while to get to ya from china but the cost makes it worth wild</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re fine for my purposes and they were cheap and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>My daughter is enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them, they are exactly what i wanted....</li>
            <li>She was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my dotting tools.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not completely disappointed.</li>
            <li>It has every size dot imaginable and the cuteness of the pretty colors makes then even better.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use and with all the different tip sizes in this one set, there is no need to buy any more.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just the sizes i was looking for, and they have a good physical appearance.</li>
            <li>a while to get here but for how cheap they were it was worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my friends love my designs, thanks to the dotting tools.</li>
            <li>These came in the mail somewhat quickly.</li>
            <li>Love these tools, very pretty love the pink marble looking color and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product, this is my first time using something like this.</li>
            <li>they work really  well and are easy to use...</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>, they took a while to arrive but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting out on my own.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and they look exactly like in the picture.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to make all kinds of fun nail art with dots with my new tool set!!!</li>
            <li>but most of them have like several of the same size and are very cheap.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what I purchased them for.</li>
            <li>These came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>so I order different ones and I like these ones so much better.</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re okay for personal use.</li>
            <li>Well made and very affordable!</li>
            <li>but they send you like two of the same size, over all they&#x27;re cute and they work how they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li>After getting my nails done professionally a few times and seeing the cute designs you can make with such tools as these I decided to get my own.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m fine with that since if I loose one, at least I&#x27;ll have a back up of that size most likely :D</li>
            <li>they are easily put back into the tool and still useable.</li>
            <li>work great same as any other dotting tool!</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these since 2013 and all I can say is that they&#x27;re very durable.</li>
            <li>thank you so much.</li>
            <li>These dotters make my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>She loves it and does so much with the simplicity of the tools.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like these although 2 of the tools are identical</li>
            <li>My daughter really like using these on herself, grandma and mom.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, which I always really appreciate.</li>
            <li>These tools make my job so much easier when I am doing esthetics.  </li>
            <li>so really and truly I got 6 dot sizes instead of 10)</li>
            <li>When making a design with multiple colors the similar sizes came in handy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when i got these finally.</li>
            <li>The five I received are actually only three unique tools and two duplicates</li>
            <li>BUT I NOTICED AFTER THE... 2nd USE I HAD TO CLEAN IT, &amp;</li>
            <li>BUT DESPITE THAT IM MAINLY UPSET AT THE LIES THAN THE DEFECTIVE ITEM!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent set.</li>
            <li>Decent product for decent price</li>
            <li>There are several different sizes which makes working with them and creating various designs more fun.</li>
            <li>Comes in a little cute plastic pouch.</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described, while some of the size of \\&quot;dots\\&quot; were very close to one another after playing around with them I found them all to actually be of different sizes.</li>
            <li>They would make a decent gift for a young nail artist though.</li>
            <li>Thank you-- &amp; thanx for the little hairband gift too! :)</li>
            <li>Love these little guys!</li>
            <li>I am in no way a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; but this was a cheap product to buy that helps my designs come out looking a little bit professional.</li>
            <li>THE LYING COMPANY YOU2BE HAS COMPLETELY IGNORED THE ITEM REPLACEMENT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND ME.</li>
            <li>and I really like the price, but noticed that 4 out of the 5 dotting tools were same size.</li>
            <li>can finally make cute designs at home without having to waste money.</li>
            <li>Rate it a number 5 no mess</li>
            <li>The ones pictured here are a higher quality and have several different sizes on each ens.</li>
            <li>These were just what I was looking for and really like the fact that you get several different sizes</li>
            <li>3 of them have the same dot size and 2 pens lose their dots because they aren&#x27;t fixed well!  </li>
            <li>they arrived way before the delivery date, but i was surprised to see that 2 of the tools were the same.</li>
            <li>A WHOLE NEW SET AND A LITTLE GIFT</li>
            <li>then i compared 2 of the other tools and they were exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The product is new, but because of a rough ride, the packaging it was in was torn.</li>
            <li>so really its like a tool and a half</li>

            <li> It was so dirt cheap that I had to get it.  </li>
            <li> So cheap I bought 3 sets two to pass out for gifts.</li>
            <li> very useful for nail art.</li>
            <li> i have just started doing cool stuff with my nails and these tools are great for dots, it takes a while to get to ya from china but the cost makes it worth wild</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re fine for my purposes and they were cheap and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> My daughter is enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them, they are exactly what i wanted....</li>
            <li> She was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my dotting tools.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It has every size dot imaginable and the cuteness of the pretty colors makes then even better.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use and with all the different tip sizes in this one set, there is no need to buy any more.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just the sizes i was looking for, and they have a good physical appearance.</li>
            <li> a while to get here but for how cheap they were it was worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my friends love my designs, thanks to the dotting tools.</li>
            <li> These came in the mail somewhat quickly.</li>
            <li> Love these tools, very pretty love the pink marble looking color and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product, this is my first time using something like this.</li>
            <li> they work really  well and are easy to use...</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> , they took a while to arrive but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting out on my own.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and they look exactly like in the picture.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to make all kinds of fun nail art with dots with my new tool set!!!</li>
            <li> but most of them have like several of the same size and are very cheap.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what I purchased them for.</li>
            <li> These came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> so I order different ones and I like these ones so much better.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re okay for personal use.</li>
            <li> Well made and very affordable!</li>
            <li> but they send you like two of the same size, over all they&#x27;re cute and they work how they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li> After getting my nails done professionally a few times and seeing the cute designs you can make with such tools as these I decided to get my own.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m fine with that since if I loose one, at least I&#x27;ll have a back up of that size most likely :D</li>
            <li> they are easily put back into the tool and still useable.</li>
            <li> work great same as any other dotting tool!</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these since 2013 and all I can say is that they&#x27;re very durable.</li>
            <li> thank you so much.</li>
            <li> These dotters make my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> She loves it and does so much with the simplicity of the tools.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like these although 2 of the tools are identical</li>
            <li> My daughter really like using these on herself, grandma and mom.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, which I always really appreciate.</li>
            <li> These tools make my job so much easier when I am doing esthetics.  </li>
            <li> so really and truly I got 6 dot sizes instead of 10)</li>
            <li> When making a design with multiple colors the similar sizes came in handy.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i got these finally.</li>
            <li> The five I received are actually only three unique tools and two duplicates</li>
            <li> BUT I NOTICED AFTER THE... 2nd USE I HAD TO CLEAN IT, &amp;</li>
            <li> BUT DESPITE THAT IM MAINLY UPSET AT THE LIES THAN THE DEFECTIVE ITEM!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent set.</li>
            <li> Decent product for decent price</li>
            <li> There are several different sizes which makes working with them and creating various designs more fun.</li>
            <li> Comes in a little cute plastic pouch.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described, while some of the size of \\&quot;dots\\&quot; were very close to one another after playing around with them I found them all to actually be of different sizes.</li>
            <li> They would make a decent gift for a young nail artist though.</li>
            <li> Thank you-- &amp; thanx for the little hairband gift too! :)</li>
            <li> Love these little guys!</li>
            <li> I am in no way a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; but this was a cheap product to buy that helps my designs come out looking a little bit professional.</li>
            <li> THE LYING COMPANY YOU2BE HAS COMPLETELY IGNORED THE ITEM REPLACEMENT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND ME.</li>
            <li> and I really like the price, but noticed that 4 out of the 5 dotting tools were same size.</li>
            <li> can finally make cute designs at home without having to waste money.</li>
            <li> Rate it a number 5 no mess</li>
            <li> The ones pictured here are a higher quality and have several different sizes on each ens.</li>
            <li> These were just what I was looking for and really like the fact that you get several different sizes</li>
            <li> 3 of them have the same dot size and 2 pens lose their dots because they aren&#x27;t fixed well!  </li>
            <li> they arrived way before the delivery date, but i was surprised to see that 2 of the tools were the same.</li>
            <li> A WHOLE NEW SET AND A LITTLE GIFT</li>
            <li> then i compared 2 of the other tools and they were exactly the same.</li>
            <li> The product is new, but because of a rough ride, the packaging it was in was torn.</li>
            <li> so really its like a tool and a half</li>
            <li> Two of them have the same size larger dot with a smaller one on the other end.</li>
            <li> As other posters have said, these tools are really only a couple different sizes, rather than receiving 10 different sizes as the picture would lead you to believe.</li>
            <li> In some of the other dotting tools I researched, there were 3 or 4 pieces, but only 2 different size dots.</li>
            <li> One side was all the same while the other row was different.</li>
            <li> this meant that there were only 3 tools that were different from each other.</li>
            <li> Would DEFINITELY recommend to anybody, amateur &amp; professional.</li>
            <li> got it earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the tips come off a few and needed to superglue them back in to place.</li>
            <li> Other then that.</li>
            <li> And two others have the same size small dots.</li>
            <li> The other ones I had got stolen</li>
            <li> but luckily I had some crazy glue to fix that issue.</li>
            <li> some of the other buyers of this product complained about; They don&#x27;t all have different sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very excited about it ...</li>
            <li> In the comments some complained that there were repeats in size, I actually found that to be in my benefit.</li>
            <li> THE TIP DOWN TO THE HANDLE STARTED PEELING &amp; COMING APART...</li>
            <li> All the other dot sizes are exactly the same :(</li>
            <li> ITS BEEN 3 AND A HALF MONTHS AND</li>
            <li> Several of the tips are apparently so close in size that it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> It did take a little while for me to get them in the mail.</li>
            <li> Received in half the time!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because there are only two or three sizes that are different.</li>
            <li> Just arrived a tad late.</li>
            <li> SO IRRITATING!</li>
            <li> which is so irritating!</li>
            <li> Nail designs that I though were impossible to acheive before</li>
            <li> so while I am disappointed with having fewer sizes, they still do their job.</li>
            <li> (: plus the price was INSANE</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t send me this Set but I got another one ...I got the dotting 5x2 way marbleizing dotting pen set instead ... I&#x27;m not very excited about it ... 3 of them have the same dot size and 2 pens lose their dots because they aren&#x27;t fixed well!  Anyway I tried making dots on my nails and they came out cute .. so that&#x27;s why I give 3 stars ..</li>

            <li> I do A LOT of nail art and these tools are very useful! I can do the perfect flowers with these and a toothpick! Such a great deal at this price. I recommend buying these and using YouTube to search nail art tutorials.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. What I like about it is that there are 10 different sizes, and none of the sizes are repeated. In some of the other dotting tools I researched, there were 3 or 4 pieces, but only 2 different size dots.</li>
            <li> Came on time it is what is it described to be.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter lovesssss her dotting tools and uses them all the time to make designs.</li>
            <li> very useful for nail art.I will be ordering this again. I also tell my classmates about this item and where I ordered them from</li>
            <li> These are okay for the price. I&#x27;ve had the tips come off a few and needed to superglue them back in to place. Several of the tips are apparently so close in size that it&#x27;s crazy. They would make a decent gift for a young nail artist though.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I am using these great tools for stuffing tiny fingers and toes on cloth-art dolls! A doll artist say they work like a charm!</li>
            <li> these are nice, even if you&#x27;re not a nail artist, you will be with these pens! i love them! thank you!</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast. These dotting tools are good quality and pretty. Each side is a different size. I can&#x27;t wait to start using them more!</li>
            <li> This is a great quality item. My daughter is enjoying it very much. Works great and cleans up nicely...The color is an extra bonus...</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed. I&#x27;ve done my own nails for years but never did many designs. After getting my nails done professionally a few times and seeing the cute designs you can make with such tools as these I decided to get my own. They are very easy to use and with all the different tip sizes in this one set, there is no need to buy any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these since 2013 and all I can say is that they&#x27;re very durable.</li>
            <li> great dotters however the metal parts on some of them detached. they are easily put back into the tool and still useable.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered these. They&#x27;re good quality. And it&#x27;s really easy to create cute nail looks. It did take a little while for me to get them in the mail. Well worth the wait though.</li>
            <li> I ordered these specific dotting tools because of all the different sizes and the are lettered A, B, C, D, E, there are so many dotting tools out there but most of them have like several of the same size and are very cheap. The ones pictured here are a higher quality and have several different sizes on each ens. That IS NOT what I received, one end of all 5 of the tools I got are all the same size, there are maybe only like 3 different sizes between all 5 double ended tools. I waited for ever for these and paid more, I could have got these cheap things on ebay for a penny. SO IRRITATING! Just because they are purple doesn&#x27;t make them the same thing!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i got these finally. I absolutely love them, they are exactly what i wanted....thank you so much.</li>
            <li> These dotters make my life so much easier. Nail designs that I though were impossible to acheive before, I can do them with ease now.</li>
            <li> Awesome price and I am very impressed with the dotting tools. Product arrived in 4 days and works just fine. Good price compared to the ones you see at Sally&#x27;s beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> It was so dirt cheap that I had to get it.  Boy was I ever glad I did!  The Double Ended Dotting Nail Art Tools Set is absolutely WONDERFUL! I use the dotting tools to make cute nail art on my nails and my friends nails.  My friends were so amazed that they too are purchasing sets for themselves.</li>
            <li> Awesome dotting tools. As described and sent in a timely manner. Great quality and pretty to look at. Great for nail art</li>
            <li> Considering it came from Hong Kong, it came very quickly!!  The product is new, but because of a rough ride, the packaging it was in was torn.</li>
            <li> I loved the product. They&#x27;re just the sizes i was looking for, and they have a good physical appearance. I&#x27;m also very happy it got here on time.</li>
            <li> This product I got for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and does so much with the simplicity of the tools. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very pleased- my daughter loved these!</li>
            <li> I use these dotting tools for every design imaginable and they work great. I still have my original set after more than a year and they are not damaged in the slightest. I love them!</li>
            <li> I really like these although 2 of the tools are identical (both ends are the same on both tools).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a while to get here but for how cheap they were it was worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple ends that are identical to another so all in all I think I got 6 different size tips but I&#x27;m fine with that since if I loose one, at least I&#x27;ll have a back up of that size most likely :D</li>
            <li> This product arrived in perfect condition. I am very pleased with the quality of the nail art dotting tools, and how well they work. Everyone asks about the designs on my manicures. A must-have product for up-and-coming laquerists and professionals as well. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> These are very beautiful and durable dotting tools. I am very pleased with the purchase, and at such a great deal. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> great dotting tools. I&#x27;ve used it every time i do my nails. my friends love my designs, thanks to the dotting tools.</li>
            <li> My daughter really like using these on herself, grandma and mom. She was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Cheap and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just as described. All in very good condition great quality. No issues. Just arrived a tad late. Other then that. No complaints.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT GOT WHAT THE PICTURE DEPICTS! I was hoping this one would have different sizes, but no, they&#x27;re all around the same sizes. which is so irritating! I&#x27;ll give the seller a second chance by replace it for another ones. Will update this later.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product, this is my first time using something like this. Pretty colors, nice size and easy to grip</li>
            <li> The five I received are actually only three unique tools and two duplicates and they are not labeled like those in the pictures.  But they&#x27;re fine for my purposes and they were cheap and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Product is described at double sided but there are only 5 sizes?  Description should clarify. But for the money the product works as it should.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my dotting tools. I thought i read all the reviews. This product wasn&#x27;t the cheapest but still went with it. I was disappointed because there are only two or three sizes that are different. All the other dot sizes are exactly the same :( so really its like a tool and a half</li>
            <li> These are okay. Not all of them are different size dots. Two of them have the same size larger dot with a smaller one on the other end. And two others have the same size small dots. I&#x27;m not an expert at nails, so I am happy with these. I&#x27;m also happy about the price &amp; they shipped quite fast.</li>
            <li> Got a million compliments on my nails are stirdy and just great all together.  If your looking for dotting tools get these</li>
            <li> beautiful and affordable. comes in a variety of sizes. love it!</li>
            <li> Has different size tips to make different designs.</li>
            <li> These came exactly as described. They work perfect for what i need them for.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  In the comments some complained that there were repeats in size, I actually found that to be in my benefit. When making a design with multiple colors the similar sizes came in handy.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, which I always really appreciate. The item was exactly as described, while some of the size of \\&quot;dots\\&quot; were very close to one another after playing around with them I found them all to actually be of different sizes. Would definately recommend for a nice inexpensive dotting tool set. Can&#x27;t wait to make all kinds of fun nail art with dots with my new tool set!!!</li>
            <li> Love these little guys! I&#x27;ve used them a couple of times and will use them again. There are plenty of designs to copy via Pinterest. These tools work great, I would recommend them to anyone who loves cool/different designs for their nails.</li>
            <li> Received in half the time! You get what is pictured, and I quite like them! They work well.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my order and how soon it came. Bot to mention the cheap price for it! Best Deal around</li>
            <li> The product is very good. There are many things one can do with these. There are several different sizes which makes working with them and creating various designs more fun.</li>
            <li> I wish i never bought these, this dotting tools the majority of them are repeated like only two of them are different. Soo upset i wish i had bought two of the cheekys dotting tools that day as they actually add up to be around the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* 7/18/13&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY THE RETAILERS AND THEY HAVE APOLOGIZED FOR THEIR MISTAKE, THEY ARE CURRENTLY GOING TO SEND ME A WHOLE NEW SET AND A LITTLE GIFT ON THE SIDE WITH ALL EXPENSES PAYED BY THEM (THANK YOU You2Be). I WILL UPDATE AGAIN WHEN I RECEIVE THE ITEMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE 11/04/13&lt;br /&gt;WELL ITS BEEN 3 AND A HALF MONTHS AND THE LYING COMPANY YOU2BE HAS COMPLETELY IGNORED THE ITEM REPLACEMENT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND ME. I SENT THEM AN EMAIL IN REGARDS OF THE ITEM AND THEY NEVER REPLIED. THEY WERE REALLY GOOD AT GUIDING ME TO DELETE THE SELLER FEEDBACK AND SEEMED VERY GENUINE AND KIND IN THE EMAILS. AT THAT MOMENT I DIDNT KNOW ANY BETTER THAT ONCE YOU DELETE A FEEDBACK YOU CANT RE-EDIT OR FIND IT EVER AGAIN SO I DID IT SINCE I HAD NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE. NOW I KNOW BETTER THAT I WILL NEVER REMOVE A FEEDBACK UNTIL THE ITEM IS IN MY HANDS, WELL I GUESS IT SERVES ME AS AN EXPERIENCE.&lt;br /&gt;THANK GOD IT WAS AN INEXPENSIVE ITEM OTHERWISE I WOULD&#x27;VE BEEN MORE UPSET BUT DESPITE THAT IM MAINLY UPSET AT THE LIES THAN THE DEFECTIVE ITEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING FROM THIS COMPANY EVER AGAIN!!! YOU2BE YOU SUCK!!</li>
            <li> Good tool set and nice value. I thought these would be lower quality because of the price but its. Decent set.</li>
            <li> I am an aesthetician and make up artist.  These tools make my job so much easier when I am doing esthetics.  Nice looking, good quality and very easy to use.  The other ones I had got stolen so I order different ones and I like these ones so much better.</li>
            <li> Decent product for decent price</li>
            <li> These were just what I was looking for and really like the fact that you get several different sizes</li>
            <li> Love these tools, very pretty love the pink marble looking color and easy to use. Comes in a little cute plastic pouch. These tools are very good for the price!!</li>
            <li> I like to paint my nails and play around with designs. I am in no way a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; but this was a cheap product to buy that helps my designs come out looking a little bit professional.</li>
            <li> i love the variety of sizes and the great cheap price. i bought a similar pack of nail dotters that were from the US and they were the same.</li>
            <li> These came in the mail somewhat quickly. I had ordered two one for my sister and we both love them. One side was all the same while the other row was different.</li>
            <li> Okay I guess and just like some of the other buyers of this product complained about; They don&#x27;t all have different sizes. Most are duplicates, but they did come before the estimated date. These aren&#x27;t my only dotting tools so I&#x27;m not completely disappointed. I&#x27;ll add a picture.</li>
            <li> They are great! I&#x27;m starting out on my own. I just needed somemore 5 pcs Plastic  Double Ended Dotting And Marbling Nail Art Tool Set . They were delivered on time</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay. I thought the tools would all be different sizes, but one end of each of them is the same size. That was kind of disappointing. But they&#x27;re okay for personal use.</li>
            <li> they arrived way before the delivery date, but i was surprised to see that 2 of the tools were the same. then i compared 2 of the other tools and they were exactly the same. this meant that there were only 3 tools that were different from each other.</li>
            <li> This product is great. got it on time&lt;br /&gt;I can finally make cute designs at home without having to waste money.</li>
            <li> got it earlier than expected! i havent tried them out just yet but they look great. everthing was ok cool</li>
            <li> Just perfect for what I purchased them for! I bought 2 sets, one for my nails and another to use with polymer clay. I have used the one set for polymer clay ALL the time, but still have yet to use it for my nails.</li>
            <li> Perfect pic of what i ordered and it came with this cute lil case to keep them in....love this item</li>
            <li> Well made and very affordable! So cheap I bought 3 sets two to pass out for gifts. Love them!!!!! Amature to professionals will like them</li>
            <li> LOVE this purchase! It has every size dot imaginable and the cuteness of the pretty colors makes then even better. I will be using these quite often. Would DEFINITELY recommend to anybody, amateur &amp; professional.</li>
            <li> Okayy well the dotting tools work great but they send you like two of the same size, over all they&#x27;re cute and they work how they&#x27;re supposed to so they get 4 stars from me(: plus the price was INSANE</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her nail art and with this purchase she can do more designs on her nail.  Rate it a number 5 no mess and I will recommend It to every nail salon.</li>
            <li> i have just started doing cool stuff with my nails and these tools are great for dots, it takes a while to get to ya from china but the cost makes it worth wild</li>
            <li> I just started nail art designs and this set is an Awsome tools to have. Very good for the price.</li>
            <li> ANOTHER MUST HAVE ITEM... NOT ONLY FOR NAILS... ART...DESIGNING... PAINTING... I LOVE THESE... ANOTHER ITEM I USE ALL THE TIME I DO MY MANI&#x27;S/PEDI&#x27;S.... THANX &amp; GOD BLESS :D I USE THIS ITEM ALOT.. BUT I NOTICED AFTER THE... 2nd USE I HAD TO CLEAN IT, &amp; THE TIP DOWN TO THE HANDLE STARTED PEELING &amp; COMING APART... NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THIS... BUT I LUV (DOTTING TOOLS)..</li>
            <li> work great same as any other dotting tool! would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for polymer clay. The set (purple) is beautiful in color and I have every size i need for miniatures. It took about two weeks for me to receive my package but I&#x27;m extremely happy with them. Definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give this a 5 only because I haven&#x27;t used them yet. They arrived quickly and they look exactly like in the picture. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> As other posters have said, these tools are really only a couple different sizes, rather than receiving 10 different sizes as the picture would lead you to believe. However, they were inexpensive and they work well, so while I am disappointed with having fewer sizes, they still do their job.</li>
            <li> I got them way before it was expected almost 3 weeks early and I love them!  Yah one thing for sure some do have the same size but I am okey with that other then that its perfect!</li>
            <li> I like the color and I really like the price, but noticed that 4 out of the 5 dotting tools were same size. ( 2 were one size, another 2 were a different size and 1 was different from the others. so really and truly I got 6 dot sizes instead of 10) however i will still enjoy using them! Oh yeah; and one of the dotting tips came out because it wasn&#x27;t glued but luckily I had some crazy glue to fix that issue. Order was placed on April 23rd; delivery was estimated to be after May 17th but arrived on May 2nd. I would still repurchase because of the price!</li>
