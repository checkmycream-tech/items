            <li>It is pretty and sparkly, but it will &amp;#34;break&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Very chic!</li>
            <li>Ok, first when I opened the package it was broken...but easy fix because it&#x27;s all held together with little hoops.</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s a nice headband.</li>
            <li>It really is kinda pretty in person, but the links that hold the gems together have gaps so when I picked it up for the 1st time it fell apart.  </li>
            <li>but then the black part like broke on its own.</li>
            <li>large bands take over my hair</li>

            <li>I really like this band.</li>
            <li>I love how the elastic is stretchy but not too stretchy or too tight.</li>
            <li>It is very nice headbamd after I fixed the broken pieces when it arrived.</li>
            <li>So cute and it came weeks earlier then expected!</li>
            <li>It is quite large, I have slack if I wear it around my hair and especially if i try to wear it as a headband on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I fixed it with pliers like 10Ã— on the metal part</li>
            <li>I tried one on and it broke, fixed it</li>
            <li>Exactly what was expected</li>

            <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
            <li> Super tight but hopefully loosens after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but not too flashy, and it stays out really well.</li>
            <li> I have long dark hair and it nicely holds it back without looking too flashy.</li>
            <li> I was shocked and pleased with the price and quality!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t wore it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought other headbands of same quality for 4 times the price of this one.</li>
            <li> By its nature, if you are too rough with it the links will break, but come on, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when wearing, your hair gets caught.</li>
            <li> so i braid my hair almost soaking wet, put this in as a headband and pull my bangs</li>
            <li> From some of the other reviews, I thought it would be flimsy, but it is not.</li>
            <li> The little metal circles that connect it have fell off a few times, but I give it 3 stars because it was only a couple dollars</li>
            <li> was sent from overseas, so do expect a little wait time as it is by air frieght.</li>
            <li> Use for little ones not adults.</li>
            <li> I can not use this headband, which is disappointing because I really like it.</li>
            <li> I hope this doesn&#x27;t fade and turn my forehead green...</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i am fairly lazy</li>
            <li> The hair piece rhinestones were missing!</li>
            <li> but looking past all of that</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely small and it hurt to put it on.</li>
            <li> Wore it a few times, but looks a little weird with missing diamond, so I stopped wearing it.</li>
            <li> I opened the box and the Hair Band was broken in half.  </li>
            <li> I got it to wear in a wedding and its delicate and feminine.</li>
            <li> The detail of the delicate lace shimm wers subtly,  which I think adds to the piece.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality.</li>
            <li> a little painful because of the hoops digging into your head...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because one of the stone is missing.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m so unhappy</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so freaking cute. But it broke on me so many times. I fixed it with pliers like 10Ã— on the metal part but then the black part like broke on its own.</li>
            <li> I love this! Definitely will be ordering more! I get so many compliments and fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> Very &amp;#34;well&amp;#34; made, great material. Look so beautiful and fancy. Great delivery, always comes before time frame. Caring seller, and happy customer :)</li>
            <li> The headband is beautiful but it does not fit my head. It is quite large, I have slack if I wear it around my hair and especially if i try to wear it as a headband on my forehead. I can not use this headband, which is disappointing because I really like it. I may give it as a gift to someone with a BIG Head :)</li>
            <li> From some of the other reviews, I thought it would be flimsy, but it is not. By its nature, if you are too rough with it the links will break, but come on, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I have long dark hair and it nicely holds it back without looking too flashy.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s beautiful haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I will later today looks just like the picture .. Just one question did anyone else receive a Cross inside there packet ? ?</li>
            <li> So cute and it came weeks earlier then expected!</li>
            <li> Tons of compliments! More amazing in person and extremely comfortable! I was shocked and pleased with the price and quality!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
            <li> Beautiful and exactly as pictured. VERY shiny! Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> This looked great in my hair the day of my daughters wedding so for that I am thrilled.  But that night when I took it off it fell apart. Now I get it is is not expensive but I feel for the price  I should get more than one use out of it.  The item it self fells sturdy but the the links between each bead or flower was what broke in two places.</li>
            <li> Lovely headband very nice  and beautiful and good price</li>
            <li> Delivered just like I thought, about a month after ordering but I knew that so no biggie. I love this! It is super cute and not of cheap material. I love how the elastic is stretchy but not too stretchy or too tight. I would definitely buy again .</li>
            <li> It was much nicer in person. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. Fits well and good quality. Be careful when wearing, your hair gets caught. But other than that it&#x27;s a nice headband.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty. Lets not forget that The decorative beads are metal so they may hurt your head. I haven&#x27;t wore it for a long time. I had it on for a minute or so and it&#x27;s not uncomfortable but I feel like it will be over a couple of hours. I hope this doesn&#x27;t fade and turn my forehead green...</li>
            <li> Beautiful design! Extremely poor quality. Band broke the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it she will use it at the wedding, she is one of the bridesmaid.hairdresser prefer to use it.</li>
            <li> Nice headband for the price. Occasionally my hair gets caught in the metal, but it looks cute (elegant from far away lol).</li>
            <li> The metal parts kept hurting my head</li>
            <li> i get lots of compliments when i wear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note i am fairly lazy so i braid my hair almost soaking wet, put this in as a headband and pull my bangs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy easy.  and people (several daily) compliment.</li>
            <li> This was delivered with a missing diamond at the very front of it.  Wore it a few times, but looks a little weird with missing diamond, so I stopped wearing it.</li>
            <li> Super tight but hopefully loosens after a few uses. The little metal circles that connect it have fell off a few times, but I give it 3 stars because it was only a couple dollars and it&#x27;s super cute!</li>
            <li> Fits well and doesn&#x27;t fall off which I like since allot of headbands do.</li>
            <li> The headband is gorgeous! Just as pretty as the picture. I haven&#x27;t worn it yet, but I plan too very soon. The detail of the delicate lace shimm wers subtly,  which I think adds to the piece. The band that holds it on your head is very strong and is doubled for extra strength and stretches nicely.&lt;br /&gt;This was sent from overseas, so do expect a little wait time as it is by air frieght. Merchant is great to work with, if I had a problem or questioning about the time frame, they were quick to respond and willing to help. Will order from again.</li>
            <li> Unwearable headband. Metal, pointy pieces press into your head making this headband unwearable. These decorative pieces were not meant to be worn on the body. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The hair piece rhinestones were missing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fit perfect on me. I love it</li>
            <li> I opened the box and the Hair Band was broken in half.  I&#x27;m not super happy, and haven&#x27;t even attempted to us it.</li>
            <li> Great price for a nice product. I bought other headbands of same quality for 4 times the price of this one. Will buy again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Ok, first when I opened the package it was broken...but easy fix because it&#x27;s all held together with little hoops. But then, the next day, I was putting it on and it broke and snapped me in the face...but otherwise it&#x27;s gorgeous...a little painful because of the hoops digging into your head...but looking past all of that I really like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a headband. If people are 5ft away ish then it&#x27;s pretty but up close it&#x27;s crap.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Was received with a little longer shipment time, but in excellent shape and is very beautiful! My 2 teenage Granddaughters will be delighted!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> love it. just what i wanted.!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time great quality thankfully it never broke!!!</li>
            <li> I loved the head band. Its very pretty. You can where it with a white dress and /or a t-shirt with jeans. But the details of the headband is very pretty and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> broke as soon as I put it on</li>
            <li> It looks prettier in the picture and it&#x27;s really big. I have a big head and it&#x27;s way too big for me</li>
            <li> It is very pretty, fits perfectly and came in good shape :)</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price! Love it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this item. It did come in fast. As soon as I attempted to try it on, it popped. Waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Really pretty and fit perdectly</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these , One for my sister and one myself. Never got to wear either one. I tried one on and it broke, fixed it and it broke again. They&#x27;re extremely small and it hurt to put it on. Then I tried my sister&#x27;s , to see if it was the same and same thing happened. It looks pretty but please make sure we can also use it once we buy it and pay for it.</li>
            <li> Broke right away. Use for little ones not adults.</li>
            <li> This item is just ok. It is pretty and sparkly, but it will &amp;#34;break&amp;#34;. The links need to be tightened in multiple places. It is a great price and will definitely suit the purpose.</li>
            <li> It really is kinda pretty in person, but the links that hold the gems together have gaps so when I picked it up for the 1st time it fell apart.  We had to get pliers and find all the pieces to squeeze it back together.  Once repaired, it&#x27;s not quite as flimsy a you might expect.  Definitely worth the money, if you have a month or 2 to wait for delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this one, very pretty and it feel great on my head.</li>
            <li> The hair band is very pretty.  I&#x27;m disappointed because one of the stone is missing.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and i needed something to accessorize it without overpowering my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;the large bands take over my hair and i needed something with the right amount of detail to make my dress pop.&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love from first sight!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to give to my niece and she was really happy. She really like the design. I know she love it because I always see her wearing it on her hair. Sometimes, I also do some hairstyles on her hair with this headband and it really looks good on her.</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s just like the picture ! Fits awesome</li>
            <li> This is a lovely headband!  It&#x27;s very pretty and very lightweight. You forget that you&#x27;re wearing it. It was the perfect last touch to my daughter&#x27;s homecoming look! I love it!</li>
            <li> My brother&#x27;s girlfriend bought me this for Christmas because I put it on my wishlist. It took forever to get here, but I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal because it was shipping from Asia so, whatever. The reason I&#x27;m so unhappy I even put this product on my list is because it broke into 3 pieces within 30 seconds of being out of the packaging. What a waste of money. The &amp;#34;metal&amp;#34; part connecting the sparkly headband to the elastic snapped along with part of the sparkly headband. It was so cute and I couldn&#x27;t wait to wear it, but it wouldn&#x27;t even stretch to go on my (normal-sized) head! Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this sweet Lilly headband! So pretty and shiny! Fits my head perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this headband! I got it to wear in a wedding and its delicate and feminine. Good quality especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t worn it yet but it looks just like the picture! Very chic!</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable. The links that hold it together are huge and dig into my scalp.</li>
            <li> It is very nice headbamd after I fixed the broken pieces when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I really like this band. It&#x27;s pretty, but not too flashy, and it stays out really well.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair back and very stylish.</li>
