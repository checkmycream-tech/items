            <li>Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Recovery Toner is a perfect balance.</li>
            <li>this has been the best silkiest toner I&#x27;ve ever used....</li>
            <li>Great toner.  </li>
            <li>The product is great.</li>
            <li>it gets off the rest of my makeup and helps cleanse my skin without drying it out, and it has great anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li>Price is great too.</li>
            <li>I actually love it!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad on buying this!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell and consistency.  </li>
            <li>This toner is perfect for me because the cleanser I use works very well, but, sometimes it dries out my skin.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have that rubbing alcohol feel that toner can sometimes have.</li>
            <li>Loving this toner would buy more.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews on this toner (it was on a list of top 10 toners and got an 8.5 out of 10).</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to address redness in my face and my skin tone and texture has never been better.  </li>
            <li>This is also my favorite I use both.</li>
            <li>and I love everything I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and get it all the time.</li>
            <li>But now I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many toners ranging in drug store quality to $50 toners....</li>
            <li>This toner is great for all skin types to use before bed, it will make your skin feel smooth and look much clearer when you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>However, when I opened and smelled, it gave a strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>Fantastic products</li>
            <li>Wears comfortably under makeup and sunscreen and does not seem to cause break outs.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel like it was getting my skin clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different types of toners and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>All of their products are extremely well formulated and very effective.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and really does moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a toner before since I&#x27;ve always had dry, sensitive skin, but this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping I would like this toner because I LOVE the oil booster and have been on a never ending search for a toner that doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For normal days and light reactions I use once a day.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like this at first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so milky smooth (the toner) and not harsh at all</li>
            <li>If you want $10 off your first order, click on this link: http://goo.gl/38yriL</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft after I use.</li>
            <li>Felt like a breath of fresh air for my sensitive combination skin!</li>
            <li>Has made such an improvement to my skin (I have dry skin) and it has done good for me</li>
            <li>It feels great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like some other astringents.</li>
            <li>and they really did help my skin.</li>
            <li>It is made for dryer skin types though, so if you have oily skin it can be too much for day wear and make your face shiny.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much difference from Clinique.</li>
            <li>I really like Paulas stuff.</li>
            <li>New customers (people ordering for the first time from the PC website) can get $10 off by clicking this link https://goo.gl/zCfCFd</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality toner.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product is so soothing and calming.  </li>
            <li>Supposed to be for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone with dry to normal skin, especially if it&#x27;s sensitive.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>If I start having a major reaction, I will use this line a few times a day to soothe my skin and it helps SO much.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice smell and consistency.  Toner does not break out my skin or dry me out.  However, I don&#x27;t see any visible difference in my skin.  For example, skin doesn&#x27;t feel softer or look any brighter or smoother after use.  So I probably would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> For years I thought I was allergic to everything - red itchy skin and breakouts.  I also thought I had oily skin, because of the breakouts.  Then I heard if Rosacea and everything made sense!!  I NEED this product!  If I start having a major reaction, I will use this line a few times a day to soothe my skin and it helps SO much.  For normal days and light reactions I use once a day.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping I would like this toner because I LOVE the oil booster and have been on a never ending search for a toner that doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin. However, even though it says it is for sensitive skin, it made mine feel dry, tight and it actually made my skin redder. Back to searching!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this product if you have oily skin. This toner is perfect for me because the cleanser I use works very well, but, sometimes it dries out my skin. Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Recovery Toner is a perfect balance.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on this toner (it was on a list of top 10 toners and got an 8.5 out of 10). It feels nice on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have that rubbing alcohol feel that toner can sometimes have. I don&#x27;t have very dry skin or redness problems however so I will probably try something else next time but I would totally suggest it to someone with dry skin- you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This has a sweet smell unlike the same product purchase from the Paula&#x27;s choice website - weird!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I purchased it to address redness in my face and my skin tone and texture has never been better.  I have very sensitive skin and this product is so soothing and calming.  At $20, this is a steal.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality toner.</li>
            <li> This is also my favorite I use both. I have been with Paula&#x27;s Choice for years. Fantastic products and they really did help my skin. I like her makeup also.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and went on smoothly. Felt like a breath of fresh air for my sensitive combination skin!

            <li> Great toner.  Just started using it</li>
            <li> This toner is great for all skin types to use before bed, it will make your skin feel smooth and look much clearer when you wake up in the morning. It is made for dryer skin types though, so if you have oily skin it can be too much for day wear and make your face shiny. Wears comfortably under makeup and sunscreen and does not seem to cause break outs. Thanks</li>
            <li> The product is great. It feels great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like some other astringents. It gives a dewy feel. But, if I use it for several days in a row (evenings only), by morning, my forehead breaks out with these tiny ball-point size pimples.</li>
            <li> I actually love it! Has made such an improvement to my skin (I have dry skin) and it has done good for me so I&#x27;m glad on buying this! hopefully it continues to be that way .. (definitely repurchasing)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much difference from Clinique.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and get it all the time. I really like Paulas stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at first.  Didn&#x27;t feel like it was getting my skin clean.  But now I love it.  It&#x27;s so milky smooth (the toner) and not harsh at all</li>
            <li> Supposed to be for sensitive skin but it makes my skin red and burns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a toner before since I&#x27;ve always had dry, sensitive skin, but this stuff is great.  I apply it after I wash my face with the Moisture Boost cleanser- it gets off the rest of my makeup and helps cleanse my skin without drying it out, and it has great anti-aging benefits. My skin feels super soft after I use. I use it morning and night. I would recommend it for anyone with dry to normal skin, especially if it&#x27;s sensitive.

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many toners ranging in drug store quality to $50 toners.... this has been the best silkiest toner I&#x27;ve ever used.... so if you&#x27;re a Dior girl, you really can&#x27;t go wrong :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different types of toners and this one is my favorite.  It applies smoothly and really does moisturize your skin.  Price is great too.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It does not dry out my skin. I have very dry skin but still like to use toner so this works well for me.</li>
            <li> Loving this toner would buy more.</li>
            <li> This product was not well packed like pics I seemed online. The cap used only a small tape on the gap between the cap and the bottle. And when I opened it, there were lotion that makes the product seemed to be a used one. I had not used any other products of this brand, but the reason why I purchased this is because it is said that Paula&#x27;s Choice does not use any alcohol. However, when I opened and smelled, it gave a strong alcohol smell. Don&#x27;t know if the product should be like this or not, but do not recommend others to risk to try it on face.</li>
