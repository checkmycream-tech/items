            <li>I even liked the stamper that came with it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this assortment as they had a nice selection of designs I haven&#x27;t seen elsewhere.</li>
            <li>They were in numerical order in packs of 5 which was nice but</li>

            <li>You will have to purchase your own scraper and stamp as it is not included with this set.</li>
            <li>I read many good reviews, and glad many of you are happy with the set.  </li>

            <li>The images are etched nicely.</li>
            <li>The images are very well made and stamp beautifully with the xl stamper!</li>
            <li>I had no reason to contact the company, but they sent me a follow up email to make sure I was having a good experience with the product.</li>
            <li>Im just thrilled with these plates.</li>
            <li>really a nice surprise because I was wondering what to put them in once they arrived.</li>

            <li>nice price, nice design, can&#x27;t beat Konad quality, and still cost efficient, would recommend, and planning to buy more cheeky Gal.</li>
            <li>Great price and super value.</li>
            <li>These plates are very easy to use and don&#x27;t require the Konrad stamping polish.</li>

            <li>The 2012 Cheeky Set of 26 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit With Total of 160 Nail Art Designs is excellent in many ways.  </li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m sure that would work too.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but it turned out cute.</li>
            <li>Will buy more templates from Cheeky.  </li>
            <li>Just took a while to be able to use the stamper correctly.</li>
            <li>Most don&#x27;t stamp no matter what I use.  </li>
            <li>the better the print would turn out on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I got these before they sold out.  </li>
            <li>Someone on YouTube mentioned that the metal scrapers work better on plates that aren&#x27;t Konad.</li>
            <li>2 friends of mine tried neither of them were able to get these to work either.</li>
            <li>Love all of the designs.</li>
            <li>I love the designs on these plates.</li>
            <li>Most of them work well.  </li>
            <li>I tried a variety of nail polishes and still most of the images don&#x27;t transfer over.</li>
            <li>Love love love love love love love love love love love love love this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I love the variety that comes with this set.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad i did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update....I have gotten somewhat better with the stamping and will continue to try using these.  </li>
            <li>so looking forward to getting better.  </li>
            <li>The designs transferred over a lot better to the stamper to my nails.  </li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s so many to choose from.</li>
            <li>Turned out cute and it was SO EASY!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My customers love them.</li>
            <li>Love them they work well</li>
            <li>Omg I just received my plates today in the mail I am more then satisfied with these plates</li>
            <li>I love the designs and the people at Cheeky</li>
            <li>but so many don&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you purchase a stamper, and you&#x27;ll want thicker polish for stamping.</li>
            <li>I love my stamps</li>
            <li>I love it all.</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re about 5/8\\&quot; from top to bottom).</li>
            <li>Make sure to remove the plastic on each plate before you get started.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than me trying to paint a line or a squiggle myself.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy so many from Cheeky.</li>
            <li>the selection was of artwork is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I love the images on these plates</li>
            <li>The images stamp better than the konad templates.</li>
            <li>Thank you cheeky for such a great product!</li>
            <li>You do get 26 plates, I didn&#x27;t get 1-26, it was more like 1-17, 19-23, 25-27, 29.</li>
            <li>I love to decorate my nails every chance I get and these had all the designs I wanted.</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied of the choice that I made to add Cheeky to my collections.</li>
            <li>Lots of cute designs, work well</li>
            <li>Cute patterns tho.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that the scraper was plastic</li>
            <li>I love the variety</li>
            <li>They are well made and adorable.</li>
            <li>and i have to say that i really love these plates</li>
            <li>I love the plates and the designs&lt;</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these plates.</li>
            <li>The plates have nice smooth edges.</li>
            <li>But Cheeky has really cute designs</li>
            <li>Most of them come out well.</li>
            <li>Bought this set for my girlfriend and she loves them, she gets many hours of enjoyment out of their use.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on the work after using stamp plate</li>
            <li>Each one enjoyed picking out their stamps and colors for designs</li>
            <li>Some colors worked better then others</li>
            <li>I saw THESE products featured on a blog I love and thought, &amp;#34;Huh,</li>
            <li>And the styles are adorable.</li>
            <li>, I love you</li>
            <li>are the best, definitely recommend them 100%.</li>
            <li>and I just love love love them.</li>
            <li>Love the plates.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok for me,</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>but I finally did and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>My girls love them.</li>
            <li>I love that they come with a protective sheet that you peel off, but despite that  about 3of my plates were scratched, but they still stamped well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did I tell you how much I love these?</li>
            <li>(I gifted this</li>
            <li>Ok, so I ordered this product Dec. 28th, 2012.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d spend my money with this company again. :)</li>
            <li>and the plates came in the cute cubed case with a plastic card scraper.  </li>
            <li>I tried out different polishes to see which ones worked the best and watched some tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Also, watching different tutorials will help you find the method that works best for you.</li>
            <li>I really love these plates</li>
            <li>I may just have to order another one :)</li>
            <li>(Konad plates are better).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s because of my nail polish &#x27;cause I&#x27;ve tried many colors.</li>
            <li>They came a week after order and I love them....</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than I can say for most companies who sell through e-commerce sites like Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the price of cheeky plates compared to konad</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>they are she wont be able to use them.</li>
            <li>Take the risk because I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Lov love these plates.</li>
            <li>I love the designs, I just wish they worked.  </li>
            <li>but when you stamp you notice that the Konad plate is a much better plate.</li>
            <li>Now if you do not have patience get all Konad stamps, but if you want a lot of fun plates get the Cheeky plates a ton of designs and cheap you just have to work with them and try thicker polishes and be patient to get great results.</li>
            <li>So many designs for the price</li>
            <li>Just need more practise.</li>
            <li>and I shall be buying more.</li>
            <li>I think most of the images are cute and wearable.  </li>
            <li>These are ok.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these plates.</li>
            <li>I wonder what I will do with so many images</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>so it catches more polish and a clearer and more defined stamp.</li>
            <li>the next brand that works wonderfully is Sally Hanson Insta-Dri</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of them</li>
            <li>she does all her friends nails, and they love it also...</li>
            <li>but wow.....I need more fingernail polish with it....</li>
            <li>LOL thanks</li>
            <li>I so love these.</li>
            <li>But will not be spending more money to find out.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the storage box.</li>
            <li>This is such a good deal!!</li>
            <li>I love the variety.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better anyway.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with the selection of plates and definitely recommend!  </li>
            <li>I love the designs on these plates and the summer collection.</li>
            <li>I think it was a problem while it was being ensemble at the cheeky H.Q, because if it was a shipping problem then it would have been more than just one nail plate being damaged)</li>
            <li>Love the stamps and designs</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Most family functions now end up turning into a nail party for all the girls.  </li>
            <li>Some of the duplicates were cute ones, so I have since passed them on to my daughter and nieces...</li>
            <li>so cute. :)</li>
            <li>but most are so don&#x27;t hold that against them.</li>
            <li>Wife and daughters LOVE these</li>
            <li>This item is okay there are some really cute designs on each image plate.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to practice it more</li>
            <li>I chose them because they had so many choices for the tips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already received many compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to creating more designs with the set.</li>
            <li>The designs are cute and original, and add to my collection nicely.  </li>
            <li>of the plates appear to be good quality metal, but scratch VERY easily with the Konad metal scraper - the enclosed card much works better as a scraper without scratching them.</li>
            <li>they give a really nice clean stamp, although there is more of a tendency to smear while stamping.</li>
            <li>I was initially very excited about these plates.</li>
            <li>They stamp well and are very unique.  </li>
            <li>i was very excited about this purchase.  </li>
            <li>These are high quality, all stamped great with no problems, a set anyone would love</li>
            <li>Just throw away all the paper towels, wipes and q-tips, clean stamping plates and brushes with warm soupy water.</li>
            <li>tips on stamping with problem plates or designs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that if an image doesn&#x27;t stamp well, try it w/other polishes or applying lighter or stronger pressure on the scraper and also on the very fine images with fine lines, I found that if I transfer it faster, they do stamp</li>
            <li>and they are all super cute!</li>
            <li>But I am super pleased!</li>
            <li>The images are clear and stamp beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having so much fun with them!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to use!</li>
            <li>really easy to use come with a cute lil box to put in the plates and a lil emergency card to scrape off the design..</li>
            <li>good variety of designs but cheap quality, smudges easily but easy to clean&#x3D;</li>
            <li>I have try most of the designs and so far it works great.</li>
            <li>They are the best, the most beautiful nail art plates to be stamping it and bought the designs are beautiful, the pattern is very well marked, drilled is deep which makes the seal up very well</li>
            <li>These plates have worked great for me so far!</li>
            <li>Many of the plates have designs that are too fine and don&#x27;t carry over well</li>
            <li>Excellent way to get a variety of templates to keep nail designs different and just unique.</li>
            <li>Came faster than I expected, all stamped perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love these designs, and bought the set because it had so many full nail designs.</li>
            <li>So I have had a chance to try several of the full nail plates and have to say they work great!  </li>
            <li>they are very cute and the images come out really well!</li>
            <li>It was packed very well and all looks good.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the packaging was good.</li>
            <li>I already used them right away as soon as I have received them!!</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this product, so fun!</li>
            <li>This is a good beginner kit, it has a little of everything at a great price.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about getting so many designs with just 15 bucks.</li>
            <li>Finally for Christmas I caved in and bought this set and another set from Mash and LOVED them both!</li>
            <li>Some designs work better than others but overall I am quite happy with this purchase and have already recommended it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans up easy with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and</li>
            <li>Such a great value considering most plates range from $4 - $6 and with Cheeky</li>
            <li>They are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cleans up is easy just use water in stead of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>Easy to peel off cover.</li>
            <li>I received this set of nail stamping plates by Cheeky very quickly (two days after ordering).</li>
            <li>Everything I had read and seen on YouTube made this product look so easy and to my surprise</li>
            <li>or so of playing around with them, they are really easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are also easy transferable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use; besides trying to peel off the protective film.  </li>
            <li>I recently got into nail stamping, and thought that this would be a good way to get a nice variety of stamps without spending a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>loved the price and loved the simple elegant designs they were not sloppy and leave clean designs, 3 more words</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of any kind of nail art stamping plates.</li>
            <li>Full nail stamping is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I love that this set comes with a lot of the full nail plates.  </li>
            <li>Really cool  and cute designs.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice</li>
            <li>The stamper and scraper that came with the set work fine for me also.</li>
            <li>The plates are light and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>However, some of the designs have fine lines and detail.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>We normally get Konad brand stuff because it&#x27;s the best we could find as far a stamps</li>
            <li>The depth of the engraving worked fine for me, but I didn&#x27;t try their scraper or stamper</li>
            <li>but these worked just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>though it is pretty much a fraction of the price of a konad stamper, it is definitely of great quality as well.</li>
            <li>I love my nails now, thanks to Cheeky!:)</li>
            <li>I used a non-Konad nail polish and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li>so I guess that their quality control just isn&#x27;t up to par as others have said their plates work just fine.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, like how you&#x27;d expect nail stamp plates to work.</li>
            <li>The images are super cute.</li>
            <li>rest of the designs look super cute and are all there.</li>
            <li>There are so many cute images, I&#x27;ve used a few and love them can&#x27;t wait to use more!!</li>
            <li>I think these designs are very pretty; glad I found these.</li>
            <li>definitely aren&#x27;t the best designs in the world, but for the price it is a great first basic plate set!</li>
            <li>I used the [[ASIN:B004GFR3GY Konad Staming Nail Art Stamp &amp; Scraper Set Ii]] with regular nail polish and had an easy time getting good results with most designs.</li>
            <li>Was a little worried getting non Konad plates because I haven&#x27;t had the best luck</li>
            <li>Not only was a great price on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>When they became available, I received another email.</li>
            <li>Overall I think these plates are great.  </li>
            <li>but I am a beginner and with my Konad double ended stamper and metal scraper the images work great.</li>
            <li>Images transferred well and product is packaged securely.</li>
            <li>and they wouldn&#x27;t fit in the Pueen case I got,</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these plates.</li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this, because I have great fun with it.</li>
            <li>Clean up easy.</li>
            <li>Great nail art plates for the low price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for nail newbies or kids because they come out \\&quot;decent\\&quot;, but some designs aren&#x27;t deeply engraved.</li>
            <li>I also use the Konad stamper, and have even had success with the cheap &amp;#34;Salon Expressions&amp;#34; nail stamping kit picking up the polish colors with the Sinful Colors polish!</li>
            <li>If you have patience then the designs are great, and it is definitely going to save you money.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want yet another set of plates with designs that won&#x27;t fit on all of my nails.</li>
            <li>If I had paid double the money, I would be happy I bought them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plates fit in bm plate book.</li>
            <li>These stamps have a nice variety and work very well.</li>
            <li>Good etched designs .. seem to work well so far.  </li>
            <li>it is everything i was hoping for , it is really a good buy , and when you do the 25 dollar total for free shipping its a steal&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li>This set is soooo pretty !!</li>
            <li>The designs are etched well and are very fun to use.</li>
            <li>but if I use the special stamping polish it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I highly appreciate Cheeky&#x27;s customer service, and I would be more than pleased to order from them again.</li>
            <li>super easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be ordering more plates from this company in the future, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>so i knew to take off the protective film which came off super easy.  </li>
            <li>I totally LOVE the 2012 cheeky plates designs and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this that I almost for got to remove it.</li>
            <li>unique~  </li>
            <li>The images are very cute and so far have all stamped well.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also fun!</li>
            <li>I received 26 unique plates (no duplicates)</li>
            <li>Am still learning how to create unique designs.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun to say we did them ourselves!</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be buying more from them&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>So much fun!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to try them out, but  </li>
            <li>love the plates, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These plates are so much fun to use!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to recieve this product and then use it on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Originally I had been looking at the Bundle Monster plates</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 4 of the plates and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>My first stamp plate purchase and I love them.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of Cheeky plates and they are fantastic!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;This set&#x27;s full nail designs are the biggest available (guaranteed).</li>
            <li>This was my first stamping kit, and I was very excited when I bought it.</li>
            <li>I was really excited looking through the designs because there were more that I liked (and would actually use) than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Fun and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Even using my konad stamping polish I can&#x27;t seem to pick up a clean transfer.</li>
            <li>so I have to clean off the stamper and the plate with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cheeky made it fun and easy.  </li>
            <li>The designs transfer clean and I had no damage to my plates.</li>
            <li>Great gift idea for an upper elementary child.</li>
            <li>all of the grand kids had fun just playing with acylic paint and stamping just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li>I find that when using the Konad &amp;#34;special polish,&amp;#34; you have to leave it sitting in the design for 15-30 seconds, depending on the design, before it will lift cleanly off the design.</li>
            <li>The plates stamp cleanly with a Konad scraper and stamper.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying stamps and so far I&#x27;m loving them!</li>
            <li>:) So far i had tried most of my plates and they stamp well.</li>
            <li>Keeping in mind that I haven&#x27;t tested every single image I would say this is a great set.</li>
            <li>really wanted to order the huge rectangle plates, but decided to start with these first to see how I liked the designs and quality.  </li>
            <li>When stamping the images come out nice and clear for me!</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the extra effort to maintain good customer service!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use special stamping polish, to do her nsils</li>
            <li>The product came un a especial box, all the plates had a special cover to protect the images.</li>
            <li>I did not know you could not use any nail polish but have to buy a special one.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this whenever I paint my nails, to add a special touch.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to see these plates.  </li>
            <li>They give you a lot of different options and it is very easy to use!</li>
            <li>However, these worked great on every nail except for my thumb, which I expected from any brand of plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first manicure was a success and each one gets better.</li>
            <li>Lots of full nail images to choose from</li>
            <li>Every design is shown as advertised and full nail designs cover all of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this set has a nice selection of images/full nail designs to keep one busy for awhile.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Might be lite on depth of design on some but good overall.</li>
            <li>I still need a lot of practice but from pictures people post with the product and some of the You Tube video, it looks like it can look really cool..</li>
            <li>I saw good reviews for the big image plates and went with this</li>
            <li>my nails look so cool.</li>
            <li>I am loving these plates so far.</li>
            <li>I like this set because it has a lot of the full nail choices.</li>
            <li>They are good but a lot smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>Show off your cool looking nails on your friends and family..</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend anyone buying these if you love stamping.</li>
            <li>Very pleased--many, many nail art options, essy to use</li>
            <li>GGreat products with lots of cool designs to choose from..</li>
            <li>had such good luck with walmart kit.</li>
            <li>A must have if you love nail art as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Full designs cover all my nail.  </li>
            <li>Cons: Even with a good amount of the plate protectors being scraped up, when peeled off, there were massive and minimul scratches on some of my plates (</li>
            <li>But overall good quality product.</li>
            <li>I love these designs, however I received them and they are very scratched up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a true addict to nail art...</li>
            <li>There are 64 full nail designs altogether (16 plates with 4 designs on each plate) and</li>
            <li>They have a lot of really cool designs.</li>
            <li>The full nail patterns require patience in lining up for wider nail beds but overall plates are good.</li>
            <li>As an avid stamper, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new image designs and was thrilled when I seen these available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>if we didn&#x27;t like it no problem just use top coat before stamping clean and try again if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to let you know Grandma, and her girl friends are all flaunting our newly designed nails too!</li>
            <li>The images come out crisp, clean, and fully detailed.</li>
            <li>you great with other sets.</li>
            <li>After seeing some great results other people have had with Cheeky, I ordered this set of 26 Cheeky plates.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this set to anyone into nail stamping!!</li>
            <li>more expensive polishes worked best with the designs.&lt;br /&gt;Clean stamper, plate, and scraper ASAP after stamping nail with polish</li>
            <li>I am enjoying playing around with using different color combinations to see what shows up on top of what colors.</li>
            <li>The designs are cut deeply into the plates, the plates are quality, designs are great, and the price is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a convenient box, although I like to store my plates in the baseball card sleeves for quick access.</li>
            <li>Overall, im satisfied with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>Excellent engraving (deep enough to hold nail polish).</li>
            <li>I really love the designs on this nail plate set… I would have given it a 5 star if it weren’t for the fact that the plate number 16 was really bended so the result is not even worth to try to stamp it</li>
            <li>The plates are fine and very diversified for lots of fun choices; it&#x27;s me that has to get the hang of it!</li>
            <li>I had never used them before and thought Konaids prices were way too high plus their patterns weren&#x27;t that cute.</li>
            <li>but I decided to give these plates a try since they had high ratings and were one of the more well known brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great pictures, only gripe is some of the finer detailed stamps are not coming out clearly for me.</li>
            <li>However, I still very much like this item!</li>
            <li>, I thought I got mini plates or something, they are the standard plate size but even more importantly the images fit my nails.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the purchase and will definitely do business with Designs By Cheeky again!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the short time it took to receive them</li>
            <li>The smaller designs are cute and most of them work, but I still don&#x27;t think that this product was worth the price.</li>
            <li>And super fast shipping !!</li>
            <li>Every image I stamped came out perfectly and fit my entire nail (I have short nails, but large hands)</li>
            <li>I tested almost every image, and the detail was great, all the way down to seeds on a strawberry, or links in a necklace.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the texture doesnt work good on my nails because my nails are too long, so the texture is small for the whole nail, but is perfect anyway</li>
            <li>Love the items they all work well and will purchase again if they offer new plates</li>
            <li>I was wanting some new designs and saw that Cheeky had some cute ones and they were affordable too.  </li>
            <li>I love my new plates </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m brand new to nail stamping, but even after practicing and getting used to doing it, most of these designs didn&#x27;t come out as desired.</li>
            <li>I got pretty darn fast after that, arriving in a cute faux book-looking case.</li>
            <li>this collection, lots of possibilities- be sure to use fast dry top coat!</li>
            <li>This was my first attempt at nail stamping and these plates were so much fun!</li>
            <li>It turned out to be exactly the way it was described on the site, and I am excited to see the print each time I use it.</li>
            <li>They worked the first time!</li>
            <li>The hardest part of use was deciding what to try first!</li>
            <li>I definitely will be getting more!</li>
            <li>and I am overall satisfied!</li>
            <li>Incredibly fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li>If you are new to the world of nail stamping or a seasoned vet, I strongly recommend Cheeky Stamps!</li>
            <li>just need to remember to clean them with acetone before the first use.</li>
            <li>These plates are loaded with great designs and cost so little.</li>
            <li>fun to play with, but tricky to figure out the whole stamping part!!</li>
            <li>These stamps work great and there are a lot of choices - although some are a bit redundant.</li>
            <li>plates are much smaller than I expected but the collection included many of the images that I was looking for and at an attractive price.  </li>
            <li>Konad plates are carved in deeper, allowing easier polish transfer, the Cheeky plates here are not,  so you have to do a lot of trial and error, I learned don&#x27;t use a metal scrapper, it scratches your plates and removes to much polish, just a light swipe with a credit card, and press with a medium amount of pressure to get the image to transfer from plate to stamp.</li>
            <li>Also I purchased a a few items through this company and  you get great customer service.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that now i have to figure out what kind of polish i need to use with the plates.</li>
            <li>some fun designs.</li>
            <li>so i bought this batch, and i love it so far</li>
            <li>but so far everything comes out pretty crisp and nice.</li>
            <li>But so far I like the product :]</li>
            <li>I own several sets of plates and lots of Konad.</li>
            <li>Takes some practice but definitely worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have a ton of fun with these.</li>
            <li>Daughter us having fun with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use with the Konad stamper/scraper.</li>
            <li>Recommend anyone to puchase it and have fun.</li>
            <li>When they came in the mail, my mom and I had hours of fun playing with our nails.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for nail art stamping plates, I recommend you these, they worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My girls &amp; I are having fun with all the designs.</li>
            <li>I having so much fun with these stamps.</li>
            <li>Fun Saturday afternoon.</li>
            <li>but they are fun to play around with.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these and will be buying future collections as well :)</li>
            <li>Leave a good finish on nails and allows a wide variety of figures on the nails.</li>
            <li>also youll need to get a &amp;#34;stamper&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;scraper&amp;#34; which will be about 5 bucks, so all in all, for all the money spent, this is way better and more for your money than those As seen on TV things.</li>
            <li>and I need to \\&quot;practice\\&quot; using them some more as this is such a fantastic idea</li>
            <li>Took a while to arrive but was kept informed by email, they were better than I expected and definately feel like I got my moneys worth, so many  fab designs.  </li>
            <li>it took a while (like almost a month) to arrive home, but it was worth</li>
            <li>I received this set of plates a few days early with is great!</li>
            <li>They stamp nicely but are on the smaller side.</li>
            <li>I have been having a lot of fun with this set.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this purchase at least happy enough to purchase some xl plate designs by Cheeky</li>
            <li>there are a bunch of them ( that&#x27;s always fun )....</li>
            <li>Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li>I found that you need to use a lot more polish to fill the designs and need to scrape forwards and backwards to get the excess polish off completely.</li>
            <li>Worth the money for the amount of options</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t use, but you&#x27;ve got your basic animal prints, stripes, etc and a lot of fun cute ones that I&#x27;m excited to try, like the wine bottle one and</li>
            <li>Other then that i love all the cute designs on the plates.</li>
            <li>other brands offer plates w a lot more cute designs.</li>
            <li>I have bought plates from many non Konad brands and i was usually quite satisfied, therefore, I decided to try these plates since I got a huge cheeky plate</li>
            <li>not as good as some other plates i have</li>
            <li>so you should really take it in consideration when buying these plates that it goes perfectly for short nails not for even medium or long.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to purchase another set right from them right now.</li>
            <li>The designs are a mishmash of cute, and flowery, and French mani, and some cool ones too.</li>
            <li>They clean up well and don&#x27;t get scratched too much.</li>
            <li>Overall not bad, but would like more variety in pictures.</li>
            <li>The images stamp very clear and pick up easy.  </li>
            <li>I really like that there are a lot of full nail image designs as thats what I&#x27;m into for stamping right now.  </li>
            <li>im not stamping right, so other than that the plates are pretty good</li>
            <li>I also love that the larger images fit your whole nail.</li>
            <li>these are fun and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>nice product , delivery time is long.</li>
            <li>but they seem to transfer ok, just need to employ a little more effort.</li>
            <li>I look forward to more plates if you ever decide to create new designs...as I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new plates!</li>
            <li>very decent, easy to stamp with, haven&#x27;t had any problems and they are all standard size and fit in the sleeves in my books</li>
            <li>The images stamp very well on the very first attempt.</li>
            <li>The designs on this plate are very intricate and very pretty.</li>
            <li>they came in early and they are exactly what I ordered they stamp on easily</li>
            <li>They are large enough for most nails and cut deep enough they stamp beautifully with no smudging.</li>
            <li>I like mycket order very much</li>
            <li>but you have to be very fast on these.  </li>
            <li>the designs are beautiful but only work with nail polish of sinful colors and the xl stamper other than that amazing and these two supplements needed to stamp well are worth it because they work with every single plate out there.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to see the new cheeky plates on sale.</li>
            <li>It took exactly 2 weeks to receive the plates...</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever done nail art stamping</li>
            <li>At first i was trying with a gel nail polish</li>
            <li>I am a first time stamper</li>
            <li>Was just going to throw the stamper away, as another reviewer said to, but decided to give it a try first.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I love the different types and style.</li>
            <li>First of all THE STAMPER AND SCRAPER SUCK.  </li>
            <li>There are many different designs.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li>Will come back and update my review after more trial and error.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this brand in the future.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of nail image plates</li>
            <li>These are my first stamping plates, purchased based on the reviews I read both here and on nail</li>
            <li>I only tested a couple of the images using a polish that was probably not the best choice since it dried pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase and would definitely buy this brand and from this seller again.imilar complaints, so it seems like Cheeky really needs to check their packaging more carefully.</li>
            <li>At first I thought these would be the jumbo size plates like the summer 2012 collection</li>
            <li>The Nail Art Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure images was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>This is my first stamping plate set, and I&#x27;m so excited!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many different designs for adults and kids.</li>
            <li>Buy the real deal, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Absolute no flaw!</li>
            <li>However, I wish I had ordered Bundle Monster plates first.</li>
            <li>Got exactly 26 and could not be happier.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>.. i would totally buy more cheeky</li>
            <li>Much easier for me to store them in the box!</li>
            <li>Make sure you have enough stampers!</li>
            <li>These were my first set of nail stamps</li>
            <li>Will definitely get more cheeky products.</li>
            <li>This is my first foray into nail stamping</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to buying more Cheeky nail plates in the future.</li>
            <li>I really like the french tip designs, they are so fun and interesting.</li>
            <li>this is the first set I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>Images stamped are crisp.</li>
            <li>really like this stamping plate!  </li>
            <li>most of the time only a part of the design got on the stamper.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been wanting to buy a Konad, but thinks it&#x27;s too expensive then this is a WONDERFUL alternative!</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying a nail stamp set</li>
            <li>All plates have a backing to prevent cuts and the top of the plate is covered in a blue film to protect them during shipping.</li>
            <li>I would have to add a suggestion, unlike Konad, you cannot use as many different brands of polish on these plates.</li>
            <li>Knowledge comes from stamping experience with plates, all comments left on Amazon, and research on nail blogs and many YouTube videos.</li>
            <li>there are many french tip designs....</li>
            <li>This is my first stamping plate set.</li>
            <li>So many plates and such neat designs.</li>
            <li>These were the first set of nail plates I have purchased, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>Will be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li>Comes in a great little decorative storage box so all of your plates can live together without getting misplaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great plates, they have a lot of variety and the image sizes actually appear to be large enough to cover the whole finger.</li>
            <li>Patterns come off easily with general nail polish.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying out different polishes before you do an actual manicure because you will find that some polishes don&#x27;t stamp at all while others work great</li>
            <li>These won&#x27;t fit the nail bed for my thumbs or even the very moderate length of some of my nails, which just barely peek over the top of my fingers.</li>
            <li>I was stunned by how clean and clear the images came out.</li>
            <li>I found the Cheeky plates to be deeply etched enough to get a good impression, unlike some plates I have.</li>
            <li>only good for short nails, or decals.</li>
            <li>so these are OK, they have some cute designs and some not nice ones, its about 50-50.</li>
            <li>The designs are deep enough to get a good stamp.</li>
            <li>but once you get that down and the right color, its pretty cool!!</li>
            <li>This is not a bad thing unless you are the half dozen other brands of plates I own :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do keep in mind that how well the design stamps depends not only on how well the image is embedded on the plate, but also the type of nail polish you use (my old white nail polish stamped great when I first got it</li>
            <li>i bought this for my sister and she love it, every piece was with a blue protector plastic and the designs are very fancy and pretty, we really like it.</li>
            <li>I will admit, with some not good reviews and some great reviews, I was apprehensive about purchasing this stamping set, but was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a seasoned stamper and have never had as much difficulty as I have had with these plates.</li>
            <li>The etching is deep enough and the images (that I have used so far) are great.  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant at first before purchasing these</li>
            <li>they are good quality although small for nails  </li>
            <li>They are just as good or very close to the quality of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>They came through the mail super quick and definitely met my expectations.</li>
            <li>but after giving these &#x27;problem&#x27; designs several tries, I found out that if you run the scraper more lightly, with hardly any pressure, they stamped fine!!!</li>
            <li>Designs stamp very nicely, but are much smaller than expected!</li>
            <li>Its always a plus when the blue plastic covering comes off easily, which these do.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, simple and complies offered by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have large hands.  </li>
            <li>The images are very crisp and clear.  </li>
            <li>But what I do know is that $15 was a great deal for so many of these image plates, especially considering that Konads go for about half of that per single plate.</li>
            <li>Upon e-mailing Amazon, I was a able to either mail the plates back and get a new set, or to get a 50% refund.</li>
            <li>The images come out nice and clear; even when I used the Sally Hansen Insta Dry polish.</li>
            <li>These plates come with a blue protective film that was very easy to remove, they have backing so that the edges are not sharp.  </li>
            <li>my next order may be those giant plates &gt;: )!&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve contacted Cheeky to see if I can avoid having to send the entire set back to my friend (more postage being required, boo!)</li>
            <li>I was expecting much longer</li>
            <li>i highly reccomend these!</li>
            <li>it really does make a difference from the plastic/creditcard scraper.</li>
            <li>They all stamp really well for me using reguler polish and a plastic scraper.  </li>
            <li>They transfer very well to the nail.</li>
            <li>If you buy 26 plates from Cheeky at a discounted rate, instead of the real deal like Konad, you are not saving money because they don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li>very diverse assortment.  </li>
            <li>and I got a very prompt reply.</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>The cracked glass doesn&#x27;t transfer at all and the Cheetah print is very blurry when transferred.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the designs are very</li>
            <li>but since they perform as expected, I&#x27;m okay with the faults.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy, just took off a star for the bends, they don&#x27;t stack evenly and a few rock back and forth.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t try out the one that came with the set because I never have much luck with them.  </li>
            <li>Very suprised by the designs.</li>
            <li>Anything would be appreciated....</li>
            <li>Then I bought the MASH 2012 plates and they have seemed to work really well.  </li>
            <li>thanks for any tips and comments....</li>
            <li>They are so fast and beats trying to draw these designs.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas because she is really into the nail art thing.  </li>
            <li>So Im going to keep them because I really like this set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was one design that was different than pictured on CH4, and although I actually like the one I got better, I think it&#x27;s still worth noting anytime there are discrepancies between the product pictured and the one received.</li>
            <li>I really like them they work well and</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I tried the trick of gently sanding the surface of the stamper and it helped marginally, but still wouldn&#x27;t pick up the whole design from a Konad plate.</li>
            <li>very easily&lt;br</li>
            <li>designs do not transfer to the nail very good&lt;</li>
            <li>thanks 4 everything</li>
            <li>if i put my fingers over the design and whole plate, i wont feel a difference.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I tried everything I read, watched a whole bunch of youtube videos and NOTHING worked.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get them straight</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>They came fast and work really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the cheeky brand.</li>
            <li>much polish was used.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>scrape lightly and stamp moderately.</li>
            <li>I really do think someone out there can get these plates to work, but it isn&#x27;t me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start stamping or someone like myself who&#x27;s become an enthusiast.</li>
            <li>Make sure to check all your plates carefully when you get these.</li>
            <li>These turned out a lot better than I expected.....</li>
            <li>Work really well.</li>
            <li>Works fairly well most of the time (I&#x27;m not experienced enough yet).</li>
            <li>I own several different brands.</li>
            <li>first set from Cheeky was the summer set, which also has the statement in the ad here on Amazon about having big full nail designs, and it does.</li>
            <li>the full nail designs pretty much only cover my pinkie.</li>
            <li>I am an avid stamper, and was looking for some new images.</li>
            <li>with a little practice it has become super easy.</li>
            <li>The tip designs don&#x27;t fit on my thumbs, but I must have larger thumb nails than most average women.  </li>
            <li>These designs are a lot better than the other Cheeky plates I ordered which were the octagon shaped plates.  </li>
            <li>I use these plates quite often; even more so than my other Cheeky plates.</li>
            <li>as they come shipped stacked on top of each other.</li>
            <li>The stamps are wide enough to cover my entire nail bed and transfer beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other plates for more but these are better not than the Konad but than other brands.</li>
            <li>The small designs are ok and the ones for french are really cute</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to have the other set of plates :)</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s pretty worth it.</li>
            <li>You will have to experiment with different nail polishes in order to get a clean design lifted off the plates.</li>
            <li>The images are fun, crisp, and diverse and open up a world of opportunities for nail stamping.  </li>
            <li>I tested only a few designs on 4 different plates and they were perfect so far.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that over some time companies figured out that nails are wide and bigger is better than smaller for a nail design.</li>
            <li>All the images are crisp and clear.</li>
            <li>the image came out crisp &amp; clear), how well you scrape and your speed of picking up the image &amp; stamping it on your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clear crisp stamping.</li>
            <li>The full nail designs were just a tad smaller</li>
            <li>If I had any complaints it would be that despite having the paper backing the sides felt a little sharp but that&#x27;s not enough to take away from a review of AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>I have only used the special polish with it, didnt try any of the &#x27;normal&#x27; polishes with it</li>
            <li>I am new to stamping and I am really trying to get the hang of these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it about a week, I love the different designs.</li>
            <li>there are so many different designs you will definitely find one that fits your mood and or your ensemble.  </li>
            <li>Big enough for my nails and lots of options to be creative.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and all 26 plates are different.  </li>
            <li>did have a big lead time for shipping, so if you&#x27;re wanting something quick you&#x27;ll have to pay for quicker shipping.</li>
            <li>so the images were more than big enough for my hands.</li>
            <li>I bought a kit in Vegas while on vacation of a different brand, but after reading several reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and love these.</li>
            <li>I decided that I could deal with the image mess-ups, as they weren&#x27;t really an issue, but I was kinda bummed that they weren&#x27;t able to get me my missing plate</li>
            <li>They are the same size, same depth of the design for the polish to stamp well, and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with both purchases.</li>
            <li>The Insta-Dri works so well because it dries quicker than regular polish allowing a tacky consistency to develop quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally buying more cheeky products in the future!</li>
            <li>These plates are for people that have super short shaped nails 😳.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it and even purchase more disks - just not full nail designs.</li>
            <li>In my opinion they are great for the price and also that the designs are big enough to cover an average size nail.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>every image I have tried stamped well- have to use a high pigmented polish.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I really expected larger plates, but to be honest I never really did nay detailed research.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend to all the nail lover out there to consider purchase cheeky plates.</li>
            <li>On one design I stamped it onto a piece of blank paper, just to see if I could get a full image, and out of about 20 stamps I finally got one that was clear and transferred the full image.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>so I was looking to add to my collection without spending the high price on Konad.</li>
            <li>These plates were far better than other stamping plates that I have used.</li>
            <li>All the designs I&#x27;ve tried so far came really sharp and neat in my nails, the stars patterns are definitly my favorites :)</li>
            <li>25 different polish brands and hundreds of stamping attempts later without a single good stamp, I am giving up on these plates.</li>
            <li>I just have to work a little cleaner :-)</li>
            <li>MOST of the image etchings of the designs, are not deep enough to hold the polish, to pick up a clear image!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it comes in a cute little box</li>
            <li>love the little box they came in.</li>
            <li>Most probably like you, I was a little weary because you cannot try them out if you want to return them.</li>
            <li>To the best of my knowledge, they haven&#x27;t come across a bad plate yet in either set.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old loves looking through and deciding which she wants on each nail.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few of the plates with my everyday inexpensive nail polish and they all seem to work very well and the pictures come out great.</li>
            <li>spent about 3 hours just stamping on my nail (with no base polish) working on getting the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Some images don&#x27;t fit across my wide nails.</li>
            <li>The few times I was able to pick up an image, when they were stamped on my nails they were patchy.</li>
            <li>It did take it away to actually receive them but worth the wait</li>
            <li>Not a complaint at all.  </li>
            <li>The designs are different and fun to play with.  </li>
            <li>normal polish works well with them</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with any of the images transferring and so far have gotten crisp clear images.</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with any of the images transferring and so far have gotten crisp clear images.</li>
            <li>individual nail designs are tiny also and many either don&#x27;t have much detail, or have so much detail crammed into a tiny space that no one will know what the design is supposed to be once on the nail.</li>
            <li>I love these plates, but the designs DO NOT FIT MY NAILS.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s nice and thick.)  </li>
            <li>The box has a very large assortment of tips, full nail patterns and little designs.</li>
            <li>First of all i was waiting for my plates over a month, which even for China is kinda long time, when i finally got it I was so excited, until i opened the package)</li>
            <li>I would say Cheeky&#x27;s images are right up there with Red Angel!  </li>
            <li>So i either have to risk this mistake again and wait and hope i get all the right ones... or just live without 6-10 and give the extra 5 to my sister in law...</li>
            <li>With the various stamping plates I own, I recommend a cheaper polish like Sinful Colors, as they have a huge array of colors, and are thick enough that the stamper picks up the thicker color.</li>
            <li>They all lots kind of unique design that hardly find in other brands of stamping plates</li>
            <li>there are a few designs that are very thin and only look good in black and white because of design thinness, but most look great.</li>
            <li>I also tested various images fine lines, big spaces,</li>
            <li>there are a lot of really pretty ones from full nail designs to little ones and tip ones.</li>
            <li>but since she is new to stamping</li>
            <li>Cheeky Plates is a new one here on amazon.</li>
            <li>, i contacted cheeky and they told me to contact amazon for a return so they would send a new set</li>
            <li>and I told them about the issue and the took care of it and sent me out a new plate.  </li>
            <li>I live in France</li>
            <li>I got what I paid for...a cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li>The designs were cute and when they arrived, I found they were wide enough to accommodate my nails, which I sometimes have a problem with.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Konad stamping set well before it was popular a few years back, you know, before they were $4 a plate.  </li>
            <li>ones that do work are very clear and stamp</li>
            <li>The designs are bigger and fit on my whole nail with other brands I had to try and get the empty spots filled which is a hastle.</li>
            <li>Nail art is all new to me since I just became interested about 3 weeks ago and have been trying different things.  </li>
            <li>Some of the designs are very little kiddish, but the ones that I do like, I love.</li>
            <li>i had the same prints as the first box</li>
            <li>there are some Konad dupes designs that print out exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I did my first manicure with the nail stamp plates last night</li>
            <li>At first I though the disc&#x27;s were scratched but discovered it was only the protective coating that appeared scratched.</li>
            <li>Just pick two distinctive colors - a light and dark to make it pop.</li>
            <li>great produict, pretty fast delivery, just disappointed that the nail art plates were not in their Cheeky box.  </li>
            <li>I was soo excited to receive this item after I have read the other customer reviews but to my disapoitment the package was incomplete</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pity that the bundle didn&#x27;t contain scraper and printer, as I expected, but everything else was very cool!</li>
            <li>* use a quick dry clear coat before stamping to try to save time.</li>
            <li>The only thing good about these plates was that they had very cute designs I only wish they worked :(.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again, hopefully with bigger full images.  </li>
            <li>I am a teen (and kind of small for my age) and</li>
            <li>Although the images are a little small, I am able to get the designs to fit on all of my fingers, besides my thumbs.</li>
            <li>it is likely the nail polish, remember it must be dark enough with one coat because unless you are talented enough to stamp the image twice and exact then you only get the one coat.</li>
            <li>very light where I could hardly see it.</li>
            <li>The only positive is that the items arrived quickly.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The full-nail image does not fit over my nails nicely - the plates are not wide enough.</li>
            <li>Each design covers my full nail plate without leaving any gaps like with other sets.</li>
            <li>Clean up is no fun because I end up with nail polish all over me.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is that the images could be larger for those who have wide or long nails....and please consider making them more readily available for international shipping!  </li>
            <li>I have few other sets and this one is of a higher quality and designs are really cute.</li>
            <li>The product comes in an adorable little box &amp; every plate is protected by a blue sticker.</li>
            <li>Im also in love with the little box they came in, it has room for about 10 extra plates, and magnetically closes.</li>
            <li>But other than that, everything was as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I really like the variety of images which include full nail which are wide enough for my nails (a major plus),</li>
            <li>Images come out clear.</li>
            <li>These plates did come with a clear blue cover so the plates do not scratch which is appreciated</li>
            <li>They stamp really well using the Konad double ended stamper</li>
            <li>After reading the mixed reviews, I was very nervous about ordering these plates</li>
            <li>I have not had any issues with any of the images I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>The etching on these plates is a tiny bit shallower than Konad, but not so much so that it affects image transfer or visibility.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with getting the image to look like a stencil.</li>
            <li>, I used an old card and my Konad stamper as I do with all my plates.  </li>
            <li>My TWO year old niece asks me to &amp;#34;paint stamp&amp;#34; her nails, and loves it.</li>
            <li>I would advise, instead of using those metal scrapers, to use an old credit card or gift card.</li>
            <li>but it was nowhere near the designs.</li>
            <li>All the plates have a blue cling film that can be peeled off without too much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I assumed that they might be doing something in the background, so I completely forgot about it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so it will probably cover my nails just if i completely cut them.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li>I also recommend using an old plastic card of some sort to scrape the excess polish off with.</li>
            <li>I use old credit type card as scraper so surfaces don&#x27;t get scratched.</li>
            <li>This ad contains a completely untrue statement:</li>
            <li>so they can get a refund because I&#x27;d rather handle it myself directly.</li>
            <li>Tried 2of the stamps so far and couldn&#x27;t get anyting to transfer.  </li>
            <li>I use an old gift card as a scraper, since the one from my stamper/scraper kit has a metal edge and scratched the plate.</li>
            <li>, the stamps seem to work well, I did get duplicates of 5 of the disks, so I only REALLY got 21 of the 26 plates that I paid for.  </li>
            <li>, they are constantly doing their nails now, there is so much excitement with each nail session.</li>
            <li>However, they are not as exciting as I expected them to be (in terms of quality).</li>
            <li>They also included a multi-colored round rhinestones wheel, and a multi-shape rhinestone wheel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the plates, and I think they were worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am having a good time learning the ins and outs of stamping on nails.  </li>
            <li>my daughter and I were so excited to get these - short shipping time - a bunch of super cute designs - so hard to figure out which ones to do first - 4 plates with seven small designs - 16 plates with four large and two small designs - 6 plates with six nail tip designs -</li>
            <li>Some designs are more difficult but with the right polish and some practice, it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li>It takes a little patience to master using the plates, but if you are patient it really is worth the effort!</li>
            <li>You might want to have your own little container or box for them, as they are in a small flimsy cardbord box, much like a deck of cards.</li>
            <li>The full nail images are on the small side, just slightly bigger than the ones on the first Bundle Monster set.  </li>
            <li>The set has 160 images to be exact not the over 180 stated, there are 64 full images, 60 small images and 36 french tips.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this set for its quality and price (compared to individual Konad plates) and will be looking at other Cheeky products!</li>
            <li>Some plates don&#x27;t work well :( , but there are more that work ok.</li>
            <li>I like that the stamper is a light pink, so that I can see red and pink polish on it nicely, unlike Konad dark pink stampers.</li>
            <li>The designs on them are very cute but unfortunately with how scratched up</li>
            <li>I was online and was just checking to see if there were any new fauxnad plates out, i have both bundle monster sets, shany, and the red angel plates.  </li>
            <li>I have several nail stamping plate sets, including the new Cheeky 2013 summer set, and the Cheely Jumbo XL plates.</li>
            <li>Its only a few bucks and will make a huge difference in your stamping.  </li>
            <li>the only problem with those was they didnt have much of the French Tip designs</li>
            <li>I ran a coarse file across it a few times first, not sure if that made a difference, but it seems to pick up the images well and is squishy enough to press the image on my nail nicely.</li>
            <li>I tried using several different plates and designs, and the designs didnt transfer to the stamper very well, or at all.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to send back the entire package...</li>
            <li>I am slowly getting better at stamping the images on my big toe.</li>
            <li>and they had some major defects.</li>
            <li>Konad stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After examining all of the plates, there were a few that were scratched but only one image was affected and actually, I think the scratches gave it a bit more interest - it was a french tip design that I may or may not use.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different stampers (Konad, white thick sticky type) that I own.  </li>
            <li>But other than the missing plate, I am fully satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Other than a few trial and error stamps I really love these plates.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun, but will take a little practice to get used to it.</li>
            <li>I was concerned for a few plates because they had what looked like deep scratches on the blue covering, but when I peeled off the covering they were fine.</li>
            <li>Set each child up with stamper, scaper, paper towels, some acrylice paints, something to stamp to I use some colored paper, give each child 1 dry coton wipe and 1 wet to clean plate after each design was stamped, paint brushes or q-tips for appling paint, quirted some paint out some smaller pieces of paper.</li>
            <li>have had a bit of difficulty with some of the smaller flower graphics stamping clearly...</li>
            <li>, ive only tried maybe 5 plates so far</li>
            <li>I was surprised because the in last set if stamping plates I received from Cheeky, all the designs worked with no problems at all!</li>
            <li>They are etched deep enough and work very well, a couple were scratched when I pulled the blue cover off</li>
            <li>As far as I can see, the designs are the same as shown.</li>
            <li>As I said the only trouble I had with them is the size of the full nail images</li>
            <li>Creamy thicker polishes are better than thin ones or shimmery</li>
            <li>Or if you&#x27;re only stamping one nail and it&#x27;s the main design, not cool that the whole design doesn&#x27;t pick up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, some people have very small nails beds, but some have larger beds than mine, but I imagine most people could forget about using these on a big toe.</li>
            <li>This is not to say some images are not flawed (because some definitely are) but on these it may work if you try them in other ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The designs are pretty clear, but not deep compare to Messy, Konad and Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li>They transfer really well and the combinations are endless.</li>
            <li>and i was pleased when they arrived, after further inspection i noticed that 1 of the little bags that came was the same as one other and</li>
            <li>but i had already used some of them and the time that will take to send them back and then wait for the other set to get here was just too much for me to make all of that trouble worth.</li>
            <li>There are only one or two designs that don&#x27;t quite transfer because the design was etched too shallow, but when each plate has 4 to 6 designs, that&#x27;s not bad!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all of these yet, so I can&#x27;t vouch for each and every single image, but the ones I have used transferred beautifully (including tiny intricate details), and none of the rest appear to have the shallow etching problem of which some people complained.</li>
            <li>One stamp was off center, ruining one of my stamping options because it falls off the plate, and the other had a deep scratch through the design, a cute cupcake, which ruins its potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased these plates, and a few Konad plates when I first started stamping, now when you look at them from a distance you wouldn&#x27;t notice any difference in the plates</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times since I first got it.</li>
            <li>These are just as good as any other expensive name brand nail art.</li>
            <li>and when u stamp to get the image, dont roll, just straight up and down.</li>
            <li>The plates are very thin and tend to bend very easily.</li>
            <li>It seems to be hit and miss as far as the plates go, large or small, as I am having issues with some of the 2013 plates.</li>
            <li>They are long and wide enough (unlike other brands) to cover the full size of your nail.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG.</li>
            <li>very happy with all images that ill use!!!</li>
            <li>My niece loved it so much I decided to buy one for her, but was very disappointed that it came in a small cheap cardboard box just big enough for the plates, with no scraper.  </li>
            <li>I really like the little stamper.  </li>
            <li>images come out clear and ill certainly be stamping with them again tomorrow!!!</li>
            <li>I really do need to practice using these since my placement of the little bow design I chose left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get used to using these if you have never used them before, but they are fun to play with.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised about the shipping, it was extremely</li>

            <li> the amount of stamps you get for the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they had fairly good reviews and had a much better price.</li>
            <li> I do own a Konad plate and am using that as my baseline comparison.</li>
            <li> Some stamp better than others; its a great deal;I love them.</li>
            <li> I bought these plates so I can do my own nails</li>
            <li> I thought it was nice that they remembered and emailed me again.</li>
            <li> I even liked the stamper that came with it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this assortment as they had a nice selection of designs I haven&#x27;t seen elsewhere.</li>
            <li> They were in numerical order in packs of 5 which was nice but</li>
            <li> I choose this set because I really liked almost all of the designs</li>
            <li> Well  this set of Cheeky plates is just as good and in our opinion, even better.  </li>
            <li> so far so good all plates I use work excellent.</li>
            <li> Others I own not all plates work.</li>
            <li> You will have to purchase your own scraper and stamp as it is not included with this set.</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews, and glad many of you are happy with the set.  </li>
            <li> Though the prints are nice</li>
            <li> hi i own a collection of nail plates that includes konad, bundle monster, sdp, and no brand plates</li>
            <li> They are just as nice as the Konad brand</li>
            <li> They came in a really nice box that can be used for storage and has a nice magnetic closure.</li>
            <li> The images are etched nicely.</li>
            <li> The images are very well made and stamp beautifully with the xl stamper!</li>
            <li> I had no reason to contact the company, but they sent me a follow up email to make sure I was having a good experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Im just thrilled with these plates.</li>
            <li> really a nice surprise because I was wondering what to put them in once they arrived.</li>
            <li> I used the Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear and Inta-Dri polishes with them and they worked really nicely.</li>
            <li> A rose</li>
            <li> and I have to say that cheeky plates are as good as my konad plates, and way better than my mash plates.</li>

            <li> I am very happy with these plates and feel like they give a nice crisp image, are easy to use, and feel well made.</li>
            <li> nice price, nice design, can&#x27;t beat Konad quality, and still cost efficient, would recommend, and planning to buy more cheeky Gal.</li>
            <li> Great price and super value.</li>
            <li> These plates are very easy to use and don&#x27;t require the Konrad stamping polish.</li>

            <li> These looked super cute in the photo and was a good price.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree these stamps are amazing and even the fine detail is visible.</li>
            <li> The 2012 Cheeky Set of 26 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit With Total of 160 Nail Art Designs is excellent in many ways.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m sure that would work too.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but it turned out cute.</li>
            <li> Will buy more templates from Cheeky.  </li>
            <li> Just took a while to be able to use the stamper correctly.</li>
            <li> Most don&#x27;t stamp no matter what I use.  </li>
            <li> the better the print would turn out on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad I got these before they sold out.  </li>
            <li> Someone on YouTube mentioned that the metal scrapers work better on plates that aren&#x27;t Konad.</li>
            <li> 2 friends of mine tried neither of them were able to get these to work either.</li>
            <li> Love all of the designs.</li>
            <li> I love the designs on these plates.</li>
            <li> Most of them work well.  </li>
            <li> I tried a variety of nail polishes and still most of the images don&#x27;t transfer over.</li>
            <li> Love love love love love love love love love love love love love this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I love the variety that comes with this set.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad i did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update....I have gotten somewhat better with the stamping and will continue to try using these.  </li>
            <li> so looking forward to getting better.  </li>
            <li> The designs transferred over a lot better to the stamper to my nails.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s so many to choose from.</li>
            <li> Turned out cute and it was SO EASY!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My customers love them.</li>
            <li> Love them they work well</li>
            <li> Omg I just received my plates today in the mail I am more then satisfied with these plates</li>
            <li> I love the designs and the people at Cheeky</li>
            <li> but so many don&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you purchase a stamper, and you&#x27;ll want thicker polish for stamping.</li>
            <li> I love my stamps</li>
            <li> I love it all.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re about 5/8\\&quot; from top to bottom).</li>
            <li> Make sure to remove the plastic on each plate before you get started.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than me trying to paint a line or a squiggle myself.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy so many from Cheeky.</li>
            <li> the selection was of artwork is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I love the images on these plates</li>
            <li> The images stamp better than the konad templates.</li>
            <li> Thank you cheeky for such a great product!</li>
            <li> You do get 26 plates, I didn&#x27;t get 1-26, it was more like 1-17, 19-23, 25-27, 29.</li>
            <li> I love to decorate my nails every chance I get and these had all the designs I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied of the choice that I made to add Cheeky to my collections.</li>
            <li> Lots of cute designs, work well</li>
            <li> Cute patterns tho.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that the scraper was plastic</li>
            <li> I love the variety</li>
            <li> They are well made and adorable.</li>
            <li> and i have to say that i really love these plates</li>
            <li> I love the plates and the designs&lt;</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these plates.</li>
            <li> The plates have nice smooth edges.</li>
            <li> But Cheeky has really cute designs</li>
            <li> Most of them come out well.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my girlfriend and she loves them, she gets many hours of enjoyment out of their use.</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on the work after using stamp plate</li>
            <li> Each one enjoyed picking out their stamps and colors for designs</li>
            <li> Some colors worked better then others</li>
            <li> I saw THESE products featured on a blog I love and thought, &amp;#34;Huh,</li>
            <li> And the styles are adorable.</li>
            <li> , I love you</li>
            <li> are the best, definitely recommend them 100%.</li>
            <li> and I just love love love them.</li>
            <li> Love the plates.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok for me,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> but I finally did and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> My girls love them.</li>
            <li> I love that they come with a protective sheet that you peel off, but despite that  about 3of my plates were scratched, but they still stamped well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did I tell you how much I love these?</li>
            <li> (I gifted this</li>
            <li> Ok, so I ordered this product Dec. 28th, 2012.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d spend my money with this company again. :)</li>
            <li> and the plates came in the cute cubed case with a plastic card scraper.  </li>
            <li> I tried out different polishes to see which ones worked the best and watched some tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Also, watching different tutorials will help you find the method that works best for you.</li>
            <li> I really love these plates</li>
            <li> I may just have to order another one :)</li>
            <li> (Konad plates are better).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s because of my nail polish &#x27;cause I&#x27;ve tried many colors.</li>
            <li> They came a week after order and I love them....</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than I can say for most companies who sell through e-commerce sites like Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the price of cheeky plates compared to konad</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> they are she wont be able to use them.</li>
            <li> Take the risk because I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Lov love these plates.</li>
            <li> I love the designs, I just wish they worked.  </li>
            <li> but when you stamp you notice that the Konad plate is a much better plate.</li>
            <li> Now if you do not have patience get all Konad stamps, but if you want a lot of fun plates get the Cheeky plates a ton of designs and cheap you just have to work with them and try thicker polishes and be patient to get great results.</li>
            <li> So many designs for the price</li>
            <li> Just need more practise.</li>
            <li> and I shall be buying more.</li>
            <li> I think most of the images are cute and wearable.  </li>
            <li> These are ok.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE these plates.</li>
            <li> I wonder what I will do with so many images</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> so it catches more polish and a clearer and more defined stamp.</li>
            <li> the next brand that works wonderfully is Sally Hanson Insta-Dri</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of them</li>
            <li> she does all her friends nails, and they love it also...</li>
            <li> but wow.....I need more fingernail polish with it....</li>
            <li> LOL thanks</li>
            <li> I so love these.</li>
            <li> But will not be spending more money to find out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the storage box.</li>
            <li> This is such a good deal!!</li>
            <li> I love the variety.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better anyway.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with the selection of plates and definitely recommend!  </li>
            <li> I love the designs on these plates and the summer collection.</li>
            <li> I think it was a problem while it was being ensemble at the cheeky H.Q, because if it was a shipping problem then it would have been more than just one nail plate being damaged)</li>
            <li> Love the stamps and designs</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Most family functions now end up turning into a nail party for all the girls.  </li>
            <li> Some of the duplicates were cute ones, so I have since passed them on to my daughter and nieces...</li>
            <li> so cute. :)</li>
            <li> but most are so don&#x27;t hold that against them.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughters LOVE these</li>
            <li> This item is okay there are some really cute designs on each image plate.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to practice it more</li>
            <li> I chose them because they had so many choices for the tips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already received many compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to creating more designs with the set.</li>
            <li> The designs are cute and original, and add to my collection nicely.  </li>
            <li> of the plates appear to be good quality metal, but scratch VERY easily with the Konad metal scraper - the enclosed card much works better as a scraper without scratching them.</li>
            <li> they give a really nice clean stamp, although there is more of a tendency to smear while stamping.</li>
            <li> I was initially very excited about these plates.</li>
            <li> They stamp well and are very unique.  </li>
            <li> i was very excited about this purchase.  </li>
            <li> These are high quality, all stamped great with no problems, a set anyone would love</li>
            <li> Just throw away all the paper towels, wipes and q-tips, clean stamping plates and brushes with warm soupy water.</li>
            <li> tips on stamping with problem plates or designs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that if an image doesn&#x27;t stamp well, try it w/other polishes or applying lighter or stronger pressure on the scraper and also on the very fine images with fine lines, I found that if I transfer it faster, they do stamp</li>
            <li> and they are all super cute!</li>
            <li> But I am super pleased!</li>
            <li> The images are clear and stamp beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having so much fun with them!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to use!</li>
            <li> really easy to use come with a cute lil box to put in the plates and a lil emergency card to scrape off the design..</li>
            <li> good variety of designs but cheap quality, smudges easily but easy to clean&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I have try most of the designs and so far it works great.</li>
            <li> They are the best, the most beautiful nail art plates to be stamping it and bought the designs are beautiful, the pattern is very well marked, drilled is deep which makes the seal up very well</li>
            <li> These plates have worked great for me so far!</li>
            <li> Many of the plates have designs that are too fine and don&#x27;t carry over well</li>
            <li> Excellent way to get a variety of templates to keep nail designs different and just unique.</li>
            <li> Came faster than I expected, all stamped perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love these designs, and bought the set because it had so many full nail designs.</li>
            <li> So I have had a chance to try several of the full nail plates and have to say they work great!  </li>
            <li> they are very cute and the images come out really well!</li>
            <li> It was packed very well and all looks good.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the packaging was good.</li>
            <li> I already used them right away as soon as I have received them!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this product, so fun!</li>
            <li> This is a good beginner kit, it has a little of everything at a great price.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting so many designs with just 15 bucks.</li>
            <li> Finally for Christmas I caved in and bought this set and another set from Mash and LOVED them both!</li>
            <li> Some designs work better than others but overall I am quite happy with this purchase and have already recommended it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans up easy with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and</li>
            <li> Such a great value considering most plates range from $4 - $6 and with Cheeky</li>
            <li> They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cleans up is easy just use water in stead of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> Easy to peel off cover.</li>
            <li> I received this set of nail stamping plates by Cheeky very quickly (two days after ordering).</li>
            <li> Everything I had read and seen on YouTube made this product look so easy and to my surprise</li>
            <li> or so of playing around with them, they are really easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are also easy transferable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use; besides trying to peel off the protective film.  </li>
            <li> I recently got into nail stamping, and thought that this would be a good way to get a nice variety of stamps without spending a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> loved the price and loved the simple elegant designs they were not sloppy and leave clean designs, 3 more words</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of any kind of nail art stamping plates.</li>
            <li> Full nail stamping is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> and I love that this set comes with a lot of the full nail plates.  </li>
            <li> Really cool  and cute designs.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice</li>
            <li> The stamper and scraper that came with the set work fine for me also.</li>
            <li> The plates are light and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> However, some of the designs have fine lines and detail.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> We normally get Konad brand stuff because it&#x27;s the best we could find as far a stamps</li>
            <li> The depth of the engraving worked fine for me, but I didn&#x27;t try their scraper or stamper</li>
            <li> but these worked just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> though it is pretty much a fraction of the price of a konad stamper, it is definitely of great quality as well.</li>
            <li> I love my nails now, thanks to Cheeky!:)</li>
            <li> I used a non-Konad nail polish and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li> so I guess that their quality control just isn&#x27;t up to par as others have said their plates work just fine.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, like how you&#x27;d expect nail stamp plates to work.</li>
            <li> The images are super cute.</li>
            <li> rest of the designs look super cute and are all there.</li>
            <li> There are so many cute images, I&#x27;ve used a few and love them can&#x27;t wait to use more!!</li>
            <li> I think these designs are very pretty; glad I found these.</li>
            <li> definitely aren&#x27;t the best designs in the world, but for the price it is a great first basic plate set!</li>
            <li> I used the [[ASIN:B004GFR3GY Konad Staming Nail Art Stamp &amp; Scraper Set Ii]] with regular nail polish and had an easy time getting good results with most designs.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried getting non Konad plates because I haven&#x27;t had the best luck</li>
            <li> Not only was a great price on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> When they became available, I received another email.</li>
            <li> Overall I think these plates are great.  </li>
            <li> but I am a beginner and with my Konad double ended stamper and metal scraper the images work great.</li>
            <li> Images transferred well and product is packaged securely.</li>
            <li> and they wouldn&#x27;t fit in the Pueen case I got,</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these plates.</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this, because I have great fun with it.</li>
            <li> Clean up easy.</li>
            <li> Great nail art plates for the low price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for nail newbies or kids because they come out \\&quot;decent\\&quot;, but some designs aren&#x27;t deeply engraved.</li>
            <li> I also use the Konad stamper, and have even had success with the cheap &amp;#34;Salon Expressions&amp;#34; nail stamping kit picking up the polish colors with the Sinful Colors polish!</li>
            <li> If you have patience then the designs are great, and it is definitely going to save you money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want yet another set of plates with designs that won&#x27;t fit on all of my nails.</li>
            <li> If I had paid double the money, I would be happy I bought them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plates fit in bm plate book.</li>
            <li> These stamps have a nice variety and work very well.</li>
            <li> Good etched designs .. seem to work well so far.  </li>
            <li> it is everything i was hoping for , it is really a good buy , and when you do the 25 dollar total for free shipping its a steal&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> This set is soooo pretty !!</li>
            <li> The designs are etched well and are very fun to use.</li>
            <li> but if I use the special stamping polish it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I highly appreciate Cheeky&#x27;s customer service, and I would be more than pleased to order from them again.</li>
            <li> super easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be ordering more plates from this company in the future, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> so i knew to take off the protective film which came off super easy.  </li>
            <li> I totally LOVE the 2012 cheeky plates designs and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this that I almost for got to remove it.</li>
            <li> unique~  </li>
            <li> The images are very cute and so far have all stamped well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also fun!</li>
            <li> I received 26 unique plates (no duplicates)</li>
            <li> Am still learning how to create unique designs.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fun to say we did them ourselves!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be buying more from them&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> So much fun!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to try them out, but  </li>
            <li> love the plates, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These plates are so much fun to use!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve this product and then use it on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Originally I had been looking at the Bundle Monster plates</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 of the plates and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> My first stamp plate purchase and I love them.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of Cheeky plates and they are fantastic!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This set&#x27;s full nail designs are the biggest available (guaranteed).</li>
            <li> This was my first stamping kit, and I was very excited when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited looking through the designs because there were more that I liked (and would actually use) than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Fun and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Even using my konad stamping polish I can&#x27;t seem to pick up a clean transfer.</li>
            <li> so I have to clean off the stamper and the plate with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cheeky made it fun and easy.  </li>
            <li> The designs transfer clean and I had no damage to my plates.</li>
            <li> Great gift idea for an upper elementary child.</li>
            <li> all of the grand kids had fun just playing with acylic paint and stamping just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li> I find that when using the Konad &amp;#34;special polish,&amp;#34; you have to leave it sitting in the design for 15-30 seconds, depending on the design, before it will lift cleanly off the design.</li>
            <li> The plates stamp cleanly with a Konad scraper and stamper.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying stamps and so far I&#x27;m loving them!</li>
            <li> :) So far i had tried most of my plates and they stamp well.</li>
            <li> Keeping in mind that I haven&#x27;t tested every single image I would say this is a great set.</li>
            <li> really wanted to order the huge rectangle plates, but decided to start with these first to see how I liked the designs and quality.  </li>
            <li> When stamping the images come out nice and clear for me!</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the extra effort to maintain good customer service!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use special stamping polish, to do her nsils</li>
            <li> The product came un a especial box, all the plates had a special cover to protect the images.</li>
            <li> I did not know you could not use any nail polish but have to buy a special one.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this whenever I paint my nails, to add a special touch.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to see these plates.  </li>
            <li> They give you a lot of different options and it is very easy to use!</li>
            <li> However, these worked great on every nail except for my thumb, which I expected from any brand of plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> first manicure was a success and each one gets better.</li>
            <li> Lots of full nail images to choose from</li>
            <li> Every design is shown as advertised and full nail designs cover all of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this set has a nice selection of images/full nail designs to keep one busy for awhile.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Might be lite on depth of design on some but good overall.</li>
            <li> I still need a lot of practice but from pictures people post with the product and some of the You Tube video, it looks like it can look really cool..</li>
            <li> I saw good reviews for the big image plates and went with this</li>
            <li> my nails look so cool.</li>
            <li> I am loving these plates so far.</li>
            <li> I like this set because it has a lot of the full nail choices.</li>
            <li> They are good but a lot smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Show off your cool looking nails on your friends and family..</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend anyone buying these if you love stamping.</li>
            <li> Very pleased--many, many nail art options, essy to use</li>
            <li> GGreat products with lots of cool designs to choose from..</li>
            <li> had such good luck with walmart kit.</li>
            <li> A must have if you love nail art as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Full designs cover all my nail.  </li>
            <li> Cons: Even with a good amount of the plate protectors being scraped up, when peeled off, there were massive and minimul scratches on some of my plates (</li>
            <li> But overall good quality product.</li>
            <li> I love these designs, however I received them and they are very scratched up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a true addict to nail art...</li>
            <li> There are 64 full nail designs altogether (16 plates with 4 designs on each plate) and</li>
            <li> They have a lot of really cool designs.</li>
            <li> The full nail patterns require patience in lining up for wider nail beds but overall plates are good.</li>
            <li> As an avid stamper, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new image designs and was thrilled when I seen these available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> if we didn&#x27;t like it no problem just use top coat before stamping clean and try again if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to let you know Grandma, and her girl friends are all flaunting our newly designed nails too!</li>
            <li> The images come out crisp, clean, and fully detailed.</li>
            <li> you great with other sets.</li>
            <li> After seeing some great results other people have had with Cheeky, I ordered this set of 26 Cheeky plates.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this set to anyone into nail stamping!!</li>
            <li> more expensive polishes worked best with the designs.&lt;br /&gt;Clean stamper, plate, and scraper ASAP after stamping nail with polish</li>
            <li> I am enjoying playing around with using different color combinations to see what shows up on top of what colors.</li>
            <li> The designs are cut deeply into the plates, the plates are quality, designs are great, and the price is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Comes in a convenient box, although I like to store my plates in the baseball card sleeves for quick access.</li>
            <li> Overall, im satisfied with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> Excellent engraving (deep enough to hold nail polish).</li>
            <li> I really love the designs on this nail plate set… I would have given it a 5 star if it weren’t for the fact that the plate number 16 was really bended so the result is not even worth to try to stamp it</li>
            <li> The plates are fine and very diversified for lots of fun choices; it&#x27;s me that has to get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> I had never used them before and thought Konaids prices were way too high plus their patterns weren&#x27;t that cute.</li>
            <li> but I decided to give these plates a try since they had high ratings and were one of the more well known brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great pictures, only gripe is some of the finer detailed stamps are not coming out clearly for me.</li>
            <li> However, I still very much like this item!</li>
            <li> , I thought I got mini plates or something, they are the standard plate size but even more importantly the images fit my nails.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the purchase and will definitely do business with Designs By Cheeky again!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the short time it took to receive them</li>
            <li> The smaller designs are cute and most of them work, but I still don&#x27;t think that this product was worth the price.</li>
            <li> And super fast shipping !!</li>
            <li> Every image I stamped came out perfectly and fit my entire nail (I have short nails, but large hands)</li>
            <li> I tested almost every image, and the detail was great, all the way down to seeds on a strawberry, or links in a necklace.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the texture doesnt work good on my nails because my nails are too long, so the texture is small for the whole nail, but is perfect anyway</li>
            <li> Love the items they all work well and will purchase again if they offer new plates</li>
            <li> I was wanting some new designs and saw that Cheeky had some cute ones and they were affordable too.  </li>
            <li> I love my new plates </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brand new to nail stamping, but even after practicing and getting used to doing it, most of these designs didn&#x27;t come out as desired.</li>
            <li> I got pretty darn fast after that, arriving in a cute faux book-looking case.</li>
            <li> this collection, lots of possibilities- be sure to use fast dry top coat!</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at nail stamping and these plates were so much fun!</li>
            <li> It turned out to be exactly the way it was described on the site, and I am excited to see the print each time I use it.</li>
            <li> They worked the first time!</li>
            <li> The hardest part of use was deciding what to try first!</li>
            <li> I definitely will be getting more!</li>
            <li> and I am overall satisfied!</li>
            <li> Incredibly fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li> If you are new to the world of nail stamping or a seasoned vet, I strongly recommend Cheeky Stamps!</li>
            <li> just need to remember to clean them with acetone before the first use.</li>
            <li> These plates are loaded with great designs and cost so little.</li>
            <li> fun to play with, but tricky to figure out the whole stamping part!!</li>
            <li> These stamps work great and there are a lot of choices - although some are a bit redundant.</li>
            <li> plates are much smaller than I expected but the collection included many of the images that I was looking for and at an attractive price.  </li>
            <li> Konad plates are carved in deeper, allowing easier polish transfer, the Cheeky plates here are not,  so you have to do a lot of trial and error, I learned don&#x27;t use a metal scrapper, it scratches your plates and removes to much polish, just a light swipe with a credit card, and press with a medium amount of pressure to get the image to transfer from plate to stamp.</li>
            <li> Also I purchased a a few items through this company and  you get great customer service.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that now i have to figure out what kind of polish i need to use with the plates.</li>
            <li> some fun designs.</li>
            <li> so i bought this batch, and i love it so far</li>
            <li> but so far everything comes out pretty crisp and nice.</li>
            <li> But so far I like the product :]</li>
            <li> I own several sets of plates and lots of Konad.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice but definitely worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have a ton of fun with these.</li>
            <li> Daughter us having fun with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use with the Konad stamper/scraper.</li>
            <li> Recommend anyone to puchase it and have fun.</li>
            <li> When they came in the mail, my mom and I had hours of fun playing with our nails.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for nail art stamping plates, I recommend you these, they worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My girls &amp; I are having fun with all the designs.</li>
            <li> I having so much fun with these stamps.</li>
            <li> Fun Saturday afternoon.</li>
            <li> but they are fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these and will be buying future collections as well :)</li>
            <li> Leave a good finish on nails and allows a wide variety of figures on the nails.</li>
            <li> also youll need to get a &amp;#34;stamper&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;scraper&amp;#34; which will be about 5 bucks, so all in all, for all the money spent, this is way better and more for your money than those As seen on TV things.</li>
            <li> and I need to \\&quot;practice\\&quot; using them some more as this is such a fantastic idea</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive but was kept informed by email, they were better than I expected and definately feel like I got my moneys worth, so many  fab designs.  </li>
            <li> it took a while (like almost a month) to arrive home, but it was worth</li>
            <li> I received this set of plates a few days early with is great!</li>
            <li> They stamp nicely but are on the smaller side.</li>
            <li> I have been having a lot of fun with this set.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this purchase at least happy enough to purchase some xl plate designs by Cheeky</li>
            <li> there are a bunch of them ( that&#x27;s always fun )....</li>
            <li> Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li> I found that you need to use a lot more polish to fill the designs and need to scrape forwards and backwards to get the excess polish off completely.</li>
            <li> Worth the money for the amount of options</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use, but you&#x27;ve got your basic animal prints, stripes, etc and a lot of fun cute ones that I&#x27;m excited to try, like the wine bottle one and</li>
            <li> Other then that i love all the cute designs on the plates.</li>
            <li> other brands offer plates w a lot more cute designs.</li>
            <li> I have bought plates from many non Konad brands and i was usually quite satisfied, therefore, I decided to try these plates since I got a huge cheeky plate</li>
            <li> not as good as some other plates i have</li>
            <li> so you should really take it in consideration when buying these plates that it goes perfectly for short nails not for even medium or long.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to purchase another set right from them right now.</li>
            <li> The designs are a mishmash of cute, and flowery, and French mani, and some cool ones too.</li>
            <li> They clean up well and don&#x27;t get scratched too much.</li>
            <li> Overall not bad, but would like more variety in pictures.</li>
            <li> The images stamp very clear and pick up easy.  </li>
            <li> I really like that there are a lot of full nail image designs as thats what I&#x27;m into for stamping right now.  </li>
            <li> im not stamping right, so other than that the plates are pretty good</li>
            <li> I also love that the larger images fit your whole nail.</li>
            <li> these are fun and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> nice product , delivery time is long.</li>
            <li> but they seem to transfer ok, just need to employ a little more effort.</li>
            <li> I look forward to more plates if you ever decide to create new designs...as I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new plates!</li>
            <li> very decent, easy to stamp with, haven&#x27;t had any problems and they are all standard size and fit in the sleeves in my books</li>
            <li> The images stamp very well on the very first attempt.</li>
            <li> The designs on this plate are very intricate and very pretty.</li>
            <li> they came in early and they are exactly what I ordered they stamp on easily</li>
            <li> They are large enough for most nails and cut deep enough they stamp beautifully with no smudging.</li>
            <li> I like mycket order very much</li>
            <li> but you have to be very fast on these.  </li>
            <li> the designs are beautiful but only work with nail polish of sinful colors and the xl stamper other than that amazing and these two supplements needed to stamp well are worth it because they work with every single plate out there.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to see the new cheeky plates on sale.</li>
            <li> It took exactly 2 weeks to receive the plates...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever done nail art stamping</li>
            <li> At first i was trying with a gel nail polish</li>
            <li> I am a first time stamper</li>
            <li> Was just going to throw the stamper away, as another reviewer said to, but decided to give it a try first.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I love the different types and style.</li>
            <li> First of all THE STAMPER AND SCRAPER SUCK.  </li>
            <li> There are many different designs.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li> Will come back and update my review after more trial and error.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of nail image plates</li>
            <li> These are my first stamping plates, purchased based on the reviews I read both here and on nail</li>
            <li> I only tested a couple of the images using a polish that was probably not the best choice since it dried pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase and would definitely buy this brand and from this seller again.imilar complaints, so it seems like Cheeky really needs to check their packaging more carefully.</li>
            <li> At first I thought these would be the jumbo size plates like the summer 2012 collection</li>
            <li> The Nail Art Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure images was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> This is my first stamping plate set, and I&#x27;m so excited!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many different designs for adults and kids.</li>
            <li> Buy the real deal, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Absolute no flaw!</li>
            <li> However, I wish I had ordered Bundle Monster plates first.</li>
            <li> Got exactly 26 and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> .. i would totally buy more cheeky</li>
            <li> Much easier for me to store them in the box!</li>
            <li> Make sure you have enough stampers!</li>
            <li> These were my first set of nail stamps</li>
            <li> Will definitely get more cheeky products.</li>
            <li> This is my first foray into nail stamping</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to buying more Cheeky nail plates in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like the french tip designs, they are so fun and interesting.</li>
            <li> this is the first set I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> Images stamped are crisp.</li>
            <li> really like this stamping plate!  </li>
            <li> most of the time only a part of the design got on the stamper.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been wanting to buy a Konad, but thinks it&#x27;s too expensive then this is a WONDERFUL alternative!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a nail stamp set</li>
            <li> All plates have a backing to prevent cuts and the top of the plate is covered in a blue film to protect them during shipping.</li>
            <li> I would have to add a suggestion, unlike Konad, you cannot use as many different brands of polish on these plates.</li>
            <li> Knowledge comes from stamping experience with plates, all comments left on Amazon, and research on nail blogs and many YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> there are many french tip designs....</li>
            <li> This is my first stamping plate set.</li>
            <li> So many plates and such neat designs.</li>
            <li> These were the first set of nail plates I have purchased, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> Will be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> Comes in a great little decorative storage box so all of your plates can live together without getting misplaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great plates, they have a lot of variety and the image sizes actually appear to be large enough to cover the whole finger.</li>
            <li> Patterns come off easily with general nail polish.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying out different polishes before you do an actual manicure because you will find that some polishes don&#x27;t stamp at all while others work great</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t fit the nail bed for my thumbs or even the very moderate length of some of my nails, which just barely peek over the top of my fingers.</li>
            <li> I was stunned by how clean and clear the images came out.</li>
            <li> I found the Cheeky plates to be deeply etched enough to get a good impression, unlike some plates I have.</li>
            <li> only good for short nails, or decals.</li>
            <li> so these are OK, they have some cute designs and some not nice ones, its about 50-50.</li>
            <li> The designs are deep enough to get a good stamp.</li>
            <li> but once you get that down and the right color, its pretty cool!!</li>
            <li> This is not a bad thing unless you are the half dozen other brands of plates I own :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do keep in mind that how well the design stamps depends not only on how well the image is embedded on the plate, but also the type of nail polish you use (my old white nail polish stamped great when I first got it</li>
            <li> i bought this for my sister and she love it, every piece was with a blue protector plastic and the designs are very fancy and pretty, we really like it.</li>
            <li> I will admit, with some not good reviews and some great reviews, I was apprehensive about purchasing this stamping set, but was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a seasoned stamper and have never had as much difficulty as I have had with these plates.</li>
            <li> The etching is deep enough and the images (that I have used so far) are great.  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant at first before purchasing these</li>
            <li> they are good quality although small for nails  </li>
            <li> They are just as good or very close to the quality of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> They came through the mail super quick and definitely met my expectations.</li>
            <li> but after giving these &#x27;problem&#x27; designs several tries, I found out that if you run the scraper more lightly, with hardly any pressure, they stamped fine!!!</li>
            <li> Designs stamp very nicely, but are much smaller than expected!</li>
            <li> Its always a plus when the blue plastic covering comes off easily, which these do.  </li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, simple and complies offered by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have large hands.  </li>
            <li> The images are very crisp and clear.  </li>
            <li> But what I do know is that $15 was a great deal for so many of these image plates, especially considering that Konads go for about half of that per single plate.</li>
            <li> Upon e-mailing Amazon, I was a able to either mail the plates back and get a new set, or to get a 50% refund.</li>
            <li> The images come out nice and clear; even when I used the Sally Hansen Insta Dry polish.</li>
            <li> These plates come with a blue protective film that was very easy to remove, they have backing so that the edges are not sharp.  </li>
            <li> my next order may be those giant plates &gt;: )!&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve contacted Cheeky to see if I can avoid having to send the entire set back to my friend (more postage being required, boo!)</li>
            <li> I was expecting much longer</li>
            <li> i highly reccomend these!</li>
            <li> it really does make a difference from the plastic/creditcard scraper.</li>
            <li> They all stamp really well for me using reguler polish and a plastic scraper.  </li>
            <li> They transfer very well to the nail.</li>
            <li> If you buy 26 plates from Cheeky at a discounted rate, instead of the real deal like Konad, you are not saving money because they don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li> very diverse assortment.  </li>
            <li> and I got a very prompt reply.</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> The cracked glass doesn&#x27;t transfer at all and the Cheetah print is very blurry when transferred.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the designs are very</li>
            <li> but since they perform as expected, I&#x27;m okay with the faults.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy, just took off a star for the bends, they don&#x27;t stack evenly and a few rock back and forth.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t try out the one that came with the set because I never have much luck with them.  </li>
            <li> Very suprised by the designs.</li>
            <li> Anything would be appreciated....</li>
            <li> Then I bought the MASH 2012 plates and they have seemed to work really well.  </li>
            <li> thanks for any tips and comments....</li>
            <li> They are so fast and beats trying to draw these designs.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas because she is really into the nail art thing.  </li>
            <li> So Im going to keep them because I really like this set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was one design that was different than pictured on CH4, and although I actually like the one I got better, I think it&#x27;s still worth noting anytime there are discrepancies between the product pictured and the one received.</li>
            <li> I really like them they work well and</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I tried the trick of gently sanding the surface of the stamper and it helped marginally, but still wouldn&#x27;t pick up the whole design from a Konad plate.</li>
            <li> very easily&lt;br</li>
            <li> designs do not transfer to the nail very good&lt;</li>
            <li> thanks 4 everything</li>
            <li> if i put my fingers over the design and whole plate, i wont feel a difference.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I tried everything I read, watched a whole bunch of youtube videos and NOTHING worked.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get them straight</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> They came fast and work really well.</li>
            <li> I really like the cheeky brand.</li>
            <li> much polish was used.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> scrape lightly and stamp moderately.</li>
            <li> I really do think someone out there can get these plates to work, but it isn&#x27;t me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start stamping or someone like myself who&#x27;s become an enthusiast.</li>
            <li> Make sure to check all your plates carefully when you get these.</li>
            <li> These turned out a lot better than I expected.....</li>
            <li> Work really well.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well most of the time (I&#x27;m not experienced enough yet).</li>
            <li> I own several different brands.</li>
            <li> first set from Cheeky was the summer set, which also has the statement in the ad here on Amazon about having big full nail designs, and it does.</li>
            <li> the full nail designs pretty much only cover my pinkie.</li>
            <li> I am an avid stamper, and was looking for some new images.</li>
            <li> with a little practice it has become super easy.</li>
            <li> The tip designs don&#x27;t fit on my thumbs, but I must have larger thumb nails than most average women.  </li>
            <li> These designs are a lot better than the other Cheeky plates I ordered which were the octagon shaped plates.  </li>
            <li> I use these plates quite often; even more so than my other Cheeky plates.</li>
            <li> as they come shipped stacked on top of each other.</li>
            <li> The stamps are wide enough to cover my entire nail bed and transfer beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other plates for more but these are better not than the Konad but than other brands.</li>
            <li> The small designs are ok and the ones for french are really cute</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to have the other set of plates :)</li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s pretty worth it.</li>
            <li> You will have to experiment with different nail polishes in order to get a clean design lifted off the plates.</li>
            <li> The images are fun, crisp, and diverse and open up a world of opportunities for nail stamping.  </li>
            <li> I tested only a few designs on 4 different plates and they were perfect so far.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that over some time companies figured out that nails are wide and bigger is better than smaller for a nail design.</li>
            <li> All the images are crisp and clear.</li>
            <li> the image came out crisp &amp; clear), how well you scrape and your speed of picking up the image &amp; stamping it on your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clear crisp stamping.</li>
            <li> The full nail designs were just a tad smaller</li>
            <li> If I had any complaints it would be that despite having the paper backing the sides felt a little sharp but that&#x27;s not enough to take away from a review of AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used the special polish with it, didnt try any of the &#x27;normal&#x27; polishes with it</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping and I am really trying to get the hang of these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it about a week, I love the different designs.</li>
            <li> there are so many different designs you will definitely find one that fits your mood and or your ensemble.  </li>
            <li> Big enough for my nails and lots of options to be creative.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and all 26 plates are different.  </li>
            <li> did have a big lead time for shipping, so if you&#x27;re wanting something quick you&#x27;ll have to pay for quicker shipping.</li>
            <li> so the images were more than big enough for my hands.</li>
            <li> I bought a kit in Vegas while on vacation of a different brand, but after reading several reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and love these.</li>
            <li> I decided that I could deal with the image mess-ups, as they weren&#x27;t really an issue, but I was kinda bummed that they weren&#x27;t able to get me my missing plate</li>
            <li> They are the same size, same depth of the design for the polish to stamp well, and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with both purchases.</li>
            <li> The Insta-Dri works so well because it dries quicker than regular polish allowing a tacky consistency to develop quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally buying more cheeky products in the future!</li>
            <li> These plates are for people that have super short shaped nails 😳.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it and even purchase more disks - just not full nail designs.</li>
            <li> In my opinion they are great for the price and also that the designs are big enough to cover an average size nail.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> every image I have tried stamped well- have to use a high pigmented polish.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I really expected larger plates, but to be honest I never really did nay detailed research.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend to all the nail lover out there to consider purchase cheeky plates.</li>
            <li> On one design I stamped it onto a piece of blank paper, just to see if I could get a full image, and out of about 20 stamps I finally got one that was clear and transferred the full image.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> so I was looking to add to my collection without spending the high price on Konad.</li>
            <li> These plates were far better than other stamping plates that I have used.</li>
            <li> All the designs I&#x27;ve tried so far came really sharp and neat in my nails, the stars patterns are definitly my favorites :)</li>
            <li> 25 different polish brands and hundreds of stamping attempts later without a single good stamp, I am giving up on these plates.</li>
            <li> I just have to work a little cleaner :-)</li>
            <li> MOST of the image etchings of the designs, are not deep enough to hold the polish, to pick up a clear image!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it comes in a cute little box</li>
            <li> love the little box they came in.</li>
            <li> Most probably like you, I was a little weary because you cannot try them out if you want to return them.</li>
            <li> To the best of my knowledge, they haven&#x27;t come across a bad plate yet in either set.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old loves looking through and deciding which she wants on each nail.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the plates with my everyday inexpensive nail polish and they all seem to work very well and the pictures come out great.</li>
            <li> spent about 3 hours just stamping on my nail (with no base polish) working on getting the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Some images don&#x27;t fit across my wide nails.</li>
            <li> The few times I was able to pick up an image, when they were stamped on my nails they were patchy.</li>
            <li> It did take it away to actually receive them but worth the wait</li>
            <li> Not a complaint at all.  </li>
            <li> The designs are different and fun to play with.  </li>
            <li> normal polish works well with them</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with any of the images transferring and so far have gotten crisp clear images.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with any of the images transferring and so far have gotten crisp clear images.</li>
            <li> individual nail designs are tiny also and many either don&#x27;t have much detail, or have so much detail crammed into a tiny space that no one will know what the design is supposed to be once on the nail.</li>
            <li> I love these plates, but the designs DO NOT FIT MY NAILS.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s nice and thick.)  </li>
            <li> The box has a very large assortment of tips, full nail patterns and little designs.</li>
            <li> First of all i was waiting for my plates over a month, which even for China is kinda long time, when i finally got it I was so excited, until i opened the package)</li>
            <li> I would say Cheeky&#x27;s images are right up there with Red Angel!  </li>
            <li> So i either have to risk this mistake again and wait and hope i get all the right ones... or just live without 6-10 and give the extra 5 to my sister in law...</li>
            <li> With the various stamping plates I own, I recommend a cheaper polish like Sinful Colors, as they have a huge array of colors, and are thick enough that the stamper picks up the thicker color.</li>
            <li> They all lots kind of unique design that hardly find in other brands of stamping plates</li>
            <li> there are a few designs that are very thin and only look good in black and white because of design thinness, but most look great.</li>
            <li> I also tested various images fine lines, big spaces,</li>
            <li> there are a lot of really pretty ones from full nail designs to little ones and tip ones.</li>
            <li> but since she is new to stamping</li>
            <li> Cheeky Plates is a new one here on amazon.</li>
            <li> , i contacted cheeky and they told me to contact amazon for a return so they would send a new set</li>
            <li> and I told them about the issue and the took care of it and sent me out a new plate.  </li>
            <li> I live in France</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for...a cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li> The designs were cute and when they arrived, I found they were wide enough to accommodate my nails, which I sometimes have a problem with.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Konad stamping set well before it was popular a few years back, you know, before they were $4 a plate.  </li>
            <li> ones that do work are very clear and stamp</li>
            <li> The designs are bigger and fit on my whole nail with other brands I had to try and get the empty spots filled which is a hastle.</li>
            <li> Nail art is all new to me since I just became interested about 3 weeks ago and have been trying different things.  </li>
            <li> Some of the designs are very little kiddish, but the ones that I do like, I love.</li>
            <li> i had the same prints as the first box</li>
            <li> there are some Konad dupes designs that print out exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I did my first manicure with the nail stamp plates last night</li>
            <li> At first I though the disc&#x27;s were scratched but discovered it was only the protective coating that appeared scratched.</li>
            <li> Just pick two distinctive colors - a light and dark to make it pop.</li>
            <li> great produict, pretty fast delivery, just disappointed that the nail art plates were not in their Cheeky box.  </li>
            <li> I was soo excited to receive this item after I have read the other customer reviews but to my disapoitment the package was incomplete</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pity that the bundle didn&#x27;t contain scraper and printer, as I expected, but everything else was very cool!</li>
            <li> * use a quick dry clear coat before stamping to try to save time.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about these plates was that they had very cute designs I only wish they worked :(.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again, hopefully with bigger full images.  </li>
            <li> I am a teen (and kind of small for my age) and</li>
            <li> Although the images are a little small, I am able to get the designs to fit on all of my fingers, besides my thumbs.</li>
            <li> it is likely the nail polish, remember it must be dark enough with one coat because unless you are talented enough to stamp the image twice and exact then you only get the one coat.</li>
            <li> very light where I could hardly see it.</li>
            <li> The only positive is that the items arrived quickly.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The full-nail image does not fit over my nails nicely - the plates are not wide enough.</li>
            <li> Each design covers my full nail plate without leaving any gaps like with other sets.</li>
            <li> Clean up is no fun because I end up with nail polish all over me.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is that the images could be larger for those who have wide or long nails....and please consider making them more readily available for international shipping!  </li>
            <li> I have few other sets and this one is of a higher quality and designs are really cute.</li>
            <li> The product comes in an adorable little box &amp; every plate is protected by a blue sticker.</li>
            <li> Im also in love with the little box they came in, it has room for about 10 extra plates, and magnetically closes.</li>
            <li> But other than that, everything was as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like the variety of images which include full nail which are wide enough for my nails (a major plus),</li>
            <li> Images come out clear.</li>
            <li> These plates did come with a clear blue cover so the plates do not scratch which is appreciated</li>
            <li> They stamp really well using the Konad double ended stamper</li>
            <li> After reading the mixed reviews, I was very nervous about ordering these plates</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with any of the images I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> The etching on these plates is a tiny bit shallower than Konad, but not so much so that it affects image transfer or visibility.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with getting the image to look like a stencil.</li>
            <li> , I used an old card and my Konad stamper as I do with all my plates.  </li>
            <li> My TWO year old niece asks me to &amp;#34;paint stamp&amp;#34; her nails, and loves it.</li>
            <li> I would advise, instead of using those metal scrapers, to use an old credit card or gift card.</li>
            <li> but it was nowhere near the designs.</li>
            <li> All the plates have a blue cling film that can be peeled off without too much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I assumed that they might be doing something in the background, so I completely forgot about it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it will probably cover my nails just if i completely cut them.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> I also recommend using an old plastic card of some sort to scrape the excess polish off with.</li>
            <li> I use old credit type card as scraper so surfaces don&#x27;t get scratched.</li>
            <li> This ad contains a completely untrue statement:</li>
            <li> so they can get a refund because I&#x27;d rather handle it myself directly.</li>
            <li> Tried 2of the stamps so far and couldn&#x27;t get anyting to transfer.  </li>
            <li> I use an old gift card as a scraper, since the one from my stamper/scraper kit has a metal edge and scratched the plate.</li>
            <li> , the stamps seem to work well, I did get duplicates of 5 of the disks, so I only REALLY got 21 of the 26 plates that I paid for.  </li>
            <li> , they are constantly doing their nails now, there is so much excitement with each nail session.</li>
            <li> However, they are not as exciting as I expected them to be (in terms of quality).</li>
            <li> They also included a multi-colored round rhinestones wheel, and a multi-shape rhinestone wheel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the plates, and I think they were worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am having a good time learning the ins and outs of stamping on nails.  </li>
            <li> my daughter and I were so excited to get these - short shipping time - a bunch of super cute designs - so hard to figure out which ones to do first - 4 plates with seven small designs - 16 plates with four large and two small designs - 6 plates with six nail tip designs -</li>
            <li> Some designs are more difficult but with the right polish and some practice, it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> It takes a little patience to master using the plates, but if you are patient it really is worth the effort!</li>
            <li> You might want to have your own little container or box for them, as they are in a small flimsy cardbord box, much like a deck of cards.</li>
            <li> The full nail images are on the small side, just slightly bigger than the ones on the first Bundle Monster set.  </li>
            <li> The set has 160 images to be exact not the over 180 stated, there are 64 full images, 60 small images and 36 french tips.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this set for its quality and price (compared to individual Konad plates) and will be looking at other Cheeky products!</li>
            <li> Some plates don&#x27;t work well :( , but there are more that work ok.</li>
            <li> I like that the stamper is a light pink, so that I can see red and pink polish on it nicely, unlike Konad dark pink stampers.</li>
            <li> The designs on them are very cute but unfortunately with how scratched up</li>
            <li> I was online and was just checking to see if there were any new fauxnad plates out, i have both bundle monster sets, shany, and the red angel plates.  </li>
            <li> I have several nail stamping plate sets, including the new Cheeky 2013 summer set, and the Cheely Jumbo XL plates.</li>
            <li> Its only a few bucks and will make a huge difference in your stamping.  </li>
            <li> the only problem with those was they didnt have much of the French Tip designs</li>
            <li> I ran a coarse file across it a few times first, not sure if that made a difference, but it seems to pick up the images well and is squishy enough to press the image on my nail nicely.</li>
            <li> I tried using several different plates and designs, and the designs didnt transfer to the stamper very well, or at all.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to send back the entire package...</li>
            <li> I am slowly getting better at stamping the images on my big toe.</li>
            <li> and they had some major defects.</li>
            <li> Konad stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After examining all of the plates, there were a few that were scratched but only one image was affected and actually, I think the scratches gave it a bit more interest - it was a french tip design that I may or may not use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different stampers (Konad, white thick sticky type) that I own.  </li>
            <li> But other than the missing plate, I am fully satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Other than a few trial and error stamps I really love these plates.</li>
            <li> Lots of fun, but will take a little practice to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I was concerned for a few plates because they had what looked like deep scratches on the blue covering, but when I peeled off the covering they were fine.</li>
            <li> Set each child up with stamper, scaper, paper towels, some acrylice paints, something to stamp to I use some colored paper, give each child 1 dry coton wipe and 1 wet to clean plate after each design was stamped, paint brushes or q-tips for appling paint, quirted some paint out some smaller pieces of paper.</li>
            <li> have had a bit of difficulty with some of the smaller flower graphics stamping clearly...</li>
            <li> , ive only tried maybe 5 plates so far</li>
            <li> I was surprised because the in last set if stamping plates I received from Cheeky, all the designs worked with no problems at all!</li>
            <li> They are etched deep enough and work very well, a couple were scratched when I pulled the blue cover off</li>
            <li> As far as I can see, the designs are the same as shown.</li>
            <li> As I said the only trouble I had with them is the size of the full nail images</li>
            <li> Creamy thicker polishes are better than thin ones or shimmery</li>
            <li> Or if you&#x27;re only stamping one nail and it&#x27;s the main design, not cool that the whole design doesn&#x27;t pick up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, some people have very small nails beds, but some have larger beds than mine, but I imagine most people could forget about using these on a big toe.</li>
            <li> This is not to say some images are not flawed (because some definitely are) but on these it may work if you try them in other ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The designs are pretty clear, but not deep compare to Messy, Konad and Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li> They transfer really well and the combinations are endless.</li>
            <li> and i was pleased when they arrived, after further inspection i noticed that 1 of the little bags that came was the same as one other and</li>
            <li> but i had already used some of them and the time that will take to send them back and then wait for the other set to get here was just too much for me to make all of that trouble worth.</li>
            <li> There are only one or two designs that don&#x27;t quite transfer because the design was etched too shallow, but when each plate has 4 to 6 designs, that&#x27;s not bad!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of these yet, so I can&#x27;t vouch for each and every single image, but the ones I have used transferred beautifully (including tiny intricate details), and none of the rest appear to have the shallow etching problem of which some people complained.</li>
            <li> One stamp was off center, ruining one of my stamping options because it falls off the plate, and the other had a deep scratch through the design, a cute cupcake, which ruins its potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased these plates, and a few Konad plates when I first started stamping, now when you look at them from a distance you wouldn&#x27;t notice any difference in the plates</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times since I first got it.</li>
            <li> These are just as good as any other expensive name brand nail art.</li>
            <li> and when u stamp to get the image, dont roll, just straight up and down.</li>
            <li> The plates are very thin and tend to bend very easily.</li>
            <li> It seems to be hit and miss as far as the plates go, large or small, as I am having issues with some of the 2013 plates.</li>
            <li> They are long and wide enough (unlike other brands) to cover the full size of your nail.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG.</li>
            <li> very happy with all images that ill use!!!</li>
            <li> My niece loved it so much I decided to buy one for her, but was very disappointed that it came in a small cheap cardboard box just big enough for the plates, with no scraper.  </li>
            <li> I really like the little stamper.  </li>
            <li> images come out clear and ill certainly be stamping with them again tomorrow!!!</li>
            <li> I really do need to practice using these since my placement of the little bow design I chose left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get used to using these if you have never used them before, but they are fun to play with.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised about the shipping, it was extremely</li>
            <li> I really like nail and bought this mainly for the full nail stamps, but unfortunately they do not fit my entire nail, and I do not have long nails.</li>
            <li> There is a high demand for these plates, and I think they are being a little too rushed in production...</li>
            <li> Which i dont mind because my nails wont grow past a certain length anyways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the Bundle Monster sets and some Konad but was getting pretty bored with the same old patterns (ever so slightly different yet not different enough) on all the plates.</li>
            <li> If I try it the other way, they&#x27;re not long enough unless I cut my nails shorty short.</li>
            <li> The designs are simply not deep enough to get a good imprint, making them worthless.</li>
            <li> The image shows up well even using a cheap creme rather than an expensive or specialty polish, which was a relief because I didn&#x27;t want to have to spend a lot of money on a polish I&#x27;d only use for stamping.</li>
            <li> was that the image plates are actually tinyer than expected BUT the images are big to cover every nail.</li>
            <li> Maybe it might be only good for gel polish, because I don&#x27;t wipe of the base coat, just the stamp and redo</li>
            <li> I have fiddled with several plates and haven&#x27;t picked up a single one!</li>
            <li> By the time I figured this out, it was really too late.</li>
            <li> The pattern does not completely come off the stamper as I had seen in some video&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Just seemed strange....</li>
            <li> The french tip designs look like they will be too wide for my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Took way too long to get here.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly, as long as you know what you are doing.</li>
            <li> Since using a scraper scratches the plate in the end, it&#x27;s not very bothersome to me).The only suprise that I faced with</li>
            <li> their delivery time is kinda long.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that 2 of the plates had one long scratch on it and on one plate the scratch goes through the design.</li>
            <li> but i think the brand was to thin because it wouldn&#x27;t work right</li>
            <li> If I mess up I thoroughly wet a Q-tip with acetone and softly dab off the stamping nail polish.</li>
            <li> Small or large etching, I&#x27;ve only gotten a few to work...  </li>
            <li> There is a few designs that are not deep enough, but nothing to major than cannot be fix if you just get to remove the nail polish with less force.</li>
            <li> yes ladies these have backings,no sharp edges.#5 works even with regular polishes</li>
            <li> As usual the full image are too small for my thumbs, my CH 1-4 are just under 1/2 inch and the others are 1/2 inch wide.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to second the experience of the other two reviewers.  </li>
            <li> came home the other night to find a tiny package, which upon opening</li>
            <li> If  only the  plates were  a little bigger!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t anticipate was the very long delivery time.  </li>
            <li> or it&#x27;ll get too dry.</li>
            <li> (missing sections) when you stamped (because they weren&#x27;t deep enough)</li>
            <li> I have wider nsil beds and have had trouble in the past with full nail images not fitting my nails from the Konad, Gals, and Red Angel brands.</li>
            <li> every single plate thank you.</li>
            <li> When the box came I was surprised by how small it was</li>
            <li> My only complaint about these plates are that some of the designs aren&#x27;t deep enough to work for stamping.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t be surprised when some numbers between the plates are missing!</li>
            <li> Disappointed because I really liked these designs.</li>
            <li> I am new to the nail art stamping plates, but I had a few I had previously purchased and wanted to increase my plates and options.</li>
            <li> Sort of a let down compare to the sheet template of larger 2013 nail stamps.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is</li>
            <li> The only one I had a slight problem with was the butterflies on plate ch3</li>
            <li> Seems the small plates aren&#x27;t etched deep enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used stamping polish and regular polish with this set, and their is something for everyone in terms of subject matter in this set.  </li>
            <li> Plate 5 was missing, there was a double of plate 4, and two of the 20-somethings had minor issues with flubbed production.</li>
            <li> I started off with the Konads but the price on these are so much less and the quality the same.  </li>
            <li> Buying and shipping worked very well, but some of the images in the plates are impossible to use (you can&#x27;t even see the whole images at some plates).</li>
            <li> There is only one flaw on my plate CH 17, the little purse is incomplete.</li>
            <li> I was a little worry to purchase this item for the different variety of opinions.</li>
            <li> harder I pressed the stamper onto the plates</li>
            <li> Only a few don&#x27;t seem to work at all.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have removed the plastic off one plate which is plate #14 and have tried to transfer 2 designs off that plate with not much luck.</li>
            <li> I had to send back because I was missing one</li>
            <li> So I reorderd them and a few of them are scratched kinda deep</li>
            <li> They arrived sooner than expected, I&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no problem at all with any of the plates transferring designs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually planning to keep a few plates for myself and give the rest of them to my mother in law.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself a few months back</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous getting started because I have wide nails</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re careful, then you shouldn&#x27;t worry about.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about buying this product because my previous experience with nail stamping was NOT good.</li>
            <li> My primary desire for purchasing these plates were the bigger designs that should cover all nail, so when i saw the size of plates i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> but the stamps are little for long nails..</li>
            <li> I was extremely worried about ordering a non konad plate set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if it wasn&#x27;t cut all the way but other than that</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned in the other review, I am still testing the use of these.  </li>
            <li> I tried using the stamper with other plates and it wouldn&#x27;t pick the design up.</li>
            <li> images are deeper than other brands....</li>
            <li> Somehow this product did not take 8 weeks to deliver like the other cheeky products I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> These were the first plates I&#x27;ve bought, and i was skeptical about them working.</li>
            <li> Went to walmart got small set for ten buck for kit.</li>
            <li> possiblities are endless not just for nails.</li>
            <li> The individual plates comes in a neat, small box and comes with a card that can be used as a scraper.</li>
            <li> The edges are in fact a bit sharp (the discs are thinner than other brands).</li>
            <li> Plates are really small and the designs would cover your nails just if you have very short ones.</li>
            <li> On the other plate the scratch was not close to the design so it made no affect on transfer ability.  </li>
            <li> i had read the other reviews and did my research</li>
            <li> Edges are a bit sharp</li>
            <li> really disappointed in this because I really love the designs on this plate.</li>
            <li> Got this set and one other for my wife and daughter since they are nail FREAKS.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Sharp</li>
            <li> I only have a small set of Konad plates</li>
            <li> I had some trouble with a few but over all using different types of polish and arylic paint.  </li>
            <li> The edges are a little sharp, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Other than my bad placement, the images I did use transferred pretty well - I used the double ended</li>
            <li> i got a repeat so now i have 2 of the same plates, some plates are hard to stamp but that might be cus</li>
            <li> if you stamp too hard you might drive ink out of design well, same with scraping.</li>
            <li> thing, be careful, the sides of the plates looks a little sharp!</li>
            <li> Not just the average flowers</li>
            <li> Instead I received a small box of round discs with smaller images on them.  </li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;ll know the plates definitely work.all the time 110%</li>
            <li> I was shocked that I didn&#x27;t have to do any redos especially since it was my first time stamping.</li>
            <li> With an identical statement, I was expecting at least similar sizes, but that is not what I got.</li>
            <li> me, no biggie, but for some of my more picky friends, they hate it.  </li>
            <li> Cant wait to buy their other plates!</li>
            <li> When I received the plates the designs seemed to be a little deeper than the other plates I have.</li>
            <li> but it didnt turn out really dark black</li>
            <li> so i used some black polish i already had and it worked</li>
            <li> I used the kleancolor black.</li>
            <li> I received my package on Monday morning after ordering the previous Saturday afternoon.</li>
            <li> , I do not get half of designs</li>
            <li> The engravings aren&#x27;t deep enough making it difficult to use and inconsistent results from nail to nail.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> They look like they have been previously used and abused.</li>
            <li> I had been dying to get my hands on Konads for a year and a half</li>
            <li> The kit shipped out of China within 2-3 days of my order, it took about two and a half weeks to make it to San Francisco, and about six weeks to make it from SF to my house.  </li>
            <li> The single designs are a little small</li>
            <li> If you consider I spent around 5$ ,6$ even 8$ to buy Konad Plates in the past.</li>
            <li> Only minor issue is one plate has half of the design slightly flawed.</li>
            <li> Some of the designs are a little thinner than I&#x27;d like but they work.</li>
            <li> As for quality, I&#x27;ve used a Konad plate and have found no significant difference in image quality or ease of use between the two.</li>
            <li> It took me a little bit to get the hang of using them, but after 30 min.</li>
            <li> Also came in the cutest little storage box that opens like a book.</li>
            <li> I had heard to use a plastic scraper instead of a metal one (the metal ones scratch the plates), so I use the little plastic card included in this set as my scraper.</li>
            <li> I was a little doubtful because I thought the patterns wouldn&#x27;t fit my nails</li>
            <li> I have bought a few of their XL plates and a JUMBO plate</li>
            <li> Some lines are even missing on the stamped picture.</li>
            <li> were missing</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m having sooo much trouble getting these to stamp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having trouble with a couple plates, could be user error</li>
            <li> Since last year I have been addicted to nail stamping.</li>
            <li> but now it doesn&#x27;t, making the images look uneven</li>
            <li> Then a few months ago, I discovered these</li>
            <li> but i noticed that i got 2 sets of plates 11-15 and am missing plates 6-10.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brand-new to nail stamping, so unfortunately my review will be limited, as I&#x27;m not very knowledgeable on the subject.</li>
            <li> and these plates aren&#x27;t hard to use, you just have to use thick polish, otherwise your design will dry on the stamper before you can transfer it to your nails.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if this was a waste of money or not.  </li>
            <li> Some of the stamps were too small and the nail polish dried in it before I could stamp it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I got the two plates in the mail plus two sets of those little gemstones you can put on your nails!</li>
            <li> Read all the bad reviews and was really nervous about getting these plates.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed with these plates though, they are not deep enough and the nail polish comes out of the design when it is scraped off.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the plate, stamper or polish.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for the past 1 year</li>
            <li> ( I stamped every image), even the small word on CH 17 and CH 27.</li>
            <li> I suggest getting a holder for these small plates and a protective case.  </li>
            <li> Small plates for nail stamping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do the small pictures.</li>
            <li> I do have small nails</li>
            <li> So over all I was not able to salvage anything from this purchase.</li>
            <li> the nail &amp;#34;squares&amp;#34; are just too small.</li>
            <li> but I can look past that</li>
            <li> I broke out these plates and tried random patterns on all my nails, using konad stamping polish in white, and a metal scraper/stamper from salon express.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the stamper or the stamp.  </li>
            <li> I just walked past a kiosk in the mall selling these for $15 a disc.</li>
            <li> The square nail sized designs are 60% to small for my nails</li>
            <li> all of them are too small.</li>
            <li> Truth I had a very bad experience with these plates on me came out more expensive than the other to buy another brand</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very sad about about the full nail images :&#x27;(  because they are so pretty but don&#x27;t cover my thumbnails.  </li>
            <li> small designs are hard to stamp off the plate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rather than think stamping is too hard, I came to Amazon and started reading reviews of plates and watching youtube videos with nail stamping plate reviews.  </li>
            <li> I hardly find time to get my nails done though</li>
            <li> With a hard stamper.</li>
            <li> It feels like a REALLY dull knife.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with any stamping plates before but</li>
            <li> and I was afraid the designs would not cover my entire nail.</li>
            <li> need thick polishes and Konad scrapper/stamp if you buy these plates.</li>
            <li> The consistency needs to be thick.</li>
            <li> I did a base coat of white and used a dark gray for stamping, chose 5 of the full-cover circular theme designs and stamped away.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when I received my plates; so far, I&#x27;ve used 10 or so images and haven&#x27;t had any problems with any designs I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The accents themselves are very small.</li>
            <li> Very small designs..</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with the ones I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Wish they were a tad less expensive.  </li>
            <li> not too shallow-</li>
            <li> And although the images are a bit shallow, seem to still work well</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t advise serious nail junkies to buy</li>
            <li> They are too shallow.</li>
            <li> I am not very good, yet, at stamping my nails, but I am working on it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that I was sent a duplicate set of plates, so I&#x27;m missing 5 of the plates shown in the image preview.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d get 5 stars, except some of the designs are a bit cheesy and some a tad redundant.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering nail stamping plates, am I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The transfered picture looks fare and will need a hard work to make it work!</li>
            <li> but it is currently unavailable. :(</li>
            <li> This is a shame because two of the ones I had to have are not working properly. :(</li>
            <li> The stamper and scraper that comes with the set are pretty awful.</li>
            <li> just disappointed that they are so short</li>
            <li> When they arrived, I grabbed my thick polish (ones that go opaque with one coat) and a sheet of paper - all the images stamp!  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to master.</li>
            <li> frustrating when you have a client and are on a schedule when you get one that doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I tend to focus on the negative ones to figure out all that is wrong with a product.</li>
            <li> Totally addicted to stamping.</li>
            <li> thing to worry about with the cheeky plates is they are extremely thin on the edges of the plate.</li>
            <li> Leading up to my purchase of this set of Cheeky plates, I had previously bought some other inexpensive no-name stamping plates and no-name stamper and was/am very frustrated with these no-name items!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It was virtually impossible for the stamper to pick up any polish because the etchings were so shallow that when I used the scraper to scrape the excess, it pull out of the etchings too.</li>
            <li> Maybe Im doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Red Angel plates after these, and they are terrible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not perfect at it</li>
            <li> I thought getting into nail art would be expensive.</li>
            <li> but gel is expensive too.</li>
            <li> ill stick to Konad</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong purchasing these for anyone that does nails.</li>
            <li> The Konad plates are expensive for a reason.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this set does not include the plastic Cheeky &#x27;membership card&#x27;, which acts as a scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> I can use the rest of the designs are impossible to lift, no problem or enamels or seals, a problem of poor leveling depth of the plates.</li>
            <li> When i received them i opened them up and every single one of the image plates were scratched terribly.</li>
            <li> Also gave myself a nasty cut on one of the sharp edges so not great quality!</li>
            <li> the crazy 80&#x27;s print.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tested this plate out to see if the line would show up once transferred to the nail and very faintly it did.  </li>
            <li> I dont think it will affect the design that bad</li>
            <li> Bad quality plates.</li>
            <li> BAD QUALITY...</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have the guts to buy it after reading some of the bad reviews because I was scared I&#x27;d be one of the unlucky ones.</li>
            <li> I bought these after seeing them on a blog (canadiannailfanatic at blogspot), and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Konad plate to see if I was being a moron</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

            <li> Just received my cheeky plates! Everything looked perfect. I was concerned for a few plates because they had what looked like deep scratches on the blue covering, but when I peeled off the covering they were fine. I tested only a few designs on 4 different plates and they were perfect so far. The full nail designs were just a tad smaller then what I was expecting but it still gets the job done. It took exactly 2 weeks to receive the plates...I was expecting much longer so I was happy. I would definitely recommend them..I will buy from them again. P.S. This is the first time EVER buying from them..very impressed.</li>
            <li> loved the price and loved the simple elegant designs they were not sloppy and leave clean designs, 3 more words</li>
            <li> It was packed very well and all looks good. The only thing is that now i have to figure out what kind of polish i need to use with the plates. The transfered picture looks fare and will need a hard work to make it work! But like LuvLuv said in her comment i have to try different polishes</li>
            <li> Très bon produit, reçu rapidement et très facile d&#x27;utilisation. Les motifs correspondent à ceux de la photo. Attention, ne convient pas aux ongles très longs car les modèles de ce pack sont principalement des motifs pour l&#x27;ongle entier, et ils ne sont pas très grands.</li>
            <li> it is the best product ever..... they came in early and they are exactly what I ordered they stamp on easily and perfectly I love this product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get these to work. I&#x27;ve tried several different polish brands and different stampers. None have worked.</li>
            <li> Patterns come off easily with general nail polish. The box has a very large assortment of tips, full nail patterns and little designs.</li>
            <li> Although the images are a little small, I am able to get the designs to fit on all of my fingers, besides my thumbs. The designs are etched well and are very fun to use.</li>
            <li> The 2012 Cheeky Set of 26 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit With Total of 160 Nail Art Designs is excellent in many ways.  Not only was a great price on Amazon.com, it&#x27;s a great product that does a great job.  I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase.  K. Ludewig of Cave Creek, AZ.</li>
            <li> These plates for nail stamping are great. Loads to choose from and came well packaged. Can&#x27;t wait to have a go and hopefully&lt;br /&gt;create some fun designs.</li>
            <li> My number one go to plates seem to always be cheeky. This is not a bad thing unless you are the half dozen other brands of plates I own :-)</li>
            <li> i got these plates today , and it had two boxes inside the package , and when i opened the second box i realized i had the same prints as the first box 😑😕😞 anyone else with this problem?</li>
            <li> I have heard many great things about CHEEKY plates from all around the internet. I have bought a few of their XL plates and a JUMBO plate and they have all been good, but the only problem with those was they didnt have much of the French Tip designs so i bought this batch, and i love it so far, ive only tried maybe 5 plates so far and they all stamp well. I have only used the special polish with it, didnt try any of the &#x27;normal&#x27; polishes with it so i dont know how well it is with that, but so far everything comes out pretty crisp and nice. there are some Konad dupes designs that print out exactly the same. i highly reccomend these! For some of you who have problem stamping, i would suggest using the actualy metal scraper it really does make a difference from the plastic/creditcard scraper. and when u stamp to get the image, dont roll, just straight up and down. This is a great for those of you want a lot of different designs but cannot afford the konad ones!</li>
            <li> I love love love these plates! They have great designs.  Lots of full nail images to choose from and they are all super cute! They all stamp really well for me using reguler polish and a plastic scraper.  I havent tried it with a metal scraper but i&#x27;m sure that would work too. The images come out crisp, clean, and fully detailed. The only one I had a slight problem with was the butterflies on plate ch3 but if I use the special stamping polish it works just fine.  Very happy with my purchase :D</li>
            <li> These plates are great. The images are super cute. They transfer very well to the nail. I am an avid stamper, and was looking for some new images. This set hit the mark. Not just the average flowers you great with other sets. This has a great varitey of images. I&#x27;m very happy with my new Cheeky set, and plan to buy more Cheeky items soon!! Happy stamping!!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they had fairly good reviews and had a much better price. Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t work. I tried several different plates, with several different techniques that YouTube taught me and they were all for naught. It was virtually impossible for the stamper to pick up any polish because the etchings were so shallow that when I used the scraper to scrape the excess, it pull out of the etchings too. The few times I was able to pick up an image, when they were stamped on my nails they were patchy. I bought a Konad plate to see if I was being a moron or there was something else at hand. The Konad ones were so easy! The only imperfect nail was from my mastiff nosing the stamp while I rolled it on my nail.&lt;br /&gt;My lesson learned was simple. You get what you pay for. If you buy 26 plates from Cheeky at a discounted rate, instead of the real deal like Konad, you are not saving money because they don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> These nail plates are great for the price. They are by no means perfect but I refuse to complain for the fact that I did not pay about $6 per plate like the Konad plates. I do own a Konad plate and am using that as my baseline comparison. Some of the designs are a little thinner than I&#x27;d like but they work. Some designs work better than others but overall I am quite happy with this purchase and have already recommended it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Use stamping nail polish. Regular nail polish can get sticky and not transfer well. If I mess up I thoroughly wet a Q-tip with acetone and softly dab off the stamping nail polish. Works fairly well most of the time (I&#x27;m not experienced enough yet).</li>
            <li> Nice selection of images, very good stamping quality, I am happy with this purchase, and will buy from Cheeky again:)</li>
            <li> These stamps work great and there are a lot of choices - although some are a bit redundant. Fun and easy to use.  Cleans up easy with nail polish remover.  Comes in a great little decorative storage box so all of your plates can live together without getting misplaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever done nail art stamping and I love it. It took me a lil bit to get the hang of it but it turned out cute. At first i was trying with a gel nail polish but i think the brand was to thin because it wouldn&#x27;t work right so i used some black polish i already had and it worked but it didnt turn out really dark black so im going to try different polishes. Other then that i love all the cute designs on the plates. It did take it away to actually receive them but worth the wait i think.</li>
            <li> The full-nail image does not fit over my nails nicely - the plates are not wide enough. If I try it the other way, they&#x27;re not long enough unless I cut my nails shorty short. However, I still very much like this item! I would recommend it and even purchase more disks - just not full nail designs.</li>
            <li> Awesome plates... i recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Will buy more templates from Cheeky.  This is the best value for your money.  Beautiful designs made easy.&lt;br /&gt;All Cheeky products I&#x27;ve purchased always exceed my expectation.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these. Even using my konad stamping polish I can&#x27;t seem to pick up a clean transfer. Save your money and invest in the konad plates. I can&#x27;t even use these. Such a shame.</li>
            <li> Some stamp better than others; its a great deal;I love them.</li>
            <li> Item as described and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I love these stamps! I am not very good, yet, at stamping my nails, but I am working on it! Great variety!</li>
            <li> I bought these plates so I can do my own nails and they worked perfectly.  Not a complaint at all.  Just took a while to be able to use the stamper correctly.</li>
            <li> I have plates from several different manufacturers and I must say that these are the best plates I&#x27;ve ever used including the Konad plates. I got this as a gift for my sister for her birthday but since she is new to stamping I did her nails for her. I was stunned by how clean and clear the images came out. I didn&#x27;t use special stamping polish, to do her nsils I used the kleancolor black. When I was done I also tested with a regular white polish. I also tested various images fine lines, big spaces, even the tip images were great. When the box came I was surprised by how small it was, I thought I got mini plates or something, they are the standard plate size but even more importantly the images fit my nails. I have wider nsil beds and have had trouble in the past with full nail images not fitting my nails from the Konad, Gals, and Red Angel brands. No such problems with the images I tested. Keeping in mind that I haven&#x27;t tested every single image I would say this is a great set. If I had any complaints it would be that despite having the paper backing the sides felt a little sharp but that&#x27;s not enough to take away from a review of AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> Came faster than I expected, all stamped perfectly. A+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it about a week, I love the different designs. After I use majority of the designs I&#x27;ll change the review. But so far I like the product :]</li>
            <li> the patterns are gorgeous! very diverse assortment.  there are so many different designs you will definitely find one that fits your mood and or your ensemble.  i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seems the small plates aren&#x27;t etched deep enough. Most don&#x27;t stamp no matter what I use.  It seems to be hit and miss as far as the plates go, large or small, as I am having issues with some of the 2013 plates.</li>
            <li> Images come out clear. Good engraving.</li>
            <li> First let me say that Cheeky customer service is awesome.  I emailed them when the plates were out of stock and I got a very prompt reply. When they became available, I received another email. I thought it was nice that they remembered and emailed me again. Now, for the good stuff...These plates are amazing! I am a first time stamper and I was concerned with the learning curve and image quality of a fauxnad plate but these plates blew me away.  The images are very crisp and clear.  The stamper and scraper that came with the set work fine for me also. I was stamping in no time. I would recommend this set to anyone into stamping, be it newbie or oldie; they are absolutely great!</li>
            <li> I was extremely worried about ordering a non konad plate set. But I am super pleased! I received my package on Monday morning after ordering the previous Saturday afternoon. After using the plates I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my purchase! Every design is shown as advertised and full nail designs cover all of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;My more expensive polishes worked best with the designs.&lt;br /&gt;Clean stamper, plate, and scraper ASAP after stamping nail with polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;The harder I pressed the stamper onto the plates the better the print would turn out on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t forget to remove the plastic covering from the plates. I was so excited to try this that I almost for got to remove it.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. All the images are crisp and clear. I like it so much I recently tried to order it for a friend but it is currently unavailable. :(</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t tried all the images, the ones I have tried are very  nice.  Glad I got these before they sold out.  I would say Cheeky&#x27;s images are right up there with Red Angel!  I even liked the stamper that came with it.  Was just going to throw the stamper away, as another reviewer said to, but decided to give it a try first.  I really like the little stamper.  I ran a coarse file across it a few times first, not sure if that made a difference, but it seems to pick up the images well and is squishy enough to press the image on my nail nicely. I like that the stamper is a light pink, so that I can see red and pink polish on it nicely, unlike Konad dark pink stampers. I do use the Konad metal scraper, though.  Someone on YouTube mentioned that the metal scrapers work better on plates that aren&#x27;t Konad.</li>
            <li> I could never get these to work. 2 friends of mine tried neither of them were able to get these to work either.</li>
            <li> Love all of the designs. I&#x27;m a beginner for nail stamping.... and these plates aren&#x27;t hard to use, you just have to use thick polish, otherwise your design will dry on the stamper before you can transfer it to your nails. The designs are great, but it the shipping took a while.</li>
            <li> Great my wife loved it</li>
            <li> I was super excited to see these plates.  I was online and was just checking to see if there were any new fauxnad plates out, i have both bundle monster sets, shany, and the red angel plates.  These looked super cute in the photo and was a good price.  I didn&#x27;t hesitate to get them!  Nothing rivals the quality of Konad, these work but need a practice hand.  The images are not engraved very deep like the Shany and Red Angel plates.  I haven&#x27;t tested them all yet but they seem to transfer ok, just need to employ a little more effort.</li>
            <li> I love the designs on these plates. Most of them work well.  Only a few don&#x27;t seem to work at all.  The cracked glass doesn&#x27;t transfer at all and the Cheetah print is very blurry when transferred.  But over all these work great and I loved the designs.  Wish they were a tad less expensive.  I give it a four star for the plates that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love these plates!  A lot of the designs are very unique~  A good addition to any nail plate collection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to order the huge rectangle plates, but decided to start with these first to see how I liked the designs and quality.  I&#x27;m impressed, so my next order may be those giant plates &gt;: )!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try out these designs.. there are so many cute ones!  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Great stamping kit. Works as intended. Only minor issue is one plate has half of the design slightly flawed. It&#x27;s as if it wasn&#x27;t cut all the way but other than that, these are great.</li>
            <li> they are good quality although small for nails  but i use them for my daughters and sometimes when my nails break</li>
            <li> Great tool to have at home for your very own nail salon.  Easy to use and the instructions are simple.  The plates are light and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> As an avid stamper, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new image designs and was thrilled when I seen these available on Amazon.  The price for 26 plates also made them a great deal, in my opinion. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when I received my plates; so far, I&#x27;ve used 10 or so images and haven&#x27;t had any problems with any designs I&#x27;ve used.  I really like that there are a lot of full nail image designs as thats what I&#x27;m into for stamping right now.  Its always a plus when the blue plastic covering comes off easily, which these do.  I didn&#x27;t use the stamper or scraper that came with it so can&#x27;t comment on the quality of them, but this is because I already have my favourite stamper and scraper that I use for stamping.  My only suggestion is that the images could be larger for those who have wide or long nails....and please consider making them more readily available for international shipping!  I look forward to more plates if you ever decide to create new designs...as I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new plates!</li>
            <li> Lots of bang for your buck! Came dinner than stated.</li>
            <li> Some of these Cheeky plates were bent, and some pop like a safety lid on a jar, but upon testing, they stamp perfectly. There is a high demand for these plates, and I think they are being a little too rushed in production...but since they perform as expected, I&#x27;m okay with the faults. I tested almost every image, and the detail was great, all the way down to seeds on a strawberry, or links in a necklace. Overall very happy, just took off a star for the bends, they don&#x27;t stack evenly and a few rock back and forth. But again, the designs are fun and cute, and stamp perfectly, so I&#x27;m happy. :)</li>
            <li> The product was just as it was stated in the ad. Love the items they all work well and will purchase again if they offer new plates</li>
            <li> Great plates. Great pictures, only gripe is some of the finer detailed stamps are not coming out clearly for me. Some lines are even missing on the stamped picture. Maybe Im doing something wrong. Have tried over and over!</li>
            <li> Excellent way to get a variety of templates to keep nail designs different and just unique.</li>
            <li> I bought this assortment as they had a nice selection of designs I haven&#x27;t seen elsewhere. I used the [[ASIN:B004GFR3GY Konad Staming Nail Art Stamp &amp; Scraper Set Ii]] with regular nail polish and had an easy time getting good results with most designs. However, some of the designs have fine lines and detail. I found those came out best if I used Konad stamping polish with them instead. Combine this set with the [[ASIN:B005VX8S4G Red Angel (tm) Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 21pc]] and you should have almost any design you could possibly ever need.</li>
            <li> I tried a variety of nail polishes and still most of the images don&#x27;t transfer over. It appears that the images may not be etched deep enough.</li>
            <li> Love love love love love love love love love love love love love this purchase. Love.</li>
            <li> i personally love this set!!! very happy with all images that ill use!!! and they came pristine!!! images come out clear and ill certainly be stamping with them again tomorrow!!! just love love them!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried using several different plates and designs, and the designs didnt transfer to the stamper very well, or at all. Its almost as if the imprints wern&#x27;t made deep enough into the plate. I only found one usable design, and it only worked for me one time. I did not try all the plates. I was surprised because the in last set if stamping plates I received from Cheeky, all the designs worked with no problems at all! What happened???</li>
            <li> Some plates don&#x27;t work well :( , but there are more that work ok.</li>
            <li> Overall I think these plates are great.  They are a glossy steel with a backing.  They stamp really well using the Konad double ended stamper, I didn&#x27;t try out the one that came with the set because I never have much luck with them.  The full nail images are on the small side, just slightly bigger than the ones on the first Bundle Monster set.  I do think this is a great buy and an awesome price.  The designs are different and fun to play with.  As I said the only trouble I had with them is the size of the full nail images and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it four stars and not five.</li>
            <li> not too shallow- every image I have tried stamped well- have to use a high pigmented polish.  I&#x27;m very happy w/this collection, lots of possibilities- be sure to use fast dry top coat!</li>
            <li> Item as described, love these plates!</li>
            <li> I have bought plates from many non Konad brands and i was usually quite satisfied, therefore, I decided to try these plates since I got a huge cheeky plate and it worked fine. I was highly disappointed with these plates though, they are not deep enough and the nail polish comes out of the design when it is scraped off. The only thing good about these plates was that they had very cute designs I only wish they worked :(. Now I know to stay away from cheeky plates.xxxx</li>
            <li> Cheeky Plates is a new one here on amazon.Great seller,great product.I had no problems with these plates.#1 ships fast.#2 packaged great.#3 film removes easly and is blue so you can see it.#4 backings..yes ladies these have backings,no sharp edges.#5 works even with regular polishes too.#6 stamps and transfer well.(etching is deep but not to deep)#7 this set has a nice selection of images/full nail designs to keep one busy for awhile.&lt;br /&gt; I am very glad i grab these B4 valentines,i did a mani that i am posting here all plates used here are Cheeky.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and as described! Before selecting which plate collection I wanted I searched and searched, and to me this was the best selection! It takes a little patience to master using the plates, but if you are patient it really is worth the effort! I am very satisfied with the purchase and will definitely do business with Designs By Cheeky again!</li>
            <li> I love the different types and style.</li>
            <li> First of all THE STAMPER AND SCRAPER SUCK.  Just throw that out and go purchase a Konad scraper and stamper.  Its only a few bucks and will make a huge difference in your stamping.  If you are using the stamp and scraper that came with these plates and your images dont come out THAT IS PROBABLY WHY.  These plates come with a blue protective film that was very easy to remove, they have backing so that the edges are not sharp.  The images are very cute and so far have all stamped well. I have not tested all images but I have on about 5 plates.  I own several sets of plates and lots of Konad.</li>
            <li> Terrible. The engraving wasn&#x27;t etched deep enough to work. Total waste of money.  I should have returned for a refund.</li>
            <li> Good etched designs .. seem to work well so far.  Good variety of designs.  Might be lite on depth of design on some but good overall.</li>
            <li> I am SO happy about this set! There are many different designs. These plates are very easy to use and don&#x27;t require the Konrad stamping polish.</li>
            <li> Truth I had a very bad experience with these plates on me came out more expensive than the other to buy another brand, I do not get half of designs I can use the rest of the designs are impossible to lift, no problem or enamels or seals, a problem of poor leveling depth of the plates.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of any kind of nail art stamping plates. I love the variety that comes with this set. I also love that the larger images fit your whole nail. I will definitely be purchasing more of these. They&#x27;re also fun!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t actual come in a sheet like it shows on the site.  Instead I received a small box of round discs with smaller images on them.  Sort of a let down compare to the sheet template of larger 2013 nail stamps.  But I&#x27;ll still use the</li>
            <li> Very suprised by the designs. Like that there are so many!! Glad I purchased them. It seems another set will be purchased for my daughter for her birthday!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the this set and i was pleased when they arrived, after further inspection i noticed that 1 of the little bags that came was the same as one other and also they only sent me 25 not 26. so at the end i got only 25 plates but 5 were repeated so i paid for 26 but only got 20 usable ones, i contacted cheeky and they told me to contact amazon for a return so they would send a new set but i had already used some of them and the time that will take to send them back and then wait for the other set to get here was just too much for me to make all of that trouble worth. The plates were very good and stamp fine but the custumer service makes them get a 1 star review.</li>
            <li> I was initially very excited about these plates. The designs were cute and when they arrived, I found they were wide enough to accommodate my nails, which I sometimes have a problem with. 25 different polish brands and hundreds of stamping attempts later without a single good stamp, I am giving up on these plates. I&#x27;m a seasoned stamper and have never had as much difficulty as I have had with these plates. The designs are simply not deep enough to get a good imprint, making them worthless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get used to using these if you have never used them before, but they are fun to play with. The tip designs don&#x27;t fit on my thumbs, but I must have larger thumb nails than most average women.  I am enjoying playing around with using different color combinations to see what shows up on top of what colors.</li>
            <li> After reading the mixed reviews, I was very nervous about ordering these plates but I&#x27;m glad i did. I received 26 unique plates (no duplicates) however plate #9 was damaged despite the protective film. Not a big deal to me because the designs are still usable. I did my first manicure with the nail stamp plates last night and I will keep experimenting with all 26 plates. Overall, yes i would order from Cheeky again.</li>
            <li> Just received these yesterday.  I wrote a review on the Mash stamper and scraper that I ordered to use with these plates.  Like I mentioned in the other review, I am still testing the use of these.  I have removed the plastic off one plate which is plate #14 and have tried to transfer 2 designs off that plate with not much luck. Not sure if it is the plate, stamper or polish.  I did try 3 different polishes and colors however but still did not transfer well...very light where I could hardly see it. The pattern does not completely come off the stamper as I had seen in some video&#x27;s so I have to clean off the stamper and the plate with nail polish remover.  Nail art is all new to me since I just became interested about 3 weeks ago and have been trying different things.  Will come back and update my review after more trial and error.  Not sure yet if this was a waste of money or not.  Can anyone help me with suggestions on the art of stamping and what the issue may be...??  Anything would be appreciated....Oh,  the plates where at total of 26 which was correct.  They were in numerical order in packs of 5 which was nice but when going through the 26 plates I thought I would get plates 1 - 26.  Turned out 18,19 were missing but I got plates 27 and 29 instead.  And then they skipped plate 28 too.  Just seemed strange.... Anyway, will see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update....I have gotten somewhat better with the stamping and will continue to try using these.  I purchased the Red Angel plates after these, and they are terrible.  Then I bought the MASH 2012 plates and they have seemed to work really well.  I bought the Konad stamper/scraper and that also works well in combination. I still need a lot of practice but from pictures people post with the product and some of the You Tube video, it looks like it can look really cool..so looking forward to getting better.  thanks for any tips and comments....</li>
            <li> These designs are a lot better than the other Cheeky plates I ordered which were the octagon shaped plates.  The designs transferred over a lot better to the stamper to my nails.  I choose this set because I really liked almost all of the designs and there&#x27;s so many to choose from.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet but I am a beginner and with my Konad double ended stamper and metal scraper the images work great. Big enough for my nails and lots of options to be creative. I just have to work a little cleaner :-)</li>
            <li> Cheeky&#x27;s plates are great!  Leading up to my purchase of this set of Cheeky plates, I had previously bought some other inexpensive no-name stamping plates and no-name stamper and was/am very frustrated with these no-name items! I purchased 4 no-name plates, but only two images across the entire 4 plates will actually stamp their image. (That&#x27;s 2 total images of a possible 30 or so images)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than think stamping is too hard, I came to Amazon and started reading reviews of plates and watching youtube videos with nail stamping plate reviews.  After seeing some great results other people have had with Cheeky, I ordered this set of 26 Cheeky plates.  When they arrived, I grabbed my thick polish (ones that go opaque with one coat) and a sheet of paper - all the images stamp!  The only thing left to do was my nails.  I did a base coat of white and used a dark gray for stamping, chose 5 of the full-cover circular theme designs and stamped away.  Turned out cute and it was SO EASY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheeky made it fun and easy.  Such a wildly different experience from the no-name plates I misfortuned upon!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for the past 1 year and I like it......... I hardly find time to get my nails done though</li>
            <li> I am new to the nail art stamping plates, but I had a few I had previously purchased and wanted to increase my plates and options. I found the Cheeky plates to be deeply etched enough to get a good impression, unlike some plates I have. Needless to say, I am having a good time learning the ins and outs of stamping on nails.  Everyone who sees my nails comments on how good they look.  I will be buying more of this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I saw good reviews for the big image plates and went with this but I&#x27;m having sooo much trouble getting these to stamp. Going to keep trying it though.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, so many cool designs and so many plates for the price. My customers love them. They are so fast and beats trying to draw these designs.</li>
            <li> Great stamps with these nail plates. I can use regular polish to pick up color with these plates. They transfer well to the nail!</li>
            <li> it did not work like i thought ???&lt;br /&gt;i had to try 20 times to do i nail …..i did not like it at all..</li>
            <li> The plate arrived on time and in good condition. I love these designs, and bought the set because it had so many full nail designs. The set has 160 images to be exact not the over 180 stated, there are 64 full images, 60 small images and 36 french tips.  The set stamps well ( I stamped every image), even the small word on CH 17 and CH 27. There is only one flaw on my plate CH 17, the little purse is incomplete. As usual the full image are too small for my thumbs, my CH 1-4 are just under 1/2 inch and the others are 1/2 inch wide. Would definitely buy again, hopefully with bigger full images.  The stamper and plastic scraper work great.</li>
            <li> These designs are great! I get compliments on my nails all the time now! Takes some practice but definitely worth the time and effort. Some designs are more difficult but with the right polish and some practice, it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and all 26 plates are different.  The etching is deep enough and the images (that I have used so far) are great.  I really like the variety of images which include full nail which are wide enough for my nails (a major plus), tip images, as well as some individual images...cannot wait to use them all</li>
            <li> nice product , delivery time is long.</li>
            <li> Great set with cute images! Images transferred well and product is packaged securely. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of nail image plates and I&#x27;m impressed with the quality. I have tested each image and they all look great. It&#x27;s unfortunate that I was sent a duplicate set of plates, so I&#x27;m missing 5 of the plates shown in the image preview. By the time I figured this out, it was really too late. Now I know to look out for that.</li>
            <li> They came through the mail super quick and definitely met my expectations. They were everything I hoped they would be!</li>
            <li> Love them they work well</li>
            <li> Good product.  Am still learning how to create unique designs.  At first I though the disc&#x27;s were scratched but discovered it was only the protective coating that appeared scratched.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas because she is really into the nail art thing.  We normally get Konad brand stuff because it&#x27;s the best we could find as far a stamps go.&lt;br /&gt;  Well  this set of Cheeky plates is just as good and in our opinion, even better.  We will get all off the Cheeky plates that we can.  The designs are cut deeply into the plates, the plates are quality, designs are great, and the price is much cheaper.  This is a must buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Omg I just received my plates today in the mail I am more then satisfied with these plates they are amazing I have the konad and bundle monster plates and these work just as good as those a must buy !! And super fast shipping !! This set is soooo pretty !!</li>
            <li> So this is a beautiful set but the first set I got I had to send back because I was missing one and they had some major defects. So I reorderd them and a few of them are scratched kinda deep and there are 2 or 3 defects. I dont think it will affect the design that bad and I dont want to go through sending them back waiting for the refund and reordering them. So Im going to keep them because I really like this set.</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with any of the images I have used so far.  I love the designs and the people at Cheeky have great customer service.  One of my plates come in scratched and I told them about the issue and the took care of it and sent me out a new plate.  I will be keeping my eye out for the next collection of plates!  Such a great value considering most plates range from $4 - $6 and with Cheeky you get 26 plates for about $16.</li>
            <li> Great price for a good amount of plates but so many don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;The ones that do work are very clear and stamp great.&lt;br /&gt;It frustrating when you have a client and are on a schedule when you get one that doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Is it possible to return some?</li>
            <li> I was a little worry to purchase this item for the different variety of opinions. I am satisfy with my purchase. I have try most of the designs and so far it works great. There is a few designs that are not deep enough, but nothing to major than cannot be fix if you just get to remove the nail polish with less force. In my opinion they are great for the price and also that the designs are big enough to cover an average size nail. I do recommend buying this set.</li>
            <li> These plates are awesome and of a really decent size! I&#x27;m having trouble with a couple plates, could be user error (I don&#x27;t think so) but they don&#x27;t seem to be deep enough. This is a shame because two of the ones I had to have are not working properly. :( Thus four stars, and not five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These plates are versatile and fun, and great addition to my collection. Make sure you purchase a stamper, and you&#x27;ll want thicker polish for stamping.</li>
            <li> These are my first stamping plates, purchased based on the reviews I read both here and on nail blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates are much smaller than I expected but the collection included many of the images that I was looking for and at an attractive price.  I only tested a couple of the images using a polish that was probably not the best choice since it dried pretty fast.  I really do need to practice using these since my placement of the little bow design I chose left a lot to be desired. Other than my bad placement, the images I did use transferred pretty well - I used the double ended Konad stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After examining all of the plates, there were a few that were scratched but only one image was affected and actually, I think the scratches gave it a bit more interest - it was a french tip design that I may or may not use.  The french tip designs look like they will be too wide for my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I am happy with my purchase and will probably purchase more from this company.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have a ton of fun with these. We always get comments on our nails and it&#x27;s fun to say we did them ourselves!</li>
            <li> so far so good all plates I use work excellent. Others I own not all plates work. The designs are awesome!!</li>
            <li> I love my stamps my nails look so cool. They are easy to use. With a hard stamper. But I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> Good variety.  One came scratched.  I suggest getting a holder for these small plates and a protective case.  Something I had to order separately.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied whit this product, these templates bring many beautiful designs, work for any occasion. I love it all. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brand-new to nail stamping, so unfortunately my review will be limited, as I&#x27;m not very knowledgeable on the subject. But what I do know is that $15 was a great deal for so many of these image plates, especially considering that Konads go for about half of that per single plate. I haven&#x27;t used all of these yet, so I can&#x27;t vouch for each and every single image, but the ones I have used transferred beautifully (including tiny intricate details), and none of the rest appear to have the shallow etching problem of which some people complained. (I&#x27;m wondering if people perhaps forgot to remove the blue protective backing? It&#x27;s not as obvious as it should be, so it took me a minute to realize it wasn&#x27;t part of the plate.) The image shows up well even using a cheap creme rather than an expensive or specialty polish, which was a relief because I didn&#x27;t want to have to spend a lot of money on a polish I&#x27;d only use for stamping. I have average-sized nails that I keep short, so I had no issues with stamp size, though the full-nail images would be too short for people with longer nails (they&#x27;re about 5/8\\&quot; from top to bottom). As for quality, I&#x27;ve used a Konad plate and have found no significant difference in image quality or ease of use between the two. The etching on these plates is a tiny bit shallower than Konad, but not so much so that it affects image transfer or visibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one design that was different than pictured on CH4, and although I actually like the one I got better, I think it&#x27;s still worth noting anytime there are discrepancies between the product pictured and the one received. But other than that, everything was as described and arrived quickly. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase and would definitely buy this brand and from this seller again.imilar complaints, so it seems like Cheeky really needs to check their packaging more carefully. But other than the missing plate, I am fully satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall not bad, but would like more variety in pictures.</li>
            <li> Daughter us having fun with it. Lotd of choices, she sometimes gets undecisive at times hà ha ha. Only downfall is I have to shave tge edges with a metal file ti avoid her getting cut. Otherwise, it great!</li>
            <li> Small plates for nail stamping. Make sure to remove the plastic on each plate before you get started. It takes some time but it&#x27;s a must or the plates won&#x27;t work. There are great designs and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with getting the image to look like a stencil. I&#x27;m not perfect at it but it&#x27;s better than me trying to paint a line or a squiggle myself. It&#x27;s fun to use with the Konad stamper/scraper. I also use Julep polish. Just pick two distinctive colors - a light and dark to make it pop.</li>
            <li> At first I thought these would be the jumbo size plates like the summer 2012 collection and they wouldn&#x27;t fit in the Pueen case I got, but these are the standard size so I was very happy with that! When stamping the images come out nice and clear for me!</li>
            <li> I thought getting into nail art would be expensive. These plates are loaded with great designs and cost so little.</li>
            <li> These plates were far better than other stamping plates that I have used.They arrived sooner than expected, I&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering again from cheeky.</li>
            <li> You will have to purchase your own scraper and stamp as it is not included with this set. The selections of plates you get for this price is a really great deal.</li>
            <li> I am loving these plates so far. They have been the best deal I&#x27;ve seen on plates. They have wonderful designs that are great for a beginner or intermediate nail artist! There are only one or two designs that don&#x27;t quite transfer because the design was etched too shallow, but when each plate has 4 to 6 designs, that&#x27;s not bad!</li>
            <li> I like this set because it has a lot of the full nail choices. I don&#x27;t usually do the small pictures. The edges are a little sharp, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Some of the stamps were too small and the nail polish dried in it before I could stamp it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> The designs are pretty clear, but not deep compare to Messy, Konad and Bundle Monster. I wouldn&#x27;t buy so many from Cheeky. I like the design to be deep so when I stamp I get all the polish. I work at a nail salon so every stamp has to be good or I have to redo and that&#x27;s costly. Maybe it might be only good for gel polish, because I don&#x27;t wipe of the base coat, just the stamp and redo but gel is expensive too.</li>
            <li> I really like them they work well and normal polish works well with them each one diff and all the patterns are very nice</li>
            <li> They are good but a lot smaller than I thought they would be. I guess that&#x27;s good though for me because they are easier to store. The accents themselves are very small. The fruit pieces or fimo is way easier to pick up than any of the jewels, I think it may just take some practice as well.</li>
            <li> The Nail Art Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure images was exactly as described.  It is a jumbo set of discs with case which will allow the user to ensure wonderful nail art and the selection was of artwork is outstanding.  My daughter is a nail technician and loves, loves this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I was expecting. The product came un a especial box, all the plates had a special cover to protect the images. I try the detailed images with the konad special polish and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have several nail stamping plate sets, including the new Cheeky 2013 summer set, and the Cheely Jumbo XL plates. This set is GREAT! The images stamp very clear and pick up easy.  I&#x27;ve used stamping polish and regular polish with this set, and their is something for everyone in terms of subject matter in this set.  I use these plates quite often; even more so than my other Cheeky plates.</li>
            <li> Nice varied images, good product and price. Recommend anyone to puchase it and have fun. Show off your cool looking nails on your friends and family..</li>
            <li> I love the images on these plates but I&#x27;m very sad about about the full nail images :&#x27;(  because they are so pretty but don&#x27;t cover my thumbnails.  I don&#x27;t even have large hands.  I wish Cheeky made these images in a larger size.  Full nail stamping is my favorite.  All these images stamp so well, even with regular polish.</li>
            <li> Says cheeky but stamps say vaga but a friend who bought them before hers say cheeky and the actual stamps are slightly different in size</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny! I was very hesitant at first before purchasing these but I&#x27;m very glad i took the risk purchasing these stampers. The images stamp better than the konad templates. I would absolutely recommend anyone buying these if you love stamping. Thank you cheeky for such a great product! I will most definitely be buying more from them&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is my first stamping plate set, and I&#x27;m so excited!&lt;br /&gt;They definitely aren&#x27;t the best designs in the world, but for the price it is a great first basic plate set! You do get 26 plates, I didn&#x27;t get 1-26, it was more like 1-17, 19-23, 25-27, 29. Some of them I probably won&#x27;t use, but you&#x27;ve got your basic animal prints, stripes, etc and a lot of fun cute ones that I&#x27;m excited to try, like the wine bottle one and the crazy 80&#x27;s print.&lt;br /&gt;They did have a big lead time for shipping, so if you&#x27;re wanting something quick you&#x27;ll have to pay for quicker shipping.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, a product of excellent quality. I put 5 stars for all categories. I have recommended this product to my friends</li>
            <li> This set has a lot of really great designs in it. It is most important to have a great stamper so that your stencils can show up and there are a lot of great choices in this set.</li>
            <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. it is just what it describes. works great with any polish. I haven&#x27;t found any designs that don&#x27;t stamp.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works perfectly. Excellent for the people who like stamping their nails. That&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> So much fun! They work great. So many different designs for adults and kids. My 4 year old loves looking through and deciding which she wants on each nail.</li>
            <li> these are an awesome product. I love to decorate my nails every chance I get and these had all the designs I wanted. Thanks</li>
            <li> With this product, be prepared to use a lot of nail polish. With these stamping plates, practice makes perfect. I am slowly getting better at stamping the images on my big toe. However, they are not as exciting as I expected them to be (in terms of quality).</li>
            <li> you get all kinds of designs with these. They transfer really well and the combinations are endless. This is a great starter set for anyone getting into nail art or wanting to add to their collection.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Konad stamping set well before it was popular a few years back, you know, before they were $4 a plate.  I was wanting some new designs and saw that Cheeky had some cute ones and they were affordable too.  They came in a timely manner and I was so excited to try them out, but  I got what I paid for...a cheap imitation.  The engravings aren&#x27;t deep enough making it difficult to use and inconsistent results from nail to nail.&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, I&#x27;ve been stamping for years now.  Buy the real deal, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> nice price, nice design, can&#x27;t beat Konad quality, and still cost efficient, would recommend, and planning to buy more cheeky Gal.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about these plates are that some of the designs aren&#x27;t deep enough to work for stamping. Otherwise they work great.</li>
            <li> very decent, easy to stamp with, haven&#x27;t had any problems and they are all standard size and fit in the sleeves in my books</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied of the choice that I made to add Cheeky to my collections. The images stamp very well on the very first attempt. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at nail stamping and these plates were so much fun! We had a nail stamping night and 5 of us did nails.  It definitely makes a difference what type of polish you use.  Creamy thicker polishes are better than thin ones or shimmery ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of compliments on my nails when I do the stamping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note - do *not* use a quick dry clear coat before stamping to try to save time. The stamps will smear.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while back. I really enjoy these plates. The images are very nicely etched. Absolute no flaw! Glad to have these in my nail stamping plates collection!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this product, so fun!</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering nail stamping plates, am I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I have tried several different stampers (Konad, white thick sticky type) that I own.  MOST of the image etchings of the designs, are not deep enough to hold the polish, to pick up a clear image! Even with the tops buffed. Small or large etching, I&#x27;ve only gotten a few to work...  I read many good reviews, and glad many of you are happy with the set.  However, I wish I had ordered Bundle Monster plates first.</li>
            <li> Lots of cute designs, work well</li>
            <li> Very small designs..only good for short nails, or decals. Cute patterns tho.</li>
            <li> so these are OK, they have some cute designs and some not nice ones, its about 50-50. other brands offer plates w a lot more cute designs. i wouldn&#x27;t get again if i had the choice knowing what i know now</li>
            <li> It fits all my nails and I like all the solid nail designs that come in this set... It works</li>
            <li> I bought these after seeing them on a blog (canadiannailfanatic at blogspot), and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  The designs are cute and original, and add to my collection nicely.  They stamped beautifully, I had no problems with images not working.  The depth of the engraving worked fine for me, but I didn&#x27;t try their scraper or stamper, I used an old card and my Konad stamper as I do with all my plates.  I was pleased to see that the scraper was plastic and I might try it, though.  I do have small nails so the images were more than big enough for my hands.</li>
            <li> Bad quality plates. Like another reviewer stated the plates are not deep enough. When you scrape off the excess polish all of the polish gets removed. I tried several brands of scrapers: Konad, Salon Express, etc., even a used gift card and the same thing happened. I tried using the stamper with other plates and it wouldn&#x27;t pick the design up. I tried the trick of gently sanding the surface of the stamper and it helped marginally, but still wouldn&#x27;t pick up the whole design from a Konad plate. So over all I was not able to salvage anything from this purchase. I&#x27;m staying away from all Cheeky products.</li>
            <li> So I have had a chance to try several of the full nail plates and have to say they work great!  Was a little worried getting non Konad plates because I haven&#x27;t had the best luck but these worked just fine for me.  I love the variety and I love that this set comes with a lot of the full nail plates.  I have people ask me all the time if they are stickers.  They are great plates and would recommend getting them.  These plates did come with a clear blue cover so the plates do not scratch which is appreciated as they come shipped stacked on top of each other.</li>
            <li> BAD QUALITY...&lt;br /&gt;-scratch very easily&lt;br /&gt;-the designs do not transfer to the nail very good&lt;br /&gt;-the design plates are cute.&lt;br /&gt;-much cheaper then konad plate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...overall i wouldn&#x27;t purchase from cheeky agian.. ill stick to Konad</li>
            <li> I do read reviews before I make a purchase and I tend to focus on the negative ones to figure out all that is wrong with a product. Well I can tell you that whatever issues others were having with these plates have been corrected. The depth is perfect. I did not receive any duplicates. Got exactly 26 and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Since last year I have been addicted to nail stamping. I&#x27;ve ordered the Bundle Monster sets and some Konad but was getting pretty bored with the same old patterns (ever so slightly different yet not different enough) on all the plates. That is until Cheeky came along! I receive so many wonderful compliments on my nails. I have had absolutely no problem at all with any of the plates transferring designs. They are well made and adorable. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> my daughter and I were so excited to get these - short shipping time - a bunch of super cute designs - so hard to figure out which ones to do first - 4 plates with seven small designs - 16 plates with four large and two small designs - 6 plates with six nail tip designs - good buy</li>
            <li> Great variety, and though it is pretty much a fraction of the price of a konad stamper, it is definitely of great quality as well. Would definitely recommend for a friend. in fact, I am thinking of buying one as a gift.</li>
            <li> These plates and designs are amazing.  They stamp well and are very unique.  I can&#x27;t wait for the \\&quot;Summer\\&quot; collection to come out, the designs are even better!!!  Don&#x27;t miss this set!</li>
            <li> The bundle arrived quickly and all plates are amazing! It&#x27;s a pity that the bundle didn&#x27;t contain scraper and printer, as I expected, but everything else was very cool!</li>
            <li> Arrived within a couple weeks although tracking said 6-8 weeks.  Was well packaged. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The bundle plates were shipped on time, and arrived in perfect condiction... so glad they contained protective support, amazing design.. i would totally buy more cheeky products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images are deeper than other brands....so the result is better !!!! so amazing guys !!! thanks 4 everything</li>
            <li> Very pleased--many, many nail art options, essy to use</li>
            <li> Took way too long to get here. Though the prints are nice</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece. Really great designs, and they come in a nice box for storage.</li>
            <li> hi i own a collection of nail plates that includes konad, bundle monster, sdp, and no brand plates and i have to say that i really love these plates i tested them all and have no issues with any of them i loved the designs because theyre originals and the picture comes out perfect,they have the perfect profundity, oh and if you dont have where to storage your plates this one comes with a lovely box!! and the backing of these plates have a really cute desing! so yes you have to have these plates added to your collection trust me!</li>
            <li> GGreat products with lots of cool designs to choose from..only problem i had was wanted to is one design bit wouldn&#x27;t work cause it wasn&#x27;t engraved deep enough so wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I love the plates and the designs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that SOME of the designs don&#x27;t pick up as well as the Konad plates.  For instance, if i&#x27;m trying to use the star design, it&#x27;ll pick up everything but a corner of the star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, no biggie, but for some of my more picky friends, they hate it.  Or if you&#x27;re only stamping one nail and it&#x27;s the main design, not cool that the whole design doesn&#x27;t pick up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From here on out, I&#x27;m only buying Konad plates.  At least I&#x27;ll know the plates definitely work.all the time 110%</li>
            <li> Designs stamp very nicely, but are much smaller than expected! Also gave myself a nasty cut on one of the sharp edges so not great quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so delighted to see the variety of designs. I already used them right away as soon as I have received them!!</li>
            <li> great produict, pretty fast delivery, just disappointed that the nail art plates were not in their Cheeky box.  Much easier for me to store them in the box!</li>
            <li> Somehow this product did not take 8 weeks to deliver like the other cheeky products I&#x27;ve ordered. The designs transfer clean and I had no damage to my plates. Comes in a convenient box, although I like to store my plates in the baseball card sleeves for quick access.</li>
            <li> Most of the plates are great, but some aren&#x27;t even showing very well! if i put my fingers over the design and whole plate, i wont feel a difference. overall it&#x27;s pretty worth it. it&#x27;s only with a couple of plates that i had that problem.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these plates. These were the first plates I&#x27;ve bought, and i was skeptical about them working. When they came in the mail, my mom and I had hours of fun playing with our nails. My TWO year old niece asks me to &amp;#34;paint stamp&amp;#34; her nails, and loves it. These work perfectly, as long as you know what you are doing. I would advise, instead of using those metal scrapers, to use an old credit card or gift card. The metal scrapers WILL scratch your plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more plates from this company in the future, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try out all of the plates.  However, I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with the ones I&#x27;ve used so far. They are just as nice as the Konad brand and you can&#x27;t beat the price. The plates have nice smooth edges. The images come out nice and clear; even when I used the Sally Hansen Insta Dry polish. (It&#x27;s nice and thick.)  I would definately recommend these plates.</li>
            <li> Read all the bad reviews and was really nervous about getting these plates. I had never used them before and thought Konaids prices were way too high plus their patterns weren&#x27;t that cute. I gave them a try and they are great. I use a Konaid double end stamper, maybe people were having problems with their stampers and not the plates. Everything on the designs I have used turns up on the nail and looks great! I was shocked that I didn&#x27;t have to do any redos especially since it was my first time stamping. I only gave it 4 stars becase there were 2 plates that had a scratch on them but it was nowhere near the designs. But Cheeky has really cute designs and they were all big enough to cover all my nails (and I always say I have big hands for a lady). Definatley recommended you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> these are fun and they work pretty well. not as good as some other plates i have but i still like them. for the price don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised about the shipping, it was extremely fast!&lt;br /&gt;I love the plates, exactly as described. When I was looking for stamping plates I was a little doubtful because I thought the patterns wouldn&#x27;t fit my nails (I&#x27;ve always thought my hands and nails are too big for a woman), but I decided to take the risk and surprise! these were just PERFECT! I can&#x27;t wait to try them all! I&#x27;ve become addicted!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for nail art stamping plates, I recommend you these, they worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Simply perfect. Bought these for wife. No need to buy konad anymore. These are just perfect !</li>
            <li> This was my first stamping kit, and I was very excited when I bought it. It turned out to be exactly the way it was described on the site, and I am excited to see the print each time I use it. Most of them come out well. It also depends a great deal on the type of nail polish you are using. But overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this, because I have great fun with it. I like the fact that it comes in a cute little box and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced. I love my nails now, thanks to Cheeky!:)</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my girlfriend and she loves them, she gets many hours of enjoyment out of their use. You cannot go wrong purchasing these for anyone that does nails.</li>
            <li> Great gift idea for an upper elementary child. This is a great product for learning the art of nail stamping.  My girls &amp; I are having fun with all the designs.</li>
            <li> I like mycket order very much</li>
            <li> A lot of the images won&#x27;t left off</li>
            <li> These are great so many option and so fun, I LOVE doing my nails and I get so many compliments on the work after using stamp plate</li>
            <li> I having so much fun with these stamps. My grand daughters are thrilled. I read alot of  reviews almost talked me out of buying them. Went to walmart got small set for ten buck for kit. To see what I can do with them. I had some trouble with a few but over all using different types of polish and arylic paint.  Decided to order these had such good luck with walmart kit. possiblities are endless not just for nails. I even got my grandson involved he is our only boy grossly out numbered all of the grand kids had fun just playing with acylic paint and stamping just for the fun of it. Cleans up is easy just use water in stead of nail polish remover. Make sure you have enough stampers! something to scrape with. we used store discount cards worked best. Set each child up with stamper, scaper, paper towels, some acrylice paints, something to stamp to I use some colored paper, give each child 1 dry coton wipe and 1 wet to clean plate after each design was stamped, paint brushes or q-tips for appling paint, quirted some paint out some smaller pieces of paper. I demonstrated and they went to town. Fun Saturday afternoon. Clean up easy. Just throw away all the paper towels, wipes and q-tips, clean stamping plates and brushes with warm soupy water. Hang and display their art. Oh and no cuts or accidents accured!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week I did all the girls nails with the &amp;#34;Cheeky&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Shandy&amp;#34; sets I purchased. Each one enjoyed picking out their stamps and colors for designs every finger was designed differently and I don&#x27;t think we had any repeats.Some colors worked better then others but then others and if we didn&#x27;t like it no problem just use top coat before stamping clean and try again if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to let you know Grandma, and her girl friends are all flaunting our newly designed nails too! Lots of complainments and oohs and awws. Husbands beware! yes I am doing my nails again....</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about buying this product because my previous experience with nail stamping was NOT good. I had bought an indroductory set from a different brand and it did not work. I tried everything I read, watched a whole bunch of youtube videos and NOTHING worked. I saw THESE products featured on a blog I love and thought, &amp;#34;Huh, I wonder&amp;#34; and so I made the leap. I LOVE THESE!!!! They worked the first time! And the styles are adorable. The hardest part of use was deciding what to try first!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the plates with my everyday inexpensive nail polish and they all seem to work very well and the pictures come out great. The only issue I had had was I did not received plates 18,19 and 28. Besides that I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So many awesome designs. I own several different brands. A must have if you love nail art as much as I do. Check out my slide show of nail art on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt; [...]</li>
            <li> the designs are beautiful but only work with nail polish of sinful colors and the xl stamper other than that amazing and these two supplements needed to stamp well are worth it because they work with every single plate out there.</li>
            <li> really easy to use come with a cute lil box to put in the plates and a lil emergency card to scrape off the design..</li>
            <li> The plates are a dream, but I did get one plate that was damaged. The rest of them work beautifully, and I can&#x27;t wait to get my XL Cheeky plates. :)</li>
            <li> They are the best, the most beautiful nail art plates to be stamping it and bought the designs are beautiful, the pattern is very well marked, drilled is deep which makes the seal up very well, I love you I have no words describe them, are the best, definitely recommend them 100%.</li>
            <li> These were my first set of nail stamps and I just love love love them. They came in a really nice box that can be used for storage and has a nice magnetic closure. The stamps are wide enough to cover my entire nail bed and transfer beautifully. I was very pleased with the short time it took to receive them and they came in a padded envelope so the box would be protected.</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping and I am really trying to get the hang of these. I can&#x27;t seem to get them straight but they are fun to play around with. Clean up is no fun because I end up with nail polish all over me.</li>
            <li> Love the plates. Easy to peel off cover. Really cool  and cute designs. Full designs cover all my nail.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I received this set of nail stamping plates by Cheeky very quickly (two days after ordering). I&#x27;m actually planning to keep a few plates for myself and give the rest of them to my mother in law. The individual plates comes in a neat, small box and comes with a card that can be used as a scraper. All the plates have a blue cling film that can be peeled off without too much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the plates appear to be good quality metal, but scratch VERY easily with the Konad metal scraper - the enclosed card much works better as a scraper without scratching them. You will have to experiment with different nail polishes in order to get a clean design lifted off the plates. I find that when using the Konad &amp;#34;special polish,&amp;#34; you have to leave it sitting in the design for 15-30 seconds, depending on the design, before it will lift cleanly off the design. Any sooner than that, and the stamp image gets sort of smeared. Whereas, when I use Sally Hanson Chrome Nail Makeup, I have to stamp it off the design IMMEDIATELY or it&#x27;ll get too dry. So some experimentation will definitely be called for. Overall I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this set for its quality and price (compared to individual Konad plates) and will be looking at other Cheeky products!</li>
            <li> Recieved my nail art stamping cheeky set!! came with what it said, every 5 trays were packaged so 5 bags to open, all had the blue plastic thing on it to protect it!! fun to play with, but tricky to figure out the whole stamping part!! but once you get that down and the right color, its pretty cool!!</li>
            <li> gave it four stares cus i got a repeat so now i have 2 of the same plates, some plates are hard to stamp but that might be cus im not stamping right, so other than that the plates are pretty good</li>
            <li> I really like these. I buy Konad and Bundle Monster, and these are just as good. The designs are a mishmash of cute, and flowery, and French mani, and some cool ones too. I really enjoy these and will be buying future collections as well :)</li>
            <li> Many of the plates have designs that are too fine and don&#x27;t carry over well</li>
            <li> I just wanted to second the experience of the other two reviewers.  The plates stamp cleanly with a Konad scraper and stamper.  The stamper and scraper that comes with the set are pretty awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. The single designs are a little small but that&#x27;s ok for me, that means I can use more together to create a nice design. They came fast and work really well. I plan on buying one of the XL plates next.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I had to tweek them for about a week to get the swing on how to get the image just right but I finally did and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Good quality plates. The full nail patterns require patience in lining up for wider nail beds but overall plates are good. Got all plates in order, no duplicates. Would order again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful deal! Very happy with the variety of plates and designs. My girls love them. Now it takes even longer to decide which design to use.</li>
            <li> I tested ALL of the designs and most of them stamped very nicely!!  Some of them weren&#x27;t uniform (missing sections) when you stamped (because they weren&#x27;t deep enough) but after giving these &#x27;problem&#x27; designs several tries, I found out that if you run the scraper more lightly, with hardly any pressure, they stamped fine!!! (I use a plastic scraper since the Konad metal one scratches the plates and they stamp just as good).  I love that they come with a protective sheet that you peel off, but despite that  about 3of my plates were scratched, but they still stamped well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do keep in mind that how well the design stamps depends not only on how well the image is embedded on the plate, but also the type of nail polish you use (my old white nail polish stamped great when I first got it but now it doesn&#x27;t, making the images look uneven but when I tried some of these images with another polish- metallic- the image came out crisp &amp; clear), how well you scrape and your speed of picking up the image &amp; stamping it on your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips on stamping with problem plates or designs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that if an image doesn&#x27;t stamp well, try it w/other polishes or applying lighter or stronger pressure on the scraper and also on the very fine images with fine lines, I found that if I transfer it faster, they do stamp but you have to be very fast on these.  This is not to say some images are not flawed (because some definitely are) but on these it may work if you try them in other ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note I DO NOT WORK FOR THE COMPANY!  I just have experience stamping with Konad!!!</li>
            <li> Did I tell you how much I love these? I bought a kit in Vegas while on vacation of a different brand, but after reading several reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and love these. Cant wait to order more plates, Cheeky brand discs are great. They are the same size as the disc I bought in Vegas.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice but the stamps are little for long nails..but either way the stamps r great and fun to use</li>
            <li> did not like.  the nail &amp;#34;squares&amp;#34; are just too small.</li>
            <li> Buying and shipping worked very well, but some of the images in the plates are impossible to use (you can&#x27;t even see the whole images at some plates).</li>
            <li> I really like the cheeky brand. Almost all the stamps have stamped well. They clean up well and don&#x27;t get scratched too much.</li>
            <li> i just got mine today and its amazing but the plates are a lot smaller than i though it would be.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, simple and complies offered by the manufacturer. Leave a good finish on nails and allows a wide variety of figures on the nails.</li>
            <li> Great nail art plates for the low price. These work great - they&#x27;re just as good as Konad nail plates!</li>
            <li> The designs on this plate are very intricate and very pretty. They give you a lot of different options and it is very easy to use! Remember to buy a stamper to use this device.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with awesome designs!!!! Works wonderful and soooo much fun to create amazing nail art!!!</li>
            <li> These plates are so much fun to use!  They are just as good or very close to the quality of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The edges are in fact a bit sharp (the discs are thinner than other brands). And although the images are a bit shallow, seem to still work well (I gifted this and I&#x27;ve been told - and have seen - how well they work).</li>
            <li> Ok, so I ordered this product Dec. 28th, 2012. I got pretty darn fast after that, arriving in a cute faux book-looking case. However when I opened it to sort them accordingly, there were 3 issues. Plate 5 was missing, there was a double of plate 4, and two of the 20-somethings had minor issues with flubbed production. Upon e-mailing Amazon, I was a able to either mail the plates back and get a new set, or to get a 50% refund. I decided that I could deal with the image mess-ups, as they weren&#x27;t really an issue, but I was kinda bummed that they weren&#x27;t able to get me my missing plate 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed Cheeky in January about if there was anything they could do about it. They asked me for my order number, and then silence. I assumed that they might be doing something in the background, so I completely forgot about it!&lt;br /&gt;I came home the other night to find a tiny package, which upon opening I found to contain my plate! They also included a multi-colored round rhinestones wheel, and a multi-shape rhinestone wheel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the plates, and I think they were worth the trouble. I highly appreciate Cheeky&#x27;s customer service, and I would be more than pleased to order from them again.</li>
            <li> Love the design, love the textures, and my girls loved the cute printings on her nails&lt;br /&gt;the texture doesnt work good on my nails because my nails are too long, so the texture is small for the whole nail, but is perfect anyway</li>
            <li> I used  a couple of plates &amp; they worked great! I definitely will be getting more! Awesome product! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Waiting on Konad nail polish to use with the plates bc it is not working with regular nail polish. Got items in a timely manner just as advertised. I would use this company again. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Very good product, lots of designs for a great price! they come covered in wrap so they dont get scratched during shipping. You might want to have your own little container or box for them, as they are in a small flimsy cardbord box, much like a deck of cards. also youll need to get a &amp;#34;stamper&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;scraper&amp;#34; which will be about 5 bucks, so all in all, for all the money spent, this is way better and more for your money than those As seen on TV things. Good product, Good price. I&#x27;d spend my money with this company again. :)</li>
            <li> It was not packaged as it depicts in the picture. I bought one for myself a few months back and the plates came in the cute cubed case with a plastic card scraper.  My niece loved it so much I decided to buy one for her, but was very disappointed that it came in a small cheap cardboard box just big enough for the plates, with no scraper.  But overall it&#x27;s still a great bargain and great product.  Will definitely get more cheeky products.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve this product and then use it on my nails.  I attempted to use the plates and the stamper as directed and it was more difficult than I intended it to be.  Everything I had read and seen on YouTube made this product look so easy and to my surprise the designs didn&#x27;t go on or come out as I thought they would.  This could be operator error on my part and I need to \\&quot;practice\\&quot; using them some more as this is such a fantastic idea and it shouldn&#x27;t be rocket science to use them.  I will continue to try and see if I can&#x27;t perfect the art of nail stamping and I love all the funky designs the came on the plates!  I would reccommend this to anyone but I would also tell them to HAVE PATIENCE when attempting to use them.</li>
            <li> AS plaquinhas são muito boas para carimbar e tem desenhos lindos! Adorei.&lt;br /&gt;Com certeza vale a pena comprar! Eu estou apaixonada por elas e mal vejo a hora de comprar a segunda coleção.</li>
            <li> This is my first foray into nail stamping and I received these plates as a Christmas gift. Originally I had been looking at the Bundle Monster plates but I decided to give these plates a try since they had high ratings and were one of the more well known brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates arrived in perfect condition and none of my plates were scratched or damaged. I was really excited looking through the designs because there were more that I liked (and would actually use) than I anticipated. I was a bit nervous getting started because I have wide nails and I was afraid the designs would not cover my entire nail. However, these worked great on every nail except for my thumb, which I expected from any brand of plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent about 3 hours just stamping on my nail (with no base polish) working on getting the hang of it. I tried out different polishes to see which ones worked the best and watched some tutorials on YouTube. I highly recommend trying out different polishes before you do an actual manicure because you will find that some polishes don&#x27;t stamp at all while others work great (don&#x27;t judge your plates until you do this). Also, watching different tutorials will help you find the method that works best for you. For me, rolling my finger over the stamper (instead of the stamper over my finger) gave me the cleanest and clearest design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first manicure was a success and each one gets better. I am very happy with these plates and feel like they give a nice crisp image, are easy to use, and feel well made. I am looking forward to buying more Cheeky nail plates in the future.</li>
            <li> I just recently got into nail stamping. This set makes me want to stamp my nails every time I do them, not matter the time it takes. I really like the french tip designs, they are so fun and interesting. I always get compliments on these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 of the plates and so far I am very pleased. I used a non-Konad nail polish and they worked just fine. I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments on my nails, people think I got them done at the salon. Love them!</li>
            <li> I really love these plates this is the first set I&#x27;ve bought and I&#x27;m really happy with it there are a lot of really pretty ones from full nail designs to little ones and tip ones. They are etched deep enough and work very well, a couple were scratched when I pulled the blue cover off but I can look past that and I am overall satisfied!</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive but was kept informed by email, they were better than I expected and definately feel like I got my moneys worth, so many  fab designs.  I&#x27;m as happy with these as I am my Konad plates</li>
            <li> The plates are great I&#x27;m having so much fun with them!!  I also ordered an extra plate case and I like the &#x27;newer&#x27; model vs the one that came with my plates.  I may just have to order another one :)</li>
            <li> Totally addicted to stamping. This is a good beginner kit, it has a little of everything at a great price.</li>
            <li> A great buy. I would recommend to all nail art addicts. The images are etched nicely. Images stamped are crisp.</li>
            <li> Those plates are GORGEOUS!&lt;br /&gt;As I live in France it took a while (like almost a month) to arrive home, but it was worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;The design are bigger than the Konad, but smaller than the Cheeky jumbo plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing, be careful, the sides of the plates looks a little sharp! Besides that, nothing. I love my new plates </li>
            <li> Nervous about this purchase because of the reviews/cheap price. You will def. need thick polishes and Konad scrapper/stamp if you buy these plates. They&#x27;re great for nail newbies or kids because they come out \\&quot;decent\\&quot;, but some designs aren&#x27;t deeply engraved. Wouldn&#x27;t advise serious nail junkies to buy (Konad plates are better).</li>
            <li> I totally LOVE the 2012 cheeky plates designs and the price is very reasonable. It&#x27;s a must have !!! For people who like to do their own nails! I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> good variety of designs but cheap quality, smudges easily but easy to clean&#x3D; probably will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I will admit, with some not good reviews and some great reviews, I was apprehensive about purchasing this stamping set, but was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this stamping plate!  With the various stamping plates I own, I recommend a cheaper polish like Sinful Colors, as they have a huge array of colors, and are thick enough that the stamper picks up the thicker color. I also use the Konad stamper, and have even had success with the cheap &amp;#34;Salon Expressions&amp;#34; nail stamping kit picking up the polish colors with the Sinful Colors polish!</li>
            <li> After 3 months waiting, my package finally came. Perks: The product comes in an adorable little box &amp; every plate is protected by a blue sticker. Cons: Even with a good amount of the plate protectors being scraped up, when peeled off, there were massive and minimul scratches on some of my plates (Since using a scraper scratches the plate in the end, it&#x27;s not very bothersome to me).The only suprise that I faced with was that the image plates are actually tinyer than expected BUT the images are big to cover every nail. Overall, im satisfied with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> I received this set of plates a few days early with is great! They stamp nicely but are on the smaller side. Which i dont mind because my nails wont grow past a certain length anyways. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with longer nails. But for me these are perfect! The images are very well made and stamp beautifully with the xl stamper! And for the price, these are the best deal i could find.</li>
            <li> If it were only some of the plates, I&#x27;ll deal with it. But the difficult to pick up issue&#x27;s there for most of the patterns. I have fiddled with several plates and haven&#x27;t picked up a single one! They are too shallow. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s because of my nail polish &#x27;cause I&#x27;ve tried many colors. I&#x27;ll have to return this and buy the Konad plates. I was really excited about getting so many designs with just 15 bucks. But, you got what you paid for. The Konad plates are expensive for a reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other plates for more but these are better not than the Konad but than other brands. The designs are bigger and fit on my whole nail with other brands I had to try and get the empty spots filled which is a hastle.</li>
            <li> small designs are hard to stamp off the plate. most of the time only a part of the design got on the stamper. much polish was used. bigger designs work well though.</li>
            <li> They came a week after order and I love them....</li>
            <li> Good product, good company. They&#x27;d get 5 stars, except some of the designs are a bit cheesy and some a tad redundant. But overall good quality product. I had no reason to contact the company, but they sent me a follow up email to make sure I was having a good experience with the product. That&#x27;s more than I can say for most companies who sell through e-commerce sites like Amazon. I really appreciate the extra effort to maintain good customer service!</li>
            <li> These are great plates, they have a lot of variety and the image sizes actually appear to be large enough to cover the whole finger. Great price and super value.</li>
            <li> I didnt get the item. Only the package the item was shipped in</li>
            <li> I received my package today AND the Konad stamping starter kit that included two Konad plates, three Konad nail polish and the stamper. I&#x27;ve been playing with both products all day today and the cheeky plates work JUST AS GOOD as the Konad plates do. They are the same size, same depth of the design for the polish to stamp well, and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with both purchases. I love the price of cheeky plates compared to konad brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to worry about with the cheeky plates is they are extremely thin on the edges of the plate. I can see why people cut themselves with the edges but if you&#x27;re careful, then you shouldn&#x27;t worry about. It feels like a REALLY dull knife. Overall, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I wanted to make a review of the plates, that i hope would be helpful for you guys. First of all i was waiting for my plates over a month, which even for China is kinda long time, when i finally got it I was so excited, until i opened the package) My primary desire for purchasing these plates were the bigger designs that should cover all nail, so when i saw the size of plates i was disappointed. Plates are really small and the designs would cover your nails just if you have very short ones. I have mine in medium length so it will probably cover my nails just if i completely cut them. The small designs are ok and the ones for french are really cute so you should really take it in consideration when buying these plates that it goes perfectly for short nails not for even medium or long. Hope my review will be helpful for those who want to buy this product and have some doubts like I had, wish somebody would tell me that before buying.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas, she loves to do all kinds of designs on her nails. When i received them i opened them up and every single one of the image plates were scratched terribly.They look like they have been previously used and abused. The plates are very thin and tend to bend very easily.The designs on them are very cute but unfortunately with how scratched up they are she wont be able to use them. I would not recommend this product to anyone.The only positive is that the items arrived quickly.[[ASIN:B006OMHR1S 2012 Cheeky Set of 26 Nail Art Nail art Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit With Total of 160 Nail Art Designs]]</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying stamps and so far I&#x27;m loving them! It took me a little bit to get the hang of using them, but after 30 min. or so of playing around with them, they are really easy to use. Great collection with a ton of cute patterns I&#x27;m really excited to use!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time,Very happy with my purchase.Excellent engraving.I have not had any problems with any of the images transferring and so far have gotten crisp clear images.I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These were amazing! I had been dying to get my hands on Konads for a year and a half but after seeing the price, I decided against it. Then a few months ago, I discovered these but I didn&#x27;t have the guts to buy it after reading some of the bad reviews because I was scared I&#x27;d be one of the unlucky ones. Finally for Christmas I caved in and bought this set and another set from Mash and LOVED them both! So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems. It&#x27;s really easy and the designs are great! The shipping was fast and the packaging was good. If you&#x27;ve been wanting to buy a Konad, but thinks it&#x27;s too expensive then this is a WONDERFUL alternative! I&#x27;m about to purchase another set right from them right now. I&#x27;m hooked!....Also, try the newer Mash set! It&#x27;s just as great as Cheeky! Perfect for wider nails....Hoped this helped anyone who had been contemplating whether or not they should buy this. Take the risk because I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> There is an amazing collection of graphics on this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think just about every holiday is covered on this set as well as some great patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a bit of difficulty with some of the smaller flower graphics stamping clearly...but that might just be me.</li>
            <li> BEST thing I have ever bought for my nails, its a must have i&#x27;m so happy I got it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> Lov love these plates. They are packaged well. They are not sharpe like some plates. They all hav very nice design. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> My first stamp plate purchase and I love them. Lots of fun, but will take a little practice to get used to it. I also recommend using an old plastic card of some sort to scrape the excess polish off with. Metal scrapers will scratch you plates.</li>
            <li> these are very good. there are a few designs that are very thin and only look good in black and white because of design thinness, but most look great. if you stamp too hard you might drive ink out of design well, same with scraping. scrape lightly and stamp moderately. love the little box they came in.</li>
            <li> Recibí el producto, súper bonitos, muy bien presentada estoy feliz haciendo mis diseños en las uñas, son como se ven en las fotografías aunque el tamaño es pequeño para uñas anchas</li>
            <li> I tried all types of polish, two types of stamping tools and two different scrapers to no avail.  The image would not pick up as the plates were just not etched deep enough.  I love the designs, I just wish they worked.  I have read the others reviews so I guess that their quality control just isn&#x27;t up to par as others have said their plates work just fine.  Mine didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I purchased these plates, and a few Konad plates when I first started stamping, now when you look at them from a distance you wouldn&#x27;t notice any difference in the plates but when you stamp you notice that the Konad plate is a much better plate. Konad plates are carved in deeper, allowing easier polish transfer, the Cheeky plates here are not,  so you have to do a lot of trial and error, I learned don&#x27;t use a metal scrapper, it scratches your plates and removes to much polish, just a light swipe with a credit card, and press with a medium amount of pressure to get the image to transfer from plate to stamp. Now if you do not have patience get all Konad stamps, but if you want a lot of fun plates get the Cheeky plates a ton of designs and cheap you just have to work with them and try thicker polishes and be patient to get great results.</li>
            <li> I really expected larger plates, but to be honest I never really did nay detailed research. Some of the designs are very little kiddish, but the ones that I do like, I love. So many designs for the price, I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times since I first got it. Practice makes perfect though; be prepared for some trial runs.</li>
            <li> Trop top!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marchand trés correct, le produit est conforme et super!! Je le recommande!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Par contre il faut être patient pour la livraison (1 mois environ) mais c&#x27;est signalé dès l&#x27;achat donc pas de surprise! Et quel bonheur&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;de recevoir son paquet et enfin découvrir le produit!!</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend to all the nail lover out there to consider purchase cheeky plates. They all lots kind of unique design that hardly find in other brands of stamping plates :) So far i had tried most of my plates and they stamp well. Just need more practise. The only down side is their delivery time is kinda long. It took about 1 month for my 2nd set.</li>
            <li> I have been having a lot of fun with this set. This is my first time buying a nail stamp set and I shall be buying more. There were no duplicates and all the images show up as they are supposed to. If you are having issues with image it is likely the nail polish, remember it must be dark enough with one coat because unless you are talented enough to stamp the image twice and exact then you only get the one coat.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect, you have a several kind of stamp to use, there are some many that you don&#x27;t know which to choose. It arrived on time,</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with any of the images transferring and so far have gotten crisp clear images. I have noticed that 2 of the plates had one long scratch on it and on one plate the scratch goes through the design. I tested this plate out to see if the line would show up once transferred to the nail and very faintly it did.  On the other plate the scratch was not close to the design so it made no affect on transfer ability.  I think most of the images are cute and wearable.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase at least happy enough to purchase some xl plate designs by Cheeky that I can&#x27;t wait to try out.</li>
            <li> I love these designs, however I received them and they are very scratched up. Disappointed because I really liked these designs.</li>
            <li> I use those image plates often, most of the them works great, some doesn&#x27;t work well. over all it is a good product.</li>
            <li> These are ok.  Some images don&#x27;t fit across my wide nails.</li>
            <li> Just got the plates.. haven&#x27;t used them yet.. but i noticed that i got 2 sets of plates 11-15 and am missing plates 6-10. I really don&#x27;t want to send back the entire package...So i either have to risk this mistake again and wait and hope i get all the right ones... or just live without 6-10 and give the extra 5 to my sister in law...</li>
            <li> I really do think someone out there can get these plates to work, but it isn&#x27;t me. On one design I stamped it onto a piece of blank paper, just to see if I could get a full image, and out of about 20 stamps I finally got one that was clear and transferred the full image. If you have patience then the designs are great, and it is definitely going to save you money.</li>
            <li> I broke out these plates and tried random patterns on all my nails, using konad stamping polish in white, and a metal scraper/stamper from salon express. Every image I stamped came out perfectly and fit my entire nail (I have short nails, but large hands) overall Im just thrilled with these plates. Im also in love with the little box they came in, it has room for about 10 extra plates, and magnetically closes. really a nice surprise because I was wondering what to put them in once they arrived.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these plates. So many beautiful designs. Also came in the cutest little storage box that opens like a book. So Awesome. I had a hard time with any stamping plates before but with a little practice it has become super easy.</li>
            <li> I was soo excited to receive this item after I have read the other customer reviews but to my disapoitment the package was incomplete so I have to return it</li>
            <li> I had to add this set to my collection of plates. The price is good considering that Konad plates are about $6 for just 1 plate. I love knowing that I can do my own nails and not have to pay someone else to do them. I think these designs are very pretty; glad I found these.</li>
            <li> This set of 26 nail art is amazing. So beautiful and it came with every plate covered with a plastic to protect it. I did not have problem taking the plastic off .. I read others having problem ..  I wonder what I will do with so many images but I paid only 14.99 for all this.  If you consider I spent around 5$ ,6$ even 8$ to buy Konad Plates in the past.</li>
            <li> Good variety of designs. I use old credit type card as scraper so surfaces don&#x27;t get scratched.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought my set a while ago and I love it. All the designs I&#x27;ve tried so far came really sharp and neat in my nails, the stars patterns are definitly my favorites :)&lt;br /&gt;This is a great purchase for it&#x27;s price and I can&#x27;t wait to have the other set of plates :)</li>
            <li> This is my first set of Cheeky plates and they are fantastic! Tons of really great designs to choose from. All plates have a backing to prevent cuts and the top of the plate is covered in a blue film to protect them during shipping. I used the Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear and Inta-Dri polishes with them and they worked really nicely. I would certainly recommend this set to anyone into nail stamping!!</li>
            <li> I only buy Konad stamps because the engraving is deeper so it catches more polish and a clearer and more defined stamp. HOWEVER, after reading almost 75 five and four star ratings and 11 lower star ratings I figured I would give it a try. Most probably like you, I was a little weary because you cannot try them out if you want to return them. You can only look at the images for a return but I figured for $15 bucks and considering one image plate from Konad is $4-6 bucks I would be daring. I have to agree these stamps are amazing and even the fine detail is visible. I would have to add a suggestion, unlike Konad, you cannot use as many different brands of polish on these plates. The consistency needs to be thick. The Konad special polish works PERFECT and the next brand that works wonderfully is Sally Hanson Insta-Dri and they are only around $4 at any drug store. CVS seemed to have the biggest collection of colors but at $5.50 compared to $4 at Walgreens and Wal-Mart. The Insta-Dri works so well because it dries quicker than regular polish allowing a tacky consistency to develop quickly. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start stamping or someone like myself who&#x27;s become an enthusiast. Knowledge comes from stamping experience with plates, all comments left on Amazon, and research on nail blogs and many YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a true addict to nail art...can&#x27;t wait to get started on all of the possibilities!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay Me!  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> i bought this for my sister and she love it, every piece was with a blue protector plastic and the designs are very fancy and pretty, we really like it.</li>
            <li> i was very excited about this purchase.  i had read the other reviews and did my research so i knew to take off the protective film which came off super easy.  my kids and i really love all the design choices!</li>
            <li> Cheeky stamping plates are really good quality. The images are clear and stamp beautifully. I will be ordering more of them</li>
            <li> This ad contains a completely untrue statement: \\&quot;This set&#x27;s full nail designs are the biggest available (guaranteed). They are long and wide enough (unlike other brands) to cover the full size of your nail.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG. The designs are the same tiny size as Konad, Mash and others. They are NOT bigger plates or designs like the Cheeky Summer set, although the box is the same size. These won&#x27;t fit the nail bed for my thumbs or even the very moderate length of some of my nails, which just barely peek over the top of my fingers. I didn&#x27;t want yet another set of plates with designs that won&#x27;t fit on all of my nails. Yes, some people have very small nails beds, but some have larger beds than mine, but I imagine most people could forget about using these on a big toe. Some of us like a matching manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The individual nail designs are tiny also and many either don&#x27;t have much detail, or have so much detail crammed into a tiny space that no one will know what the design is supposed to be once on the nail. A rose the size of a pin head is going to look like a blob made by a pin head, if it transfers at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first set from Cheeky was the summer set, which also has the statement in the ad here on Amazon about having big full nail designs, and it does. With an identical statement, I was expecting at least similar sizes, but that is not what I got. If I can figure out the return process and shipping doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune, these are going back.</li>
            <li> Love these stamping disks, I have great luck using them and a good variety of image!</li>
            <li> These are great!  The images are fun, crisp, and diverse and open up a world of opportunities for nail stamping.  It&#x27;s also a great deal - you get so many!</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it...she does all her friends nails, and they love it also...but wow.....I need more fingernail polish with it....LOL thanks it really is perfect!</li>
            <li> I so love these. Clear crisp stamping. I want more!</li>
            <li> Beautiful designs on these and 161 images. Also I purchased a a few items through this company and  you get great customer service.</li>
            <li> Make sure to check all your plates carefully when you get these. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with stamp plates before, but this time around, I received these as a birthday gift in the mail and two of my plates were defective. One stamp was off center, ruining one of my stamping options because it falls off the plate, and the other had a deep scratch through the design, a cute cupcake, which ruins its potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve contacted Cheeky to see if I can avoid having to send the entire set back to my friend (more postage being required, boo!) so they can get a refund because I&#x27;d rather handle it myself directly. Hopefully, Cheeky will just ask for the UPC as proof of its purchase so I can send the two defective plates to them, I&#x27;d be more than happy to pay shipping on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the designs look super cute and are all there. Unfortunately, this set does not include the plastic Cheeky &#x27;membership card&#x27;, which acts as a scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I did contact Cheeky, they responded that they&#x27;d work with me to replace the plate that was damaged, but after submitting a photo and my information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I got the two plates in the mail plus two sets of those little gemstones you can put on your nails! Awesome company! :)</li>
            <li> These turned out a lot better than I expected.....there are a bunch of them ( that&#x27;s always fun )....they are of the best in quality.....there are many french tip designs....If I had paid double the money, I would be happy I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Teresa Alstott</li>
            <li> Tried 2of the stamps so far and couldn&#x27;t get anyting to transfer.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the stamper or the stamp.  But will not be spending more money to find out.</li>
            <li> I did not know you could not use any nail polish but have to buy a special one. It is very hard to master.</li>
            <li> Cutest designs I&#x27;ve ever bought (and I have a LOT of different design plates). I wish I could post pictures! Excellent engraving (deep enough to hold nail polish). I LOVE the storage box. I&#x27;m totally buying more cheeky products in the future!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters for Christmas and the quality is great and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;) great on the shipping end also! Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li> This set is very nice. I have few other sets and this one is of a higher quality and designs are really cute. They are also easy transferable and easy to use. Each design covers my full nail plate without leaving any gaps like with other sets. I am pleased that over some time companies figured out that nails are wide and bigger is better than smaller for a nail design.</li>
            <li> These are high quality, all stamped great with no problems, a set anyone would love</li>
            <li> loved the designs and the quality of the disc. I just walked past a kiosk in the mall selling these for $15 a disc. This is such a good deal!!</li>
            <li> This is my first stamping plate set. I love the variety. I use an old gift card as a scraper, since the one from my stamper/scraper kit has a metal edge and scratched the plate. It seems to work better anyway. As far as I can see, the designs are the same as shown. I plan on using this whenever I paint my nails, to add a special touch.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with the selection of plates and definitely recommend!  They are easy to use; besides trying to peel off the protective film.  Edges are a bit sharp but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> Used them on myself and they all work great. just need to remember to clean them with acetone before the first use.</li>
            <li> I have over 50 plates and I have to say that cheeky plates are as good as my konad plates, and way better than my mash plates. I love the designs on these plates and the summer collection. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> It works fine, like how you&#x27;d expect nail stamp plates to work. There&#x27;s no problem with the plates and the price is great. Reminder that it&#x27;s 26 plates so don&#x27;t be surprised when some numbers between the plates are missing!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! These are just as good as any other expensive name brand nail art. So many plates and such neat designs.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the packaging Cheeky used for the plates and giving you am emergency scraper? Amazing! There are so many cute images, I&#x27;ve used a few and love them can&#x27;t wait to use more!! Incredibly fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li> Work really well. Plates fit in bm plate book. The designs are deep enough to get a good stamp. No repeat plates!  Cant wait to buy their other plates!</li>
            <li> Loved em! they are very cute and the images come out really well! remember to use the right kind of polish or they wont come out as well! wearing some designs right now!!!</li>
            <li> I really love the designs on this nail plate set… I would have given it a 5 star if it weren’t for the fact that the plate number 16 was really bended so the result is not even worth to try to stamp it (I’m really disappointed in this because I really love the designs on this plate. I think it was a problem while it was being ensemble at the cheeky H.Q, because if it was a shipping problem then it would have been more than just one nail plate being damaged) that said I really loved it over all!!!</li>
            <li> I really like nail and bought this mainly for the full nail stamps, but unfortunately they do not fit my entire nail, and I do not have long nails. Love the stamps and designs just disappointed that they are so short</li>
            <li> i love it i love it ! it is everything i was hoping for , it is really a good buy , and when you do the 25 dollar total for free shipping its a steal&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> Got this set and one other for my wife and daughter since they are nail FREAKS.  It seems to work great and they absolutly love them!  Most family functions now end up turning into a nail party for all the girls.  To the best of my knowledge, they haven&#x27;t come across a bad plate yet in either set.</li>
            <li> Completely in love with these plates, perfect size, tons of images, so cheap, well made, they transfer really well onto the nail, just Perfect</li>
            <li> If you are new to the world of nail stamping or a seasoned vet, I strongly recommend Cheeky Stamps! They are large enough for most nails and cut deep enough they stamp beautifully with no smudging. Do yourself a favor and save yourself a lot of time and money, buy Cheeky</li>
            <li> This is a nice assortment. Cheeky makes Cute stuff and good quality products. They came in a box with a card to use as a scraper as well.</li>
            <li> The plates are fine and very diversified for lots of fun choices; it&#x27;s me that has to get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> from the way the picture shows it i thought it was all on a sheet but they are individual pieces but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love these plates, but the designs DO NOT FIT MY NAILS. These plates are for people that have super short shaped nails 😳.  If  only the  plates were  a little bigger!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, deep etchings. The square nail sized designs are 60% to small for my nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brand new to nail stamping, but even after practicing and getting used to doing it, most of these designs didn&#x27;t come out as desired. About one fourth of the plates didn&#x27;t transfer from the plate to the stamping tool at all because they weren&#x27;t engraved deeply enough. There are 64 full nail designs altogether (16 plates with 4 designs on each plate) and all of them are too small. I am a teen (and kind of small for my age) and the full nail designs pretty much only cover my pinkie. The smaller designs are cute and most of them work, but I still don&#x27;t think that this product was worth the price. I would not recommend these nail stamping plates even for a lower price.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to see the new cheeky plates on sale. They have a lot of really cool designs. When I received the plates the designs seemed to be a little deeper than the other plates I have. I found that you need to use a lot more polish to fill the designs and need to scrape forwards and backwards to get the excess polish off completely. Other than a few trial and error stamps I really love these plates. Being so deep they give a really nice clean stamp, although there is more of a tendency to smear while stamping. Thank you Cheeky for making another awesome set of plates!</li>
            <li> I recently got into nail stamping, and thought that this would be a good way to get a nice variety of stamps without spending a lot of money.  What I didn&#x27;t anticipate was the very long delivery time.  The kit shipped out of China within 2-3 days of my order, it took about two and a half weeks to make it to San Francisco, and about six weeks to make it from SF to my house.  I probably could have walked faster!  Other than that, the stamps seem to work well, I did get duplicates of 5 of the disks, so I only REALLY got 21 of the 26 plates that I paid for.  Some of the duplicates were cute ones, so I have since passed them on to my daughter and nieces...</li>
            <li> im loving every single plate thank you. A+ seller</li>
            <li> These plates have worked great for me so far! These were the first set of nail plates I have purchased, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. All the designs I have tried work well. The quality is great, and the designs are fun. I had heard to use a plastic scraper instead of a metal one (the metal ones scratch the plates), so I use the little plastic card included in this set as my scraper. It works perfectly. All I needed to by was a stamper- I use the Konad double-ended one, which works well with these plates. These are a great deal and a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> Awesome set. Works great. NO problems with any impressions. They all come out great. Worth the money for the amount of options</li>
            <li> This is an incredible deal! The plates were in excellent condition and they work wonderfully, I did my nails with them today, Valentine&#x27;s themed....so cute. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with these.They were good for stamping but watch the edges.Sharp but most are so don&#x27;t hold that against them.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughters LOVE these , they are constantly doing their nails now, there is so much excitement with each nail session. it took them about 2 times to get the hang of it but after that no problem. plenty of vid on youtube on tips on how to use them.</li>
            <li> Love these!!! Although takes some practice and some patience.  The designs are great! I started off with the Konads but the price on these are so much less and the quality the same.  Will be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> This item is okay there are some really cute designs on each image plate. I cant get the designs on my nail all the way. I&#x27;m using the Konad nail stamper kit. Maybe I just need to practice it more</li>
            <li> These stamps have a nice variety and work very well. I chose them because they had so many choices for the tips. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I received the cheeky set on July 1st and immediately used them on July 2nd to create my July 4th nails! The nail plates worked great, no problems with the stamp picking up the image. I only have a small set of Konad plates so I was looking to add to my collection without spending the high price on Konad. I&#x27;m very pleased with this Cheeky set and the amount of stamps you get for the price is amazing. I&#x27;ve already received many compliments on my nails. I&#x27;m looking forward to creating more designs with the set.</li>
