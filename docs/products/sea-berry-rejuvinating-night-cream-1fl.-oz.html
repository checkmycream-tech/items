    <ol>
            <li>great stuff!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also very good.</li>
            <li>Although a great product, I did not notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any great difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I started using the Sibu night cream a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;m delighted to say that it seems to be working almost as well as the oil.  </li>
            <li>I do not like the feeling, see nothing good and will not reorder it.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this night cream!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>An amazingly moisturising night cream.</li>
            <li>I use the seed oil (straight) on my face and that&#x27;s given me my best results.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizes nicely and has no offensive scent.  </li>
            <li>but I find Argan Oil products as effective or moreso, so I&#x27;ll stick with them.</li>
            <li>this is a wonderful night cream, completely non greasy, makes your skin feel very soft, wonderful scent,&lt;br /&gt;not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike most creams, it does not leave a sheen.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s certainly not enough to turn me away from this excellent cream.</li>
            <li>I have most of the Sea Buckthorn line</li>
            <li>Since, using these products my skin is smoother, healthier, and more even toned.</li>
            <li>I thought that I&#x27;d see more moisture in my skin, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li>I also use the lotion and love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so refreshing and</li>
            <li>Sibu products are excellent for skin with problems, especially aging skin</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much better than the day cream.</li>
            <li>I love most of Sibu products but this stuff is just sitting in my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t enjoyed the process or the consistency.  </li>
            <li>Good smell, absorbs fast and I think it&#x27;s made a difference.</li>
            <li>The cream is very light and absorbs easily and quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I use the Sibu Nourishing Moisturizer cream during the day a love it so much and decided to try the night cream!</li>
            <li>Love it as much!</li>
            <li>My skin was getting dry and these two products work awesome to keep it soft and silky!</li>
            <li>It is a great value that compares to other products that are 3x the price!</li>
            <li>Sea Buckthorn is my new absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>Honestly, though, it&#x27;s not worth paying more for.  </li>
            <li>There are lots of natural ingredient, cruelty free, no chemical moisturizers to be easily found.  </li>
            <li>This is a great mosturiser my face never looked better especially in the winter time when my face it&#x27;s so very dry.</li>
            <li>Some night creams can be heavy, but this one is great, I recieved within 7 days of placing order, my face loves it.  </li>
            <li>Cream is old and has a crust on top.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry/dehydrated skin and was excited when I was recommended this at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Mostly it smells like oranges, but the fragrance of this product only lasts like a minute and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and I will continue to order it whenever I need it.</li>
            <li>Not exactly dry and flaky, skin was smooth but not hydrated like I wanted.</li>
            <li>neither is the oil unless you slop on way too much.</li>
            <li>I received this item really fast</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made much difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s natural and has a light citrus scent (I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances in products).  </li>
            <li>than any decent moisturing creme.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this night cream.</li>
            <li>Who could imagine such a small jar could deliver the incredible results in such a short time.  </li>
            <li>(By the way, sea buckthorn is the only non-chemical product I&#x27;ve ever found that really helped with age spots!)  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve seen no difference in my skin so far.  </li>
            <li>Too early for any &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>It feels like old cream.</li>
            <li>You can get a nice vitamin packed, antioxidant loaded facial moisturizer at Target for a lot less money--and you don&#x27;t have to hunt it down at health food stores or order on line.  </li>
            <li>The cream is generally faster to apply than the oil.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The reason may be that I have only used this one product along with my other brands for cleansing, etc., so I have now purchased the cleanser and eye cream.  </li>

            <li> However, as soon as you put it on your face feels stiff, similar to how your skin, if you have dry skin, feels after a shower...</li>
            <li> This night cream was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I was curious about the &#x27;sea buckthorn&#x27; properties.</li>
            <li> The only down side is it has a slight fishy smell to it because of the omega vitamins.  </li>

            <li> Despite being closed tightly after use, this cream dried out to a solid within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> After applying the cream, my face feels very tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Both products fade reddish-toned age spots and make wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The minor drawback to the cream is that it has a slight odor that&#x27;s not good.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on that one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spread well and its almost dried out or something.  </li>
            <li> Not a strong Fragrance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink or anything, and it&#x27;s very slight, but something I do notice.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE ORDER night cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how beneficial this is...</li>
            <li> I guess I had the wrong concept.  </li>
            <li> Weird.  </li>
            <li> but this night cream is difficult for me to use.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very poor quality.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is very expensive, and does not help my skin, and I do not recommend to buy it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Despite being closed tightly after use, this cream dried out to a solid within a few weeks.  Can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on a Town &amp; Country Magazine article and an on-line blog review.  I like that it&#x27;s natural and has a light citrus scent (I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances in products).  However, I&#x27;ve seen no difference in my skin so far.  The reason may be that I have only used this one product along with my other brands for cleansing, etc., so I have now purchased the cleanser and eye cream.  Even if I have no improvement in my skin, as long as I don&#x27;t have a reaction and know that this product doesn&#x27;t contain toxic ingredients, that may keep me using it regardless.</li>
            <li> The cream is very light and absorbs easily and quickly into the skin.  Also, unlike most creams, it does not leave a sheen.  Would recommend to anyone with any skin type.</li>
            <li> I use sea buckthorn for age spots with the side benefit of smoothing out wrinkles.  I use the seed oil (straight) on my face and that&#x27;s given me my best results.  I started using the Sibu night cream a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;m delighted to say that it seems to be working almost as well as the oil.  The cream is generally faster to apply than the oil.  It&#x27;s not greasy, but neither is the oil unless you slop on way too much. :)  Both products fade reddish-toned age spots and make wrinkles less noticeable.  (By the way, sea buckthorn is the only non-chemical product I&#x27;ve ever found that really helped with age spots!)  The minor drawback to the cream is that it has a slight odor that&#x27;s not good.  It doesn&#x27;t stink or anything, and it&#x27;s very slight, but something I do notice.  The seed oil does not have this odor.  However, it&#x27;s certainly not enough to turn me away from this excellent cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great mosturiser my face never looked better especially in the winter time when my face it&#x27;s so very dry. Also try their serum it&#x27;s also very good.</li>
            <li> Who could imagine such a small jar could deliver the incredible results in such a short time.  My skin looks and feels rejuvenated.I highly recommend this night cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have most of the Sea Buckthorn line and I do not want to be without it. Since, using these products my skin is smoother, healthier, and more even toned. The only down side is it has a slight fishy smell to it because of the omega vitamins.  Mostly it smells like oranges, but the fragrance of this product only lasts like a minute and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Overall, I love this product and I will continue to order it whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Melasma on my face since my third pregnancy.  This is the ONLY product that has faded it to almost non-existence.  My husband noticed it as well and he doesn&#x27;t notice anything.</li>
            <li> An amazingly moisturising night cream. I wake up with plump skin that is basically glowing.  Sea Buckthorn is my new absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> Although a great product, I did not notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought that I&#x27;d see more moisture in my skin, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  I guess I had the wrong concept.  I just didn&#x27;t like the texture of my skin after using this.  Not exactly dry and flaky, skin was smooth but not hydrated like I wanted.</li>
            <li> I received this item really fast but it&#x27;s very poor quality. Waste of money.  Cream is old and has a crust on top. I ordered other Sibu creams a year ago and they have later expiration date then my \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; cream that I just relieved.  I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Good smell, absorbs fast and I think it&#x27;s made a difference. I also use the lotion and love the product. It goes a long way so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting any.</li>
            <li> I like all of the Sea Buckthorn products but I especially like this one. It hydrates and plumps my skin at night and I also feel a tightness in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cindy B</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful night cream, completely non greasy, makes your skin feel very soft, wonderful scent,&lt;br /&gt;not overpowering. recommend!</li>
            <li> This moisturizes nicely and has no offensive scent.  Honestly, though, it&#x27;s not worth paying more for.  You can get a nice vitamin packed, antioxidant loaded facial moisturizer at Target for a lot less money--and you don&#x27;t have to hunt it down at health food stores or order on line.  There are lots of natural ingredient, cruelty free, no chemical moisturizers to be easily found.  I didn&#x27;t see any great difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry/dehydrated skin and was excited when I was recommended this at Whole Foods. However, as soon as you put it on your face feels stiff, similar to how your skin, if you have dry skin, feels after a shower... I would not recommend this product because of the uncomfortableness of wearing it.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product&lt;br /&gt;it is very expensive, and does not help my skin, and I do not recommend to buy it</li>
            <li> great stuff!! I love this cream it&#x27;s so refreshing and just what it claims to do for you! ! !</li>
            <li> Too early for any &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.  Not a strong Fragrance.</li>
            <li> I always used sibu day cream and sibu oil. This night cream was not what I expected.  It feels like old cream. When I used my face color change to red and etching.  NO MORE ORDER night cream. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Some night creams can be heavy, but this one is great, I recieved within 7 days of placing order, my face loves it.  It is a great value that compares to other products that are 3x the price!</li>
            <li> than any decent moisturing creme.  I know Dr. Oz has recommended Sea Buckthorn but I find Argan Oil products as effective or moreso, so I&#x27;ll stick with them.</li>
            <li> After applying the cream, my face feels very tight and dry. I do not like the feeling, see nothing good and will not reorder it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how beneficial this is...I was curious about the &#x27;sea buckthorn&#x27; properties. It hasn&#x27;t made much difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this night cream!</li>
            <li> Sibu products are excellent for skin with problems, especially aging skin</li>
            <li> i like this one. it&#x27;s moisturizing. the smell… not so good… but it&#x27;s much better than the day cream. don&#x27;t waste your money on that one.</li>
            <li> I love most of Sibu products but this stuff is just sitting in my medicine cabinet.  I just don&#x27;t understand.  It doesn&#x27;t spread well and its almost dried out or something.  Weird.  I do like the other 2 glass bottles with the pumps on them but this night cream is difficult for me to use.  I will try to use it but I haven&#x27;t enjoyed the process or the consistency.

            <li> I use the Sibu Nourishing Moisturizer cream during the day a love it so much and decided to try the night cream! Love it as much! My skin was getting dry and these two products work awesome to keep it soft and silky! LOVE it!</li>
