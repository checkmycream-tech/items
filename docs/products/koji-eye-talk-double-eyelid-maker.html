            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Otherwise, excellent product! :)</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>The glue sticks good</li>
            <li>so I just purchased one that was more sticky and waterproof and it works great.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>i really love it!</li>
            <li>It makes me feel more confident and happy.</li>
            <li>bottle after use and I will continue to buy, it is a very, very easy to use glue.</li>
            <li>I used Koji before and it was much better at keeping the skin together</li>
            <li>I had three line eyelid for many years.  </li>
            <li>I used it for three weeks, and now I have perfect double  eyelid.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>make me more confident</li>
            <li>This product helps me feel better.</li>
            <li>I guess I will need to practice more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Should work on most ppl, just happened not to work on me</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It does take practice to perfect your double eyelids, but the results pay off.</li>
            <li>I did not used to be better than it.</li>
            <li>definitely better than eyelid tape because it doesnt hurt when you put on.</li>
            <li>I just need more practice.  </li>
            <li>So far so good though!</li>
            <li>It makes a perfect double eyelid and is fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be more comfortable than tape.</li>
            <li>As titled, follow the instruction, really easy to apply and let eyelid shape.</li>
            <li>make sure you clean your eyelid before using the koji ^^</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and nice package.</li>
            <li>My new favorite glue for sure.</li>
            <li>With careful layering of eyeshadow, you can hide the glue well and still achieve a beautiful look.</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle, she is very easy to use, I have been using it, it is my eyes become more and</li>
            <li>However, if I leave it on for more than 6 hours, my eyelid gets irritated, and stays irritated for a whole day.</li>
            <li>Many say it isn&#x27;t noticeable but it really bothers me.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>Got it really quick, came around the estimated time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a much better alternative to the physical strips because you can easily hide the fact your creating eyelids.</li>
            <li>and it dries, which fortunately happens fast</li>
            <li>After a few hour the lid come apart and my eyes get all stiki a gue.&lt;br /&gt;Not too happy with the pruduct.</li>
            <li>I tried several times but still cannot do it nicely.</li>
            <li>The price is really worth with the quality..</li>
            <li>It takes alot of time and work to get it right.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product because it is gentle with my sensitive skin but still does an effective job of creating the desired eyelids.  </li>
            <li>Good product but for my eyes when glue dries and you push up the eyelid, sometimes when looking down you can see the work you just did which made me feel that people can see what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>like this product very much..</li>
            <li>It´s a good product, cheap and easy to use, but it´s sometimes uncomfortable to wear</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used something like this.  </li>
            <li>To use this you need to let the glue get tacky first.</li>
            <li>Practice first.</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I asked for.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work well for me, but I think it was more human error than the product.  </li>
            <li>it lasts long for the most part for me.</li>
            <li>the stickiness is fine and I would have continued buying this product, but because its water soluble anything I did with water or sweat,or humidity it would look like a white strips on my eyelid and people would notice and it would embarrass me.</li>
            <li>I get ready for work and put it on at 2pm, go to work get off work and wash off by midnight</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really border how you put on your make up.</li>
            <li>The glue really works if you know what you are doing.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t buy this product again, but I really do like eyelid glue</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this too much does come with a price however.</li>
            <li>it really sticks.</li>
            <li>very well</li>
            <li>It works good and stays well, to remove put some water and take it out slowly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve could&#x27;ve used a glue for false eyelashes instead, which costs only $1 and is more effective.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s still too wet, but effective enough.</li>
            <li>I used it for 10 days and it kinda changed my eye fold to clear double-fold !</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well, especially if you&#x27;ve seen how to use it online.</li>
            <li>dries clear, no scent.</li>
            <li>old bc</li>
            <li>so do not waste</li>
            <li>The glue dries pretty quick for me and a little amount of it goes a long way!</li>
            <li>It is true that when you close your eyes you will see a slight mark of the dried glue, but this is true for any type of glue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it in public with make up and it looks natural and amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish it were cheaper since I only use this when my lids are uneven which happens rarely.</li>

            <li> I just wish it were cheaper since I only use this when my lids are uneven which happens rarely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the timing right, before it&#x27;s too dry</li>
            <li> After years of gluing my eyelids on a regular basis, I saw that my eyelids became stretched out and saggier.</li>
            <li> I had to learn when the glue was dry enough to poke my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;TIP: the two fork prongs are to locate the crease you want, the single prong at the end of the stick is for actually creating the crease after you apply the glue.</li>
            <li> One is tapered double lid and the other is parallel lid.</li>
            <li> I got this product a lot later than expected, but besides that, I recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> my eyelids were stretched out and irrated.  </li>
            <li> I still have not recover from the stretched eyelid, and it&#x27;s been a month.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used double eyelid glue for years, and I&#x27;ve tried every time of product out there, including the other lines by Koji.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, however, you do need to wait until it is completely dry before opening your eyes due to it sticking in the wrong places.</li>
            <li> It takes about a minute to dry.</li>
            <li> Anything you do with this product would have to be in a dry desert or something.</li>
            <li> but it kept sticking to the prongs and pulled my eyelid back down.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin around the eye.</li>
            <li> However it won&#x27;t last long, maybe less than half day.</li>
            <li> This one has the strongest staying power, and gives minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other brands ive tried.</li>
            <li> My eyes have very small eyelid, the Eye Talk makes my eyes look bigger</li>
            <li> I could never clean out the ends of the wands.</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelids.</li>
            <li> I tried using the product a few times, but by the time i got it to work somewhat</li>
            <li> I would caution against over using any type of product like this, because you will come to depend on it as your eyelids start to look worse and you constantly need to glue them.</li>
            <li> , it just started to stay few week ago</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it will stay forever</li>
            <li> , it is hard to notice that there is anything on our eyes.</li>
            <li> Single eyelids can be very frustrating to apply makeup, so this product can be a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a common allergy and the manufacture should try to find an alternative.</li>
            <li> May be I am just not good at it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll look worse than before!</li>
            <li> It smells weird after a while...</li>
            <li> If you are desperate buy this, if you are not, don´t do it.</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;ffff  :( :( :( :( :</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;i hate it</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed with this product!!</li>
            <li> worst eyelid glue</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it doesnt stick so well. And the product peels off after 2 hours and my skin is not even oil. I have very dry skin around the eye. I think the product is old bc I used Koji before and it was much better at keeping the skin together</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed with this product!! It worked for only 5 mins.....literally?! I&#x27;ve could&#x27;ve used a glue for false eyelashes instead, which costs only $1 and is more effective. And another thing, after mins of usage, your lids will create a foliage, meaning~ your lids will droop, and will glue itself shut! You&#x27;ll look worse than before! This product could&#x27;ve came with a WARNING!</li>
            <li> It works great! My eyes have very small eyelid, the Eye Talk makes my eyes look bigger and it dries, which fortunately happens fast, it is hard to notice that there is anything on our eyes. It makes me feel more confident and happy. I truly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I got this product a lot later than expected, but besides that, I recommend buying it. The glue dries pretty quick for me and a little amount of it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It´s a good product, cheap and easy to use, but it´s sometimes uncomfortable to wear and if you close your eyes someone can tell you have something in your eye lids. If you are desperate buy this, if you are not, don´t do it.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well, especially if you&#x27;ve seen how to use it online. However, if I leave it on for more than 6 hours, my eyelid gets irritated, and stays irritated for a whole day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the timing right, before it&#x27;s too dry or it&#x27;s still too wet, but effective enough. Good!</li>
            <li> I had three line eyelid for many years.  I used it for three weeks, and now I have perfect double  eyelid. Miracle happened!</li>
            <li> I use this one for almost 3 years. I LOVE IT. My eyes are nature and bigger. make me more confident</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, however, you do need to wait until it is completely dry before opening your eyes due to it sticking in the wrong places. It takes about a minute to dry. Other than that it works great. I do prefer the tape since it last longer.</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelids. One is tapered double lid and the other is parallel lid. Many say it isn&#x27;t noticeable but it really bothers me. This product helps me feel better. It lasts for several hours throughout the day but towards the end of the day I notice it becomes undone lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it lasts long for the most part for me. I need to use a tiny bit because I already have double lids.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my sister. It works good and stays well, to remove put some water and take it out slowly. I&#x27;ll purchase again. Fast shipping and nice package. Great price.</li>
            <li> worst eyelid glue i&#x27;ve ever use...................so do not waste you&#x27;re money&lt;br /&gt;: (&lt;br /&gt;ffff  :( :( :( :( :(&lt;br /&gt;i hate it</li>
            <li> I tried eyelid tape before I tried this product.  I really like this product because it is gentle with my sensitive skin but still does an effective job of creating the desired eyelids.  However, you still need to reapply and touch up throughout the day. Otherwise, excellent product! :)</li>
            <li> Good product but for my eyes when glue dries and you push up the eyelid, sometimes when looking down you can see the work you just did which made me feel that people can see what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used something like this.  There is a learning curve to this but it seems to be more comfortable than tape. To use this you need to let the glue get tacky first. I had to learn when the glue was dry enough to poke my eyelids.  I like the fact that with this you can put it where you want or need on your lids. Practice first.</li>
            <li> Lets just say i will never buy another brand. (Unless this one goes out of stock) My new favorite glue for sure. I get ready for work and put it on at 2pm, go to work get off work and wash off by midnight and i never have to re-apply any glue. Unlike the other brands ive tried.</li>
            <li> It accomplishes the claim of making double eyelids however, after a couple hours of using the product, the double eyelid seemed to go away. This may be because I have oily lids. I found that before using the product, you should remove oil from your eyelids to extend the use of the product.</li>
            <li> It smells weird after a while... I could never clean out the ends of the wands. So far so good though! I&#x27;m beginning to see a crease developing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER: it only works if you are applying it RELIGIOUSLY. I wear this ALL THE TIME. After I wash my face I immediately reapply. This is a much better alternative to the physical strips because you can easily hide the fact your creating eyelids. I&#x27;ve worn it in public with make up and it looks natural and amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: the two fork prongs are to locate the crease you want, the single prong at the end of the stick is for actually creating the crease after you apply the glue. Remember to only create the crease after the glue dries to a transparent color!</li>
            <li> love it! the last one froze in the winter so this one is amazing and great! ;D</li>
            <li> As titled, follow the instruction, really easy to apply and let eyelid shape. However it won&#x27;t last long, maybe less than half day. Doesn&#x27;t really border how you put on your make up.</li>
            <li> I did not get to try this product because once received the ingredients listed LATEX, to which I am allergic. This is a common allergy and the manufacture should try to find an alternative. If it worked, as water and flour do to seal an egg roll, I think I would prefer it to the tape.</li>
            <li> May be I am just not good at it. I tried several times but still cannot do it nicely. I guess I will need to practice more.</li>
            <li> i really love it! it was exactly what I asked for. Keep up the good work. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The product does work.  It takes alot of time and work to get it right.  I tried using the product a few times, but by the time i got it to work somewhat my eyelids were stretched out and irrated.  I still have not recover from the stretched eyelid, and it&#x27;s been a month.      The glue really works if you know what you are doing.</li>
            <li> the product is perfect!!! I used it for 10 days and it kinda changed my eye fold to clear double-fold !</li>
            <li> I tried it few times and it doesnt really works.&lt;br /&gt;the glue is not sticky after 15-20 mins everytime I applied.</li>
            <li> the stickiness is fine and I would have continued buying this product, but because its water soluble anything I did with water or sweat,or humidity it would look like a white strips on my eyelid and people would notice and it would embarrass me. Anything you do with this product would have to be in a dry desert or something. Throughout the day it doesn&#x27;t stay I would say after every 4 hours or so it would fade or the glue would turn white.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this product again, but I really do like eyelid glue so I just purchased one that was more sticky and waterproof and it works great. I would say if you wanted a practice or a starter eyelid glue you should buy this one.</li>
            <li> Got it really quick, came around the estimated time.&lt;br /&gt;Should work on most ppl, just happened not to work on me lol</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have oily eyelids, aka I sweat a lot, but I just carry this along and reapply as needed. It actually takes a lot to sweat it off. Water soluble so it rubs off after water.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me this product ! And it is awesome !&lt;br /&gt;I love it !!!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it next time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used double eyelid glue for years, and I&#x27;ve tried every time of product out there, including the other lines by Koji. This one has the strongest staying power, and gives minimal irritation. It does take practice to perfect your double eyelids, but the results pay off. I&#x27;ve used it for years without people noticing that I had something on my eyelid. It is true that when you close your eyes you will see a slight mark of the dried glue, but this is true for any type of glue. With careful layering of eyeshadow, you can hide the glue well and still achieve a beautiful look. Single eyelids can be very frustrating to apply makeup, so this product can be a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this too much does come with a price however. After years of gluing my eyelids on a regular basis, I saw that my eyelids became stretched out and saggier. I would caution against over using any type of product like this, because you will come to depend on it as your eyelids start to look worse and you constantly need to glue them.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle, she is very easy to use, I have been using it, it is my eyes become more and look.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle after use and I will continue to buy, it is a very, very easy to use glue. I did not used to be better than it.</li>
            <li> After a few hour the lid come apart and my eyes get all stiki a gue.&lt;br /&gt;Not too happy with the pruduct.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to. It makes a perfect double eyelid and is fairly cheap. Comes with poorly translated English directions, but it really came fast.</li>
            <li> definitely better than eyelid tape because it doesnt hurt when you put on. dries clear, no scent. I just wish it were cheaper since I only use this when my lids are uneven which happens rarely.</li>
            <li> The price is really worth with the quality..&lt;br /&gt;I like this product very much..it really sticks. very well and I can have an equal double eyelid now!&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you clean your eyelid before using the koji ^^</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me, but I think it was more human error than the product.  I just need more practice.  The glue sticks good but it kept sticking to the prongs and pulled my eyelid back down.</li>
            <li> The best thing I ever had</li>
            <li> I actually have an eyelid now because of this...but I&#x27;m not sure if it will stay forever, it just started to stay few week ago and I haven&#x27;t apply the glue ever since.</li>
