            <li>Nice pair of frames.</li>
            <li>These frames are nice looking and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Got them as a gift and the person was very pleased, the quality seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>comes with nice case and the frame was nice and light you can&#x27;t even feel them when they are on..</li>
            <li>love them.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;).</li>
            <li>It also enhances my face, it&#x27;s not too big, just a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  </li>
            <li>overall very impressed, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>but the glasses is ok.</li>
            <li>Love the color choices of these glass frames.</li>
            <li>these really don&#x27;t work for my face but excellent quality, very fast shipping, came in a nice strong case.</li>
            <li>so the plastic ear pieces were a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>they are well made, not flimsy or cheap.</li>
            <li>hope this helps, feel free to ask questions</li>
            <li>Over all they are worth it! ...</li>
            <li>not bad for the price</li>
            <li>(much too easy to just re-order a frame for the customer</li>
            <li>Worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>took them in immediately and had my prescription lenses put in, wearing them right now.</li>
            <li>Glasses were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>make sure if you are having prescription lenses put in that they adjust the bridge pieces so that you are looking out the middle of the lens</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re still paying more than anywhere else for the same item).  </li>
            <li>I Made a purchase of three different frames and these where my favorite, I however got them just for fashion</li>
            <li>I really like them!</li>
            <li>Good quality but bit small for me</li>
            <li>and they are really well made.</li>
            <li>For the price you cannot beat it and the seller included a nice hard case.</li>
            <li>and the hard case that comes with it is nice too.</li>
            <li>You can see in the image shown the words &amp;#34;JONES NEW YORK&amp;#34; is on the lens of the glasses.</li>
            <li>Very classy looking eyewear, arrived new and wrapped with all tags attached.</li>
            <li>I purchased as a fashion accessory and did not read deeply enough into the reviews to see that there were words printed on the clear plastic lens.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll wear them to job interviews to look a little more professional if you know what I mean</li>

            <li> I think I&#x27;ll wear them to job interviews to look a little more professional if you know what I mean</li>
            <li> A bit smaller than my other frames with the same measurements.</li>
            <li> The eyeglasses arrived scratched with a loose frame where the earpiece immediately fell apart.</li>
            <li> I thought they were a different style I bought from JC Penneys a few years ago</li>
            <li> You can use fingernail polish remover and get it off, just be careful because you can smear it and then need to polish the lens.  </li>
            <li> also i have a round face and the style makes my face look less wide thru the cheek.</li>
            <li> After getting my lenses put in these frames, they are thick due to my nearsightedness, these frames will not fold.  </li>
            <li> The glasses were a little small than what I could tell from the picture.</li>
            <li> beforehand otherwise your world will look all wonky.</li>
            <li> Only thing that was disappointing I was under the impression that a glass case came with glasses but no case..</li>
            <li> the plastic that comes with the frame was scratched, not to bad, but that is the only reason I am not giving the 5 stars..</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t even though the frames I bought at Penney&#x27;s were &amp;#34;Jones 135&amp;#34;, too -- sort of confusing if you ask me!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t find out about this until it was too late.</li>
            <li> Wrong style</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yep, I HATE Penney&#x27;s anymore!  </li>

            <li> Glasses were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Good quality but bit small for me</li>
            <li> The eyeglasses arrived scratched with a loose frame where the earpiece immediately fell apart. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> WAS THE SAME THING I WANT, THZ</li>
            <li> love them. took them in immediately and had my prescription lenses put in, wearing them right now. comfy and stylish, and for the price they are even more awesome. they are well made, not flimsy or cheap. i have a metal allergy so the plastic ear pieces were a huge bonus. also i have a round face and the style makes my face look less wide thru the cheek. make sure if you are having prescription lenses put in that they adjust the bridge pieces so that you are looking out the middle of the lens beforehand otherwise your world will look all wonky. hope this helps, feel free to ask questions and i&#x27;ll try to answer them if i see them pop up &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> Wrong style but I bought them so what can I do?  I thought they were a different style I bought from JC Penneys a few years ago (that of course they continue so when you break the frames you have no choice but to order not just another frame but the $500 bifocal plastic coated lenses to put in them (much too easy to just re-order a frame for the customer but this seems to be Penney&#x27;s &amp;#34;unethical way&amp;#34; -- Yep, I HATE Penney&#x27;s anymore!  Used to be one of the best department stores around; now they mark things up to give you a $10 off coupon so you&#x27;re still paying more than anywhere else for the same item).  Anyway, I thought I found the same frames (these that I ordered) but they weren&#x27;t even though the frames I bought at Penney&#x27;s were &amp;#34;Jones 135&amp;#34;, too -- sort of confusing if you ask me!  &amp;#34;Jones 135&amp;#34; should be &amp;#34;Jones 135&amp;#34;!  Oh well, they went in the garbage!</li>
            <li> I have never felt a more perfect fit in an eyeglasses before. It also enhances my face, it&#x27;s not too big, just a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  I will continue to shop at amazon.</li>
            <li> You can see in the image shown the words &amp;#34;JONES NEW YORK&amp;#34; is on the lens of the glasses. When I purchased these, I thought it would be a sticker I could peel off. Some glasses have a sticker on the lens. Wrong! It does NOT come off because it&#x27;s not a sticker! The words are printed on the glass. Now who would want to wear a pair of glasses that has words printed at the bottom? Nobody does!</li>
            <li> these really don&#x27;t work for my face but excellent quality, very fast shipping, came in a nice strong case. overall very impressed, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> not bad for the price</li>

            <li> Loved them but can&#x27;t wear cause logo doesn&#x27;t come off</li>
            <li> Bought these as prop glasses but the label is permanently etched into the lense. Booooooooo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stated that the item includes a case but it came without it....but the glasses is ok.</li>
            <li> Glasses very nice style and perfect for framing my face. Only thing that was disappointing I was under the impression that a glass case came with glasses but no case..</li>
            <li> Delivery was as promised, frame is great, I wish a case would have been included.</li>
            <li> These frames are nice looking and very comfortable.  I purchased as a fashion accessory and did not read deeply enough into the reviews to see that there were words printed on the clear plastic lens.  You can use fingernail polish remover and get it off, just be careful because you can smear it and then need to polish the lens.  I hope people will read this and see that you can indeed get the words off if you want to use them.</li>
            <li> Nice pair of frames. A bit smaller than my other frames with the same measurements. Love the color choices of these glass frames.</li>
            <li> Got them as a gift and the person was very pleased, the quality seems pretty good. Prompt in time and excellent packaging.</li>

            <li> I really like them! I got them to go with a Wenda costome for Halloween and they are really well made. I think I&#x27;ll wear them to job interviews to look a little more professional if you know what I mean, lol. Over all they are worth it! ...and the hard case that comes with it is nice too.</li>
