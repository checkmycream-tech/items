    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful, I always feel healthy when I wear this make-up.</li>
            <li>I was told by friends that Laura Geller&#x27;s cosmetics were great, but after trying this powdery baked blush/bronzer I can honestly say I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.      </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a great deal for sure.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to apply and helps with the discoloration in my skin.</li>
            <li>This gives me great coverage that is perfectly light.</li>
            <li>This product makes me look amazing because of the darker shade for contouring/sculpting..</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years ordering it from QVC and I have always been pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love this powder.  </li>
            <li>in my opinion her makeup is so much better</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>This gives me a light but not obvious healthy sun kissed glow that is just perfect for these winter blahs!</li>
            <li>I have use it for several years and it feels good on the skin and provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li>it changes everything!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my fast, &#x27;go-to&#x27; product to look good in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Had to return it, as it&#x27;s too light for me.  </li>
            <li>58 y.o. blonde, blue-eyed, fair skinned with tendency to freckle.</li>
            <li>Gives me just the right color.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>the color is not aggressive but you can add layers upon layers with out it becoming to heavy and get more coverage.</li>
            <li>love the medium of this and ordered initially for my fair daughter, but its too dark for her, but i decided to keep it for regular use for myself with medium skin</li>
            <li>then those mineral powders out there, this goes on very well</li>
            <li>You need to put some cream or primer on your face first so it lays down smoothly.</li>
            <li>Today I applied the base and concealer and they were very good, not oily at all.  </li>

            <li> Had to return it, as it&#x27;s too light for me.  It&#x27;s hard to tell, looking at colors on the internet. If I could have read the product description provided by the maker, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this color.</li>
            <li> I like the product but it came and wasn&#x27;t boxed so I threw it out. It looked as if it had been used.</li>
            <li> I was told by friends that Laura Geller&#x27;s cosmetics were great, but after trying this powdery baked blush/bronzer I can honestly say I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.      The color is ok, what bathers me is that everytime I apply it to my face, a lot of powder falls on my clothes, making it impossible for me to retouch on te car or in the office while sitting down, when it also falls on my pants!!!  I also bought the foundation, the concealer, and the 3-piece kit with the brush included.  Today I applied the base and concealer and they were very good, not oily at all.  But with the brush included in the kit, the powder fell everywhere, and I was wearing black!!! I had to change and I don&#x27;t see myself doing this every morning...  The brush is just too hard for the powdery baked products making it worse.</li>
            <li> This gives me great coverage that is perfectly light. It&#x27;s lasted a very long time so it&#x27;s a great deal for sure.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for many years ordering it from QVC and I have always been pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;This time however,  I wondered if the compacts I received were seconds or compacts that were flawed as they&lt;br /&gt; were mostly Balance and very little Bronze which should have been divided half and half. After spending over $60&lt;br /&gt; on them, I would not do this again.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to apply and helps with the discoloration in my skin.</li>
            <li> This gives me a light but not obvious healthy sun kissed glow that is just perfect for these winter blahs!</li>

            <li> This product makes me look amazing because of the darker shade for contouring/sculpting..it changes everything!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my fast, &#x27;go-to&#x27; product to look good in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Arrived with one third crushed.  Kept it cause I needed it NOW!</li>
            <li> I get this every few months.  Laura Geller products always impress me!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, I always feel healthy when I wear this make-up.</li>
            <li> in my opinion her makeup is so much better then those mineral powders out there, this goes on very well it covers my redness does not cover my pigment loss areas but then nothing I try does. the color is not aggressive but you can add layers upon layers with out it becoming to heavy and get more coverage. mine seems to last forever</li>
            <li> i am prone to makeup-acne. This product does not irritate my skin, at all. Wear it all day, 5 days a week. . love it</li>
            <li> When I received. It , it was broken and o&lt;br /&gt;Not useable.</li>
