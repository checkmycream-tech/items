    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Suave Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner with Cowabunga Coconut is great for kids!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add to that by mentioning that it&#x27;s especially good for senior citizens.  </li>
            <li>it smells so yummy and coconutty delicious!</li>
            <li>so I read all the reviews and decided to buy this shampoo and it works great!</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>The best part is the no tears if it gets in her eyes, which it always does.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner is fair at best, but I have yet to find a combined product that does a great job there.  </li>
            <li>I use it after swimming laps and it works great on removing chlorine from my hair.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great smelling (sort of beachy, sunscreen coconut).  </li>
            <li>this case, the 2 in 1 feature is great for anyone who deals with a child who hates to have his/her hair washed.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so great with hair that tends to be oily, as the conditioners seem to be a bit on the heavier side.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product and great, trusted name brand.  </li>
            <li>And great smell.</li>
            <li>Great price for a quality product.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really great about this too, is that it&#x27;s a shampoo and conditioner in</li>
            <li>Suave Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner in Cowabunga Coconut has a pleasant tropical floral scent.  </li>
            <li>coconut scent is pleasant and not overdone.</li>
            <li>Not too obnoxious or overpowering, pleasant and not too sugary as some kid&#x27;s shampoos can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this shampoo, I also loved it because they don&#x27;t have to condition</li>
            <li>The lather is good and it doesn&#x27;t hurt his eyes.  </li>
            <li>good product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It smells good and cleans her hair well.  </li>
            <li>I loved this combination shampoo and conditioner when I used it on my 3-year-old grandson&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a very nice smell, lathers up nicely, and seems to do a good job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>nice 2-1 product that cleans well and adds a bit to conditioning to help prevent</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is kind of like the Lifesaver coconut pieces.</li>
            <li>It works well in terms of cleaning, and we (parents) like it because the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>Very easy to brush / comb through hair after bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better than many odors I&#x27;ve smelled on them! -</li>
            <li>Smoothers\\&quot; kind works much better for detangling.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate his eyes, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>Good price, good product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>But, with these shampoos that have these fancy bottles and these great smells, they are willing to try it out a bit more.  </li>
            <li>It rinses very quickly off and his hair stays nice.  </li>
            <li>But even if it is not \\&quot;perfect\\&quot;, it is next to perfect, because it does get the hair clean, and the smell is good.  </li>
            <li>I have mostly used [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but you should make sure you and your family like the smell of coconut</li>
            <li>We tend to use kids shampoo and conditioner more in the summer after swimming to help with not having all kinds of salt in our hair before leaving the beach.  </li>
            <li>This product should work well for most people.  </li>
            <li>My kids love this shampoo, and I like the value.  </li>
            <li>This one lathers much better and rinses away easier.  </li>
            <li>I try to get her to use conditioner, but that&#x27;s one more step</li>
            <li>Her hair has been much more manageable ever since.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see this one do what it claims.</li>
            <li>Sweat will sting for sure.  </li>
            <li>This gentle shampoo works nice and smells really good.  </li>
            <li>, kids love it</li>
            <li>It works great on all hair typs, but the conditioner formula is surprisingly strong and even works great with children who have long hair or thick/curly.</li>
            <li>The scent  is definitely okay and not all that strong.  </li>
            <li>It has a coconut smell that is just a bit artifical but kids won&#x27;t know the difference and it did do a nice job at leaving our hair feeling clean and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>Nice product providing a good lather and general moisture.  </li>
            <li>This works great on fine hair&lt;br /&gt;does not seems to upset sensitive skin&lt;</li>
            <li>It leaves their hair perfectly clean, and they love the smell and characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the scent which is a nice, gentle coconut.</li>
            <li>So hey, this is a fine product for your kids but also for \\&quot;grandpa\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge deal.  </li>
            <li>With the oldest now being over 6, I just decided to upgrade her to this tear free &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Shampoos aren&#x27;t the most exciting products on earth to review, but it does help to know what you are buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is light coconut</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap for a reason...</li>
            <li>Suave is a leading brand of shampoo for a good reason, their products are basic, good and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Extra Shine, Orange-Mango Smoothie, 9-Fluid Ounce]] that we got talked into buying because they smelled soooooo good and looked soooo cute.  </li>
            <li>Happy with this shampoo as it leaves the kid&#x27;s hair pretty soft and easy to comb out.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not a fan of coconut, and this does smell strongly of coconut, it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not recommend as a one step process product to replace 2 products, but I would as a general good quality kids shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The product feels light and cool on the hair&lt;</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of different children&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner combinations but so far this is the best.</li>
            <li>of all, the price is right!</li>
            <li>I will be calling Suave Kids tomorrow for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>for the kids, they love the smell and it keeps them more interested in washing their hair than when we use \\&quot;boring\\&quot; normal shampoos.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner in it helps to be able to comb through tangled hair without too much fuss.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is good enough for mom and child to use.</li>
            <li>Great price and will buy and try some of the other scents.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is non-irritating to eyes and skin and the scent is mild and inoffensive as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really like the smell too, which makes using it more fun for them.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice light shampoo with a scent our entire family loves: Coconut!  </li>
            <li>Mild lather.</li>
            <li>This is good shampoo/conditioner, but it can leave hair dry.  </li>
            <li>It is a very gentle shampoo and my hair feels clean and bouncy.</li>
            <li>The Cowabunga Coconut fragrance has a fresh coconut smell</li>
            <li>Nice, simple product.  </li>
            <li>Which makes it great for little girls with fine and long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t expect a lot from Suave except that it clean your hair and scalp, rinse clean and not strip your hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li>In fact, we liked it a lot better than the more expensive [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Our kids like to use it on their hair better than similar all-in-one products that do hair and body.  </li>
            <li>It could also be that I got some diluted sweat in my eyes too since it was an unusually hot day</li>
            <li>The only issue we had is with our older daughter, whose hair is very fine.  </li>
            <li>It washes out clean without a residue and leaves the hair feeling soft</li>
            <li>If they are old enough to wash their own hair, chances are they won&#x27;t go squirting this in their eyes or</li>
            <li>so it would reasonably be assumed that it&#x27;s intended to be used by children old enough to shampoo their own hair</li>
            <li>particular shampoo is okay, having used it on myself to assess its initial performance.  </li>
            <li>This 2 in 1 Tear Free and actually conditions your child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>While split ends aren&#x27;t a concern yet, my son really likes this product and it promises to prevent split ends.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>We found that even with the two-in-one aspect of this product, her hair was still very tangled as compared to those times when we use a dedicated conditioner separate from the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>combination shampoo/conditioners don&#x27;t condition very well.  </li>
            <li>Cowabunga Coconut does all that and does it very well.  </li>
            <li>side note is that it was packaged very well, it was taped shut and in a plastic sealed bag and did not leak in shipping.  </li>
            <li>definitely buy this again and will look for other fragrances as scents make the whole experience more fun for him and for whoever is washing his hair!</li>
            <li>This makes even adult hair very easy to pick out when wet.</li>
            <li>The lack of many chemicals present in regular shampoo is a plus, and the fact that these \\&quot;kids\\&quot; products are less threatening to the eyes is a great big plus for us old folks.  </li>
            <li>Smells very pleasant, is tear-free (important for my young kids who hate getting water/shampoo in their eyes), and it really does prevent my daughter&#x27;s hair from being tangled.</li>
            <li>But mainly we like how it smells.</li>
            <li>For the price I think this will serve us well for that particular situtation.</li>
            <li>An excellent product, with the one caveat mentioned earlier, and you can&#x27;t go wrong at that price.</li>
            <li>The name is clever too.  </li>
            <li>It will keep your kids from crying in pain and it is good enough quality for you to use as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for \\&quot;kids\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but for a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner-it is a little drying.</li>
            <li>This smells good, but after trying numerous Suave products I&#x27;ve decided, no more.</li>
            <li>They keep coming out with new products, that have pretty much the same results.</li>
            <li>older ones may prefer an adult shampoo.</li>
            <li>Our 4 year old daughter has waist length hair and we have used the Suave 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner every night for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>shampoo lathers well enough and cleans their hair as much as it needs to be cleaned.  </li>
            <li>It cleans and rinses well and leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li>The fat cylindrical shape of the bottle is a bit of a challenge to hold even for full-size adult hands but requires two hands for a child to hold.  </li>
            <li>Since this product is clearly labeled as \\&quot;kids\\&quot;, then if an adult uses it, it might or ir might not be \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; for them.  </li>
            <li>so... you know the old saying: \\&quot;Praemonitus, Praemunitus:  or \\&quot;forewarned is forearmed\\&quot;.case</li>
            <li>so... you know the old saying: \\&quot;Praemonitus, Praemunitus:  or \\&quot;forewarned is forearmed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised to hear my husband say \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li>It even left my hair very manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, however the bottle is very large and has nothing to prevent it from slipping out of the user&#x27;s hands.  </li>
            <li>His hair has been less dry and isn&#x27;t frizzy at all :)</li>
            <li>Our kids did not really like the smell or texture of this product, but as long as we were helping them in the bathtub getting their hair washed before getting out, it works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Younger children will like the cute little monkey on the label but</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially at this price point!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Johnsons tear free shampoo for the past 6 years on my children.  </li>
            <li>I sure wish they had this stuff when I was a little girl, as I dreaded having my stepmother rip half my hair out when she combed it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, highly recommend for mom&#x27;s or dad&#x27;s with children who have hair that is fine and hard to comb when wet.</li>
            <li>Also, while I don&#x27;t particularly style his short hair, I notice that it stays in place from his initial wet combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it does indeed leave your hair a little dry, then I guess you just need to condition it a little more to make up for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not a good 2 in 1, I&#x27;ve used other products that are a 2 in 1 that work better than this.</li>

            <li> for the kids, they love the smell and it keeps them more interested in washing their hair than when we use \\&quot;boring\\&quot; normal shampoos.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner in it helps to be able to comb through tangled hair without too much fuss.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is good enough for mom and child to use.</li>
            <li> Great price and will buy and try some of the other scents.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is non-irritating to eyes and skin and the scent is mild and inoffensive as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really like the smell too, which makes using it more fun for them.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice light shampoo with a scent our entire family loves: Coconut!  </li>
            <li> Mild lather.</li>
            <li> This is good shampoo/conditioner, but it can leave hair dry.  </li>
            <li> It is a very gentle shampoo and my hair feels clean and bouncy.</li>
            <li> The Cowabunga Coconut fragrance has a fresh coconut smell</li>
            <li> Nice, simple product.  </li>
            <li> Which makes it great for little girls with fine and long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t expect a lot from Suave except that it clean your hair and scalp, rinse clean and not strip your hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> In fact, we liked it a lot better than the more expensive [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Our kids like to use it on their hair better than similar all-in-one products that do hair and body.  </li>
            <li> It could also be that I got some diluted sweat in my eyes too since it was an unusually hot day</li>
            <li> The only issue we had is with our older daughter, whose hair is very fine.  </li>
            <li> It washes out clean without a residue and leaves the hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> If they are old enough to wash their own hair, chances are they won&#x27;t go squirting this in their eyes or</li>
            <li> so it would reasonably be assumed that it&#x27;s intended to be used by children old enough to shampoo their own hair</li>
            <li> particular shampoo is okay, having used it on myself to assess its initial performance.  </li>
            <li> This 2 in 1 Tear Free and actually conditions your child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> While split ends aren&#x27;t a concern yet, my son really likes this product and it promises to prevent split ends.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> We found that even with the two-in-one aspect of this product, her hair was still very tangled as compared to those times when we use a dedicated conditioner separate from the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> combination shampoo/conditioners don&#x27;t condition very well.  </li>
            <li> Cowabunga Coconut does all that and does it very well.  </li>
            <li> side note is that it was packaged very well, it was taped shut and in a plastic sealed bag and did not leak in shipping.  </li>
            <li> definitely buy this again and will look for other fragrances as scents make the whole experience more fun for him and for whoever is washing his hair!</li>
            <li> This makes even adult hair very easy to pick out when wet.</li>
            <li> The lack of many chemicals present in regular shampoo is a plus, and the fact that these \\&quot;kids\\&quot; products are less threatening to the eyes is a great big plus for us old folks.  </li>
            <li> Smells very pleasant, is tear-free (important for my young kids who hate getting water/shampoo in their eyes), and it really does prevent my daughter&#x27;s hair from being tangled.</li>
            <li> But mainly we like how it smells.</li>
            <li> For the price I think this will serve us well for that particular situtation.</li>
            <li> An excellent product, with the one caveat mentioned earlier, and you can&#x27;t go wrong at that price.</li>
            <li> The name is clever too.  </li>
            <li> It will keep your kids from crying in pain and it is good enough quality for you to use as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for \\&quot;kids\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but for a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner-it is a little drying.</li>
            <li> This smells good, but after trying numerous Suave products I&#x27;ve decided, no more.</li>
            <li> They keep coming out with new products, that have pretty much the same results.</li>
            <li> older ones may prefer an adult shampoo.</li>
            <li> Our 4 year old daughter has waist length hair and we have used the Suave 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner every night for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> shampoo lathers well enough and cleans their hair as much as it needs to be cleaned.  </li>
            <li> It cleans and rinses well and leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li> The fat cylindrical shape of the bottle is a bit of a challenge to hold even for full-size adult hands but requires two hands for a child to hold.  </li>
            <li> Since this product is clearly labeled as \\&quot;kids\\&quot;, then if an adult uses it, it might or ir might not be \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; for them.  </li>
            <li> so... you know the old saying: \\&quot;Praemonitus, Praemunitus:  or \\&quot;forewarned is forearmed\\&quot;.case</li>
            <li> so... you know the old saying: \\&quot;Praemonitus, Praemunitus:  or \\&quot;forewarned is forearmed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised to hear my husband say \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li> It even left my hair very manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , however the bottle is very large and has nothing to prevent it from slipping out of the user&#x27;s hands.  </li>
            <li> His hair has been less dry and isn&#x27;t frizzy at all :)</li>
            <li> Our kids did not really like the smell or texture of this product, but as long as we were helping them in the bathtub getting their hair washed before getting out, it works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Younger children will like the cute little monkey on the label but</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially at this price point!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Johnsons tear free shampoo for the past 6 years on my children.  </li>
            <li> I sure wish they had this stuff when I was a little girl, as I dreaded having my stepmother rip half my hair out when she combed it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, highly recommend for mom&#x27;s or dad&#x27;s with children who have hair that is fine and hard to comb when wet.</li>
            <li> Also, while I don&#x27;t particularly style his short hair, I notice that it stays in place from his initial wet combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it does indeed leave your hair a little dry, then I guess you just need to condition it a little more to make up for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not a good 2 in 1, I&#x27;ve used other products that are a 2 in 1 that work better than this.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t have the same experience with our younger daughter whose hair is a little thicker, which makes me believe that only those with extra-fine hair will be affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s got long hair, but I&#x27;d bet that it wouldn&#x27;t cause tangles for girls with long hair, it feels that silky.  </li>
            <li> only tiny little complaint was that when I tried this out myself, I got some in my eyes and didn&#x27;t think much of it, assuming it wouldn&#x27;t sting since it was a kid&#x27;s shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since, she just loves her monkey shampoo!</li>
            <li> My child has really dry hair</li>
            <li> The product is also hypoallergenic and left his fairly thick hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> While the 2 in 1 is not essential because we put conditioner on their hair throughout the day, it&#x27;s makes combing a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also really like the scent since it does not go overboard and is not your usually kid scents.</li>
            <li> Sometimes we still have to use some conditioner with longer and harder to comb out hair...</li>
            <li> I actually used it and it didn&#x27;t turn my hair to straw like some heavily detergented kid&#x27;s shampoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ended up liking it even though there is not much of a coconut smell.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that when I use it for my daughter her hair is harder to comb out.</li>
            <li> For dry hair, I&#x27;d think it was an improvement over the average \\&quot;baby\\&quot; type shampoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used other Suave Kids 2 in 1 products, and this worked just as well as the others.</li>
            <li> the Suave kids is almost half the price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adding to the difficulty of keeping the bottle from slipping is the fact that, at 22.5 oz, it is relatively heavy compared to the usual 8 oz shampoo bottle size.</li>
            <li> My daughter - who usually insists on separate shampoo and conditioner - won&#x27;t use any other 2 in 1 product.</li>
            <li> , if the kids are too little to wash their hair themselves, you&#x27;re gonna keep this out of their eyes for them.  </li>
            <li> all three times -- started crying and saying their eyes were burning &amp; stinging.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is usually a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> No More Tears.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that it cost so much.</li>
            <li> at least mine haven&#x27;t done anything like that to date with any shampoo.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Tear Free&amp;#34; is COMPLETELY FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> Kids hate to get their face wet.</li>
            <li> Too expensive with Prime.</li>
            <li> So having to shampoo, rinse and then condition and rinse again can make for a difficult time in the bath or shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wrong.  </li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell, but for a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner-it is a little drying. I use it after swimming laps and it works great on removing chlorine from my hair.</li>
            <li> Happy with this shampoo as it leaves the kid&#x27;s hair pretty soft and easy to comb out. Sometimes we still have to use some conditioner with longer and harder to comb out hair...Has a great smell too.</li>
            <li> Works well with my girls! Does not sting their eyes, that I can tell.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!  I&#x27;ve been using Johnsons tear free shampoo for the past 6 years on my children.  With the oldest now being over 6, I just decided to upgrade her to this tear free &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; shampoo.  I used it three times this week on my children, and all three of my kids -- all three times -- started crying and saying their eyes were burning &amp; stinging.  I will be calling Suave Kids tomorrow for a full refund.  &amp;#34;Tear Free&amp;#34; is COMPLETELY FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> I have mostly used [[ASIN:B000MJ79R6 L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids 2-in-1 Shampoo for Extra Softness, Strawberry Smoothie, 9-Fluid Ounce]] the Suave kids is almost half the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see a difference in the results of changing shampoo except for saving $. Our 4 year old daughter has waist length hair and we have used the Suave 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner every night for 2 weeks. Her hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel any different, so we will be switching to Suave. I recommend you try this product and see if you could be saving $.</li>
            <li> Suave Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner with Cowabunga Coconut is great for kids! This 2 in 1 Tear Free and actually conditions your child&#x27;s hair. I have tried lots of different children&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner combinations but so far this is the best. It works great on all hair typs, but the conditioner formula is surprisingly strong and even works great with children who have long hair or thick/curly. This is a must have for parents!</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, we pull the three babies out of the pool and wash their hair poolside.  While the 2 in 1 is not essential because we put conditioner on their hair throughout the day, it&#x27;s makes combing a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo lathers well enough and cleans their hair as much as it needs to be cleaned.  But mainly we like how it smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already been pointed out that this product works just as well for adults and maybe has some benefits.  I&#x27;ll add to that by mentioning that it&#x27;s especially good for senior citizens.  The lack of many chemicals present in regular shampoo is a plus, and the fact that these \\&quot;kids\\&quot; products are less threatening to the eyes is a great big plus for us old folks.  The scent  is definitely okay and not all that strong.  So hey, this is a fine product for your kids but also for \\&quot;grandpa\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This works great on fine hair&lt;br /&gt;does not seems to upset sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;a nice 2-1 product that cleans well and adds a bit to conditioning to help prevent tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent as well</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used other Suave Kids 2 in 1 products, and this worked just as well as the others. My daughter - who usually insists on separate shampoo and conditioner - won&#x27;t use any other 2 in 1 product. The kids don&#x27;t mind it, but the smell is WOAH overpowering! The kids smell like they&#x27;ve poured coconut milk on their heads. I&#x27;m not complaining - it&#x27;s much better than many odors I&#x27;ve smelled on them! - but you should make sure you and your family like the smell of coconut A LOT before trying this.</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple of times now and so has hubby and we both like it.  It has a coconut smell that is just a bit artifical but kids won&#x27;t know the difference and it did do a nice job at leaving our hair feeling clean and tangle free.  We tend to use kids shampoo and conditioner more in the summer after swimming to help with not having all kinds of salt in our hair before leaving the beach.  And yes if you see two people foaming up their heads and pouring a gallon of water to rinse it out on the side of the street at the beach it could be us.  For the price I think this will serve us well for that particular situtation.</li>
            <li> Getting my kids to bathe is like trying to put a cat in water.  But, with these shampoos that have these fancy bottles and these great smells, they are willing to try it out a bit more.  With this shampoo, I also loved it because they don&#x27;t have to condition, it is all in one and no one cries when it gets in their eyes.</li>
            <li> While split ends aren&#x27;t a concern yet, my son really likes this product and it promises to prevent split ends.  It&#x27;s great smelling (sort of beachy, sunscreen coconut).  Because it&#x27;s 2 in 1, it saves me a step when washing his hair.  I actually used it and it didn&#x27;t turn my hair to straw like some heavily detergented kid&#x27;s shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t tell, but he actually uses this as a body wash too, I figure it can&#x27;t hurt.  The lather is good and it doesn&#x27;t hurt his eyes.  It rinses very quickly off and his hair stays nice.  It&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s got long hair, but I&#x27;d bet that it wouldn&#x27;t cause tangles for girls with long hair, it feels that silky.  Also, while I don&#x27;t particularly style his short hair, I notice that it stays in place from his initial wet combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, the price is right!</li>
            <li> Suave Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner in Cowabunga Coconut has a pleasant tropical floral scent.  It cleans and rinses well and leaves hair soft.  This shampoo is non-irritating to eyes and skin and the scent is mild and inoffensive as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Younger children will like the cute little monkey on the label but older ones may prefer an adult shampoo.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this shampoo/conditioner because of the coconut smell. Ended up liking it even though there is not much of a coconut smell. It is a very gentle shampoo and my hair feels clean and bouncy. Great price and will buy and try some of the other scents.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this, picked it up for her hair and I&#x27;m tempted to steal it for mine it smells so yummy and coconutty delicious! She hates washing her hair, what kid doesn&#x27;t? But when this came in she was eager to take a bath that same night to try it out and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since, she just loves her monkey shampoo! And that simply isn&#x27;t like my Ella, she loves baths, for playing, but hates washing her hair! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Shampoos aren&#x27;t the most exciting products on earth to review, but it does help to know what you are buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, the 2 in 1 feature is great for anyone who deals with a child who hates to have his/her hair washed.  It is quicker and minimizes the amount of  parental trauma the rinsing process delivers when the shampoo &amp; conditioner are combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular shampoo is okay, having used it on myself to assess its initial performance.  It isn&#x27;t so great with hair that tends to be oily, as the conditioners seem to be a bit on the heavier side.  For dry hair, I&#x27;d think it was an improvement over the average \\&quot;baby\\&quot; type shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coconut scent is pleasant and not overdone.</li>
            <li> Nice product providing a good lather and general moisture.  Conditioner is fair at best, but I have yet to find a combined product that does a great job there.  I would not recommend as a one step process product to replace 2 products, but I would as a general good quality kids shampoo.  I also really like the scent since it does not go overboard and is not your usually kid scents.</li>
            <li> Too expensive with Prime. Disappointed that it cost so much.</li>
            <li> My child has really dry hair so I read all the reviews and decided to buy this shampoo and it works great! His hair has been less dry and isn&#x27;t frizzy at all :)</li>
            <li> This product should work well for most people.  The shampoo has a very nice smell, lathers up nicely, and seems to do a good job of cleaning.  The only issue we had is with our older daughter, whose hair is very fine.  We found that even with the two-in-one aspect of this product, her hair was still very tangled as compared to those times when we use a dedicated conditioner separate from the shampoo.  We didn&#x27;t have the same experience with our younger daughter whose hair is a little thicker, which makes me believe that only those with extra-fine hair will be affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the kids, they love the smell and it keeps them more interested in washing their hair than when we use \\&quot;boring\\&quot; normal shampoos.  To me, that counts for a lot.  An excellent product, with the one caveat mentioned earlier, and you can&#x27;t go wrong at that price.</li>
            <li> Suave is a leading brand of shampoo for a good reason, their products are basic, good and reasonably priced.  The Suave Kids 2-in-1 Shampoo Smoother is no exception.  Here&#x27;s what I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Cowabunga Coconut fragrance has a fresh coconut smell&lt;br /&gt;2. The product feels light and cool on the hair&lt;br /&gt;3. It washes out clean without a residue and leaves the hair feeling soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only area in which Suave missed the mark is in the bottle design.  The product is not marketed as a baby shampoo so it would reasonably be assumed that it&#x27;s intended to be used by children old enough to shampoo their own hair, however the bottle is very large and has nothing to prevent it from slipping out of the user&#x27;s hands.  The fat cylindrical shape of the bottle is a bit of a challenge to hold even for full-size adult hands but requires two hands for a child to hold.  Adding to the difficulty of keeping the bottle from slipping is the fact that, at 22.5 oz, it is relatively heavy compared to the usual 8 oz shampoo bottle size.</li>
            <li> Suave Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner Cowabunga Coconut.  This is good shampoo/conditioner, but it can leave hair dry.  But I will not deduct a star for that, because it probably depends on the type of hair you have.  Since this product is clearly labeled as \\&quot;kids\\&quot;, then if an adult uses it, it might or ir might not be \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; for them.  But even if it is not \\&quot;perfect\\&quot;, it is next to perfect, because it does get the hair clean, and the smell is good.  If it does indeed leave your hair a little dry, then I guess you just need to condition it a little more to make up for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for kids&#x27; hair, it is \\&quot;perfect\\&quot;.  Highly recommended for \\&quot;kids\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great, trusted name brand.  And great smell.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it. Kids hate to get their face wet. So having to shampoo, rinse and then condition and rinse again can make for a difficult time in the bath or shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like having the shampoo and conditioner in one and while it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as using two products, overall, it does make life easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is kind of like the Lifesaver coconut pieces. Not too obnoxious or overpowering, pleasant and not too sugary as some kid&#x27;s shampoos can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My kids love this shampoo, and I like the value.  It leaves their hair perfectly clean, and they love the smell and characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The kids like this because it doesn&#x27;t hurt their eyes. It works well in terms of cleaning, and we (parents) like it because the smell is nice. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Nice, simple product.  Our kids like to use it on their hair better than similar all-in-one products that do hair and body.  This one lathers much better and rinses away easier.  They really like the smell too, which makes using it more fun for them.  Highly recommended, especially at this price point!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Smells very pleasant, is tear-free (important for my young kids who hate getting water/shampoo in their eyes), and it really does prevent my daughter&#x27;s hair from being tangled. I have used Suave&#x27;s regular shampoo (which I like alright, especially for my son) but I have noticed that when I use it for my daughter her hair is harder to comb out. This \\&quot;Shampoo Smoothers\\&quot; kind works much better for detangling. Good price, good product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My daughter is one of those kids who just doesn&#x27;t like to shower, brush her teeth, or wash her hair.  Her hair is usually a tangled mess.  I try to get her to use conditioner, but that&#x27;s one more step and I don&#x27;t think she does it.  The fact that her hair comes out of the shower all tangled tells me that.  So, I&#x27;ve been having her use this Suave Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner.  Her hair has been much more manageable ever since.  She says she likes the smell.  Although I&#x27;m not a fan of coconut, and this does smell strongly of coconut, it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most combination shampoo/conditioners don&#x27;t condition very well.  I&#x27;m glad to see this one do what it claims.</li>
            <li> My daughter is beyond J&amp;J No More Tears.  I was looking for the next step up that wouldn&#x27;t burn her eyes.  This is it!  It smells good and cleans her hair well.  The best part is the no tears if it gets in her eyes, which it always does.  This will be a staple in my closet, trust me.</li>
            <li> I loved this combination shampoo and conditioner when I used it on my 3-year-old grandson&#x27;s hair. The smell is light coconut and the product is creamy and lathers well. It didn&#x27;t irritate his eyes, which is very important to me. The product is also hypoallergenic and left his fairly thick hair soft and shiny. The size and value for the money are two things my family looks for when purchasing a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy this again and will look for other fragrances as scents make the whole experience more fun for him and for whoever is washing his hair!</li>
            <li> This is a nice light shampoo with a scent our entire family loves: Coconut!  The name is clever too.  We don&#x27;t expect a lot from Suave except that it clean your hair and scalp, rinse clean and not strip your hair of its natural oils. Cowabunga Coconut does all that and does it very well.  In fact, we liked it a lot better than the more expensive [[ASIN:B000MJ79R6 L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids 2-in-1 Shampoo for Extra Softness, Strawberry Smoothie, 9-Fluid Ounce]] and the[[ASIN:B000VOENEE L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids 2-in-1 Shampoo for Extra Shine, Orange-Mango Smoothie, 9-Fluid Ounce]] that we got talked into buying because they smelled soooooo good and looked soooo cute.  Suave has some comparable \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; as the kids call them, so we might try those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only tiny little complaint was that when I tried this out myself, I got some in my eyes and didn&#x27;t think much of it, assuming it wouldn&#x27;t sting since it was a kid&#x27;s shampoo.  I wrong.  It hurt,  but only for the moment it took for me to put my face under the shower and then pat the suds away from my eyes. It does say it&#x27;s \\&quot;Tear Free\\&quot; on the bottle as well as hypoallergenic and detangling.  We didn&#x27;t need extra detnagler spray and none of the kids say it got in their eyes or that it hurt them in any way. Maybe I&#x27;m just a klutz in the shower?  It could also be that I got some diluted sweat in my eyes too since it was an unusually hot day and I had been cleaning out the garage.  Sweat will sting for sure.  The bottle says it&#x27;s tear-free but I just want parents to know it stung my eyes.  However, it&#x27;s really not as big a deal as it sounds as I&#x27;m writing this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I figure, if the kids are too little to wash their hair themselves, you&#x27;re gonna keep this out of their eyes for them.  If they are old enough to wash their own hair, chances are they won&#x27;t go squirting this in their eyes or at least mine haven&#x27;t done anything like that to date with any shampoo. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge deal.  I only mentioned it in case you DO have a kid who squirts shampoo in their face.  This comes in a 22.5 Ounce squeeze bottle and I&#x27;ve seen one of mine using it to make bubble bath so... you know the old saying: \\&quot;Praemonitus, Praemunitus:  or \\&quot;forewarned is forearmed\\&quot;.case you DO have a kid who squirts shampoo in their face.  This comes in a 22.5 Ounce squeeze bottle and I&#x27;ve seen one of mine using it to make bubble bath so... you know the old saying: \\&quot;Praemonitus, Praemunitus:  or \\&quot;forewarned is forearmed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This gentle shampoo works nice and smells really good.  The conditioner in it helps to be able to comb through tangled hair without too much fuss.  Great price for a quality product.</li>
            <li> This smells good, but after trying numerous Suave products I&#x27;ve decided, no more. I tried Suave years ago, I didn&#x27;t like it then and I don&#x27;t like it now. They keep coming out with new products, that have pretty much the same results. This is not a good 2 in 1, I&#x27;ve used other products that are a 2 in 1 that work better than this. It&#x27;s cheap for a reason...</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Smells yummy, kids love it and I was surprised to hear my husband say \\&quot;oh you smell good!\\&quot; to our toddler when she was playing with him after her bath.&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to brush / comb through hair after bath.&lt;br /&gt;- My toddler&#x27;s curls looked great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hair looks oily / unclean after two days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note is that it was packaged very well, it was taped shut and in a plastic sealed bag and did not leak in shipping.  Mild lather.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good enough for mom and child to use. I love the scent which is a nice, gentle coconut. What&#x27;s really great about this too, is that it&#x27;s a shampoo and conditioner in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also TEAR-FREE! Which makes it great for little girls with fine and long hair that tangles easily. I sure wish they had this stuff when I was a little girl, as I dreaded having my stepmother rip half my hair out when she combed it. This makes even adult hair very easy to pick out when wet. It even left my hair very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommend for mom&#x27;s or dad&#x27;s with children who have hair that is fine and hard to comb when wet. It will keep your kids from crying in pain and it is good enough quality for you to use as well.</li>
            <li> Our kids did not really like the smell or texture of this product, but as long as we were helping them in the bathtub getting their hair washed before getting out, it works fine.</li>
