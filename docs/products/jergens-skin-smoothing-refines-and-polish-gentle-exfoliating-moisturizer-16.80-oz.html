            <li>Best feeling lotion!</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion, recommend it for all.</li>
            <li>I am happy</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I think as with any scent or perfume it is going to depend on your body chemistry as to whether or not it smells good on you.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this product based on picture and title - it was supposed to be the Skin Smoothing CELLULAR RENEWAL formula I loved with the beads and nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>So glad this is one I can keep!</li>
            <li>On those off days, you can use your favorite smell good lotion or cream.</li>
            <li>The scent in nice and neutral, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I rather like the scent, but it is very strong and lingers...</li>
            <li>I use this lotion in conjuction with a natural bristle brush and coconut oil for excellent results.</li>
            <li>not sure why, so I was very happy to see it offered via Amazon and at a great price point.</li>
            <li>It was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and so does my husband.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion, have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>I moisturized fairly ok.....</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing it on a dermatologist&#x27;s &#x27;favorite picks&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I love it and love the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t returned item because it would cost more to ship than purchase price.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me moisturized all day, with a very light fragrance that isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin and it felt great after I applied it.</li>
            <li>So before you order, make very sure its the right formula for you.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients from the original have changed and not for the better.  </li>
            <li>, can&#x27;t find it in stores, but that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>this lotion sloffs off the dead skin and does a wonderful job moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried this since I was looking for something to smooth my skin (ie the name of the product).....</li>
            <li>That formula is nice smelling and works very well with dry/rough skin.</li>
            <li>It was no longer available in stores</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great low-level exfoliating lotion for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion, and it makes my old face look better.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and it really does make your skin softer/smoother with one use.</li>
            <li>I have loved this lotion for a very long time.</li>
            <li>After 10 to 15 minutes it completely dries, and is not sticky at all, which I LOVE.  </li>
            <li>Jergens - the manufacturer - heard loudly and clearly from the people who didn&#x27;t like the beads, and now they&#x27;re hearing from those of us who loved the beads. \\&quot;Jergens\\</li>
            <li>Most lotions, whether off the shelf or prescription, sit on top of your skin; Jergens Skin Smoothing Gentle Exfoliating Moisturizer actually penetrates the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful hand/skin lotion for those who have rough dry skin but don&#x27;t want an oily feeling or coating.  </li>
            <li>and i normally use Jergens original scent</li>
            <li>like I do, this lotion will make your skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>But they smash easily enough so they&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li>I was assured by Amazon customer service this item was exactly as pictured, so I enthusiastically ordered 3 bottles.</li>
            <li>This lotion really works well for our family!</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as the original Jergens.. maybe its just me..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with feeling tacky afterward; perhaps because my skins is more on the dry side.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my skin super baby soft.</li>
            <li>After seeing the picture of the product, I contacted Amazon prior to ordering and specifically asked whether this was the original formula with exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li>I have used prescription hand creams for my eczema but nothing works as well as this particular Jergens product.  </li>
            <li>You do have to consistently use it in the beginning, but once you get your skin smooth, everyday use is not required.</li>
            <li>I received the product in the new bottle, not the one that is pictured here.  </li>
            <li>Helped clear up my keratosis pilaris!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Jergens Skin Smoothing lotion for the past 2 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>If you have the fine, little bumps on your skin</li>
            <li>The smell on this lotion could be better, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it could have a more fragrant smell.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing out my whole bottle after only using it twice I think.</li>
            <li>No different than any other lotion that I use, I thought the beads would really smooth my skin out and exfoliate it but</li>
            <li>I have mild eczema on the palms on my hands as well as very, very dry skin over my entire body.  </li>
            <li>Overall, my favorite lotion by far and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Unlike the previous reviewer, I find that this lotion does make my skin smooth after it is absorbed, with only a slightly tacky/sticky feeling left behind, mostly on my hands.     </li>
            <li>It gives you very soft skin with everyday use, like really soft!</li>
            <li>It turned my skin kind of dark and unhealthy looking</li>
    </ol>

            <li> not so much, same amount of roughage as before, will use it until it&#x27;s gone but not purchase anymore.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand it, and it radiates off of you LONG after you slather this on.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and</li>
            <li> I do not care for the new formula - the scent is not nice.  </li>
            <li> Even if your skin isn&#x27;t scaly and dry!</li>
            <li> The main trouble is the weird blue liquid-filled beads that pop while you apply the lotion and leave tiny trails of blue until you rub it all in.</li>
            <li> My Favorite Lotion to combat dry skin during the harsh cold winter months.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel luxurious and silky, and even sinks in after I put on sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I spent the next few weeks haunting every pharmacy and variety store looking for the cream.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand to have my hands or arms sticky or tacky to the touch, like some other lotions can do.  </li>
            <li> Instead I received the wrong formula - Skin Smoothing Gentle exfoliating moisture.  </li>
            <li> I had previously contacted the manufacturer and learned they had reformulated the product and discontinued the version with beads, but also learned there might still be some bottles for sale at outlet stores.</li>
            <li> plus the little beads in the lotion were unnerving.</li>
            <li> Everyday I just shake the bottle up and start pumping and applying.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is very hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> (unfortunately, there were only 3).  </li>
            <li> I think the cellular renewal formula may be discontinued - not sure.</li>
            <li> The beads don&#x27;t make your skin blue, but I would hate to put this on while dressed and potentially stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> Some people may not care about the \\&quot;scent\\&quot; of a product, but this moisturizer formula has a very heavy perfume smell that is NOT pleasant and it smells for awhile after you put it on.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find in local drugstores --</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that Jergens has decided to discontinue this product, so I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this online.  </li>
            <li> and when I recently ran out, I tried something else for awhile and was aghast at how awful my skin became.  </li>
            <li> It is my base which I add Lactic acid to.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with purchase.</li>
            <li> The lotion I received has a horrible odor</li>

            <li> No different than any other lotion that I use, I thought the beads would really smooth my skin out and exfoliate it but not so much, same amount of roughage as before, will use it until it&#x27;s gone but not purchase anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Have to buy it online now, can&#x27;t find it in stores, but that&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s a great low-level exfoliating lotion for my dry skin.  Took care of the tiny dry-skin bumps that used to plague me.  Definitely recommend if you have the same.</li>
            <li> When I received a sample of the Jergens Skin Smoothing Cellular Renewal Moisturizer I threw it in my desk drawer and forgot all about it.  About a month later, I came across it and decided to give it a try.      WHO KNEW???  It was fantastic!  I spent the next few weeks haunting every pharmacy and variety store looking for the cream.  No one had it.  I finally found it and bought every bottle on the shelf (unfortunately, there were only 3).  My co-workers have tried it and they too are hooked.  My only complaint is that it is very hard to find in stores.  I now am ordering it online.    It&#x27;s definitely a winner!</li>
            <li> I have loved this lotion for a very long time. It is the only lotion in this price range that smoothes skin like it says it does! If you have the fine, little bumps on your skin like I do, this lotion will make your skin so smooth and soft. You do have to consistently use it in the beginning, but once you get your skin smooth, everyday use is not required. On those off days, you can use your favorite smell good lotion or cream. The smell on this lotion could be better, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it could have a more fragrant smell. Overall, my favorite lotion by far and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It keeps me moisturized all day, with a very light fragrance that isn&#x27;t too strong.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that Jergens has decided to discontinue this product, so I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this online.  If anyone knows of another lotion that is comparable, please let me know!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it really does make your skin softer/smoother with one use. Even if your skin isn&#x27;t scaly and dry! I have normal skin and it felt great after I applied it. True indeed the little \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot; balls will creep you out but only because you usually find those things in a body wash. But they smash easily enough so they&#x27;re OK. Whatever it is, it works. This will be my regular lotion from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens Skin Smoothing lotion for the past 2 years and love it.  I have extremely dry skin and this lotion sloffs off the dead skin and does a wonderful job moisturizing my skin.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with feeling tacky afterward; perhaps because my skins is more on the dry side.  I love the scent and so does my husband.  I think as with any scent or perfume it is going to depend on your body chemistry as to whether or not it smells good on you.  I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, have been using it for years.  It exfoliates without any burning or redness.  It dries in about 5 minutes, so can cover it with clothing at it won&#x27;t come off on the clothes.  After 10 to 15 minutes it completely dries, and is not sticky at all, which I LOVE.  I can&#x27;t stand to have my hands or arms sticky or tacky to the touch, like some other lotions can do.  This is a great lotion, recommend it for all.</li>
            <li> I tried this since I was looking for something to smooth my skin (ie the name of the product)..... it shot, and missed.....    I moisturized fairly ok..... but it left my skin tacky tacky tacky....    plus the little beads in the lotion were unnerving. If I want something to TRULY exfoliate, I want it in my body wash.... not my lotion.    The smell was horrid. I couldn&#x27;t stand it, and it radiates off of you LONG after you slather this on. I ended up throwing out my whole bottle after only using it twice I think. I&#x27;ll stick with Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous reviewer, I find that this lotion does make my skin smooth after it is absorbed, with only a slightly tacky/sticky feeling left behind, mostly on my hands.     I rather like the scent, but it is very strong and lingers... it&#x27;s floral, maybe like lilac?     The main trouble is the weird blue liquid-filled beads that pop while you apply the lotion and leave tiny trails of blue until you rub it all in. And, hopefully you rub them all in... I&#x27;ve found some stray un-popped beads after applying. The beads don&#x27;t make your skin blue, but I would hate to put this on while dressed and potentially stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> When am I going to get this product ???  This is the only item that has not shipped !!! Is this item on back order or what ?? Tell me something ........</li>
            <li> Best feeling lotion! It gives you very soft skin with everyday use, like really soft!</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only thing that works on my dry skin.  It must be the exfoliating component. I&#x27;ve used it for years and when I recently ran out, I tried something else for awhile and was aghast at how awful my skin became.  I switched back and within 2 weeks I had my skin back.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if this lotion is discontinued?  I cannot find it in the stores anymore.  I love this lotion, and it makes my old face look better.  Yes, I know it is not a face lotion, but I like it on my face.  I am happy I found it on Amazon and bought 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> After seeing the picture of the product, I contacted Amazon prior to ordering and specifically asked whether this was the original formula with exfoliating beads. I had previously contacted the manufacturer and learned they had reformulated the product and discontinued the version with beads, but also learned there might still be some bottles for sale at outlet stores. I was assured by Amazon customer service this item was exactly as pictured, so I enthusiastically ordered 3 bottles. What I received was the reformulated version without the beads and they can&#x27;t be returned. I also learned from the product&#x27;s maker that even though the Amazon seller is listed as \\&quot;Jergens\\&quot;, it is NOT the manufacturer. Jergens - the manufacturer - heard loudly and clearly from the people who didn&#x27;t like the beads, and now they&#x27;re hearing from those of us who loved the beads. \\&quot;Jergens\\&quot; - the seller- all I can say is, \\&quot;Shame on you.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on the palms on my hands as well as very, very dry skin over my entire body.  I have used prescription hand creams for my eczema but nothing works as well as this particular Jergens product.  Most lotions, whether off the shelf or prescription, sit on top of your skin; Jergens Skin Smoothing Gentle Exfoliating Moisturizer actually penetrates the skin.  It is very difficult to find in local drugstores -- not sure why, so I was very happy to see it offered via Amazon and at a great price point.</li>
            <li> I received the product in the new bottle, not the one that is pictured here.  The bottle says, &amp;#34;NOW Even Better!&amp;#34;, however the ingredients listed on the back appear to be identical.  The only difference I noticed was that the new formula does not have the small blue grains that the old formula had.</li>
            <li> Helped clear up my keratosis pilaris! I use this lotion in conjuction with a natural bristle brush and coconut oil for excellent results. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product based on picture and title - it was supposed to be the Skin Smoothing CELLULAR RENEWAL formula I loved with the beads and nice scent.  Instead I received the wrong formula - Skin Smoothing Gentle exfoliating moisture.  I do not care for the new formula - the scent is not nice.  So before you order, make very sure its the right formula for you.  I think the cellular renewal formula may be discontinued - not sure. Some people may not care about the \\&quot;scent\\&quot; of a product, but this moisturizer formula has a very heavy perfume smell that is NOT pleasant and it smells for awhile after you put it on.  I would not buy it but I still recommend the Cellular Renewal formula IF you can get it.  That formula is nice smelling and works very well with dry/rough skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and i normally use Jergens original scent so when I got this I thought it would be an upgrade but it wasn&#x27;t.. It turned my skin kind of dark and unhealthy looking and it didn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as the original Jergens.. maybe its just me.. but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing it on a dermatologist&#x27;s &#x27;favorite picks&#x27;. So glad this is one I can keep! I love it and love the smell. It makes my skin feel luxurious and silky, and even sinks in after I put on sunscreen. Scent can linger for anyone with sensitivity or preferences against scents.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a body exfoliant. It is my base which I add Lactic acid to. I drop 8 teaspoons of 88% lactic acid into the bottle and the fusion of both products work like a charm. Everyday I just shake the bottle up and start pumping and applying. This leaves my skin super baby soft.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hand/skin lotion for those who have rough dry skin but don&#x27;t want an oily feeling or coating.  The scent in nice and neutral, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> My Favorite Lotion to combat dry skin during the harsh cold winter months. This lotion really works well for our family!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  It was no longer available in stores so I was happy to find it on Amazon.  The ingredients from the original have changed and not for the better.  The lotion I received has a horrible odor and I will not use it.  Haven&#x27;t returned item because it would cost more to ship than purchase price.  Very disappointed with purchase.</li>
