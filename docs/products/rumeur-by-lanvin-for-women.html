            <li>I love the perfume.</li>
            <li>Excellent &amp; bigger than my 1st bottle!</li>
            <li>Its now my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>i just love it</li>
            <li>, I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>If you like that then you will love it, but not for me.</li>
            <li>So happy I have a new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>that citrusi sweet smell kind of match me</li>
            <li>one she trully loved was Bal a Versailles, but that one is a bit too intense for my nose</li>
            <li>This was not as strong as Eau de Parfum I bought at a store.</li>
            <li>It is not to my liking because it&#x27;s not as strong as I thought it would be</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and clean, the scent is amazing</li>
            <li>Right away I loved the way the fragrance blended with my own natural chemistry.  </li>
            <li>But once the smell settles its so pleasant, floral, and classy.</li>
            <li>The smell its not like the original and smell like a cheap soap</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love the fragrance, but the last three bottles I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.com had faulty atomizers.</li>
            <li>and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>My husband is a huge fan of the Lanvin for Men fragrance and it works very well with his body chemistry; he gets many compliments.</li>
            <li>Clean fragrance that lasts &amp; is not overly sweet or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>They are all the real thing at a fraction of Dept. Stores prices;I recommended the perfumes to many of my friends and acquintances.</li>
            <li>The scent is good, too, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It has no staying power like a a true perfume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is sweet and woodsy.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>Sexy, mysterious, sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more bottles just to have because this will be my new scent.</li>
            <li>It will be my new favorite perfume for a while.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, not easy to find, very satisfied with delivery and price.</li>
            <li>It smells like a more sophisticated version of White Musk (a perfume I wore in high school).</li>
            <li>highly recommand this product if you are looking for fresh sweet citrus note.</li>
            <li>The first I thought was damaged in shipping.</li>
            <li>First time I ever bought this</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very different than many scents I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>I love this product and this is my fourth time ordering it.</li>
            <li>I also received so many compliments and a lady actually followed me in the grocery store to ask what fragrance I was wearing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not fond of the other newer scent Rose</li>
            <li>But at such a reasonable price, I am still satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sofisticated scent and the bottle is pretty  </li>
            <li>The Lanvin woman sprayed me as I rushed past her, &amp; I stopped because I really loved the scent.</li>
            <li>so much I just suffered with the dripping.</li>
            <li>yet it had a much stronger smell and staying power.</li>
            <li>She said it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not the same as  the original fragrance</li>
            <li>I quickly asked for some info such as the name of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I took a risk in ordering it blindly, but so far, everyone loved this scent!</li>
            <li>Great price for a expensive fragrance smell.</li>
            <li>Light, not heavy &amp; over bearing &amp; lasts fairly long throughout the day</li>
            <li>the spray did not work initially and the finishing around the cap/ribbon is pretty</li>
            <li>Smells really unique and last for long time(I</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find this offered.</li>
            <li>My other favorite perfumes are Black Orchid by Tom Ford and For Her by Narciso Rodriguez-</li>
            <li>An adoring present for my younger sister.</li>
            <li>I have use rumeur for several years but this particular brand I received from your company is not the actual product.  </li>
            <li>I crossed my fingers while opening the package and even though the cardboard box it was shipped in was crushed in transport, the actual perfume box was undamaged thanks to lots of paper padding.</li>
            <li>Sorta smells like hairspray at first, but once it drys down OMFG!</li>

            <li> Sorta smells like hairspray at first, but once it drys down OMFG!</li>
            <li> I was tired of my old perfumes and needed something new, something that was gonna make me say WOW  </li>
            <li> Sticky glue around the cap&#x27;s top was messy to say the least and the perfume leaked all over my dresser drawer and ruined it!</li>
            <li> Found it for so cheap on amazon and read the reviews about how awful the smell wasâ€¦ Still wanted to try it since it smelled so lovely on my friend.</li>
            <li> The shipping did take way too long though.</li>
            <li> My man bought for me and the aroma last longer than other parfum I ever used.</li>
            <li> a smelled a beautiful smell when one of my cousins came by to see me she had on Rumeur I&#x27;ve been wearing it like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> After the show I had few minutes to spare &amp; I went back to buy it&lt;</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume a few years ago and bought it from a local department store.  </li>
            <li> Not for younger people, and again I was to lazy to return it now</li>
            <li> Very disappointed the low price was exactly what I got a low product.</li>
            <li> Next two were even worse.</li>
            <li> the bottle is so heavy</li>
            <li> The first 5-10 minutes of wearing this is disgusting, smells like nail polish remover mixed with maple syrup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is hard to describe but to me</li>
            <li> This was a knock-off bottle and the packaging was the absolute worst!</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;i am wondering whether this is a fake or defect.</li>
            <li> Drives men and women crazy.</li>

            <li> Every time I wear this fragrance, I get compliments.  Most people ask what it is called and where they can find it.</li>
            <li> My son chose this cologne for my birthday a couple of years ago. I absolutely love love love the fragrance, but the last three bottles I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.com had faulty atomizers. The first I thought was damaged in shipping. Next two were even worse. I love the cologne so much I just suffered with the dripping. And now I&#x27;m ordering again. I&#x27;ll order a different size and hope the atomizer works!</li>
            <li> Excellent service great product a fragrance above</li>
            <li> Clean fragrance that lasts &amp; is not overly sweet or overpowering.  Every time I wear it, someone asks me what it is.</li>
            <li> My wife got this in a sample from a \\&quot;goodie bag\\&quot; and man, it does everything for me. She will spray it on in the morning and even by evening she&#x27;s still smelling beautiful. I don&#x27;t know what is in it that makes my heart beat faster it&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find this offered. It was a favorite of mine. Get compliments when wearing.</li>
            <li> Sorta smells like hairspray at first, but once it drys down OMFG! Awesome perfume that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> What a a beautiful bottle and enticing scent. My other favorite perfumes are Black Orchid by Tom Ford and For Her by Narciso Rodriguez-so if you like either of those you will LOVE LOVE LOVE Rumeur!</li>
            <li> Sexy, mysterious, sophisticated scent. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> First time I ever bought this I was in Sak&#x27;s in NYC &amp; was in a hurry to make it to the Christmas show at radio city music hall. The Lanvin woman sprayed me as I rushed past her, &amp; I stopped because I really loved the scent. I quickly asked for some info such as the name of it. After the show I had few minutes to spare &amp; I went back to buy it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very different than many scents I&#x27;m used to. I&#x27;m not fond of the other newer scent Rose 2 rose or whatever but I love this perfume!!&lt;br /&gt;I was running out of it &amp; that&#x27;s when I found out they were no longer making it. I felt lost but am happy to see it can still be bought here on Amazon at an even better price than department store&lt;br /&gt;The scent is hard to describe but to me it&#x27;s heavenly. Light, not heavy &amp; over bearing &amp; lasts fairly long throughout the day</li>
            <li> Glad I found my perfume I use while traveling. I love the smell.</li>
            <li> i love it so muchã€‚the bottle is so nice and my sister also loves itã€‚but the bottle is so heavy</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume. I bought it on a whim and could not be more satisfied. Especially for the price. The shipping did take way too long though.</li>
            <li> got it on time and we love the parfum and will buy more when we run out cant wait too</li>
            <li> I love this product and this is my fourth time ordering it. that citrusi sweet smell kind of match me perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;love it, great service delivering. I was very happy. good price and good service.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommand this product if you are looking for fresh sweet citrus note.</li>
            <li> Great price for a expensive fragrance smell.</li>
            <li> I was visiting my brother out of town a smelled a beautiful smell when one of my cousins came by to see me she had on Rumeur I&#x27;ve been wearing it like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> This is my go to fragrance. My husband is a huge fan of the Lanvin for Men fragrance and it works very well with his body chemistry; he gets many compliments. I figured I&#x27;d try Lanvin as well and Rumeur is a simply beautiful fragrance. It can be pleasant in summer or winter. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume. It smells so fresh and clean, the scent is amazing</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, not easy to find, very satisfied with delivery and price. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My girl its very happy ! Than all good</li>
            <li> smells wonderful.  I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie--I love this mostly for how gorgeous it looks on my dresser. The scent is good, too, but it doesn&#x27;t last. But at such a reasonable price, I am still satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This was not as strong as Eau de Parfum I bought at a store. The one I had was in a smaller bottle, but it was the same concentration yet it had a much stronger smell and staying power. Maybe this one was on the shelf for longer time, and lost some of its power.</li>
            <li> LOVE ...LOVE...LOVE...I tried this a year ago and I always get a compliment...it smells great...</li>
            <li> The perfume  smells great and the fragance stays with you all day!!!</li>
            <li> Love this !! I took a chance buying this after reading the good  reviews. Glad I brought it. I absolutely love this scent . I was tired of my old perfumes and needed something new, something that was gonna make me say WOW  and omg this did the job. I smelled the perfume through the unopened box. It&#x27;s a very sofisticated scent and the bottle is pretty  Yes the scent is woodsy and great for the evening. So happy I have a new favorite perfume. I will be ordering more bottles just to have because this will be my new scent. When I step to my work place they will know I HAVE ARRIVED BABY !! I will be  smelling good  and looking gorgeous also :)</li>
            <li> My man bought for me and the aroma last longer than other parfum I ever used. I pass by smelling like a million dollar baby.</li>
            <li> My mother was a realy inlove with this fragance, and must say I find it to be most delightly. She used it until she passed away and I still have some left to remind me how she scented.&lt;br /&gt;another one she trully loved was Bal a Versailles, but that one is a bit too intense for my nose LOL.</li>
            <li> This was a knock-off bottle and the packaging was the absolute worst! Sticky glue around the cap&#x27;s top was messy to say the least and the perfume leaked all over my dresser drawer and ruined it! I threw it away and will never purchase perfume online again!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent and when my perfume was finished I had to get another.  I inly wish the seller gad taped the spray nozzle so it would stay on the bottle.  No big deal.</li>
            <li> This seems totally different than what I tried on in the department store.  It has no staying power like a a true perfume.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading every review I could find online for this perfume. I didn&#x27;t know what it smelled like at all so I took a risk in ordering it blindly, but so far, everyone loved this scent! I crossed my fingers while opening the package and even though the cardboard box it was shipped in was crushed in transport, the actual perfume box was undamaged thanks to lots of paper padding. There was nothing suspicious about the box (no repackaging or tears) and the bottle inside was beautiful and pristine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is sweet and woodsy. It smells like a more sophisticated version of White Musk (a perfume I wore in high school). The vaporizer is good and produces a fine mist, and surprisingly lasts most of the day! I can&#x27;t believe I got it for $30. It will be my new favorite perfume for a while.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for years and ALWAYS get compliments when I wear it!!!  I wear this when I dress up for a business meeting or out on the town!!!  It is more of an evening fragrance.  People always notice it when I wear it!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my mom for mother&#x27;s day and she loved it.  It is not to my liking because it&#x27;s not as strong as I thought it would be but hey if she liked it, that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
            <li> I have use rumeur for several years but this particular brand I received from your company is not the actual product.  It is something similar.  One can smell the alcohol content and it is not my Rumeur.  Very disappointed the low price was exactly what I got a low product.</li>
            <li> The smell its not like the original and smell like a cheap soap, it&#x27;s not the same as  the original fragrance</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell, I have used this before and wanted to try it again and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> great price for a nice evening scent.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume. It&#x27;s been my signature smell for over 10 years and I keep wearing it because, let&#x27;s face it, who doesn&#x27;t like complements? Drives men and women crazy. That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume a few years ago and bought it from a local department store.  Right away I loved the way the fragrance blended with my own natural chemistry.  I also received so many compliments and a lady actually followed me in the grocery store to ask what fragrance I was wearing!  This is my second bottle and I plan to buy it again when I&#x27;m running low!  A great value too compared to the department store prices!</li>
            <li> Excellent &amp; bigger than my 1st bottle!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the ex wife. She said it is the real deal. The price was amazing. Would definitely bye again.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine was wearing this and after a day of smelling it I was sold. Found it for so cheap on amazon and read the reviews about how awful the smell wasâ€¦ Still wanted to try it since it smelled so lovely on my friend. The first 5-10 minutes of wearing this is disgusting, smells like nail polish remover mixed with maple syrup. But once the smell settles its so pleasant, floral, and classy. Didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because of the initial smell, but definitely do recommend! Its now my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> No words!!!!!!!!!!! i just love it, I get so many compliments. Just one thing, the cap of my bottle has some issue. Splash of perfume comes out every time i take the cap off.</li>
            <li> the spray did not work initially and the finishing around the cap/ribbon is pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;i am wondering whether this is a fake or defect. the scent is also overbearing.</li>
            <li> And again I went by all the good reviews instead of going out and smelling it. Not for younger people, and again I was to lazy to return it now its just sitting in my bedroom for looks. Go out and smell it before you buy it, I will!!</li>
            <li> The best smell ever! I love it...</li>
            <li> This smells like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; perfume! If you like that then you will love it, but not for me. I gave it to my neighbor and she loves it! However she is not an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; but likes that type of perfume.</li>
