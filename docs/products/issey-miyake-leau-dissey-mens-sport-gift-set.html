            <li>This cologne smells great but it wears off quick.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price for a good perfume.</li>
            <li>Not in love with this</li>
            <li>I have the issey blu and that stays on you more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>100% ok.</li>
            <li>Simply the best!</li>
            <li>Will buy some more colognes.</li>
            <li>the second best cologne I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The first is Issey Miyake !!!</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t worry or they must be so good at duplicating something real that you can&#x27;t notice</li>
            <li>Nuit is my favorite then original then this one.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>This issey miyake cologne smells good but doesn&#x27;t last more than 35 minutes on you</li>
            <li>It smells delicious, But it doesnt last much</li>
            <li>I have the Issey Miyake intense and it smells pretty good</li>
            <li>This is all original Issey Miyake.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL LASTS ALLL DAY .</li>
            <li>It has this nice sweet smell to it yet very masculine and the ladies, or shall I say &amp;#34; my lady&amp;#34; loves it.</li>
            <li>Great buy went to a fragrance store in the mall and the Charged $90 to $100 for this exact same size.</li>
            <li>Excelent product, and very convinient price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years and love the smell on me.</li>
            <li>That seems very far fetched unless the other colognes were won from the ring toss at the county fair.</li>
            <li>The girlfriend likes this a little more than the original.</li>
            <li>I love regular Issey Miyake, but this one is a little more sporty.</li>
            <li>Stay away from the others like bleu or intense.</li>
            <li>Looks real</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was $15 lower than any local department store, and it included free shipping.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the real thing...</li>
            <li>Decided to try this since I previously bought an original white bottled one.</li>
            <li>I guess it is a fake product, smells good but doesn&#x27;t last for even an hour.</li>

            <li> I have smelt it on other individuals and always holds it fragrance</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I previously used the non-sport version, which is lighter and sweeter, but this...this scent rocks.</li>
            <li> This one tops the previous one.</li>
            <li> When I find something that works, I don&#x27;t change it however, my phlopsophy changed when I ventured out a little and tried Issey Miyakes EDT Sport.</li>
            <li> Very big, but fake  the smell was off in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Sorry for my bad english.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t know if I got a fake</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this cologne.</li>
            <li> I bought Eau de Parfum Spray, Pour Homme Sport, 6.7 for $ 79.99 and got my bill and shows Eau de Toilette Spray, this is outrageous, I cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Awesome pricing, and quality merchandise</li>
            <li> I love regular Issey Miyake, but this one is a little more sporty. I prefer this as a daytime scent. The girlfriend likes this a little more than the original.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves it. I previously used the non-sport version, which is lighter and sweeter, but this...this scent rocks. Guys and ladies continuously comment on how great it smells. Amazon&#x27;s price was $15 lower than any local department store, and it included free shipping.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews from individuals calling this the best cologne they have used. That seems very far fetched unless the other colognes were won from the ring toss at the county fair. I own scents from Tom Ford, Chanel, Gucci etc and this should be used as a fire starter in a BBQ pit. Definitely not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I bought Eau de Parfum Spray, Pour Homme Sport, 6.7 for $ 79.99 and got my bill and shows Eau de Toilette Spray, this is outrageous, I cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yo compre Eau de Parfum Spray, Pour Homme Sport, 6.7 por 79,99 $  tal y como se muestra en mi factura y recib&amp;iacute;  Eau de Toilette Spray, esto es indignante , me estafaron.</li>
            <li> Try it! It&#x27;s great. This together with Vetiver is an excellent combination.</li>
            <li> Just a little spray and it last all day. I love it.</li>
            <li> Probably the best cologne I have ever used. I love smelling good and I don&#x27;t like change. When I find something that works, I don&#x27;t change it however, my phlopsophy changed when I ventured out a little and tried Issey Miyakes EDT Sport. It has this nice sweet smell to it yet very masculine and the ladies, or shall I say &amp;#34; my lady&amp;#34; loves it. He best part is that the smell stays on your &amp;#34; hot spots&amp;#34; for a long time and if you were to sweat the perfume acts almost like a deodorant. I have nothing but great things to say about this product. And it&#x27;s NOT a rendition so don&#x27;t worry or they must be so good at duplicating something real that you can&#x27;t notice but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> SMELLS ORIGINAL LASTS ALLL DAY . I LOVE IT!!!</li>
