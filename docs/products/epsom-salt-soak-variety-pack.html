            <li>I would buy more when the three packets are finished.</li>
            <li>If you are on your feet  a lot, you will love this set of scented foot soaks.  </li>
            <li>I must say, I love the product.</li>
            <li>As I said..........I LOVE the bath salts.</li>
            <li>Love epsom salt and to ad fragrance to it as well</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Great for mom to be and new moms.  </li>
            <li>Tryed these foot soaks and they not only smell really good , but also made my aching feet feel good.</li>
            <li>Loved the aroma, and feels very relaxing.</li>
            <li>it is extremely accurate.  </li>
            <li>Ok but cost to much for what it is.</li>
            <li>I got about 3-5 full baths out of each variety.</li>
            <li>and now everyone I know going on a trip wants to borrow it!!  </li>
            <li>It does make me feel calm and relaxed and fall asleep quickly leaving the skin smooth and baby soft.</li>
            <li>I use it up too fast!</li>
            <li>Higher quality salts.</li>
            <li>from the picture I expected more than I got.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I hope the persons responsible for shipping read this review.</li>
            <li>The smells were subtle but nice, and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>And, the price is quite reasonable, better than the same item at the big box store.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for hot soaking bath to relieve tired, stiff...</li>
            <li>Its hard to judge just how effective something like this works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that I prefer scents that seem a little bit more on the natural side.</li>
            <li>A little pricey compared to plain, but these smell great.</li>
            <li>The bags were smaller than thought but was exactly what they said.</li>
            <li>Next time I would buy bigger bags because they are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>My feet hurt a lot from long walks, and I regularly soak them in epsom salts to relieve the pain - it really works, and it works fast.  </li>
            <li>I purchased and liked these salts okay, but the scents seemed a little loud and on the artificial side.</li>
            <li>After finally removing all the tape, the bags were left very sticky everywhere the tape touched.</li>
            <li>Oh yes, I tend to use a bit less than the package suggests for each soak, so you can decide what is right for you.</li>
            <li>I find them a real pick me up after a day of gardening or other jobs that keep my on my feet.  </li>

            <li> The smells are so relaxing and a sprinkle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I recommend the bath salts for detox or relaxing the body, getting rid of muscle aches and minor pain and discomfort.</li>

            <li> Think I will try some other scents next order I make.</li>
            <li> The lavender was very relaxing, the sore muscles one worked on my tired achy joints, which is why I use epsom salts in every bath.</li>
            <li> The Green Tea and chamomile is especially soothing.</li>
            <li> I do feel relaxed but not sure if it is due to this salt or the massager alone.</li>
            <li> I had to tediously cut through the tape very carefully, so as not to cut through the bags.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for many things and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet!</li>
            <li> these are small bags</li>
            <li> This silly little thing saved us hundreds of dollars, at the airports!!  </li>
            <li> I got these for my husband whose feet are awful and getting him into a salon for a pedicure is like pulling teeth.  </li>

            <li> i don&#x27;t know if it worked but its just so so</li>
            <li> Ok but cost to much for what it is.</li>
            <li> Love these! Need to get more. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t blow you away but soothing enough to do the trick.</li>
            <li> The bags were smaller than thought but was exactly what they said.</li>
            <li> Got these and I love to use them with my foot massage it works wonders for my feet.</li>
            <li> I love these!!!! The smells are so relaxing and a sprinkle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This was a great variety pack. from the picture I expected more than I got. these are small bags and I should have read the product specifications. I got about 3-5 full baths out of each variety. The lavender was very relaxing, the sore muscles one worked on my tired achy joints, which is why I use epsom salts in every bath.</li>
            <li> Bought for my lady. She uses it every night and loves being able to mix it up.</li>
            <li> These are good and I use it with foot spa bath massager. I do feel relaxed but not sure if it is due to this salt or the massager alone. But harmless to buy. I would buy more when the three packets are finished. I like the scent.</li>
            <li> Tryed these foot soaks and they not only smell really good , but also made my aching feet feel good. Just follow the directions on the bag. Think I will try some other scents next order I make. You can also use these for your bath too!! Enjoy , I sure did!!</li>
            <li> Excellent selection and product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> all of these smell like kitty litter.</li>
            <li> iwish these products weren&#x27;t scented and that they had actual chamomile and actual eucalyptus in them</li>
            <li> Fragrance is great and soothing! Plenty for the price. Will last me a while.</li>
            <li> The aroma is awesome&lt;br /&gt;Sure I will be purschaing again</li>
            <li> Great salts. A little pricey compared to plain, but these smell great.</li>
            <li> bought for a friend and she loved them</li>
            <li> Excellent bath salt. It does make me feel calm and relaxed and fall asleep quickly leaving the skin smooth and baby soft. I recommend the bath salts for detox or relaxing the body, getting rid of muscle aches and minor pain and discomfort. Great for mom to be and new moms.  However dollar tree has these packs for a dollar each. So you can save 8 bucks if you buy from dollar tree instead of this seller.</li>
            <li> Loved the aroma, and feels very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This silly little thing saved us hundreds of dollars, at the airports!!  it is extremely accurate.  and now everyone I know going on a trip wants to borrow it!!  this is a MUST buy</li>
            <li> I purchased and liked these salts okay, but the scents seemed a little loud and on the artificial side. That may not be necessarily so.  It&#x27;s just that I prefer scents that seem a little bit more on the natural side.</li>
            <li> I work retail and need Epsom Salt soaks nightly!  This is a nice variety pack for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. Its hard to judge just how effective something like this works. I do wish the scent would last longer than 3 minutes though.</li>
            <li> excellent product at an excellent price...</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase.  Created a custom blend.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.... Love the smell! Just wish the pkg were 2times as big!  I use it up too fast! Wonderful for hot soaking bath to relieve tired, stiff... Anything!</li>
            <li> My feet hurt a lot from long walks, and I regularly soak them in epsom salts to relieve the pain - it really works, and it works fast.  I loved that this was a variety pack.  Regular epsom salts just seem so medicinal, and I prefer to feel like my feet are in a spa!  The smells were subtle but nice, and the price was right.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet feel liki heaven</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Now I just need larger bags.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband whose feet are awful and getting him into a salon for a pedicure is like pulling teeth.  He liked them :)</li>
            <li> The salts smelled fantastic and of course do a wonderful job</li>
            <li> Nice 3 pack set! Higher quality salts. I&#x27;ve used them for many things and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet! When I need more I&#x27;ll be buying them again!</li>
            <li> If you are on your feet  a lot, you will love this set of scented foot soaks.  I find them a real pick me up after a day of gardening or other jobs that keep my on my feet.  The scents are soothing and the warm water is relaxing.  My daughter,whose work keeps her on her feet for long hours , swears by them.  And, the price is quite reasonable, better than the same item at the big box store.  So, do your feet a favor and give them a try.  Oh yes, I tend to use a bit less than the package suggests for each soak, so you can decide what is right for you.</li>
            <li> I must say, I love the product. The Green Tea and chamomile is especially soothing. The only problem I had was with the packaging of the product. I hope the persons responsible for shipping read this review. I had to tediously cut through the tape very carefully, so as not to cut through the bags. After finally removing all the tape, the bags were left very sticky everywhere the tape touched. As I said..........I LOVE the bath salts.</li>
            <li> Love epsom salt and to ad fragrance to it as well, PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Love them all! Great variety pack!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> These smelled amazing and worked. I like that it comes with three different options so I could chose how what I felt was best for that day. The only downside is the size of these bags, you can get two maybe three baths per bag. Next time I would buy bigger bags because they are definitely worth it.</li>
