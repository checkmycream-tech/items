            <li>they don&#x27;t even stay in the bikini top, they slide around!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect fit!!!</li>
            <li>Work great in a swimsuit.</li>
            <li>Made a great gift for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The silicone gels are amazing!</li>
            <li>Loved it</li>
            <li>I love these inserts!</li>
            <li>but my breasts are more surface area than cleavage</li>
            <li>and I hoped these would give me more oomph in a bikini top</li>
            <li>Quality was okay if you are looking for something to add to a structured bra, otherwise I would avoid.</li>
            <li>There comfortable!</li>
            <li>but when it came to swimsuit worked perfect bust seems more filled out and lil bit larger also like part</li>
            <li>They wear well and clean easy.  </li>
            <li>I got them super fast and in really nice condition.</li>
            <li>They have given me a full size.</li>
            <li>Theyre a bit small but very good quality</li>
            <li>I have tried many different pads for increasing breast size and this Bikini Push Up pad works very well both in bras and bikini top.</li>
            <li>I tried using them in both a triangle bikini top and a bandeau bikini top, however it made absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li>They definitely make a difference when I wear them, and very comfortable throughout the day.</li>
            <li>These things may be okay if you&#x27;re a AA or something, but if you actually have somewhat of boobs</li>
            <li>but they sadly, do not.</li>
            <li>the only reason i gave it 2 stars was because it might look better in a bra</li>
            <li>used for certain dresses to even out the look.  </li>
            <li>It appears to be a very high quality item.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast but ended up returning them .</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t fit properly</li>
            <li>I much rather not ever buy something like this again</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re super tiny, literally can fit them in the palm of my hand and take of like a fourth of my breast.</li>
            <li>The pad is very soft and doesn&#x27;t slip around.</li>
            <li>My husband wants me to wear them with low cut dresses.</li>
            <li>they dont push anything up, just pull my bikini top down and make it look heavy at the bottom.</li>

            <li> Will not fit a normal size 32 to 36 cup size bra!</li>
            <li> the push up pads really make her small breasts look bigger.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the item shown above as expected and instead found myself with a pair of cutlets.</li>
            <li> You have to keep your breast moisturized because they will dry them</li>
            <li> Our friend Tony dresses up in drag and he likes them.</li>
            <li> Way too small like a pre teen size breast cup enhancer!</li>
            <li> but you do need to put other padding in them.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in a thin swimsuit but these inserts were really small yet thick, overall very unrealistically shaped, so it didn&#x27;t work out at all.</li>
            <li> They work well enough, but you&#x27;d need a sports bra to go over the regular bra, and also they start to get a weird odor after a while.</li>
            <li> Overall I am extremely disappointed with this waste of a purchase and would not recommend to a friend or anyone else.</li>
            <li> they are too heavy and move around in the bras and feel awkward I am not using them for now</li>
            <li> but im definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy about this order as I did not want to receive cutlets.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is the worst product I have ever purchased they don&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> i bought these to put in my bikini tops and they are terrible!</li>

            <li> Arrived fast but ended up returning them . Will not fit a normal size 32 to 36 cup size bra! Way too small like a pre teen size breast cup enhancer!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit!!! Loved it</li>
            <li> They work well enough, but you&#x27;d need a sports bra to go over the regular bra, and also they start to get a weird odor after a while.</li>
            <li> I love these inserts! They have given me a full size. Wear them inside a pocket in your bra. If you wear silicone next to your skin, you may get a rash. My husband wants me to wear them with low cut dresses. I get a lot of looks!</li>
            <li> The silicone gels are amazing! I got them super fast and in really nice condition. They definitely make a difference when I wear them, and very comfortable throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my niece, which is actually a cup a. the push up pads really make her small breasts look bigger.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different pads for increasing breast size and this Bikini Push Up pad works very well both in bras and bikini top.The pad is very soft and doesn&#x27;t slip around.It appears to be a very high quality item. It gives about add about 1 cup size.If the need to replace these in the future, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> used for certain dresses to even out the look.  They wear well and clean easy.  They were only used for a specific outfit.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the item shown above as expected and instead found myself with a pair of cutlets. I am very unhappy about this order as I did not want to receive cutlets. If that was what I wanted I would have ordered it else-wear. Overall I am extremely disappointed with this waste of a purchase and would not recommend to a friend or anyone else.</li>
            <li> These things may be okay if you&#x27;re a AA or something, but if you actually have somewhat of boobs these things suck. I put them in and see no pushing up and they&#x27;re super tiny, literally can fit them in the palm of my hand and take of like a fourth of my breast. I&#x27;m a 32 D but my breasts are more surface area than cleavage and I hoped these would give me more oomph in a bikini top but they sadly, do not. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Work great in a swimsuit. Was lil skeptic when tried in bra but when it came to swimsuit worked perfect bust seems more filled out and lil bit larger also like part u can&#x27;t even tell their in and are waterproof</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in a thin swimsuit but these inserts were really small yet thick, overall very unrealistically shaped, so it didn&#x27;t work out at all. Quality was okay if you are looking for something to add to a structured bra, otherwise I would avoid.</li>
            <li> I am a 34B and these inserts did nothing to improve my bust size. I tried using them in both a triangle bikini top and a bandeau bikini top, however it made absolutely no difference. I would not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> They sweat and they also pop out sometimes when I bend over.</li>
            <li> this is the worst product I have ever purchased they don&#x27;t stay in place they don&#x27;t fit properly I much rather not ever buy something like this again</li>
            <li> Our friend Tony dresses up in drag and he likes them. Theyre a bit small but very good quality but you do need to put other padding in them. Made a great gift for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this.</li>
            <li> You have to keep your breast moisturized because they will dry them out.overall I like them. There comfortable! Thank You</li>
            <li> they are too heavy and move around in the bras and feel awkward I am not using them for now</li>

            <li> Am I the only person who sees something completely different in the picture that has nothing to do with breasts?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d lost a lot of weight and needed these. They helped but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use them in Texas in the summer*L*.</li>
