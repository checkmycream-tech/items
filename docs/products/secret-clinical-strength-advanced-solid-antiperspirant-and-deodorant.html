            <li>This arrived on time and this is the BEST deodorant i have ever used.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It works and when you sweat it smells great because of the composition of the deodarant.</li>
            <li>As it makes her  happy</li>
            <li>it makes me happy, thus the favorable review.</li>
            <li>She says it works great and smells great.</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant before however Amazon has a great price for it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great</li>
            <li>Great for triple digit temperatures, prevents stress or nervous sweat, etc.</li>
            <li>It worked great at controlling wetness.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it worked great</li>
            <li>the smell is great.</li>
            <li>The product would be great if the seller wouldn&#x27;t have lied about the expiration of his products.</li>
            <li>Of course I find a product that works great, smells great, makes noticeable difference in how my body sweats/smells....</li>
            <li>great deal.</li>
            <li>My wife is really happy with these &amp; they are a good price compared to stores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think so, but it does smell nice!</li>
            <li>I love the Stress Response one the best.</li>
            <li>All-day wetness and odor protection, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>That can be a good thing, if you don&#x27;t want to take any chances.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is a shameless plug for their superior product.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, it is a good product, but the price just does not appeal to me.     </li>
            <li>Smell is good plus it makes you feel good.</li>
            <li>Has a very light smell and even comes in waterproof which is great for summertime &amp; vacations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>I am in love!  </li>
            <li>This one is amazing and works so well.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant and antiperspirant works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>What kind of harm would it do?  </li>
            <li>it works  well, smells nice but not overpowring,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even want to think about what this is doing to my body, but - dang, it&#x27;s effective.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, my wife liked it.  </li>
            <li>So based on her report, this product lives up to its billing that it provides effective layers of protection.  </li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying, I like this product, it does work, but to be perfectly honest</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is good, but incredibly potent.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s not too surprising given that it contains the proven ingredient (Aluminum Zirconium Trichlorohydrex Gly) that appears in most antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>I do find however that after awhile, as with any deodorant, it seems to not be as effective.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how this worked as an anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more happy and confident now.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent too in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it an honest effort</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s the point in leaving feedback if the seller gets to pick and choose his own feedback.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to stick with the popular men&#x27;s deo</li>
            <li>but with summer coming up it would be nice to have an antiperspirant that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>so it was very easy to order it online and have it delivered to the house.</li>
            <li>This deodorant goes on smoothly and provides good protection during the warmer weather.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to buy them in bulk at a great price because they aren&#x27;t cheep especially in stores.</li>
            <li>Nice, light fragrance, superb antiperspirant action.</li>
            <li>Plus it gives a very light to no additional fragrance, so it doesn&#x27;t clash with the perfume you are wearing.</li>
            <li>My daughter added that it has a nice scent that is not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Both my husband and I use it, as it is effective but not too strongly perfumed.</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice, not too strong.</li>
            <li>I have tried several deodrants and must say that this one is the best I have come to like.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this based on results - but do your own research and decide if you&#x27;re comfortable breaking your body&#x27;s sweat patterns.</li>
            <li>When this product was introduced on the market, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>This allows more of the product to be drawn into the ducts stopping wetness.  </li>
            <li>(as many women&#x27;s anti-perspirants are).  </li>
            <li>Works well, but if you like it, be prepared to purchase more often.</li>
            <li>Most antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for me which is why I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Mostly, yes.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>It is a bit better saving, and they deliver it to my front door.  </li>
            <li>I still find that my stress sweats aren&#x27;t alleviated by this.</li>
            <li>but this is even better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the effectiveness and function of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>You can imagine my relief when my favorite brand of deodorant came up with something that beat out the others.  </li>
            <li>The clinical strength holds up so much better.  </li>
            <li>I sweat a lot and sweat through most brands of anti perspirants.</li>
            <li>Go with degree for better quality of product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works OK, but go for Degree.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and odor protection.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product online since it was a better deal.</li>
            <li>This product made me sweat even more and didn&#x27;t reduce ANYTHING.</li>
            <li>I love this clinical strength deodorant.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;light and fresh&#x27; scent is very nice.  </li>
            <li>The cream texture is easy to apply (not wax like), and it does not appear to leave traces on the clothes after washing, which is very important to us.</li>
            <li>If you blocked all your sweating, and your body was trying to sweat because it felt too hot, this would not be a good thing.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a wonderful self-supporting confidence loop.those many other situations where you do NOT need to sweat to stay healthy - like when you&#x27;re standing in front of a roomful of people</li>
            <li>As someone who sweats easily and alot, finding an antiperspirant that works is challenging.</li>
            <li>Product works great, no excessive sweat and</li>
            <li>have tried many other deodorants and this is the best that I have found for what I need.</li>
            <li>I have two almost teens who really need good protection with all the hormonal stuff</li>
            <li>The fragrance is REALLY strong and smells like cheap perfume (no fragrance would be better in my opinion)</li>
            <li>and I feel more confident using this in the hot humid Florida weather!  </li>
            <li>The scent is very mild -it&#x27;s always a plus since I don&#x27;t like overpowering deodorants.</li>
            <li>Scent is a bit strong for my preference but not unbearable.</li>
            <li>If I shower at night and then apply the deodorant, it works fine.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent - I don&#x27;t like to smell purfumey.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great reviews but it personally didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>, I have purchased it multiple times, the smell is not that great, but the product works.</li>
            <li>Having used it for the last three weeks, both of us were quite happy with this trial.</li>
            <li>It is grease free and doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery or sticky residue on your underarm or clothing,  </li>
            <li>It is odor free and glides on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Another bonus is that it goes on smooth and is not crumbly or noticeable with sleeveless shirts.</li>
            <li>For the price it is more economical to buy at Amazon, rather than elsewhere</li>
            <li>and it is a fantastic combo....</li>
            <li>Light and fresh and lavender are my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I am a woman, but sweat like a man...love the strength of this product and the light and clean scent.</li>
            <li>Super easy having to apply before bed.</li>
            <li>This new advanced kind seems to keep me drying longer.  </li>
            <li>My wife liked the consistency and found that it went on easily and clear without didn&#x27;t leave marks in her clothing.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, pleasant, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic and it keeps me dry and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I do think that this is the best, or at least strongest, deodorant available.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean and fresh scent, but still too strong.  </li>
            <li>IT does not dry out the underarm and, if you skip a day, you still smell good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for those days when you would like to wear perfume and don&#x27;t want that clash of smells that usually happens with most deodrants.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a miracle, it didn&#x27;t burn and left me smelling great.</li>
            <li>Ideal for heavy sweaters like me</li>
            <li>Prior to this I had tried everything from Dove Clinical strength to Mitchum, but nothing seemed to truly stop wetness and elminate odor - even after a good workout this stuff seems to work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love a deodorant &amp; antiperspirant that will really perform as they claim to.</li>
            <li>I always look forward to applying these, I&#x27;m so glad I found this on Amazon, thanks to the thousand of reviews.</li>
            <li>I still have fresh smelling and smooth arm pits at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both good, of course the light is less strong for my nose.</li>
            <li>I do not know how well over normal good deodrant it is, but what i can say is for normal use</li>
            <li>Although it is obviously powerful, the sensation of using this product is smooth and fresh smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sad, but awesome for those of us on a microscopic budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay College. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the All Day Fresh and also the Light and Fresh scents.</li>
            <li>It does not leave a filmy layer on dark clothing and is great for those who have problems with sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>It definitely works better than Secrets regular stregth, which is great, but I still sweat with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than the normal stuff.</li>
            <li>It has a very fresh, light scent, so fresh that I really have no need to wear any perfume.</li>
            <li>This is very light in fragrance but strong enough to take care of you all day.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite deodorant for when I really need a strong antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Scent is pleasant, not really noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed , I no longer sweat !!</li>
            <li>She reported that it kept her dry all day and that she liked the fragrance which is light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>; extreme sweating and hot vonditions would need you to keep applying but for the day to day, it is great.</li>
            <li>so I can sweat less and be more comfortable and smell better.</li>
            <li>scent is a very non-obtrusive scent and the cream applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a bit ironic, considering that it&#x27;s described as \\&quot;Light and Fresh.\\</li>
            <li>Secret Clinical Strength is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>this antiperspirant is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>To me, Secret has the best brand reputation for deodorant, and this product is no exception.</li>
            <li>It truly eliminates odors with the release of &amp;#34;out of the world&amp;#34; fresh scent</li>
            <li>I recently tried Dove because I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li>This one has by far kept me dryest and kept the smell away better than any others I have tried.</li>
            <li>But it lasts and has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>it works great and is in the soft solid format.</li>
            <li>that being said, if you&#x27;re in those many other situations where you do NOT need to sweat to stay healthy - like when you&#x27;re standing in front of a roomful of people and they&#x27;re all staring at you -</li>
            <li>right before you throw on your clothes and run out the door.</li>
            <li>Either it works, or it doesn&#x27;t, right?</li>
            <li>If the price is right, then this is what you want.</li>
            <li>and right after i shower.  </li>
            <li>Another plus is that it also goes on very smooth and if you don&#x27;t put too much, dries clear.</li>
            <li>it fills nice, not tacky,gooy, or to dry.  </li>
            <li>It dissipates fast and quickly becomes unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>; strong enough for a strenuous workout and smells super fresh too.</li>
            <li>It keeps you dry and smells nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Animal testing is not a valid way to test a product, do not support it with your money when you have many other options available.</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried; it really does keep me dry for the whole day so long as I apply it at night, before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>Women talk gladly about their cool hair gel or lipstick, but you would rarely find them talking about their wet armpits and how they handle them!</li>
            <li>They say you only get better with age</li>
            <li>Between the smell and the fact that it works very well, it&#x27;s well worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>(More on this later.)  </li>
            <li>Just to be on the safe side I reapply in the morning (just a personal choice)</li>
            <li>But if you aren&#x27;t entering an Olympic marathon, or you&#x27;re not a big sweating type (like me), this might be more antiperspirant than you need.    </li>
            <li>My only concern would be whether or not it&#x27;s safe for every day use</li>
            <li>my morning I definitely need more deodorant.</li>
            <li>Though this is still more effective than regular deodorant, it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot here in Colorado.  </li>
            <li>The first brand I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m willing to admit it because now I&#x27;m virtually odorless.  </li>
            <li>I woke up this morning after a hot,</li>
            <li>For the first time I looked to amazon for a cheaper option of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>The two pack I purchased is the cream like one, but I&#x27;m sure they have a solid stick as well.</li>
            <li>this is also a great deal considering it costs at least $8 per container at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I even used this in Jamaica when I got married in a strapless wedding dress.  </li>
            <li>Works all day and is absorbed quickly and completely without residue.</li>
            <li>We want to be able to handle the wetness and odor in a way that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get very nervous in public</li>
            <li>Its better than smelling of BO, but nobody wants to have an obvious deodorant smell either.</li>
            <li>Women&#x27;s Mitchum Advanced Control - 48 Hour Strength and Protection - Powder Fresh - Invisible Solid.</li>
            <li>However, if these cheaper alternatives don&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;ll be willing to buy this again, because it really does work.</li>
            <li>Also, I have some energetic hobbies - for example I do long sword fighting every week.</li>
            <li>So, as usual, I turned to Amazon for a good deal.  </li>
            <li>If it were the only product out there,  I would give the unscented a try, but thankfully, Degree products seem to get better reviews anyway and the powder scent particularly.</li>
            <li>this treatment is great, I stay dry all day long!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply too strong.  </li>
            <li>Strong enough for a man but made for a woman.</li>
            <li>Strong enough for my sweaty stinky man too.  </li>
            <li>And it certainly does stop sweating...</li>
            <li>I also tried this Certain dri</li>
            <li>I have tried Certain Dri, and that didn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any old regular deodorant, &amp; costs twice as much!</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s not a bad smell or too overwhelming, though, so I&#x27;m still using it - I&#x27;ll just get a different scent in the future.</li>
            <li>The smell is also very mild, which hides really well under her daily fragrance.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t justify spending this much month after month on a deodorant.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Wife really likes this deodorant and has made the switch.  </li>
            <li>This is a real shame.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate it so much.</li>
            <li>How much can one say about deodorant?</li>
            <li>Their clinical is waterproof (even though is isn&#x27;t labelled as such), it doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap perfume, and if you forget to use it one day, you&#x27;re still protected.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t sweat as much.</li>
            <li>never had problem with too much sweat, just offensive odor.  </li>
            <li>It does work very well however.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Secret Clinical Strength Advanced Solid works great for me on my really stressful days.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every product on the market, plus some &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; all promising to eliminate the perspiration and odor.</li>
            <li>And, the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>And yes, she sniffed them to double check and they were still lightly scented.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a Deodorant that will help make it through the day without making my top wet.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning and it works very well.</li>
            <li>it is VERY drying to the point where your skin can blister.</li>
            <li>I know I sweat a lot, but this claims to be &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34;, and I really didn&#x27;t feel like the antiperspirant was working.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for mild sweating but if you&#x27;re a water fountain like me, I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>By far, this product beats everything!!!</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and odor free througout the day and night no matter if the weather is hot or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I sweat perhaps more than other people tend to do.</li>
            <li>I have never been as satisfied with any other deodorant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other clinical protection antiperspirants, but this has got to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is the smell is so powerful!</li>
            <li>just to find out that the company that makes this and many other brands, tests on animals.</li>
            <li>I tried a couple of these at different levels and scent and while they all worked fine, the design (more than the additional cost) will hold be back from future purchase.</li>
            <li>Secret Clinical Strength Light and Fresh is definitely the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used in some time (since Teen Sprit Caribbean Cool, but since I&#x27;m no longer a teen, I needed a big girl deodorant).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s that cream garbage that I have always disliked strongly and felt you don&#x27;t get your money&#x27;s worth out from.</li>
            <li>We should be able to share helpful information with each other on how to handle normal things</li>
            <li>First and foremost, it doesn&#x27;t work for me any better than a plain old (MUCH cheaper) deodorant/antiperspirant does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It slides on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t mark off on clothes, and keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li>This product seems to control odor better than my previous deodorant</li>
            <li>and it was nearly half the price of what it was at CVS/grocery store and with free prime shipping!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than regular, following directions or not.</li>
            <li>My main issue (and</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands of \\&quot;clinical strenght\\&quot; deodorant at this point and this is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad someone has finally come out with a product that actually works and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I will be realistic, though.  </li>
            <li>so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because of the high ratings and it lived up to the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;February 27, 2013 update - The first problem I had was solved, but if you have arthritis in your thumb joints, as I have, I do not recommend this product, as I have to use pliers to turn the knob.[[ASIN:B001F51VS4 Secret Clinical Strength Advanced Solid Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant Light And Fresh Scent 1.6 Oz (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m actually paying attention, it really does work!!</li>
            <li>I really like that I can apply this early in the morning (</li>
            <li>But many women engage in heavy athletic activities, and would probably just as soon not have dinner plate-sized sweat marks under their arms.</li>
            <li>As my spouse will tell you, I need \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; help :).</li>
            <li>i only reapply if i&#x27;m going out again in the evening to feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and captivating scent.</li>
            <li>do want to comment that I feel strongly that if you&#x27;re doing something that&#x27;s meant to be active - let&#x27;s say horseback riding or mountain biking - that you</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was surprised when I first began using it how fresh and dry</li>
            <li>The applicator lets me use just enough deodorant for the day, so it seems to help it last a good bit longer than some of the other deodorants that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I like Secret Clinical Strength Light and Fresh Scent Advanced Solid.</li>
            <li>This product is doing its job in keeping the perspiration and odor down, so that it doesn&#x27;t have to have a strong scent to cover-up its failures.    </li>
            <li>It has a nice, subtle scent also.</li>
            <li>It offers great protection that never once failed when I used it.      </li>
            <li>I attempted to buy the deodorant with the least amount of smell - light and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is normal and natural.</li>
            <li>well this product fixed that!    </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several months now and it really helps!</li>
            <li>The first and last brand of deodorant I will ever use, no matter the cost.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I have more sweat than the average women, especially in summer.</li>
            <li>the reason why I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five) is that the scent is too heavy and strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not that sensitive to scented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know it sounds like a commercial, but when you feel confident that you will be dry, and not have giant wet rings under your arms, it really does help you relax, and therefore you don&#x27;t sweat as much!</li>
            <li>I know it sounds like a commercial, but when you feel confident that you will be dry, and not have giant wet rings under your arms, it really does help you relax, and therefore you don&#x27;t sweat as much!</li>
            <li>Especially for women after a certain age when the body chemistry changes...  </li>
            <li>The wet solid applies smoothly without rubbing off on clothes (though if the applicator touches your clothes, it will rub off then).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME &amp; HOPE IN THIS PRODUCT.    </li>
            <li>and this problem has affected all aspects of my life-- completely.</li>
            <li>Also, makes me itch a bit, but I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Turns out this &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorant was only exasperating my underarm problems the whole time.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy without having to use your finger like the old school cream.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s alright</li>
            <li>Really and truly Secret Clinical works better than any antiperspirant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing, because it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side.</li>
            <li>I make sure to clamp down my arms for a long time after applying the deodorant so I don&#x27;t have to smell it.</li>
            <li>You plan for that shower afterward and cool down.</li>
            <li>I almost always end up with more under one arm than the other since the clicks are not very even.</li>
            <li>My gf has been a regular Dove user and we were glad to have the opportunity to try out this new product from Secret, thanks to Amazon Vine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this works any better than regular brands.  </li>
            <li>It definitely didn&#x27;t lighten the hair, and I was so interested in whether or not the hair would actually lighten</li>
            <li>It does cost a little more , but for those extra stressful days I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that if it isn&#x27;t absorbed into your skin enough, it will stain clothes white.</li>
            <li>Overall, I don&#x27;t think that I would recommend it to an exceptionally heavy sweater since I doubt it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I tried that Mitchum brand and it made my underarm area very itchy and dry.</li>
            <li>This deodorant really does keep you dry longer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a long lasting deodorant, and do not let the size fool you, one box lasts me at least a month.</li>
            <li>This keeps me feeling fresh and dry all day long.</li>
            <li>but it certainly does last all day long.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s more of a cream than a solid, so it feels a little wet when you put it on and can smear).</li>
            <li>It also has a light, delicate smell.</li>
            <li>It will stop me from general sweating but in cases of heat and exertion you&#x27;re sweating, no way around it.</li>
            <li>This one actually minimizes it for the long run - you&#x27;ll always need deodorant because the odor is there, but it&#x27;s very minuscule.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a last-minute thing, I would say it takes up to a week to fully kick in, and then, well, you&#x27;re really not sweating much at all.</li>
            <li>and it will last all day, even if I go out after work into the early morning hours.</li>
            <li>I barely noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>Then I tried Dove&#x27;s clinical one because apparently it also lightened underarm hair along with getting rid of odor.  </li>
            <li>Barely a hint of odor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m returning these and going back to my old deodorant, which can be found here:</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t use drysol regularly because it is with frequent use</li>
            <li>You too can find out more at the Secret website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to go ahead and stick with the cheaper, more affordable Secret brands that still work for me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I liked this product.</li>
            <li>However, I did feel DOVE worked better than SECRET for me.</li>
            <li>I sweat constantly and Secret is the only kind that will work on me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just at this price, there are probably more economical ways to keep your heavy sweating down to a ladylike glow without the heavy pricetag.</li>
            <li>, I really didn&#x27;t notice any particular difference in this product than any of the other Secret deoderant sticks that are available.    </li>
            <li>I tried other brand name products like Mitchum and Certain Dri, but none have worked as well as this one has.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not the 99 cent on sale stuff you throw in the cart at the supermarket (actually, at this price it&#x27;s nowhere near a bargain antiperspirant!)    </li>
            <li>Though it may not seem like there is much product, a little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a solidly anti-walmart shopper, so perhaps this is why I find this offer to be such a good deal, but at Target, this same deoderant is twice as expensive as getting it here in a two pack.</li>
            <li>Heck, if your underarms are sweating that much, undoubtedly so are other parts of your body.</li>
            <li>I am no longer the social butterfly I was known to be</li>
            <li>When you finally get product to appear, you can look at how far you had to turn the product pusher up and how much is left, and it&#x27;s about 1/2 of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; product seems to truly work better than regular Secret products.  </li>
            <li>This clinical strength version does seem to work better than the other Secrets I had in the past as there is no sweat or white residue.  </li>
            <li>It worked during a very stressful public speaking engagement as well as during a game of volleyball on a very hot day.</li>
            <li>I was partial to Secret brand since I have used it most of my life but was looking for something that would keep me feeling fresh and keep me dry all day long.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Clinical strength\\&quot; in an antiperspirant may be a bit much for the average woman who isn&#x27;t a longshoreman, or who doesn&#x27;t sweat like one.    </li>
            <li>So after having washed it off in the shower at night, and sweating in my sleep, the next morning, barely a peep.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Solid\\&quot; is a bit of a misnomer, as it&#x27;s much softer in consistency than your typical antiperspirant or deodorant \\&quot;solid\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>was in hopes it would work but as far as ordor control, it was&lt;br /&gt;disappointing; however, it did keep me dry.  </li>
            <li>I sweat a lot - have all my life - and have often had to either/or shower twice daily, and/or apply a second dose of deoderant to be &amp;#34;somewhat socially acceptable&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It works and when you sweat it smells great because of the composition of the deodarant.</li>
            <li> As it makes her  happy</li>
            <li> it makes me happy, thus the favorable review.</li>
            <li> She says it works great and smells great.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant before however Amazon has a great price for it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great</li>
            <li> Great for triple digit temperatures, prevents stress or nervous sweat, etc.</li>
            <li> It worked great at controlling wetness.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it worked great</li>
            <li> the smell is great.</li>
            <li> The product would be great if the seller wouldn&#x27;t have lied about the expiration of his products.</li>
            <li> Of course I find a product that works great, smells great, makes noticeable difference in how my body sweats/smells....</li>
            <li> great deal.</li>
            <li> My wife is really happy with these &amp; they are a good price compared to stores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think so, but it does smell nice!</li>
            <li> I love the Stress Response one the best.</li>
            <li> All-day wetness and odor protection, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> That can be a good thing, if you don&#x27;t want to take any chances.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a shameless plug for their superior product.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, it is a good product, but the price just does not appeal to me.     </li>
            <li> Smell is good plus it makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> Has a very light smell and even comes in waterproof which is great for summertime &amp; vacations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I am in love!  </li>
            <li> This one is amazing and works so well.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant and antiperspirant works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> What kind of harm would it do?  </li>
            <li> it works  well, smells nice but not overpowring,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to think about what this is doing to my body, but - dang, it&#x27;s effective.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my wife liked it.  </li>
            <li> So based on her report, this product lives up to its billing that it provides effective layers of protection.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying, I like this product, it does work, but to be perfectly honest</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is good, but incredibly potent.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not too surprising given that it contains the proven ingredient (Aluminum Zirconium Trichlorohydrex Gly) that appears in most antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> I do find however that after awhile, as with any deodorant, it seems to not be as effective.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how this worked as an anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more happy and confident now.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent too in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it an honest effort</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the point in leaving feedback if the seller gets to pick and choose his own feedback.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to stick with the popular men&#x27;s deo</li>
            <li> but with summer coming up it would be nice to have an antiperspirant that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> so it was very easy to order it online and have it delivered to the house.</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on smoothly and provides good protection during the warmer weather.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to buy them in bulk at a great price because they aren&#x27;t cheep especially in stores.</li>
            <li> Nice, light fragrance, superb antiperspirant action.</li>
            <li> Plus it gives a very light to no additional fragrance, so it doesn&#x27;t clash with the perfume you are wearing.</li>
            <li> My daughter added that it has a nice scent that is not too strong.  </li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use it, as it is effective but not too strongly perfumed.</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice, not too strong.</li>
            <li> I have tried several deodrants and must say that this one is the best I have come to like.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this based on results - but do your own research and decide if you&#x27;re comfortable breaking your body&#x27;s sweat patterns.</li>
            <li> When this product was introduced on the market, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> This allows more of the product to be drawn into the ducts stopping wetness.  </li>
            <li> (as many women&#x27;s anti-perspirants are).  </li>
            <li> Works well, but if you like it, be prepared to purchase more often.</li>
            <li> Most antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for me which is why I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Mostly, yes.  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> It is a bit better saving, and they deliver it to my front door.  </li>
            <li> I still find that my stress sweats aren&#x27;t alleviated by this.</li>
            <li> but this is even better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the effectiveness and function of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> You can imagine my relief when my favorite brand of deodorant came up with something that beat out the others.  </li>
            <li> The clinical strength holds up so much better.  </li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and sweat through most brands of anti perspirants.</li>
            <li> Go with degree for better quality of product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works OK, but go for Degree.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and odor protection.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product online since it was a better deal.</li>
            <li> This product made me sweat even more and didn&#x27;t reduce ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> I love this clinical strength deodorant.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;light and fresh&#x27; scent is very nice.  </li>
            <li> The cream texture is easy to apply (not wax like), and it does not appear to leave traces on the clothes after washing, which is very important to us.</li>
            <li> If you blocked all your sweating, and your body was trying to sweat because it felt too hot, this would not be a good thing.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a wonderful self-supporting confidence loop.those many other situations where you do NOT need to sweat to stay healthy - like when you&#x27;re standing in front of a roomful of people</li>
            <li> As someone who sweats easily and alot, finding an antiperspirant that works is challenging.</li>
            <li> Product works great, no excessive sweat and</li>
            <li> have tried many other deodorants and this is the best that I have found for what I need.</li>
            <li> I have two almost teens who really need good protection with all the hormonal stuff</li>
            <li> The fragrance is REALLY strong and smells like cheap perfume (no fragrance would be better in my opinion)</li>
            <li> and I feel more confident using this in the hot humid Florida weather!  </li>
            <li> The scent is very mild -it&#x27;s always a plus since I don&#x27;t like overpowering deodorants.</li>
            <li> Scent is a bit strong for my preference but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> If I shower at night and then apply the deodorant, it works fine.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent - I don&#x27;t like to smell purfumey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great reviews but it personally didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> , I have purchased it multiple times, the smell is not that great, but the product works.</li>
            <li> Having used it for the last three weeks, both of us were quite happy with this trial.</li>
            <li> It is grease free and doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery or sticky residue on your underarm or clothing,  </li>
            <li> It is odor free and glides on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that it goes on smooth and is not crumbly or noticeable with sleeveless shirts.</li>
            <li> For the price it is more economical to buy at Amazon, rather than elsewhere</li>
            <li> and it is a fantastic combo....</li>
            <li> Light and fresh and lavender are my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I am a woman, but sweat like a man...love the strength of this product and the light and clean scent.</li>
            <li> Super easy having to apply before bed.</li>
            <li> This new advanced kind seems to keep me drying longer.  </li>
            <li> My wife liked the consistency and found that it went on easily and clear without didn&#x27;t leave marks in her clothing.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice, pleasant, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic and it keeps me dry and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I do think that this is the best, or at least strongest, deodorant available.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean and fresh scent, but still too strong.  </li>
            <li> IT does not dry out the underarm and, if you skip a day, you still smell good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for those days when you would like to wear perfume and don&#x27;t want that clash of smells that usually happens with most deodrants.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a miracle, it didn&#x27;t burn and left me smelling great.</li>
            <li> Ideal for heavy sweaters like me</li>
            <li> Prior to this I had tried everything from Dove Clinical strength to Mitchum, but nothing seemed to truly stop wetness and elminate odor - even after a good workout this stuff seems to work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love a deodorant &amp; antiperspirant that will really perform as they claim to.</li>
            <li> I always look forward to applying these, I&#x27;m so glad I found this on Amazon, thanks to the thousand of reviews.</li>
            <li> I still have fresh smelling and smooth arm pits at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both good, of course the light is less strong for my nose.</li>
            <li> I do not know how well over normal good deodrant it is, but what i can say is for normal use</li>
            <li> Although it is obviously powerful, the sensation of using this product is smooth and fresh smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sad, but awesome for those of us on a microscopic budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay College. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the All Day Fresh and also the Light and Fresh scents.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a filmy layer on dark clothing and is great for those who have problems with sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> It definitely works better than Secrets regular stregth, which is great, but I still sweat with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than the normal stuff.</li>
            <li> It has a very fresh, light scent, so fresh that I really have no need to wear any perfume.</li>
            <li> This is very light in fragrance but strong enough to take care of you all day.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite deodorant for when I really need a strong antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Scent is pleasant, not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed , I no longer sweat !!</li>
            <li> She reported that it kept her dry all day and that she liked the fragrance which is light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> ; extreme sweating and hot vonditions would need you to keep applying but for the day to day, it is great.</li>
            <li> so I can sweat less and be more comfortable and smell better.</li>
            <li> scent is a very non-obtrusive scent and the cream applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a bit ironic, considering that it&#x27;s described as \\&quot;Light and Fresh.\\</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> this antiperspirant is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> To me, Secret has the best brand reputation for deodorant, and this product is no exception.</li>
            <li> It truly eliminates odors with the release of &amp;#34;out of the world&amp;#34; fresh scent</li>
            <li> I recently tried Dove because I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li> This one has by far kept me dryest and kept the smell away better than any others I have tried.</li>
            <li> But it lasts and has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li> it works great and is in the soft solid format.</li>
            <li> that being said, if you&#x27;re in those many other situations where you do NOT need to sweat to stay healthy - like when you&#x27;re standing in front of a roomful of people and they&#x27;re all staring at you -</li>
            <li> right before you throw on your clothes and run out the door.</li>
            <li> Either it works, or it doesn&#x27;t, right?</li>
            <li> If the price is right, then this is what you want.</li>
            <li> and right after i shower.  </li>
            <li> Another plus is that it also goes on very smooth and if you don&#x27;t put too much, dries clear.</li>
            <li> it fills nice, not tacky,gooy, or to dry.  </li>
            <li> It dissipates fast and quickly becomes unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> ; strong enough for a strenuous workout and smells super fresh too.</li>
            <li> It keeps you dry and smells nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Animal testing is not a valid way to test a product, do not support it with your money when you have many other options available.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried; it really does keep me dry for the whole day so long as I apply it at night, before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Women talk gladly about their cool hair gel or lipstick, but you would rarely find them talking about their wet armpits and how they handle them!</li>
            <li> They say you only get better with age</li>
            <li> Between the smell and the fact that it works very well, it&#x27;s well worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> (More on this later.)  </li>
            <li> Just to be on the safe side I reapply in the morning (just a personal choice)</li>
            <li> But if you aren&#x27;t entering an Olympic marathon, or you&#x27;re not a big sweating type (like me), this might be more antiperspirant than you need.    </li>
            <li> My only concern would be whether or not it&#x27;s safe for every day use</li>
            <li> my morning I definitely need more deodorant.</li>
            <li> Though this is still more effective than regular deodorant, it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot here in Colorado.  </li>
            <li> The first brand I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m willing to admit it because now I&#x27;m virtually odorless.  </li>
            <li> I woke up this morning after a hot,</li>
            <li> For the first time I looked to amazon for a cheaper option of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> The two pack I purchased is the cream like one, but I&#x27;m sure they have a solid stick as well.</li>
            <li> this is also a great deal considering it costs at least $8 per container at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I even used this in Jamaica when I got married in a strapless wedding dress.  </li>
            <li> Works all day and is absorbed quickly and completely without residue.</li>
            <li> We want to be able to handle the wetness and odor in a way that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get very nervous in public</li>
            <li> Its better than smelling of BO, but nobody wants to have an obvious deodorant smell either.</li>
            <li> Women&#x27;s Mitchum Advanced Control - 48 Hour Strength and Protection - Powder Fresh - Invisible Solid.</li>
            <li> However, if these cheaper alternatives don&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;ll be willing to buy this again, because it really does work.</li>
            <li> Also, I have some energetic hobbies - for example I do long sword fighting every week.</li>
            <li> So, as usual, I turned to Amazon for a good deal.  </li>
            <li> If it were the only product out there,  I would give the unscented a try, but thankfully, Degree products seem to get better reviews anyway and the powder scent particularly.</li>
            <li> this treatment is great, I stay dry all day long!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply too strong.  </li>
            <li> Strong enough for a man but made for a woman.</li>
            <li> Strong enough for my sweaty stinky man too.  </li>
            <li> And it certainly does stop sweating...</li>
            <li> I also tried this Certain dri</li>
            <li> I have tried Certain Dri, and that didn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any old regular deodorant, &amp; costs twice as much!</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s not a bad smell or too overwhelming, though, so I&#x27;m still using it - I&#x27;ll just get a different scent in the future.</li>
            <li> The smell is also very mild, which hides really well under her daily fragrance.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t justify spending this much month after month on a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wife really likes this deodorant and has made the switch.  </li>
            <li> This is a real shame.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate it so much.</li>
            <li> How much can one say about deodorant?</li>
            <li> Their clinical is waterproof (even though is isn&#x27;t labelled as such), it doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap perfume, and if you forget to use it one day, you&#x27;re still protected.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t sweat as much.</li>
            <li> never had problem with too much sweat, just offensive odor.  </li>
            <li> It does work very well however.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength Advanced Solid works great for me on my really stressful days.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every product on the market, plus some &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; all promising to eliminate the perspiration and odor.</li>
            <li> And, the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> And yes, she sniffed them to double check and they were still lightly scented.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a Deodorant that will help make it through the day without making my top wet.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and it works very well.</li>
            <li> it is VERY drying to the point where your skin can blister.</li>
            <li> I know I sweat a lot, but this claims to be &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34;, and I really didn&#x27;t feel like the antiperspirant was working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for mild sweating but if you&#x27;re a water fountain like me, I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> By far, this product beats everything!!!</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and odor free througout the day and night no matter if the weather is hot or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I sweat perhaps more than other people tend to do.</li>
            <li> I have never been as satisfied with any other deodorant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other clinical protection antiperspirants, but this has got to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is the smell is so powerful!</li>
            <li> just to find out that the company that makes this and many other brands, tests on animals.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of these at different levels and scent and while they all worked fine, the design (more than the additional cost) will hold be back from future purchase.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength Light and Fresh is definitely the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used in some time (since Teen Sprit Caribbean Cool, but since I&#x27;m no longer a teen, I needed a big girl deodorant).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s that cream garbage that I have always disliked strongly and felt you don&#x27;t get your money&#x27;s worth out from.</li>
            <li> We should be able to share helpful information with each other on how to handle normal things</li>
            <li> First and foremost, it doesn&#x27;t work for me any better than a plain old (MUCH cheaper) deodorant/antiperspirant does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It slides on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t mark off on clothes, and keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li> This product seems to control odor better than my previous deodorant</li>
            <li> and it was nearly half the price of what it was at CVS/grocery store and with free prime shipping!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than regular, following directions or not.</li>
            <li> My main issue (and</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of \\&quot;clinical strenght\\&quot; deodorant at this point and this is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad someone has finally come out with a product that actually works and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I will be realistic, though.  </li>
            <li> so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the high ratings and it lived up to the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;February 27, 2013 update - The first problem I had was solved, but if you have arthritis in your thumb joints, as I have, I do not recommend this product, as I have to use pliers to turn the knob.[[ASIN:B001F51VS4 Secret Clinical Strength Advanced Solid Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant Light And Fresh Scent 1.6 Oz (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m actually paying attention, it really does work!!</li>
            <li> I really like that I can apply this early in the morning (</li>
            <li> But many women engage in heavy athletic activities, and would probably just as soon not have dinner plate-sized sweat marks under their arms.</li>
            <li> As my spouse will tell you, I need \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; help :).</li>
            <li> i only reapply if i&#x27;m going out again in the evening to feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and captivating scent.</li>
            <li> do want to comment that I feel strongly that if you&#x27;re doing something that&#x27;s meant to be active - let&#x27;s say horseback riding or mountain biking - that you</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was surprised when I first began using it how fresh and dry</li>
            <li> The applicator lets me use just enough deodorant for the day, so it seems to help it last a good bit longer than some of the other deodorants that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I like Secret Clinical Strength Light and Fresh Scent Advanced Solid.</li>
            <li> This product is doing its job in keeping the perspiration and odor down, so that it doesn&#x27;t have to have a strong scent to cover-up its failures.    </li>
            <li> It has a nice, subtle scent also.</li>
            <li> It offers great protection that never once failed when I used it.      </li>
            <li> I attempted to buy the deodorant with the least amount of smell - light and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is normal and natural.</li>
            <li> well this product fixed that!    </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now and it really helps!</li>
            <li> The first and last brand of deodorant I will ever use, no matter the cost.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I have more sweat than the average women, especially in summer.</li>
            <li> the reason why I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five) is that the scent is too heavy and strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not that sensitive to scented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know it sounds like a commercial, but when you feel confident that you will be dry, and not have giant wet rings under your arms, it really does help you relax, and therefore you don&#x27;t sweat as much!</li>
            <li> I know it sounds like a commercial, but when you feel confident that you will be dry, and not have giant wet rings under your arms, it really does help you relax, and therefore you don&#x27;t sweat as much!</li>
            <li> Especially for women after a certain age when the body chemistry changes...  </li>
            <li> The wet solid applies smoothly without rubbing off on clothes (though if the applicator touches your clothes, it will rub off then).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME &amp; HOPE IN THIS PRODUCT.    </li>
            <li> and this problem has affected all aspects of my life-- completely.</li>
            <li> Also, makes me itch a bit, but I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Turns out this &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorant was only exasperating my underarm problems the whole time.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy without having to use your finger like the old school cream.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s alright</li>
            <li> Really and truly Secret Clinical works better than any antiperspirant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good thing, because it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I make sure to clamp down my arms for a long time after applying the deodorant so I don&#x27;t have to smell it.</li>
            <li> You plan for that shower afterward and cool down.</li>
            <li> I almost always end up with more under one arm than the other since the clicks are not very even.</li>
            <li> My gf has been a regular Dove user and we were glad to have the opportunity to try out this new product from Secret, thanks to Amazon Vine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this works any better than regular brands.  </li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t lighten the hair, and I was so interested in whether or not the hair would actually lighten</li>
            <li> It does cost a little more , but for those extra stressful days I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that if it isn&#x27;t absorbed into your skin enough, it will stain clothes white.</li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t think that I would recommend it to an exceptionally heavy sweater since I doubt it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I tried that Mitchum brand and it made my underarm area very itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really does keep you dry longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a long lasting deodorant, and do not let the size fool you, one box lasts me at least a month.</li>
            <li> This keeps me feeling fresh and dry all day long.</li>
            <li> but it certainly does last all day long.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s more of a cream than a solid, so it feels a little wet when you put it on and can smear).</li>
            <li> It also has a light, delicate smell.</li>
            <li> It will stop me from general sweating but in cases of heat and exertion you&#x27;re sweating, no way around it.</li>
            <li> This one actually minimizes it for the long run - you&#x27;ll always need deodorant because the odor is there, but it&#x27;s very minuscule.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a last-minute thing, I would say it takes up to a week to fully kick in, and then, well, you&#x27;re really not sweating much at all.</li>
            <li> and it will last all day, even if I go out after work into the early morning hours.</li>
            <li> I barely noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Then I tried Dove&#x27;s clinical one because apparently it also lightened underarm hair along with getting rid of odor.  </li>
            <li> Barely a hint of odor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m returning these and going back to my old deodorant, which can be found here:</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use drysol regularly because it is with frequent use</li>
            <li> You too can find out more at the Secret website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to go ahead and stick with the cheaper, more affordable Secret brands that still work for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I liked this product.</li>
            <li> However, I did feel DOVE worked better than SECRET for me.</li>
            <li> I sweat constantly and Secret is the only kind that will work on me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just at this price, there are probably more economical ways to keep your heavy sweating down to a ladylike glow without the heavy pricetag.</li>
            <li> , I really didn&#x27;t notice any particular difference in this product than any of the other Secret deoderant sticks that are available.    </li>
            <li> I tried other brand name products like Mitchum and Certain Dri, but none have worked as well as this one has.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not the 99 cent on sale stuff you throw in the cart at the supermarket (actually, at this price it&#x27;s nowhere near a bargain antiperspirant!)    </li>
            <li> Though it may not seem like there is much product, a little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a solidly anti-walmart shopper, so perhaps this is why I find this offer to be such a good deal, but at Target, this same deoderant is twice as expensive as getting it here in a two pack.</li>
            <li> Heck, if your underarms are sweating that much, undoubtedly so are other parts of your body.</li>
            <li> I am no longer the social butterfly I was known to be</li>
            <li> When you finally get product to appear, you can look at how far you had to turn the product pusher up and how much is left, and it&#x27;s about 1/2 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; product seems to truly work better than regular Secret products.  </li>
            <li> This clinical strength version does seem to work better than the other Secrets I had in the past as there is no sweat or white residue.  </li>
            <li> It worked during a very stressful public speaking engagement as well as during a game of volleyball on a very hot day.</li>
            <li> I was partial to Secret brand since I have used it most of my life but was looking for something that would keep me feeling fresh and keep me dry all day long.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Clinical strength\\&quot; in an antiperspirant may be a bit much for the average woman who isn&#x27;t a longshoreman, or who doesn&#x27;t sweat like one.    </li>
            <li> So after having washed it off in the shower at night, and sweating in my sleep, the next morning, barely a peep.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Solid\\&quot; is a bit of a misnomer, as it&#x27;s much softer in consistency than your typical antiperspirant or deodorant \\&quot;solid\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> was in hopes it would work but as far as ordor control, it was&lt;br /&gt;disappointing; however, it did keep me dry.  </li>
            <li> I sweat a lot - have all my life - and have often had to either/or shower twice daily, and/or apply a second dose of deoderant to be &amp;#34;somewhat socially acceptable&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My mom has been blessed with naturally odorless underarms, and i&#x27;m the only other girl in the family.  </li>
            <li> size of it is half of what a normal deodorant is.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream in a special despenser so it goes on like solid deodorant.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength Antiperspirant/Deodorant provides moisture protection through both maximum strength ingredients and in the unique method (time of day/night)</li>
            <li> Other than that, there&#x27;s nothing bad to say about Secret Light and Fresh Advanced Solid.</li>
            <li> smells good, the only bad thing about is when I forgot use it at night, some times loose the effectiveness,</li>
            <li> It was really hot and humid and I had no problems at least from my under arms.  </li>
            <li> Hence, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long as a comparable size stick.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t necessarily prevent the odor after a long summer day.</li>
            <li> bought this deodorant for the long lasting effect.</li>
            <li> I now alternate between Secret Clinical Strength and Certain Dri (which absolutely does work in stopping sweat, but burns a little, especially after shaving).</li>
            <li> It is funny how some topics are fine to talk about - like how thick or thin your hair is - while other topics are considered taboo.</li>
            <li> I used to be bothered by ugly underarm stains in my clothes and was always self conscious about my under arm odor but not any more.</li>
            <li> Last for hours (at least a whole day)</li>
            <li> that never really got the job done, or left the white streaks on my shirt.</li>
            <li> The package is VERY small to begin with and when I received it, it was only half full.</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old african american, and I have had an excessive sweating problem for some time now..</li>
            <li> It has enough scent so that you know you are wearing something, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering like a lot of other extra strength deodorants can be.  </li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength is amazing and has seriously changed my life, I am SO thankful,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately if you have primary hyperhidrosis like I do, this deodorant will not fix anything.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days when women were expected to be corset-laced dolls who sat in a corner and blinked occasionally.</li>
            <li> it kept me all day long.</li>
            <li> for me, I also think it wears long.</li>
            <li> It will keep you smelling fresh during a baseball game in July, on a long train ride from Atlanta to DC, while camping and hiking in August, etc.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it to use the Secret.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s well worth it to use the Secret.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this high quality product comes with a high quality price tag.  </li>
            <li> She informs me that this is the only deodorant that works for her (other brands don&#x27;t prevent sweating; this one does).</li>
            <li> With the other ones, you will always smell with the same intensity.  </li>
            <li> I love this deodorant, I have a broken ankle and it was hard to get to the store</li>
            <li> It seems to wear very long in terms of protection.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain her clothing, nor does it dry out her arm pits.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works and keeps me dry even in the humid summer.</li>
            <li> It does keep you dry if you use the product with the rules</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old gal and have suffered from excessive underarm perspiration for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like is that I couldn&#x27;t wear it if I had black clothes on because it is not clear drying (nor does it claim to be) and so it leaves white marks on dark clothes.  </li>
            <li> This is a big deal, considering in the 10 years I have known her, she has used the same brand and &#x27;model&#x27; for her underarm protection (perhaps this is a common female trait).</li>
            <li> So, you&#x27;re getting only about 1/4 deodorant compared to an average sized one.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing it comes with 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can use regular deodarant during the rest of the year, but in the summer I always smell a little musty even with deodarant.</li>
            <li> So you get wet and a bit smelly.</li>
            <li> absolutely no problem now.  </li>
            <li> It feels just as gentle on my skin as the Secret formula I had been using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret for my whole life.  </li>
            <li> she got home, she didn&#x27;t bathe (too exhausted) and went to straight sleep.</li>
            <li> this is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> No strong fragrance to distract your regular perfume scent.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say it has affected my life so very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Secret products, and the Dove one, where it works enough for a few hours or for your \\&quot;workday\\&quot; to end, and it simply covers it up, but this one will work from the beginning of your day, to the next morning.  </li>
            <li> The odor control worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> Some other creams I have tried, like Dove, seemed to be sticky.  </li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s meant to be applied at night, but I&#x27;m stuck in my ways and still put it on in the morning like any other deodorant.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, the deodorant was weaker than my normal deodorant, so if I wore this alone, I would smell even worse than I did normally.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Secret Clinical Strength because it&#x27;s a product that will not let you down.</li>
            <li> So we can get fairly active.</li>
            <li> on days when I know I will be active</li>
            <li> (in fact, the only drawback is its hard to rinse off in the shower).</li>
            <li> I left negative feedback and it was removed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there is not alot of product in it.  </li>
            <li> I just choose to not use it everyday - using regular Secret solid instead.</li>
            <li> Other types of Secret doederants don&#x27;t do it for me, but this stuff protects me like no other.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend you try this product if other antiperspirant/deodorants have failed you.</li>
            <li> You have to turn it upside down and tap it to release the antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> Re-order, as expected!!</li>
            <li> I mean, I could just be sitting around, nevermind exercising, and by the end of the day, or even within hours, you could smell my odor mixed with the deodorant I&#x27;m wearing because I&#x27;m just sweating it all off.</li>
            <li> So there are definitely occasions that I need to have a product that can handle serious demands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The consistency is creamy in an odd sort of way.</li>
            <li> I was using a dove deodorant and antiperspirant but it wore off half way through the day.</li>
            <li> Once you twist the deodorant up to a useable level, it appears as though you&#x27;ve already gone through half of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will purchase that after I use up this one because I typically prefer solids.</li>
            <li> P&amp;G denies this claim but just Google it, there is hidden video proof of this company specifically to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is a bit more expensive than I am used to, but that is the trade off</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging is not good - the plastic cap that is between your arm and the antiperspirant came off on both of mine, leaving me to precariously apply with it half pressed back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sweat when its cold, hot, raining, sunny, windy...etc.</li>
            <li> It does leave a mess on clothes but you will have the coverage as it states.  </li>
            <li> I tired numerous deodorants, even prescription strength from other brands, but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> I had previously tried the Secret clinical strength (because I had a coupon), but didn&#x27;t want to shell out anymore extra cash once I was done, which is why I tried the Dove one.  </li>
            <li> I typically buy the regular line of secret deodorants</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, it&#x27;s not gooey or slimy.</li>
            <li> In that case, Secret Clinical Strength will definitely put an impregnable barrier between sweat and your clothing.    </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say the same for Secret.</li>
            <li> Sigh I guess I have to go to a dermatologists because I just wasted money..</li>
            <li> I bought Secret because I could find DOVE at a local store.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so messy.</li>
            <li> It works, controlling odor and wetness, but then, so does the Secret invisible solid I had been using.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve been using this product and are not having results (or are getting worse, as I was), try switching to a cheaper, regular deodorant stick.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday and not at night but in the morning before work.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday since the product was released.</li>
            <li> A bit odd, though, that the company recommends putting it on each evening rather than the morning -- not sure why.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me dry, no matter how hard a day I have!</li>
            <li> I had been using this deodorant for about two years when I looked at reviews online, since my excessive perspiration had only gotten significantly worse with time, to the point where I was looking into Botox or surgery because it was interfering with life.</li>
            <li> Secret deodrant has been around for quite a long time and is still living up to it&#x27;s reputation.  </li>
            <li> This product was not very effective for me.</li>
            <li> Growing up I was always really insecure about my seriously sweaty pits and always thought it was just something I was going to have to live with.</li>
            <li> And as someone who usually exclusively uses fragrance-free products, I didn&#x27;t mind the scent.  </li>
            <li> The product size is 1.6oz which I thought was a small amount for the price.  </li>
            <li> While I am not sure know what about the product is clinical strength, it did work</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I can afford to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like the push-up and through design where the deodorant is almost creme like and pushes through a grid to be applied.</li>
            <li> Helps my gym confidence as a heavy perspirer!</li>
            <li> I put my fate in this product but it does not work; if your problem is excessive dont even bother.   </li>
            <li> I have problems with excessive underarm sweating.</li>
            <li> what I usually use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure if that is a defect or not.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that it can make a mess of your clothes unless you&#x27;re very careful</li>
            <li> As soon as I switched to a regular (Secret) stick, the perspiration decreased remarkably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did a little checking at the Secret website and this is so the product is applied when you are resting (usually evening).  </li>
            <li> , these deodorant sticks are very small, and there&#x27;s very little product in them.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I never sweat when I was wearing it until I did a hard workout.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to even concentrate on anything else because of this problem.  </li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and was shocked at how little deodorant they actually put in there.</li>
            <li> I have sensative skin and never had a negative skin reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I give this product negative stars.</li>
            <li> Not smelly in the least.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice it until it was too late to return</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to admit that I sweat and smell really bad, like my dad and brother!</li>
            <li> No more forgetting in the morning rush!  </li>
            <li> If you are someone who seriously has a sweating problem I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to do the job without being sticky or otherwise uncomfortable and without any heavy scent.</li>
            <li> No more period !!</li>
            <li> Secret has been my go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li> have tried both Secret and Dove</li>
            <li> but I tend to go with Secret.</li>
            <li> Thank you secret...</li>
            <li> I have used Secret Clinical Strength AND Secret Clinical Strength Sport.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret Clinical Strength for some time now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Secret user for years.  </li>
            <li> Another coupon appeared, and I tried the Secret clinical again.  </li>
            <li> Secret clinical is not drying or irritating at all.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; would mean irritating, but that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
            <li> For this unsettling warning, I subtract 1 start from my rating.</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> But, on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Way to go Secret!</li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> but I am desperate for a solution.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> It is very expensive</li>
            <li> but i am very angry about this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that any of us smell that bad.</li>
            <li> I still could smell it all the time which I found really annoying.  </li>
            <li> and I hated it</li>
            <li> I tried to wear this deodorant a couple of time, but each time the smell gave me an awful headache.</li>
            <li> This keeps me from having terrible sweat marks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength is wonderful!  I looked for it everywhere and found that I could not afford it everywhere.  So, as usual, I turned to Amazon for a good deal.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> Great product. Especially for teen girls.  A little expensive but well worth it.  It has a nice, subtle scent also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this works any better than regular brands.  The directions state you should put this on at night???   And then you jump in the shower in the morning... so you put it on again?  Use regular stuff?    Didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than regular, following directions or not.</li>
            <li> Secret has been my go-to deodorant. This clinical strength version does seem to work better than the other Secrets I had in the past as there is no sweat or white residue.  The only concern is the note about consulting a doctor if one has kidney disease...that seems ominous.  What kind of harm would it do?  For this unsettling warning, I subtract 1 start from my rating.</li>
            <li> As I do not ultra sweat I do not know how well over normal good deodrant it is, but what i can say is for normal use it works  well, smells nice but not overpowring, it fills nice, not tacky,gooy, or to dry.  I have sensative skin and never had a negative skin reaction to it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite deodorant for when I really need a strong antiperspirant. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about using such a potent product every day, so I just use it when I know I need something stronger than usual.</li>
            <li> I have tried several deodrants and must say that this one is the best I have come to like.  It&#x27;s great for those days when you would like to wear perfume and don&#x27;t want that clash of smells that usually happens with most deodrants.  This is very light in fragrance but strong enough to take care of you all day.  It does not leave a filmy layer on dark clothing and is great for those who have problems with sensitivity.  The price is comparable for the product since you are getting something that actually works and works well I might add.  Secret deodrant has been around for quite a long time and is still living up to it&#x27;s reputation.  They say you only get better with age well this is a prime example.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to think about what this is doing to my body, but - dang, it&#x27;s effective.   You apply at night. This isn&#x27;t a last-minute thing, I would say it takes up to a week to fully kick in, and then, well, you&#x27;re really not sweating much at all. Don&#x27;t plan on using this before a big event if you&#x27;re not used to it. Scent is pleasant, not really noticeable. I recommend this based on results - but do your own research and decide if you&#x27;re comfortable breaking your body&#x27;s sweat patterns.</li>
            <li> I can use regular deodarant during the rest of the year, but in the summer I always smell a little musty even with deodarant. I tried that Mitchum brand and it made my underarm area very itchy and dry. When this product was introduced on the market, I fell in love. It works and when you sweat it smells great because of the composition of the deodarant. IT does not dry out the underarm and, if you skip a day, you still smell good. This is a WONDERFUL product.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength Light and Fresh is definitely the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used in some time (since Teen Sprit Caribbean Cool, but since I&#x27;m no longer a teen, I needed a big girl deodorant). It has a very fresh, light scent, so fresh that I really have no need to wear any perfume. The applicator lets me use just enough deodorant for the day, so it seems to help it last a good bit longer than some of the other deodorants that I&#x27;ve used. That&#x27;s a good thing, because it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side. Between the smell and the fact that it works very well, it&#x27;s well worth the price to me. The only bad thing about it is that it can make a mess of your clothes unless you&#x27;re very careful (it&#x27;s more of a cream than a solid, so it feels a little wet when you put it on and can smear). Other than that, there&#x27;s nothing bad to say about Secret Light and Fresh Advanced Solid.</li>
            <li> This deodorant definitely delivers on all of its claims.  It offers great protection that never once failed when I used it.      The &#x27;light and fresh&#x27; scent is very nice.  It has enough scent so that you know you are wearing something, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering like a lot of other extra strength deodorants can be.  This product is doing its job in keeping the perspiration and odor down, so that it doesn&#x27;t have to have a strong scent to cover-up its failures.    Unfortunately, this high quality product comes with a high quality price tag.  The price is the only thing preventing me from giving it a 5-star rating.  I can&#x27;t justify spending this much month after month on a deodorant.  I think I am going to continue to try to find cheaper substitutes that may work almost as well.  However, if these cheaper alternatives don&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;ll be willing to buy this again, because it really does work.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; product seems to truly work better than regular Secret products.  A bit odd, though, that the company recommends putting it on each evening rather than the morning -- not sure why.  And as someone who usually exclusively uses fragrance-free products, I didn&#x27;t mind the scent.  It dissipates fast and quickly becomes unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength Antiperspirant/Deodorant provides moisture protection through both maximum strength ingredients and in the unique method (time of day/night) it is applied.  (More on this later.)  The product is technically a solid but has the consistency of a paste.  My wife liked the consistency and found that it went on easily and clear without didn&#x27;t leave marks in her clothing.  She reported that it kept her dry all day and that she liked the fragrance which is light and not overpowering.  The instructions say to put this on in the evening.  I did a little checking at the Secret website and this is so the product is applied when you are resting (usually evening).  This allows more of the product to be drawn into the ducts stopping wetness.  You too can find out more at the Secret website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my wife liked it.  The product size is 1.6oz which I thought was a small amount for the price.  While I am not sure know what about the product is clinical strength, it did work so I am giving it four stars.  If you have problems with wetness, this might just be what you need.</li>
            <li> Ideal for heavy sweaters like me (sounds like I&#x27;m a parka!) this antiperspirant is pricey but worth it. Although it is obviously powerful, the sensation of using this product is smooth and fresh smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wife really likes this deodorant and has made the switch.  This is a big deal, considering in the 10 years I have known her, she has used the same brand and &#x27;model&#x27; for her underarm protection (perhaps this is a common female trait).</li>
            <li> I like Secret Clinical Strength Light and Fresh Scent Advanced Solid. It works well for my body type and the scent is not too overpowering (as many women&#x27;s anti-perspirants are).  My main issue (and the reason I only gave four stars) is that the instructions call for \\&quot;two clicks\\&quot; to dispense the solid.  I almost always end up with more under one arm than the other since the clicks are not very even.</li>
            <li> It is funny how some topics are fine to talk about - like how thick or thin your hair is - while other topics are considered taboo. Women talk gladly about their cool hair gel or lipstick, but you would rarely find them talking about their wet armpits and how they handle them! This is a real shame. We should be able to share helpful information with each other on how to handle normal things our bodies do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We sweat. Gone are the days when women were expected to be corset-laced dolls who sat in a corner and blinked occasionally. Nowadays women can bike, hike, ride horses, dance all night and face challenges all day. And yes, we sweat. This is normal and natural. We want to be able to handle the wetness and odor in a way that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get very nervous in public so I sweat perhaps more than other people tend to do. Also, I have some energetic hobbies - for example I do long sword fighting every week. These are Robin Hood style swords, not fencing foils. So we can get fairly active. So there are definitely occasions that I need to have a product that can handle serious demands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried both Secret and Dove and I like both a lot - but I tend to go with Secret. It goes on smoothly, it&#x27;s not gooey or slimy. It stays put. It has a light scent - I don&#x27;t like to smell purfumey. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to comment that I feel strongly that if you&#x27;re doing something that&#x27;s meant to be active - let&#x27;s say horseback riding or mountain biking - that you *should* sweat. Sweating is the way your body balances its heat levels. If you blocked all your sweating, and your body was trying to sweat because it felt too hot, this would not be a good thing. So you get wet and a bit smelly. You plan for that shower afterward and cool down. Heck, if your underarms are sweating that much, undoubtedly so are other parts of your body. Let your body do what it was meant to do, and keep yourself healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that being said, if you&#x27;re in those many other situations where you do NOT need to sweat to stay healthy - like when you&#x27;re standing in front of a roomful of people and they&#x27;re all staring at you - it&#x27;s well worth it to use the Secret. I know it sounds like a commercial, but when you feel confident that you will be dry, and not have giant wet rings under your arms, it really does help you relax, and therefore you don&#x27;t sweat as much! So it&#x27;s a wonderful self-supporting confidence loop.those many other situations where you do NOT need to sweat to stay healthy - like when you&#x27;re standing in front of a roomful of people and they&#x27;re all staring at you - it&#x27;s well worth it to use the Secret.

            <li> I had my daughter try this. She informs me that this is the only deodorant that works for her (other brands don&#x27;t prevent sweating; this one does). She puts it on the night before, and it lasts for 24 hours.  It doesn&#x27;t stain her clothing, nor does it dry out her arm pits. So based on her report, this product lives up to its billing that it provides effective layers of protection.  My daughter added that it has a nice scent that is not too strong.  In short, for her, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife is really happy with these &amp; they are a good price compared to stores.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with getting pit stains while just sitting at my desk at work. I tried other brand name products like Mitchum and Certain Dri, but none have worked as well as this one has. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and I would highly recommend you try this product if other antiperspirant/deodorants have failed you.</li>
            <li> This product get&#x27;s a definite A+ from me. I had tried Mitchum and Dove clinical strength but those just didn&#x27;t cut it so this was going to be the last straw for me. Needless to say, I am very pleased. I used to be bothered by ugly underarm stains in my clothes and was always self conscious about my under arm odor but not any more. I do follow the instructions and I apply at night after I get out of the shower. Just to be on the safe side I reapply in the morning (just a personal choice) but all in all I have no complaints, only praises about this product.   Thank you secret... You&#x27;ve changed my life and I appreciate it so much.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Clinical strength\\&quot; in an antiperspirant may be a bit much for the average woman who isn&#x27;t a longshoreman, or who doesn&#x27;t sweat like one.    But many women engage in heavy athletic activities, and would probably just as soon not have dinner plate-sized sweat marks under their arms. In that case, Secret Clinical Strength will definitely put an impregnable barrier between sweat and your clothing.    The consistency is creamy in an odd sort of way. This is definitely not the 99 cent on sale stuff you throw in the cart at the supermarket (actually, at this price it&#x27;s nowhere near a bargain antiperspirant!)    It also isn&#x27;t something you slather on right before you throw on your clothes and run out the door. You&#x27;re supposed to put it on the night before - I guess so it has the chance to plug up all the pores in your underarms and make you sweat-proof.    The scent is nice, pleasant, not too heavy. And it certainly does stop sweating...any sweating.     In short, it works. But if you aren&#x27;t entering an Olympic marathon, or you&#x27;re not a big sweating type (like me), this might be more antiperspirant than you need.    That can be a good thing, if you don&#x27;t want to take any chances. It&#x27;s just at this price, there are probably more economical ways to keep your heavy sweating down to a ladylike glow without the heavy pricetag.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength Advanced Solid works as advertised.  I have no problems with its efficacy.  However, I am not too keen on the consistency of the product.  \\&quot;Solid\\&quot; is a bit of a misnomer, as it&#x27;s much softer in consistency than your typical antiperspirant or deodorant \\&quot;solid\\&quot;.  Hence, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long as a comparable size stick.  Works well, but if you like it, be prepared to purchase more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had hyperhidrosis since I was a kid. Unfortunately if you have primary hyperhidrosis like I do, this deodorant will not fix anything. It&#x27;s pretty good for mild sweating but if you&#x27;re a water fountain like me, I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Actually my wife loves this stuff. As it makes her  happy it makes me happy, thus the favorable review. I&#x27;ll buy it again when this batch runs out.</li>
            <li> As someone who sweats easily and alot, finding an antiperspirant that works is challenging. Although I like this product alot I am not sure if I can afford to keep buying it. If you have wetness issues you should try this RX deodorant. It works!</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot. Most antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for me which is why I decided to give this product a try. It actually works!!! The next day I don&#x27;t sweat! The only problem I have is that since you are supposed to put it on before you go to bed, a lot of the time I forget to put it on. Also, I noticed white marks on my sheets from the deodorant. Not always, but sometimes...no big deal since they come out in the wash. My husband loves the smell and says it smells like watermelon. I don&#x27;t think so, but it does smell nice! Give this a try! I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This was a good choice!!! this treatment is great, I stay dry all day long!! smells good, the only bad thing about is when I forgot use it at night, some times loose the effectiveness,</li>
            <li> How much can one say about deodorant? Either it works, or it doesn&#x27;t, right? Mostly, yes.  I have tried several different brands of \\&quot;clinical strenght\\&quot; deodorant at this point and this is not my favorite.  It definitely works better than Secrets regular stregth, which is great, but I still sweat with it. The fragrance is REALLY strong and smells like cheap perfume (no fragrance would be better in my opinion) and if you forget to put in on one day, you know it.  Not so with Dove. Yes, this is a shameless plug for their superior product.  Their clinical is waterproof (even though is isn&#x27;t labelled as such), it doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap perfume, and if you forget to use it one day, you&#x27;re still protected. Oh, and I never sweat when I was wearing it until I did a hard workout.  No sweaty T-shirt sleeves with Dove. Can&#x27;t say the same for Secret. Sorry.  I will probably stick with Dove from now on.</li>
            <li> Last for hours (at least a whole day); strong enough for a strenuous workout and smells super fresh too. Anything and everything you want from an antiperspirant!</li>
            <li> The odor control worked extremely well. I&#x27;m not sure I like the push-up and through design where the deodorant is almost creme like and pushes through a grid to be applied. I tried a couple of these at different levels and scent and while they all worked fine, the design (more than the additional cost) will hold be back from future purchase.</li>
            <li> I do think that this is the best, or at least strongest, deodorant available.  I received two of these (in different scents) from the vine program and they work equally well.  My only concern would be whether or not it&#x27;s safe for every day use but it certainly does last all day long.  Scent is a bit strong for my preference but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> Given to my mom to review. She says it works great and smells great. What more can you ask? If the price is right, then this is what you want.</li>
            <li> All-day wetness and odor protection, pleasant scent. I have never been as satisfied with any other deodorant - I hope they never take this one off the market.</li>
            <li> To me, Secret has the best brand reputation for deodorant, and this product is no exception. It slides on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t mark off on clothes, and keeps me dry all day. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I started using this over the summer, applying it before I went to bed. At first I thought it was a miracle, it didn&#x27;t burn and left me smelling great. I didn&#x27;t even need to put on deodorant the following day because this stuff lasted 24 hours. After about a month though, it stopped having this affect. I put it on at night and my morning I definitely need more deodorant. Really disappointing. I now alternate between Secret Clinical Strength and Certain Dri (which absolutely does work in stopping sweat, but burns a little, especially after shaving). Once I run out though, I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Helps my gym confidence as a heavy perspirer!</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant before however Amazon has a great price for it.  This deodorant works and keeps me dry even in the humid summer.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying, I like this product, it does work, but to be perfectly honest, I really didn&#x27;t notice any particular difference in this product than any of the other Secret deoderant sticks that are available.    Admittedly, it is a good product, but the price just does not appeal to me.     I hope that P&amp;G is not trying to make this one of their flagship products, because I just don&#x27;t forsee this product taking off with the populus consumer.    I think I&#x27;m going to go ahead and stick with the cheaper, more affordable Secret brands that still work for me.</li>
            <li> As my spouse will tell you, I need \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; help :). This stuff seems to do the job without being sticky or otherwise uncomfortable and without any heavy scent. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have found.  Prior to this I had tried everything from Dove Clinical strength to Mitchum, but nothing seemed to truly stop wetness and elminate odor - even after a good workout this stuff seems to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a very non-obtrusive scent and the cream applies smoothly.  Some other creams I have tried, like Dove, seemed to be sticky.  I really like that I can apply this early in the morning (7am) and it will last all day, even if I go out after work into the early morning hours.</li>
            <li> This is it you guys. This is the STUFF. This is the only thing that has ever worked for me and I&#x27;ll never go back. Growing up I was always really insecure about my seriously sweaty pits and always thought it was just something I was going to have to live with. I went to the doctor and even got pills to take so I wouldn&#x27;t sweat as much. I also tried this Certain dri and I hated it, It burned and did not work for me. Secret Clinical Strength is amazing and has seriously changed my life, I am SO thankful, if you have the same issues, give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried; it really does keep me dry for the whole day so long as I apply it at night, before I go to bed. It also has a light, delicate smell. I&#x27;ve tried other clinical protection antiperspirants, but this has got to be my favorite. Though it may not seem like there is much product, a little really goes a long way. One pack lasts me about 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> I always buy my deorderant off of amazon.  It is a bit better saving, and they deliver it to my front door.  I know that it is gonna get used.</li>
            <li> I have used Secret Clinical Strength AND Secret Clinical Strength Sport. THEY DO NOT WORK. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME &amp; HOPE IN THIS PRODUCT.    I am a 20 year old gal and have suffered from excessive underarm perspiration for a long time. Needless to say it has affected my life so very much. I am no longer the social butterfly I was known to be and this problem has affected all aspects of my life-- completely. I am in college and refrain from going going up to the front of the class or making public presentations, and raising my hand or arm for that matter or drawing ANY attention to myself. It is hard to even concentrate on anything else because of this problem.  I sweat when its cold, hot, raining, sunny, windy...etc. and right after i shower.  I put my fate in this product but it does not work; if your problem is excessive dont even bother.   I have just ordered Maxim antiperspirant, which is pricier but I am desperate for a solution.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, but the deodorant product is expired as of 07/13. It is now 10/13. I don&#x27;t appreciate that. I will not order from them again.</li>
            <li> Though this is still more effective than regular deodorant, it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I&#x27;d expected. I still find that my stress sweats aren&#x27;t alleviated by this.</li>
            <li> I have problems with excessive underarm sweating. After searching online I decided to give this product a try. It is very expensive so I had high expectations. I barely noticed any difference. I&#x27;ve heard great reviews but it personally didn&#x27;t work for me. If you are someone who seriously has a sweating problem I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, I have purchased it multiple times, the smell is not that great, but the product works.</li>
            <li> have switched to this exclusively and all version like it scented or not.  wonderful solution for odor.  never had problem with too much sweat, just offensive odor.  absolutely no problem now.  this price is unbeatable in stores</li>
            <li> This product comes with a warning on the box: Do not use if you have kidney disease. I don&#x27;t know that any of us smell that bad. It does work very well however. It is a very thick cream in a special despenser so it goes on like solid deodorant. You roll up two clicks-worth to  measure the dose. My concern about kidney toxicity has led me to only use it on strenuous activity days though. It will keep you smelling fresh during a baseball game in July, on a long train ride from Atlanta to DC, while camping and hiking in August, etc. I just choose to not use it everyday - using regular Secret solid instead. I don&#x27;t have kidney problems... but why not protect them whenever possible?</li>
            <li> this product does work. but there are some rules you have to do for it to work. You can&#x27;t use it after you shower, use it at bed time, can&#x27;t use it after shaving. And if there are any people out there that are like me. I put deodorant after I shower at night. It does keep you dry if you use the product with the rules</li>
            <li> This stuff is so smelly and gets smellier throughout the day, I guess as it mixes with body odor. I had to throw it away and try another brand. I just couldn&#x27;t take it. If it were the only product out there,  I would give the unscented a try, but thankfully, Degree products seem to get better reviews anyway and the powder scent particularly. Just ordered it. Here&#x27;s hoping.</li>
            <li> My husband always used to complain that my underarms were smelly at the end of the day...    well this product fixed that!    I use one click after my shower every AM, no need to reapply.  i only reapply if i&#x27;m going out again in the evening to feel fresh.  My husband now says i&#x27;m only allowed to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Low wax, which doesn&#x27;t make your armpits rough.&lt;br /&gt;2. Smell is good plus it makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  Nice, light fragrance, superb antiperspirant action. I used to use Mitchum but this is even better. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After the birth of my second child I just sweated &amp; smelled like a totally different person.  I tired numerous deodorants, even prescription strength from other brands, but nothing worked.  This one is amazing and works so well.  Has a very light smell and even comes in waterproof which is great for summertime &amp; vacations.  I am sticking to this!!!!!! Been using it for six months &amp; not ever giving it up!</li>
            <li> I love a deodorant &amp; antiperspirant that will really perform as they claim to. I was partial to Secret brand since I have used it most of my life but was looking for something that would keep me feeling fresh and keep me dry all day long. I have to admit I was surprised when I first began using it how fresh and dry it kept me all day long. The protection it provides me with is one that I can depend on day after day. I would highly recommend Secret Clinical Strength because it&#x27;s a product that will not let you down.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and captivating scent. It truly eliminates odors with the release of &amp;#34;out of the world&amp;#34; fresh scent and I love it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is a joke. It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any old regular deodorant, &amp; costs twice as much! Also, the smell is good, but incredibly potent.  I have had friends tell me they can smell it, when they stand nearby. Its better than smelling of BO, but nobody wants to have an obvious deodorant smell either. I give this product negative stars.</li>
            <li> My gf has been a regular Dove user and we were glad to have the opportunity to try out this new product from Secret, thanks to Amazon Vine. Having used it for the last three weeks, both of us were quite happy with this trial. In terms of performance, we found that it works as advertised. I guess it&#x27;s not too surprising given that it contains the proven ingredient (Aluminum Zirconium Trichlorohydrex Gly) that appears in most antiperspirants. At the end of day, even after a half-hour gym session, the antiperspirant is still working despite it doesn&#x27;t claim to be waterproof. The cream texture is easy to apply (not wax like), and it does not appear to leave traces on the clothes after washing, which is very important to us. The smell is also very mild, which hides really well under her daily fragrance. I think the deciding factor for her will be cost, which we have yet to do the comparison to the local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret Clinical Strength for some time now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.  It is grease free and doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery or sticky residue on your underarm or clothing,  It is odor free and glides on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other deodorants and this is the best that I have found for what I need. It keeps me dry and odor free througout the day and night no matter if the weather is hot or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad someone has finally come out with a product that actually works and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! It is the only one that I will use and it doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes. It keeps me dry and is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on smoothly and provides good protection during the warmer weather.  I do find however that after awhile, as with any deodorant, it seems to not be as effective.  Because of that I stopped using it for awhile and am now giving it another try.</li>
            <li> Best Deodorant EVER!!! I used to have to alternate antiperspirants/deodorants and I&#x27;ve been using the clinical strength formulas for a coupe years now. I was happy to buy them in bulk at a great price because they aren&#x27;t cheep especially in stores.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the high ratings and it lived up to the reviews.  Works all day and is absorbed quickly and completely without residue.</li>
            <li> It works great! Especially for women after a certain age when the body chemistry changes...  But, on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I was using a dove deodorant and antiperspirant but it wore off half way through the day. This deodorant and antiperspirant works amazingly well. I apply it at night, like the directions say. This makes showering in the morning a bit more tedious; I found that showering in the morning causes the antiperspirant to wear off by the end of the day. If I shower at night and then apply the deodorant, it works fine. The only problem I have is the smell is so powerful! It is almost nauseating. I make sure to clamp down my arms for a long time after applying the deodorant so I don&#x27;t have to smell it.</li>
            <li> Buy &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s way better than the normal stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant, I have a broken ankle and it was hard to get to the store so it was very easy to order it online and have it delivered to the house. I will be doing this in the future as well!!</li>
            <li> Re-order, as expected!!</li>
            <li> Really and truly Secret Clinical works better than any antiperspirant I have ever tried. Ever. It worked during a very stressful public speaking engagement as well as during a game of volleyball on a very hot day. And it lasts the entire day (in fact, the only drawback is its hard to rinse off in the shower).</li>
            <li> This deodorant really does keep you dry longer.  Both my husband and I use it, as it is effective but not too strongly perfumed.</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old african american, and I have had an excessive sweating problem for some time now.. I have tried Certain Dri, and that didn&#x27;t work.. So after reading reviews and such, I decided to try this hoping it would work.. WRONG! I apply this as directed at night 30 mins after i take my shower before bed, I apply two clicks. I wake up and within hours, I&#x27;m sweating again!! Sigh I guess I have to go to a dermatologists because I just wasted money.. AGAIN</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Great for triple digit temperatures, prevents stress or nervous sweat, etc. No matter the situation or what life throws at you that day this stuff works. Another bonus is that it goes on smooth and is not crumbly or noticeable with sleeveless shirts.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this worked as an anti-perspirant.  However, I could not get over the smell.  It&#x27;s simply too strong.  It&#x27;s a clean and fresh scent, but still too strong.  Went with the hypoallergenic, unscented one, which is perfect.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I liked this product. I do think that it lasts longer than some of the regular deodorants I&#x27;ve tried through the years. The scent is very mild -it&#x27;s always a plus since I don&#x27;t like overpowering deodorants. However, the effect I got from this deodorant was definitely not \\&quot;clinical\\&quot;. It didn&#x27;t reduce the amount I sweat and it didn&#x27;t necessarily prevent the odor after a long summer day. Overall, I don&#x27;t think that I would recommend it to an exceptionally heavy sweater since I doubt it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with this product.  It worked great at controlling wetness.  The only thing I did not like is that I couldn&#x27;t wear it if I had black clothes on because it is not clear drying (nor does it claim to be) and so it leaves white marks on dark clothes.  Otherwise, it worked great and I would definitely use this again.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed , I no longer sweat !! When I get stressed out , exercise or over heated , it definitely showed ,as well as smelled.No more period !! I actually tested it out big time in every situation, I no longer have to worry!! It&#x27;s scent smells heavenly and my skin under my arms is actually getting softer !!</li>
            <li> I bought Secret because I could find DOVE at a local store.  I attempted to buy the deodorant with the least amount of smell - light and fresh. I still could smell it all the time which I found really annoying.  I also found myself feeling like it hadn&#x27;t lasted all day and when I got home from work I needed to reapply if I was going out again. I dislike the scent but as for the strength.. I&#x27;ve found since I&#x27;ve hit 30 I&#x27;m sweating a lot (a physician is the next step) - so it might just be me! However, I did feel DOVE worked better than SECRET for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now and it really helps! Plus it gives a very light to no additional fragrance, so it doesn&#x27;t clash with the perfume you are wearing. And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength Advanced Solid works great for me on my really stressful days. I sweat constantly and Secret is the only kind that will work on me.  This new advanced kind seems to keep me drying longer.  It does cost a little more , but for those extra stressful days I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  It&#x27;s hot here in Colorado.  This keeps me feeling fresh and dry all day long.</li>
            <li> I love the effectiveness and function of this deodorant. It says it&#x27;s meant to be applied at night, but I&#x27;m stuck in my ways and still put it on in the morning like any other deodorant. I like that the wavy openings in the plastic let just enough deodorant through as I rotate the clicky thing on the bottom. It keeps me dry, no matter how hard a day I have! The wet solid applies smoothly without rubbing off on clothes (though if the applicator touches your clothes, it will rub off then).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only dislike (and the reason why I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five) is that the scent is too heavy and strong. That&#x27;s a bit ironic, considering that it&#x27;s described as \\&quot;Light and Fresh.\\&quot; It&#x27;s not a bad smell or too overwhelming, though, so I&#x27;m still using it - I&#x27;ll just get a different scent in the future.</li>
            <li> One of the containers of deodorant will not advance the product.  You have to turn it upside down and tap it to release the antiperspirant.  Also, makes me itch a bit, but I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 27, 2013 update - The first problem I had was solved, but if you have arthritis in your thumb joints, as I have, I do not recommend this product, as I have to use pliers to turn the knob.[[ASIN:B001F51VS4 Secret Clinical Strength Advanced Solid Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant Light And Fresh Scent 1.6 Oz (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Secret user for years.  The first brand I&#x27;ve ever used.  It worked well enough.  I recently tried Dove because I liked the scent.  Then I tried Dove&#x27;s clinical one because apparently it also lightened underarm hair along with getting rid of odor.  2 in 1, why not?  It definitely didn&#x27;t lighten the hair, and I was so interested in whether or not the hair would actually lighten, I don&#x27;t even remember what happened with the odor.  I had previously tried the Secret clinical strength (because I had a coupon), but didn&#x27;t want to shell out anymore extra cash once I was done, which is why I tried the Dove one.  Another coupon appeared, and I tried the Secret clinical again.  Now that I&#x27;m actually paying attention, it really does work!! I&#x27;m willing to admit that I sweat and smell really bad, like my dad and brother! I mean, I could just be sitting around, nevermind exercising, and by the end of the day, or even within hours, you could smell my odor mixed with the deodorant I&#x27;m wearing because I&#x27;m just sweating it all off. Blehh... But I&#x27;m willing to admit it because now I&#x27;m virtually odorless.  I woke up this morning after a hot, So Cal night (yes, in the brink of spring), and nothing.  Barely a hint of odor.  The directions say to put it on at night before bed, but I put it on in the morning before i start my day.  So after having washed it off in the shower at night, and sweating in my sleep, the next morning, barely a peep.  One day I just noticed that the shirt I sleep in didn&#x27;t smell anymore.  I am in love!  My mom has been blessed with naturally odorless underarms, and i&#x27;m the only other girl in the family.  You can imagine my relief when my favorite brand of deodorant came up with something that beat out the others.  The first and last brand of deodorant I will ever use, no matter the cost.  I will be realistic, though.  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the odor so that you can just quit using any deodorant altogether.  If you need to use deodorant, you will always need to use deodorant.  I&#x27;m just saying, it&#x27;s a long-lasting odor reducer.  I&#x27;ve used other Secret products, and the Dove one, where it works enough for a few hours or for your \\&quot;workday\\&quot; to end, and it simply covers it up, but this one will work from the beginning of your day, to the next morning.  A lot longer.  It also minimizes your underarm odor overall.  With the other ones, you will always smell with the same intensity.  This one actually minimizes it for the long run - you&#x27;ll always need deodorant because the odor is there, but it&#x27;s very minuscule.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it will do and doesn&#x27;t scare the boys away. Works wonders at taming my sweaty pits!</li>
            <li> Alot cheaper than in the stores. This is thesecond time I have purchased from here and will definatley do it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every product on the market, plus some &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; all promising to eliminate the perspiration and odor. By far, this product beats everything!!! I could not be more happy and confident now.</li>
            <li> It does leave a mess on clothes but you will have the coverage as it states.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so messy.</li>
            <li> I tried to wear this deodorant a couple of time, but each time the smell gave me an awful headache. I don&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;m usually not that sensitive to scented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these deodorant sticks are very small, and there&#x27;s very little product in them. Once you twist the deodorant up to a useable level, it appears as though you&#x27;ve already gone through half of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, you don&#x27;t need very much of it to last the day. I also didn&#x27;t sweat through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning these and going back to my old deodorant, which can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/Lady-Mitchum-Womens-Advanced-Control/dp/B004KQH7LK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_11?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1367089704&amp;sr&#x3D;8-11&amp;keywords&#x3D;mitchum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Mitchum Advanced Control - 48 Hour Strength and Protection - Powder Fresh - Invisible Solid. The smell is really nice, not too strong. It also keeps me from sweating all day. And, the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; would mean irritating, but that&#x27;s not the case. It feels just as gentle on my skin as the Secret formula I had been using. However, I also haven&#x27;t noticed any increase in efficacy. It works, controlling odor and wetness, but then, so does the Secret invisible solid I had been using.</li>
            <li> Strong enough for a man but made for a woman. It keeps you dry and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret for my whole life.  It always gave me protection, but NOT under every condition.  The clinical strength holds up so much better.  No sweat or smell ALL day.</li>
            <li> For the first time I looked to amazon for a cheaper option of this deodorant. In stores it retails for around $7 each, but this sets it around $5 each. Product works great, no excessive sweat and the smell is great. A++++++ would buy again.</li>
            <li> It will stop me from general sweating but in cases of heat and exertion you&#x27;re sweating, no way around it.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and sweat through most brands of anti perspirants. This one has by far kept me dryest and kept the smell away better than any others I have tried. It has a nice scent too in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that if it isn&#x27;t absorbed into your skin enough, it will stain clothes white. But it lasts and has a fresh smell. For the price it is more economical to buy at Amazon, rather than elsewhere and Costco doesn&#x27;t always carry it. But don&#x27;t buy this if you think it eliminates oder no matter what; extreme sweating and hot vonditions would need you to keep applying but for the day to day, it is great.</li>
            <li> None deodorant has worked as well as this has, it gets control of odor and sweat, the only thing is the marks in my cloth-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a solidly anti-walmart shopper, so perhaps this is why I find this offer to be such a good deal, but at Target, this same deoderant is twice as expensive as getting it here in a two pack. Sad, but awesome for those of us on a microscopic budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay College. :)</li>
            <li> Strong enough for my sweaty stinky man too.  Apply once and no need to reapply.  No strong fragrance to distract your regular perfume scent.  Two for the price of one, it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I had been using this deodorant for about two years when I looked at reviews online, since my excessive perspiration had only gotten significantly worse with time, to the point where I was looking into Botox or surgery because it was interfering with life. I decided to follow another reviewer&#x27;s lead and switch deodorants. Turns out this &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorant was only exasperating my underarm problems the whole time. As soon as I switched to a regular (Secret) stick, the perspiration decreased remarkably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been using this product and are not having results (or are getting worse, as I was), try switching to a cheaper, regular deodorant stick. You could save yourself a lot of pain and suffering, and a lot of money as well.</li>
            <li> I typically buy the regular line of secret deodorants but I had to try this. I don&#x27;t have any problems with a deodorant not working or anything but this seemed like something to try. So far, I like it. It seems to wear very long in terms of protection. I gave one to my friend who said it&#x27;s awesome. She used it, went to work and then the gym afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she got home, she didn&#x27;t bathe (too exhausted) and went to straight sleep. Eew! She then said she woke up the next day at almost noon. To her surprise,she could smell sweat on her gym clothes(you know the scent but not emanating from her pits). And yes, she sniffed them to double check and they were still lightly scented. Not smelly in the least. She should have been reeking something awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I also think it wears long. Another plus is that it also goes on very smooth and if you don&#x27;t put too much, dries clear. The two pack I purchased is the cream like one, but I&#x27;m sure they have a solid stick as well. I will purchase that after I use up this one because I typically prefer solids.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and was shocked at how little deodorant they actually put in there. The package is VERY small to begin with and when I received it, it was only half full. Go with degree for better quality of product.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a Deodorant that will help make it through the day without making my top wet. I finally found the product!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it an honest effort so I waited to give a review.&lt;br /&gt;I was in hopes it would work but as far as ordor control, it was&lt;br /&gt;disappointing; however, it did keep me dry.  I probably will try other&lt;br /&gt;products to find one that works for me.</li>
            <li> The product would be great if the seller wouldn&#x27;t have lied about the expiration of his products. He told me via email that they expire atleast 6 months away. After receiving the products they expire in 2 months. I bought a bulk package of 12. No way can I use 2 packs in 2 month. I then asked for a refund but I would have 2 pay a 20% restocking fee plus the shipping. I left negative feedback and it was removed. What&#x27;s the point in leaving feedback if the seller gets to pick and choose his own feedback.</li>
            <li> Of course I find a product that works great, smells great, makes noticeable difference in how my body sweats/smells....just to find out that the company that makes this and many other brands, tests on animals. Vivisection. Google it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Secret brand is made by Proctor and Gamble, P&amp;G, which is not cruelty free. They do support and participate in the testing of animals for it&#x27;s products and no matter how well this product works for my overactive sweating I will never ever give them my money. An animal shouldn&#x27;t have to die so I can sweat less and be more comfortable and smell better. P&amp;G denies this claim but just Google it, there is hidden video proof of this company specifically to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Animal testing is not a valid way to test a product, do not support it with your money when you have many other options available.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is perfect.  It&#x27;s creamy without having to use your finger like the old school cream.  The scent is fantastic and it keeps me dry and smelling great.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and this is the BEST deodorant i have ever used. have been using it for years now and it is the only thing that actually works well...I am a woman, but sweat like a man...love the strength of this product and the light and clean scent. this is also a great deal considering it costs at least $8 per container at the drugstore. I use this every morning and it works very well. on days when I know I will be active I also use drysol (prescription deodorant)the night before and it is a fantastic combo....i don&#x27;t use drysol regularly because it is with frequent use it is VERY drying to the point where your skin can blister. Secret clinical is not drying or irritating at all.</li>
            <li> This product seems to control odor better than my previous deodorant and I feel more confident using this in the hot humid Florida weather!  Unfortunately, it is a bit more expensive than I am used to, but that is the trade off I suppose.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it was cheaper than Degree this month on Amazon, but I wish I had just bought the Degree (what I usually use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Clinical Strength doesn&#x27;t keep me as &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; as Degree, and it isn&#x27;t as invisible when you put it on.  Also, the packaging is not good - the plastic cap that is between your arm and the antiperspirant came off on both of mine, leaving me to precariously apply with it half pressed back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works OK, but go for Degree. I&#x27;ve used Degree for several years and never had any of the problems I described above.</li>
            <li> This is the only type of deodorant that does not give me a rash. Love the smell and odor protection. Light and fresh and lavender are my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> i bought this in hopes of it being like my prescription strength deodorant and it totally is. it works great and is in the soft solid format. bought it when it was on sale and it was nearly half the price of what it was at CVS/grocery store and with free prime shipping! great deal.</li>
            <li> this is expensive but worth it. I have two almost teens who really need good protection with all the hormonal stuff and this does the job.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use! I have more sweat than the average women, especially in summer. This keeps me from having terrible sweat marks. It also doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing.</li>
            <li> I have tried different brands over the years, but I have been using this one for several years now.  I love how it smells.  It doesn&#x27;t make me feel all yucky and sticky.  It doesn&#x27;t leave stains on my clothes like a lot of products.  I even used this in Jamaica when I got married in a strapless wedding dress.  It was really hot and humid and I had no problems at least from my under arms.  It will last all day too and maybe part of the next day if you are stuck without a shower camping.</li>
            <li> I got these 2 EXPIRED deodorants! I didnt notice it until it was too late to return but i am very angry about this.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot - have all my life - and have often had to either/or shower twice daily, and/or apply a second dose of deoderant to be &amp;#34;somewhat socially acceptable&amp;#34;.  Other types of Secret doederants don&#x27;t do it for me, but this stuff protects me like no other.</li>
            <li> This product was not very effective for me. I know I sweat a lot, but this claims to be &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34;, and I really didn&#x27;t feel like the antiperspirant was working. To make matters worse, the deodorant was weaker than my normal deodorant, so if I wore this alone, I would smell even worse than I did normally. I prefer Certain-Dri as an antiperspirant used with a regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> I like this product which costs about $7 to $8 at the store. I bought this product online since it was a better deal.</li>
            <li> This product made me sweat even more and didn&#x27;t reduce ANYTHING. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I love this clinical strength deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried the All Day Fresh and also the Light and Fresh scents. They&#x27;re both good, of course the light is less strong for my nose. It&#x27;s nice to have a long lasting deodorant, and do not let the size fool you, one box lasts me at least a month. I always look forward to applying these, I&#x27;m so glad I found this on Amazon, thanks to the thousand of reviews. I no longer have to stick with the popular men&#x27;s deo that never really got the job done, or left the white streaks on my shirt.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday and not at night but in the morning before work.  I have no sensitivities to it (although I had reactions to another brand).  My only complaint is that there is not alot of product in it.  Also, the cover would not stay on when I toss it in my drawer...not sure if that is a defect or not.  Doesn&#x27;t matter, I will still repurchase.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this deodorant. I hoard the coupons and wait for sales and stock up. I use it everyday since the product was released. It seams to be the only one that protects from odors and sweat. I still have fresh smelling and smooth arm pits at the end of the day. It also does well when I have been training for 1/2 marathons. I love the Stress Response one the best.</li>
            <li> If this did not come with two deodorants I think I&#x27;d be upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of it is half of what a normal deodorant is. Then, when you turn the dial to bring the antiperspirant up through the hole, you have to keep turning it for awhile. When you finally get product to appear, you can look at how far you had to turn the product pusher up and how much is left, and it&#x27;s about 1/2 of the bottle. So, you&#x27;re getting only about 1/4 deodorant compared to an average sized one.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing it comes with 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this deodorant for the long lasting effect. I don&#x27;t overly sweat but with summer coming up it would be nice to have an antiperspirant that lasts all day. It does hold up on that end. You could go 2 days without reapplying. So far it&#x27;s alright I&#x27;ll just have to use it sparingly!</li>
            <li> First and foremost, it doesn&#x27;t work for me any better than a plain old (MUCH cheaper) deodorant/antiperspirant does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, when I read the description, it said this was a solid product. It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s that cream garbage that I have always disliked strongly and felt you don&#x27;t get your money&#x27;s worth out from. It seems like on the third use, it&#x27;s already gone. So disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, as you can imagine, I would never order this again.</li>
            <li> Super easy having to apply before bed. No more forgetting in the morning rush!  Way to go Secret!</li>
