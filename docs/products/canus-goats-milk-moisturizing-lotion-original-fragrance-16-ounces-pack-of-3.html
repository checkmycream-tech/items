            <li>My favorite lotion.  </li>

            <li>Good product, used to buy it locally but stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>The Goat&#x27;s milk lotion rubs in nicely and feels good on the skin, but the original scent is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li>My elderly mother in law now is using and itch free for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>The company that makes the soap doesn&#x27;t make lotion , so I search cross the internet and after reading good reviews about this I decided to buy it from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>My wife likes it very much and will continue to purchase it when we run out.</li>
            <li>have bought several bottles of the lotion and love the product.  </li>

            <li>I have never broken out when using this product, like I have with many different lotions...</li>
            <li>this REALLY WORKS.  </li>

            <li>But after using it for a while, I got to really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Several other co-workers used it and loved it.</li>
            <li>One in particular had a skin condition that caused her hands to peel, crack and even bleed.</li>
            <li>They need to stop advertising this as Goat&#x27;s Milk lotion because the goat milk isn&#x27;t the main ingredient.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Most winters I get small cracks by my thumbs, but not this winter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for those cold days of winter when my skin is dry.  </li>

            <li> Does not leave skin feeling greasy. Moisturizes &amp; hydrates skin. I have never broken out when using this product, like I have with many different lotions...even those that claim otherwise.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, not too light, not greasy.  It has a light, somewhat powdery fresh scent - and does a great job moisturizing my skin all day.  Feels great on a sunburn, too.  I will continue to order this product and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002IJNVGG Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Natural Original Fragrance Lotion, 33 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;I have bought several bottles of the lotion and love the product.  I keep a bottle on my desk at work.  It&#x27;s wonderful for those cold days of winter when my skin is dry.  I have used the fragrance free on my face without a break out.  Love the body wash and bubble bath.  The scent is not over powering.  Recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this scent - very fresh and the lotion is not greasy and really hydrates.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and I love how it makes my skin feel; and the price is reasonable!  What else can I ask for?</li>

            <li> I love this product and I bought it for others too. I have an oily skin and I used it on my face most of the year except very cold days.</li>
            <li> This cream is my favorite.  It has a nice subtle fragrance.  Clean but not medicinal nor a perfume.  I work at a hospital lab so it is perfect for that, but I like it at home as well.  I have a hard time finding it in stores, so the convenience of finding it on line was a God sent.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion in a health food store restroom and loved it.  Light fragrance  and not oily.  Most winters I get small cracks by my thumbs, but not this winter and while it is exceptionally cold this winter, my hands are staying soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality -- not too heavy or greasy and the Canus original fragrances is super fresh smelling.  Thank you Canada for the import.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it has a light scent and is not greasy feeling. I use it also as my face moisturizer and it does not break my face out like like most face moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion for itching winter skin.  I tried everything to make the itching stop and this REALLY WORKS.  My elderly mother in law now is using and itch free for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Really helped with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is exceptional!  I bought it because I have psoriasis and it helped a great deal.  It leaves your skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> The Goat&#x27;s milk lotion rubs in nicely and feels good on the skin, but the original scent is not very pleasant. My husband thinks it smells like musk and I actually think it smells like cintrella. Would purchase a scented one next time.</li>
            <li> Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Moisturizing Lotion works really great, on arms, legs, hands, all over.  Have used it for over a year and never been at all disappointed.</li>
            <li> My favorite cream. Have used it for a long time. I even gave some as a gift to a friend who really likes it as well.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this ever since I got my first bottle! Really good moisturizer and in a doctor&#x27;s office we do a lot of hand washing so it gets used to restore our hands..</li>
            <li> Excellent body lotion. great price.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a lotion that truly does moisturize. My skin is very dry and I have found this product to be the best I have used. It is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t dry on your skin. I will be buying more in the months to come.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my story of this product.  A co-worker left a bottle of this lotion behind when she left.  Several other co-workers used it and loved it. One in particular had a skin condition that caused her hands to peel, crack and even bleed. Since working in a daycare with lots of washing of the hands only intenisfied her problem she found some relief.  After using Canus after every washing, at night , anytime she needed ....her hands are in perfect condition.  She will NEVER give up this product.  I order it for her.  I also use it especially for dry winter legs. It&#x27;s a natural mircle lotion.  PLEASE NEVER STOP PRODUCING THIS LOTION !</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful.  You can slather it on, and within seconds it has soaked into your skin.  NO GREASY feeling. . . ever!  Leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.  I love the FRESH smell of it.  Clean smelling . . . no flowery odor.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and goes on light and smooth. It feels a bit &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and takes a bit to absorb in but is a great product.</li>
            <li> Good product, used to buy it locally but stopped selling it. The only place we have been able to get it is on the Internet. My wife likes it very much and will continue to purchase it when we run out. Only down side is quantity you. Have to purchase</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from eczema. I purchase this lotion thinking it would be a great addition to the pure goat milk soap I bathe my daughter with. The company that makes the soap doesn&#x27;t make lotion , so I search cross the internet and after reading good reviews about this I decided to buy it from Whole Foods. Canus has way too many chemicals. They need to stop advertising this as Goat&#x27;s Milk lotion because the goat milk isn&#x27;t the main ingredient. Not all natural, not pure.  It should be called Canus Moisturizing Lotion with Goat&#x27;s Milk and Preservatives.</li>
            <li> I was almost out of my favorite lotion but couldn&#x27;t find the 32 oz. size, so settled for the 16 oz. The seller sent all four right away but one of the tops was loose and leaked about half the contents into the separate plastic bag the seller sealed them in. When I first started using this lotion, I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the fragrance (has kind of a clove scent). But after using it for a while, I got to really like the fragrance. I have noticed that others who have tried it, write that they hate the disglusting smell. I find it to be refreshing and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic. Keeps my skin smooth and hydrated. My only complaint is you don&#x27;t get a lot of cream for the price.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion.  It stays on all day and truly moisturizes your skin. Pleasant fragrance and such a rich lotion! Lasts a long time and I use it at least 2&#x27;ce a day all over. My skin is in great condition and never feels greasy. I will purchase again and again. Better price than I can get in the stores if you can even find it. Not many stores stock it sadly  around here and was thankful to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me a bottle and I loved the smell and the way it feels and works, I bought a package and am sharing it with my  friends.  The only lotion I will use from now on.</li>
