            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>These are amazing for bee stings.</li>
            <li>I have been using sting kill since I was a kid, best stuff for not only bee and wasp bites but also works great for mosquito bites...</li>

            <li>Very inexpensive and boy is it great to have when you get stung!</li>

            <li>These are the absolute best when stung by a bee.  </li>
            <li>I use old film cases to hold my perfect bee sting kits.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have kids of my own, I am glad to have these in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>Great addition to our first aid kit for sure.</li>
            <li>but my grand kids will probably need one sometime when they get stung this summer.</li>
            <li>there are too many reasons not to have these.</li>
            <li>if you go outdoors these could make for a better evening.</li>
            <li>once these are gone I will be ordering more...</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful especially when used with baking soda.  </li>
            <li>I have given away so many of these I am on line ordering more.</li>
            <li>The neighbor was stung seven times in the leg and within minutes of applying the product, her leg felt better and the swelling was contained.</li>
            <li>So glad to have had these on hand.</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipment</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ever find these in the stores, glad they have them here.</li>

            <li>We love this bee sting swabs.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all and this one is the best - because it actually does work!</li>
            <li>works better than anything I have used</li>
            <li>I hope I never use it but from the reviews I am glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it stays that way, but it&#x27;s perfect to cut the extra cardboard and stick in my medic bag.</li>
            <li>I also recently came upon a hornets nest in the woods and was thinking how nice it would be to have one of these!!!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my sting feel much better</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad to see it&#x27;s still on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time it was a good 30 min before applying so that may have made a difference.</li>
            <li>These are very cool.  </li>
            <li>good price and reasonable shipping...</li>
            <li>easy to take along on a trip - or even keep in the car.</li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend this seller.</li>

            <li>It does everything it says it will, more important is that it does quickly.</li>

            <li>They are quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My cheek was huge and only swelling more and more!</li>
            <li>Now I make sure that every first aid kit I have is stocked at the start of the season.  </li>
            <li>whether you have bee allergies or react to mosquitos different than most, these things come in handy.</li>
            <li>more so i have a fresh sealed package in the first aid kit.  </li>
            <li>Super quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The redness and swelling is gone quickly and you can watch it rapidly work before your eyes.  </li>
            <li>We have been buying this product locally for years and have been very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>and everyone is now talking about how brave the little one is and how the mom needs to be employed as an emt</li>
            <li>I would not work outside without this product handy.</li>
            <li>I stocked up and it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>if i never use another i got my moneys worth on that one use.</li>
            <li>He handed me the Sting Kill and said, \\&quot;Put it on right now.</li>

            <li>I REALLY works!</li>
            <li>We have a bunch of wasps and hornets so this is a must have for our first aid kit .</li>
            <li>I keep one in every vehicle and in my emergency first aid kit.</li>
            <li>We went to first aid office and they applied this sting kill to her.</li>
            <li>The second time though it probably wasn&#x27;t more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Fast ship!</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes of swelling I remembered I had sting kill in my first aid kit.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, I was stung about halfway through!</li>
            <li>They are a staple in our first aid kit.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li>Purchased first on trip to Oklahoma and now purchase on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Exactly as was advertized.</li>
            <li>I first used this product years ago and was devastated when it vanished from the marketplace.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stocking up, because NOTHING works better to simply stop an allergic reaction to an insect bite in its tracks than this stuff.</li>
            <li>i bought 3 sets of these and put one in each first aid kit.</li>
            <li>Keep them in our first aid kit we pack around.</li>
            <li>I got them for my first aid kit.</li>
            <li>The old swabs stored very well and still worked fine.</li>
            <li>I have used these before and they stop it from stinging very fast and it also doesn&#x27;t seem to swell as much compared to not using something.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Instant relief and easy to use.</li>
            <li>she is so prepared and quick to action.</li>
            <li>I always carry this product when hunting or fishing as they are very portable and stay sealed until needed .</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>This really words well.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They take the pain away very quicklyl</li>
            <li>It stops the pain &amp; swelling fast.</li>
            <li>Works really fast taking away the pain.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Sting Kill!</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes the way it works on any type of insect bite.  </li>
            <li>Packaging will insure they don&#x27;t break unless really pressed on.</li>
            <li>Stores (unfortunately) no longer sell it unless it is an old fashioned pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>I mainly bought these for my emergency kit.  </li>
            <li>I feel better carrying it in my back pack &amp; having it in my back pocket while mowing the lawn.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sting kill to persons who are allergic to any insects bites.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Not only have I used this on my own children (while at the beach, camping, picnicking) but on other children who have been stung and their parents didn&#x27;t have anything like this with them.  </li>
            <li>- we always have a pack stuck to the fridge with a magnet for when they come running in crying from the latest altercation with a wasp, bee or hornet.</li>
            <li>so I had to find a new place to get it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;He was very surprised it worked so well,</li>
            <li>I went directly to a pharmacy.</li>
            <li>it took just a second to figure out you have to break the vial like and ammonia inhaler and who reads directions while their kids is screaming, but this stuff really worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>these are in every med kit that goes with every child and adult in our home.</li>
            <li>I put it on and my cheek was back to normal within 30 minutes!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use (crush the glass vial inside the plastic dispenser; swab green fluid on sting site) and provides immediate relief from the pain of an insect stings for adults, children, and grandchildren.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>A  fast acting must have for anyone who spends a lot of time outside!!</li>
            <li>The second time I had to use it was today, my 5 year old was stung by a bee on his chin!</li>
            <li>This item is very hard to find and I give away more than I can use.</li>
            <li>The old Sting Kill formula broke up the insect&#x27;s protein, but not the current</li>
            <li>The current formula reduces discomfort temporally, but does not break up the protein as the old formula did.</li>
            <li>These little vials are a must to have in your first aid kit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: A family member tried to help a friends child that was stung by honeybee within the first few minutes and it had no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I grabbed my first aid kit and popped the Sting Kill, applied and within a few seconds the tears stopped.  </li>
            <li>First I received a bite from a horse-fly on my face!(which normally swells up and stays rock hard for weeks!)  </li>
            <li>In thanks the little bugger bit him.</li>
            <li>The product does work, I use it a lot living here in Texas with all the rain we&#x27;ve has lately, it takes that sting and bite away real fast.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes the way it works on any type of insect bite.  </li>
            <li> Packaging will insure they don&#x27;t break unless really pressed on.</li>
            <li> Stores (unfortunately) no longer sell it unless it is an old fashioned pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> I mainly bought these for my emergency kit.  </li>
            <li> I feel better carrying it in my back pack &amp; having it in my back pocket while mowing the lawn.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sting kill to persons who are allergic to any insects bites.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Not only have I used this on my own children (while at the beach, camping, picnicking) but on other children who have been stung and their parents didn&#x27;t have anything like this with them.  </li>
            <li> - we always have a pack stuck to the fridge with a magnet for when they come running in crying from the latest altercation with a wasp, bee or hornet.</li>
            <li> so I had to find a new place to get it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;He was very surprised it worked so well,</li>
            <li> I went directly to a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> it took just a second to figure out you have to break the vial like and ammonia inhaler and who reads directions while their kids is screaming, but this stuff really worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> these are in every med kit that goes with every child and adult in our home.</li>
            <li> I put it on and my cheek was back to normal within 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use (crush the glass vial inside the plastic dispenser; swab green fluid on sting site) and provides immediate relief from the pain of an insect stings for adults, children, and grandchildren.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> A  fast acting must have for anyone who spends a lot of time outside!!</li>
            <li> The second time I had to use it was today, my 5 year old was stung by a bee on his chin!</li>
            <li> This item is very hard to find and I give away more than I can use.</li>
            <li> The old Sting Kill formula broke up the insect&#x27;s protein, but not the current</li>
            <li> The current formula reduces discomfort temporally, but does not break up the protein as the old formula did.</li>
            <li> These little vials are a must to have in your first aid kit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: A family member tried to help a friends child that was stung by honeybee within the first few minutes and it had no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I grabbed my first aid kit and popped the Sting Kill, applied and within a few seconds the tears stopped.  </li>
            <li> First I received a bite from a horse-fly on my face!(which normally swells up and stays rock hard for weeks!)  </li>
            <li> In thanks the little bugger bit him.</li>
            <li> The product does work, I use it a lot living here in Texas with all the rain we&#x27;ve has lately, it takes that sting and bite away real fast.</li>
            <li> The pharmacist asked, \\&quot;How long has it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> about 30-45 sec later the pain is gone or on its way</li>
            <li> Our family has all had bee stings over the past few months and these have helped relieve the pain and swelling right away.</li>
            <li> It is now 3 1/2 hours later and there is absolutely NO sign of swelling, pain or itch at all!</li>
            <li> so he picked it up to help it to dry land</li>
            <li> Few months ago I went with my daughter to Wet and Wild</li>
            <li> You just gotta know where you keep them, must be put on in a minute or less if possible.</li>
            <li> In just a few minutes the bite was only an annoyance.</li>
            <li> Wal-Mart allegedly carries it.  </li>
            <li> My husband used this a few weeks ago, when he stepped on a yellow jacket.  </li>
            <li> Takes about 5 sec or so.</li>
            <li> but these work well for pain and discomfort due to any type of insect sting .</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Bought this product due to</li>
            <li> and I have seen little ones stop crying instantly.  </li>
            <li> Took my son to the pool the other day and there was a little bug in the water.</li>
            <li> I only treated the bites ONE TIME &amp; he was no longer itching in LESS than 90 SECONDS!!!</li>
            <li> That was the end of the itching and redness ... in less than a minute...</li>
            <li> When I was little these things were a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I use the swabs to coat the sting area with the green liquid then add baking soda to make a paste and leave the paste on for 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> a few times every summer</li>
            <li> He cried in pain for the few seconds</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t usually get this mushy on any product, but that was my little boy screaming.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Even when you squeeze a little, it works!  </li>
            <li> Once I put it on the bite he stopped crying and told me it didn&#x27;t hurt anymore!  </li>
            <li> I was stung by a bee this summer at a lazy river pool and the lifeguard used this product on the sting.  </li>
            <li> I have used them in the past and they will give relief to a bite/sting.  </li>
            <li> show the kid they are usually fascinated by this.</li>
            <li> Hard to find anywhere but on line</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before but it is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Once my little boy came in from playing and literally had about 70 bug bites ALL OVER HIM!!</li>
            <li> I have gotten bee stings over the last couple of years while cutting the grass.</li>
            <li> It was unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product (1988), a pharmacist explained how insect stings produce their nasty discomfort.</li>
            <li> The current formula can be used as a base to mix with meat tenderizer to break up the protein.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this product.</li>
            <li> She used to have a very bad reaction to ant bites, and when they applied it to the affected zone, in less than five minutes it disappeared, that is why I decided to buy it and have it with me all the time, just in case.</li>
            <li> and today I got out my Sting Kill before cutting the grass, just in case.</li>
            <li> Bad news, it still hurts.</li>
            <li> Getting stung twice by ground hornets was a painful ordeal with my son.  </li>
            <li> I put him in an oatmeal bath and he was still miserable.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I mainly bought these for my emergency kit.  I don&#x27;t want to get a sting intentionally but my grand kids will probably need one sometime when they get stung this summer.</li>
            <li> This item is very hard to find and I give away more than I can use. They work great for everyone. Instant relief!</li>
            <li> there are too many reasons not to have these. whether you have bee allergies or react to mosquitos different than most, these things come in handy. not only for hiking, camping, etc. if you go outdoors these could make for a better evening. arrived timely and intact.</li>
            <li> I keep these in my medical kit in the car as well as in the house just in case. Have only had to use them once and they work well.</li>
            <li> I have been using sting kill since I was a kid, best stuff for not only bee and wasp bites but also works great for mosquito bites... didn&#x27;t like the wipes and that was all that the stores carry anymore so I had to find a new place to get it... good price and reasonable shipping... once these are gone I will be ordering more...</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product (1988), a pharmacist explained how insect stings produce their nasty discomfort. I had brushed by a hornet&#x27;s nest receiving multiple stings. I went directly to a pharmacy. The pharmacist asked, \\&quot;How long has it been?\\&quot; Twenty minutes was my answer. He handed me the Sting Kill and said, \\&quot;Put it on right now. It would have worked better earlier, but it will still help some now.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are stung, the bee or wasp bite releases a protein. That protein reacts in the body and produces the swelling and irritation. The old Sting Kill formula broke up the insect&#x27;s protein, but not the current formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula has changed and no longer contains papin. The current formula reduces discomfort temporally, but does not break up the protein as the old formula did. The current formula can be used as a base to mix with meat tenderizer to break up the protein.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful especially when used with baking soda.  I use the swabs to coat the sting area with the green liquid then add baking soda to make a paste and leave the paste on for 15 minutes.  It is amazing and I have seen little ones stop crying instantly.  The the sting kill numbs the pain and the baking soda neutralizes the acid in the venom.  I use old film cases to hold my perfect bee sting kits.  Just drop in a vial of sting kill, fill with baking soda, and toss it in your purse.  A bee sting remedy only helps if you have it with you.  I have given away so many of these I am on line ordering more. I REALLY works!</li>
            <li> The neighbor was stung seven times in the leg and within minutes of applying the product, her leg felt better and the swelling was contained.</li>
            <li> I still have to use an anti histamine but these work well for pain and discomfort due to any type of insect sting . We have a bunch of wasps and hornets so this is a must have for our first aid kit . I always carry this product when hunting or fishing as they are very portable and stay sealed until needed .</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!  It greatly reduces the immediate pain and the swelling, and is convenient to use.  I keep one in every vehicle and in my emergency first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Took my son to the pool the other day and there was a little bug in the water. Didn&#x27;t look too threatening so he picked it up to help it to dry land In thanks the little bugger bit him. Pool staff didn&#x27;t have anything to help and I didn&#x27;t think I did either. Looked like a perfectly good day at the pool was ruined. Then I remembered having these in the car. Grabbed one, broke it open and applied it. In just a few minutes the bite was only an annoyance. So glad to have had these on hand. I would imagine they would work just as well on a sting.</li>
            <li> used these before - can&#x27;t find them locally anymore.  great easy to use product.  easy to take along on a trip - or even keep in the car.</li>
            <li> Few months ago I went with my daughter to Wet and Wild and she was bitten by an ant. We went to first aid office and they applied this sting kill to her. She used to have a very bad reaction to ant bites, and when they applied it to the affected zone, in less than five minutes it disappeared, that is why I decided to buy it and have it with me all the time, just in case. I highly recommend this sting kill to persons who are allergic to any insects bites. We are really happy with this procuct.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipment</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ever find these in the stores, glad they have them here. I don&#x27;t know why, but I get stung a few times every summer and these things are great. You can keep them in the car, in your pocket or in a purse and they quickly and effectively take the pain down for stings of all kinds.  Great for kids too - we always have a pack stuck to the fridge with a magnet for when they come running in crying from the latest altercation with a wasp, bee or hornet.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it twice, different people one with honeybee sting and one with yellow jacket sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither person noticed any difference after applying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time it was a good 30 min before applying so that may have made a difference. The second time though it probably wasn&#x27;t more than 10 minutes but it still didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: A family member tried to help a friends child that was stung by honeybee within the first few minutes and it had no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s 0 for 3.</li>
            <li> This is so great to have!  Getting stung twice by ground hornets was a painful ordeal with my son.  I put this on and the pressure started to go away.  I didn&#x27;t need to reapply!  Even when you squeeze a little, it works!  I saved the rest that was in the tube and put on throughout the day just to make sure!  A little goes a long way!  Fast ship!</li>
            <li> Sting kill relieved pain of wasp sting in seconds. What we bought was a replacement for the last of swabs that we bought about 25 years ago. The old swabs stored very well and still worked fine.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but, had to for this. Sting Kill has rescued me twice! First I received a bite from a horse-fly on my face!(which normally swells up and stays rock hard for weeks!)  My cheek was huge and only swelling more and more! After 10 minutes of swelling I remembered I had sting kill in my first aid kit. I put it on and my cheek was back to normal within 30 minutes! The second time I had to use it was today, my 5 year old was stung by a bee on his chin! He cried in pain for the few seconds it took me to swat the bee off his shirt and dig out sting-kill. Once I put it on the bite he stopped crying and told me it didn&#x27;t hurt anymore!  I love this stuff! I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Been using them since I was a kid, would get stung and run for the cabinet where mom kept them, instant relief from a wasp sting.  You just gotta know where you keep them, must be put on in a minute or less if possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Recently stung several times on hand and one on nose. Within minutes of application the pain starts to fade. After several minutes its almost gone entirely. I have used this product for bee, wasp, and yellow jackets all to excellent results.</li>
            <li> I have used Sting-Kill for many years, and it works every time. I would not work outside without this product handy.</li>
            <li> I have gotten bee stings over the last couple of years while cutting the grass. Every time, my leg swells to twice its size and I can&#x27;t walk for days, not to mention the pain from the swelling and the unbearable itch that follows. I asked my pharmacist about Sting Kill and he ordered some for me, (good to see I can get it here, too) and today I got out my Sting Kill before cutting the grass, just in case. Sure enough, I was stung about halfway through! I immediately shut the mower off, ran inside and used it. It is now 3 1/2 hours later and there is absolutely NO sign of swelling, pain or itch at all! For someone who has severe allergic reactions, this is a miracle!!</li>
            <li> A must if you swell up from wasp stings.  Apply this product right after being stung.  It really works.  I carry it in my pack just in case.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this product at any local stores. We love this bee sting swabs.</li>
            <li> This really words well.  Friend of my grandson&lt;br /&gt;got a wasp  sting.  Rubbed a swab on the&lt;br /&gt;area and he had no sting and the red area went away.&lt;br /&gt;He was very surprised it worked so well, as he&lt;br /&gt;had been stung before with quite a  different outcome.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Would strongly recommend this seller. These swabs are very handy to have in the event you get stung. They take the pain away very quicklyl</li>
            <li> These are amazing for bee stings. I have used them for years. Our family has all had bee stings over the past few months and these have helped relieve the pain and swelling right away. They are a staple in our first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Forth of July a tiny spider must have bitten my arm. I saw the spot but could not get the itching to stop. I didn&#x27;t want to use my STING-KILL as I wanted to &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; it for a bee sting someone else might get. After about an hour I gave up and applied the STING-KILL. That was the end of the itching and redness ... in less than a minute...</li>
            <li> I have used these before and they stop it from stinging very fast and it also doesn&#x27;t seem to swell as much compared to not using something.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter-in-law is allergic to bees and she loves these, I keep her stocked up.</li>
            <li> These are very cool.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet; so I don&#x27;t know if they work, but the science and ingenuity is there.  Will update when and/or if I use them.</li>
            <li> Bought this product due to it&#x27;s ease of use and reliability.  It does everything it says it will, more important is that it does quickly.</li>
            <li> Sting Kill is the best product on the market.  It stops the pain &amp; swelling fast.</li>
            <li> Works really fast taking away the pain.</li>
            <li> The product does work, I use it a lot living here in Texas with all the rain we&#x27;ve has lately, it takes that sting and bite away real fast. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent transaction!</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery. Exactly what I needed. It&#x27;s exactly what it looks like. I feel better carrying it in my back pack &amp; having it in my back pocket while mowing the lawn. Lots of stinging insects in Texas.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Hope i never need to use it. Great addition to our first aid kit for sure.</li>
            <li> We have used this product successfully for nearly two decades.  It is easy to use (crush the glass vial inside the plastic dispenser; swab green fluid on sting site) and provides immediate relief from the pain of an insect stings for adults, children, and grandchildren.  You may have difficulty finding it in stores.  Wal-Mart allegedly carries it.  I gave up and ordered 4 cards via amazon.com.    IT WORKS ! ! !</li>
            <li> When I was little these things were a lifesaver. Now that I have kids of my own, I am glad to have these in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> A  fast acting must have for anyone who spends a lot of time outside!!</li>
            <li> relieves pain and itch well</li>
            <li> Excellent product for just about every sting and insect bite.  Purchased first on trip to Oklahoma and now purchase on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My husband used this a few weeks ago, when he stepped on a yellow jacket.  He said this took the pain away immediately.</li>
            <li> Works great to soothe bug stings.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand since I was a child and now give it to my own children.  The redness and swelling is gone quickly and you can watch it rapidly work before your eyes.  Stores (unfortunately) no longer sell it unless it is an old fashioned pharmacy.  I stocked up and it was worth it.  I swear by these swabs and so do my kids.  The pain it gone immediately.</li>
            <li> Good product good service</li>
            <li> Exactly as was advertized.</li>
            <li> I first used this product years ago and was devastated when it vanished from the marketplace. Now that it&#x27;s back I&#x27;m stocking up, because NOTHING works better to simply stop an allergic reaction to an insect bite in its tracks than this stuff. It&#x27;s a must for the camping kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for years and it works, fast and effective. Hard to find anywhere but on line so it pays order some and to keep them around. Very inexpensive and boy is it great to have when you get stung!</li>
            <li> I always have this with me.  Not only have I used this on my own children (while at the beach, camping, picnicking) but on other children who have been stung and their parents didn&#x27;t have anything like this with them.  It works almost immediately and very effectively.  I have tried them all and this one is the best - because it actually does work!</li>
            <li> We have been buying this product locally for years and have been very satisfied with it. Now we can only find it on the web. We will continue to &amp;#34;hunt it down&amp;#34;.  Works great!  Good for mosquito bites too. It contains a pain killer (to be used topically). You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, thank goodness, but very glad to have this.</li>
            <li> They work as advertised</li>
            <li> I was stung by a bee this summer at a lazy river pool and the lifeguard used this product on the sting.  Instant relief so I decided to order these when I found them on Amazon.  I highly recommend this product.  Instant relief and easy to use.</li>
            <li> works better than anything I have used</li>
            <li> I help coach a childrens football team and during practice one day, one of my 6 year olds got stung multiple times by wasps.  I grabbed my first aid kit and popped the Sting Kill, applied and within a few seconds the tears stopped.  It was unbelievable!  Every mother there wanted to know what I had used. Now I make sure that every first aid kit I have is stocked at the start of the season.  Highly recommend Sting Kill!</li>
            <li> Sting-Kill works. Don&#x27;t discard the swab after breaking the glaass vial and using it. Wrap the vial in plastic wrap and it will last several days.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It really works. In addition to the medicine cabinet I keep them in the glove compartment of both family cars.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and swear by it!  I have a package for each family member to carry in their backpacks.  They are quick and easy to use.  No need to worry about bites or stings anymore!</li>
            <li> I have used them in the past and they will give relief to a bite/sting.  If you are allergic to an insect bte make sure to seek medical help quickly.  Also a nice ice pack will help with relief.  The instructions on the packaging is very good.  They do work.</li>
            <li> I hope I never use it but from the reviews I am glad I bought it.  I bought 4 packs</li>
            <li> I bought these just to have them on hand since summer almost here and we go camping a lot. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about sting kill.</li>
            <li> Good item.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best when stung by a bee.  Can&#x27;t imagine a home without them in the emergency supply box.</li>
            <li> i bought 3 sets of these and put one in each first aid kit. 3 days later my son got stung by a wasp at a cub scout event. in seconds he went from yelling and screaming to &amp;#34;that feels kinda good&#x27;&amp;#34; . it took just a second to figure out you have to break the vial like and ammonia inhaler and who reads directions while their kids is screaming, but this stuff really worked.&lt;br /&gt;buying more so i have a fresh sealed package in the first aid kit.  if i never use another i got my moneys worth on that one use. i don&#x27;t usually get this mushy on any product, but that was my little boy screaming.&lt;br /&gt;thanks to the manufacturer for this product</li>
            <li> These little vials are a must to have in your first aid kit.  They are miracle medicines upon getting stung.  So happy I found them here to buy as I could no longer find them at the stores.  Sting Kill provides immediate relief from being stung.  A must have!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. My wife really likes the way it works on any type of insect bite.  I would reccommend it for anyone who is susceptible to bites or stings.</li>
            <li> My wife is bothered by all kinds of bug bites. We found this stuff up in the Northwest, and it works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! Within a minute bug bites stop itching and stings stop hurting! Once my little boy came in from playing and literally had about 70 bug bites ALL OVER HIM!! I put him in an oatmeal bath and he was still miserable. So, then I treated each bite with Sting Kill. I only treated the bites ONE TIME &amp; he was no longer itching in LESS than 90 SECONDS!!! I&#x27;m back to stock up!!! (I used to get this at W-Mart, then I could no longer find it there. I heard they started keeping it at the pharmacy desk, but I haven&#x27;t checked. Amazon is just easier!!) I would give 10 stars if I could!!!💗</li>
            <li> These are the best things to have around for bee stings. Love it! Keep them in our first aid kit we pack around.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it stays that way, but it&#x27;s perfect to cut the extra cardboard and stick in my medic bag. Packaging will insure they don&#x27;t break unless really pressed on.</li>
            <li> sitting at home one day soaks up  the phone rings. its my girl. good news , her daughter is not allergic to bees like she is. Bad news, it still hurts. these are in every med kit that goes with every child and adult in our home. so i told her to get one out, squeeze the end till it cracks then wait till the swab soaks up the fluid. Takes about 5 sec or so. show the kid they are usually fascinated by this. about 30-45 sec later the pain is gone or on its way and everyone is now talking about how brave the little one is and how the mom needs to be employed as an emt she is so prepared and quick to action. YAY! so moral of the story is BUY THESE and keep them with you.</li>
            <li> I got them for my first aid kit. I spend a lot of time outdoors. If i get stung I need some relief. I with I had it when I got into the nest of yellow jackets when clearing a wooded area. I also recently came upon a hornets nest in the woods and was thinking how nice it would be to have one of these!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my sting feel much better</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before but it is hard to find.  I was very happy to find this at Amazon and purchased 2 to keep in my First Aid Kit.  This is the best stuff for taking the pain out of bee or wasp stings!  This also works for horse fly bites!</li>
            <li> Picked up some of this stuff about 15 years ago. I kept it in the glove compartment of the car. When I ran out, I never found it again. Now I just bought four packages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works for bug bites, wasp and bee stings and I would try it on a scorpion sting if the need arises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to see it&#x27;s still on the market.</li>
