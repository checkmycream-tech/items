            <li>I&#x27;d been using the L&#x27;oreal Ever- line of shampoos and conditioners for years, mostly sticking to the moisture version.  </li>
            <li>Love the odor.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to purchase it here.</li>
            <li>I find this conditioner to be on par with or better than those products.</li>
            <li>I should have know better than buy inexpensive hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Like everything else in this line I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product more than a month now</li>
            <li>Love this line from Loreal.  </li>
            <li>Salon quality at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>Also, this product rinses out very cleanly; some others I tried were almost gummy.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is the BEST I have ever used that was not a professional product and</li>
            <li>For normal aging hair, however, it works very nicely.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and is a color protector too!</li>
            <li>This one in particular give alot of volume and keeps the frizzies away when it&#x27;s humid or foggy :o)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this condition and that it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smelling great and completely soft.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s vegan and sulfate free too.</li>
            <li>and so far they&#x27;ve all been great.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, like a high end product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good for normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li>At last, someone (Loreal) has made sulfate free shampoos that are not expensive and work great!</li>
            <li>Sulfate free</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really speak to whether that is effective or not.</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It smell just like cheap men cologne.  </li>
            <li>I got this shampoo/conditioner because my hair dresser said I should use sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>Further, it does give awesome volume to my 65 year old shoulder length blond hair!!!</li>
            <li>Luckily, its not that strong of a scent ( on my hair).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still clean feeling and smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The added volume isn&#x27;t quite so impressive as with the super-expensive brand, but it is considerable, and helps my short hair cut stay organized a bit longer.  </li>
            <li>I started using a volumizing conditioner when staying at a friend&#x27;s, and loved the extra bounce it gave my hair.  </li>
            <li>so have been looking around for a more reasonably priced alternative.  </li>
            <li>Rarely does Amazon have the shampoo and conditioner available on prime, which forces me into the B&amp;M world.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy feeling of other conditioners and it smells great,</li>
            <li>Smells super and moisturizes my hair well.</li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and smells</li>
            <li>Like many women, I try what seems to be every new shampoo and conditioner that comes on the market, all of which claim to do \\&quot;wonders\\&quot; for one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Really does add volume to fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very color treated and hard to manage hair and this is the best.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair in great shape without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I really like Enjoy conditioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Infusium 23, Paul Mitchell, L&#x27;oreal Kids (I actually loved their extra gentle line), Pantene, and John Frieda</li>
            <li>This product left my hair looking flat and fly away.  </li>
            <li>amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly, fine hair that gets highlights and lowlights.  </li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today and will not use again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m utterly converted, this makes my hair feel even better than the Biolage products</li>
            <li>first time buying this.</li>
            <li>Just love this brand and ordered second time</li>
            <li>Well, this one really works!  </li>
            <li>I think this conditioner had has a funny smell to it.</li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal Volume conditioner leaves my hair full and easy to blow dry and that&#x27;s what it claims and that&#x27;s what it does.</li>
            <li>After using everpure, my hair and scalp actually felt CLEAN !</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves your hair so soft and has a natural light scent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and doesn&#x27;t fade and is gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>This conditioner really does cause your hair to look thicker.</li>
            <li>(gee thanks mom &amp; dad).  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t notice it giving me the volume I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but I have yet to see any real help with volume.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair silky smooth and soft but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all; it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li>I switched to the volume version because my very fine hair doesn&#x27;t have much volume, but it just dried my hair out and caused some breakage.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in a store but with Amazons free super saver shipping, I just order several at a time as I see myself using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li>and I can tell the difference in my hair, more volume and my red dye actually stays longer, so</li>
            <li>This is scented with rosemary and mint, which are natural and not irritating at all.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use any other shampoos now since I discovered the Loreal sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li>However, it does make my hair soft and manageable, and the scent is very clean, not sweet or floral.</li>
            <li>however, it didn&#x27;t last beyond the first use.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair light and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware it was for color treated hair, however its too late to save fading on my most recent dye job</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft, bouncy and shiny (not greasy).</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the smell, and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft, which conditioners should do.</li>
            <li>and it really doesnt look any different than using a non volume conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty gentle on your hair, conditions without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Picked up both the volume shampoo AND conditioner at my local pharmacy on a whim and used it last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Prior to using this product, I was purchasing high end salon products for $20-30 per bottle.</li>
            <li>but I got it for the volumizing aspect because my hair is long and gets weighed down easily.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very fine and somewhat thin.</li>
            <li>quite frankly I don&#x27;t know that I will go back to professional conditioners now.</li>
            <li>Naturally I have Fine, Thin hair</li>
            <li>Really like this sulfate free product and for some reason, the volumizing conditioner is difficult to find in my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Every use thereafter, my hair turned out dull, dry, and easily tangled.</li>
            <li>Only a small amount will be enough to detangle, and I can use a little more for a deeper condition occasionally.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and every conditioner that I&#x27;ve used in the past plasters my hair down.  </li>

            <li> However, it does make my hair soft and manageable, and the scent is very clean, not sweet or floral.</li>
            <li> however, it didn&#x27;t last beyond the first use.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair light and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware it was for color treated hair, however its too late to save fading on my most recent dye job</li>
            <li> leaves my hair soft, bouncy and shiny (not greasy).</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell, and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft, which conditioners should do.</li>
            <li> and it really doesnt look any different than using a non volume conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gentle on your hair, conditions without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Picked up both the volume shampoo AND conditioner at my local pharmacy on a whim and used it last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I was purchasing high end salon products for $20-30 per bottle.</li>
            <li> but I got it for the volumizing aspect because my hair is long and gets weighed down easily.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very fine and somewhat thin.</li>
            <li> quite frankly I don&#x27;t know that I will go back to professional conditioners now.</li>
            <li> Naturally I have Fine, Thin hair</li>
            <li> Really like this sulfate free product and for some reason, the volumizing conditioner is difficult to find in my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Every use thereafter, my hair turned out dull, dry, and easily tangled.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount will be enough to detangle, and I can use a little more for a deeper condition occasionally.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and every conditioner that I&#x27;ve used in the past plasters my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Rarely do I find something that works so well on my thick, wavy, color treated,  52 y/o hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; always have a tough time finding conditioners that hydrate well enough without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have ever used, and I have tried a fair few expensive shampoos and conditioners!  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, limp hair and I am a shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier, will keep buying as long as I can find it!</li>
            <li> Works , doesn&#x27;t dry out scalp and keeps color.</li>
            <li> Typically, shampoo makes my hair clean, but the conditioner weighs my hair down SO much, that that it looks greasy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Biolage for my extremely curly, long, dry hair.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for very dry hair, however -</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit (thick, wavy, middle of the back length hair), and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The ever pure products cans be difficult to find routinely in the local grocery.</li>
            <li> The delivery method leaves too much conditioner behind in the tube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pity</li>
            <li> For those of us who shampoo everyday regular shampoos can be damaging.</li>
            <li> Smells gross, dried my hair out to the point it felt like a bale of hay.</li>
            <li> and I have abandoned all other brands.</li>
            <li> only negative is the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get weighed down by products after awhile, but this being sulfate-free doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> Hair does feel softer and less tangled, so it does work</li>
            <li> I think prolonged use has made my hair less responsive to this conditioner, but otherwise, it say everything it does.</li>
            <li> I would typically switch brands a few times a year as the affects would seem to wear off after a while</li>
            <li> is one of the few inexpensive brands out there that is sulfate</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> It is a little hard to find in the stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> Also it arrived with a broken cap.  </li>
            <li> or I would get bored with the product.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good conditioner for everyday use. My mom bought it and I have used it off and on. It doesnt smell feminine either (or atleast the smell doesnt last), so guys can use it too. Hair does feel softer and less tangled, so it does work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for close to 5 years now.  It&#x27;s pretty gentle on your hair, conditions without weighing it down.  I like the scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while. It smells great and makes my hair feel good.  Great for color too since it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Sulfate free</li>
            <li> I love this product!  No sulfates, smells great &amp; leaves my hair looking beautiful.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this condition and that it is sulfate free. I wasn&#x27;t aware it was for color treated hair, however its too late to save fading on my most recent dye job so I can&#x27;t really speak to whether that is effective or not. The consistency does leave something to be desired.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of a much more expensive salon product. The delivery method leaves too much conditioner behind in the tube.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really does add volume to fine hair. It&#x27;s a pity I can&#x27;t find it in a store but with Amazons free super saver shipping, I just order several at a time as I see myself using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair looking flat and fly away.  Also it arrived with a broken cap.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, limp hair and I am a shampoo and conditioner junkie.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, my hair seems to like sulfate-free products.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few inexpensive brands out there that is sulfate free.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft, bouncy and shiny (not greasy). Basically, my hair looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the smell. Kind of outdoorsy smelling to me. Luckily, its not that strong of a scent ( on my hair).</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner (I use it with the EverPure Volume Shampoo as well) I have ever used, and I have tried a fair few expensive shampoos and conditioners!  It leaves my hair with good volume and body, and also provides great shine and smoothing.  What a bonus that it&#x27;s also inexpensive.  I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous.  Leaves my hair soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today and will not use again. Smells like flea shampoo for dogs.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and OMG and I glad that I did. This conditioner is the BEST I have ever used that was not a professional product and quite frankly I don&#x27;t know that I will go back to professional conditioners now. It leaves my hair smelling great and completely soft. I have very color treated and hard to manage hair and this is the best.</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly, fine hair that gets highlights and lowlights.  I love this conditioner and it&#x27;s sister shampoo.  Only a small amount will be enough to detangle, and I can use a little more for a deeper condition occasionally.  It keeps my hair in great shape without being too heavy.  My hair tends to get weighed down by products after awhile, but this being sulfate-free doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  I used to have to wash my hair every day, but I can skip days now and it&#x27;s still clean feeling and smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, so my lungs cannot tolerate synthetic chemical compounds used to put scents into products.  This is scented with rosemary and mint, which are natural and not irritating at all.  And it smells so amazingly good!!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used to use Biolage for my extremely curly, long, dry hair. It was the best set of products I&#x27;d ever used for my hair - until now. Read about this on beautypedia, and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m utterly converted, this makes my hair feel even better than the Biolage products and it&#x27;s given me noticeably more volume than I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell, and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft, which conditioners should do.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  My hair is shiny and doesn&#x27;t fade and is gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> Used once, made my scalp burn....I threw the product away.</li>
            <li> Works , doesn&#x27;t dry out scalp and keeps color. Been using for over a year. Doesn&#x27;t work as well guess my hair got used to it but its a very nice product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really does cause your hair to look thicker. Since it makes my hair look fuller I do not have to shampoo as often! I do prefer same product but John Frieda brand. I would try both of them.</li>
            <li> I smelled like a hippie and my hair felt like their was a film on it. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells super and moisturizes my hair well. I think prolonged use has made my hair less responsive to this conditioner, but otherwise, it say everything it does.</li>
            <li> The ever pure products cans be difficult to find routinely in the local grocery. Amazon can be counted on to have them in stock. This is a good, relatively cheap product that works well for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other shampoos now since I discovered the Loreal sulfate free products.  This one in particular give alot of volume and keeps the frizzies away when it&#x27;s humid or foggy :o)</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this conditioner would do a better job in providing volume to my hair. Did not happen. However, it does make my hair soft and manageable, and the scent is very clean, not sweet or floral. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, like a high end product. I don&#x27;t have color treated hair but I got it for the volumizing aspect because my hair is long and gets weighed down easily. This leaves my hair silky smooth and soft but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all; it&#x27;s so light. I love that it&#x27;s vegan and sulfate free too. I&#x27;m buying more things from this line now and so far they&#x27;ve all been great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the L&#x27;oreal Ever- line of shampoos and conditioners for years, mostly sticking to the moisture version.  I switched to the volume version because my very fine hair doesn&#x27;t have much volume, but it just dried my hair out and caused some breakage.</li>
            <li> first time buying this. always on lookout for good conditioner. this smells wonderful, nice clean smell, not overpowering. will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the salon quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just love this brand and ordered second time</li>
            <li> Naturally I have Fine, Thin hair (gee thanks mom &amp; dad).  Typically, shampoo makes my hair clean, but the conditioner weighs my hair down SO much, that that it looks greasy and dirty.  Picked up both the volume shampoo AND conditioner at my local pharmacy on a whim and used it last night for the first time.  OH MY ROWLING, this stuff is the ish.  I&#x27;ve used Infusium 23, Paul Mitchell, L&#x27;oreal Kids (I actually loved their extra gentle line), Pantene, and John Frieda etc.  After using everpure, my hair and scalp actually felt CLEAN !</li>
            <li> I started using a volumizing conditioner when staying at a friend&#x27;s, and loved the extra bounce it gave my hair.  Did not however love the price tag ($20 plus!) so have been looking around for a more reasonably priced alternative.  This conditioner works quite well.  The added volume isn&#x27;t quite so impressive as with the super-expensive brand, but it is considerable, and helps my short hair cut stay organized a bit longer.  Also, this product rinses out very cleanly; some others I tried were almost gummy.  As to the impact on color, I can&#x27;t say, since my hair isn&#x27;t colored.  For normal aging hair, however, it works very nicely.</li>
            <li> been using this for several years. Love the odor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner with the shampoo for quite awhile and I will not change. I use L&#x27;Oreal hair color so it only makes sense to use the shampoo and conditioner. Further, it does give awesome volume to my 65 year old shoulder length blond hair!!!</li>
            <li> For those of us who shampoo everyday regular shampoos can be damaging. At last, someone (Loreal) has made sulfate free shampoos that are not expensive and work great!</li>
            <li> I like the way this makes my hair feel plus it has a nice scent.  It is a little hard to find in the stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair but it&#x27;s very fine and somewhat thin. I also color my hair so I was hoping for a lot from this product. It does seem to make a difference on the length of time I can go without coloring my hair but I really don&#x27;t notice it giving me the volume I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Really like this sulfate free product and for some reason, the volumizing conditioner is difficult to find in my local pharmacy. Glad I was able to purchase it here.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years now.  No way my colored hair could tolerate the length I like it to be without this.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; always have a tough time finding conditioners that hydrate well enough without weighing my hair down. This makes it nice &amp; smooth, and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves your hair so soft and has a natural light scent. You only need a little bit (thick, wavy, middle of the back length hair), and it goes a long way. Couldn&#x27;t be happier, will keep buying as long as I can find it!</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I was purchasing high end salon products for $20-30 per bottle. I would typically switch brands a few times a year as the affects would seem to wear off after a while or I would get bored with the product. I find this conditioner to be on par with or better than those products. I have now been using this conditioner exclusively (or others from this same line) for over a year and I have abandoned all other brands. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Like many women, I try what seems to be every new shampoo and conditioner that comes on the market, all of which claim to do \\&quot;wonders\\&quot; for one&#x27;s hair.  Well, this one really works!  I have fine hair and every conditioner that I&#x27;ve used in the past plasters my hair down.  The L&#x27;Oreal Volume conditioner leaves my hair full and easy to blow dry and that&#x27;s what it claims and that&#x27;s what it does.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because a salon I went to (where they did an amazing job styling my hair) used it. I loved everything about it - the smell, the silky weightlessness of my hair, etc. - however, it didn&#x27;t last beyond the first use. Every use thereafter, my hair turned out dull, dry, and easily tangled. Total bummer. I would never buy this, or anything from the EverPure line, again.</li>
            <li> I should have know better than buy inexpensive hair conditioner.  The deal breaker for me is that is STRONG SMELLING! It smell just like cheap men cologne.  I gave it to my husband.</li>
            <li> Kind of leaves my hair staticy. I prefer L&#x27;Oreal  EverPure Sulfate-Free Color Care System Moisture Conditioner (same Rosemary/Mint scent) over this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because a friend recommended it. I really like Enjoy conditioner but I do not like the price tag of it. I think this conditioner had has a funny smell to it. However it does work okay. I am thinking about trying another Loreal conditioner instead.</li>
            <li> Prevents color from leaching but still provides good moisture. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for very dry hair, however - but it&#x27;s good for normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li> This Sulfate free line is all I use anymore, it works great and the smell is amazing. I&#x27;ve had people ask me what body spray I am wearing and it&#x27;s just my hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the volume shampoo and the conditioner. They dried out my hair so much I stopped using them after 3 days.  Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Great, fresh smell.  Products works to detangle but I have yet to see any real help with volume.  I have long straight hair and it really doesnt look any different than using a non volume conditioner.</li>
            <li> Like everything else in this line I love this conditioner. It leaves my hair light and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> great product, just didn&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
            <li> I have been using this product more than a month now and I can tell the difference in my hair, more volume and my red dye actually stays longer, so im definitely getting it again. It doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy feeling of other conditioners and it smells great, refreshing mint and rosemary are the perfect combination.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo/conditioner because my hair dresser said I should use sulfate free shampoo. It smells good also :)</li>
            <li> I Love it!  It smells just like a conditioner that would be used in a salon!  It is not greasy or slimy like a lot of conditioners.  It rinses clean and is a color protector too!</li>
            <li> Smells gross, dried my hair out to the point it felt like a bale of hay. No additional volume noticed.</li>
            <li> Great to help preserve color -- wish they offered the shampoo as part of the program too...</li>
            <li> Love this line from Loreal.  Rarely do I find something that works so well on my thick, wavy, color treated,  52 y/o hair.  Salon quality at a much better price.  Only downfall ? Rarely does Amazon have the shampoo and conditioner available on prime, which forces me into the B&amp;M world.</li>
