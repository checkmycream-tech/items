            <li>I LOVE Murad products!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>my favorite brand and night cream!</li>
            <li>Really amazing night cream.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a nice sparkly glow to the face.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and feels wonderful on the skin.</li>
            <li>(my husbands likes it too) and I like the sheen that adds a nice glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have aging combination skin; this product seemed to cause some breaking out when I used it during warm weather.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use much to be effective.</li>
            <li>These Murad products are awesome and have really improved the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, nice thickness, and makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>No bad odor, great feel.</li>
            <li>The night cream is very nice; however, I find that I need a bit more moisturizing, so I top it off by adding my Avon Ultimate night cream (which is just amazing) and this seems to work beautifully for my dryer skin in Colorado country!</li>
            <li>I love being able to get this procuct whenever I want to without being on the Murad monthly plan!</li>
            <li>The best is Resurgence night cream in my non professional opinion.  </li>
            <li>This is just an OK night cream with moisturizing properties on its own.</li>
            <li>and I have light, dryish skin; I am looking really good.</li>
            <li>BUT IF YOU USE DR MURADS PRODUCTS AND GET YOUR SELF ON A GREAT EATING THE RIGHT FOODS LOT OF VEGS FRUITS BERRIES AND</li>

            <li>(I like Obagi C better),</li>
            <li>I love all the Murad products.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better in the morning after using this at night.</li>
            <li>Will know more when I finish the tube.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.</li>
            <li>Not so sure it does so well.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Five more words are required, so I&#x27;ll just say it again ...</li>
            <li>Murad Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I believe it helps nourish my skin and leaves it more supple.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this night cream.  </li>
            <li>Love all the Murad products</li>
            <li>Skin does feel softer and texture looks a lot better</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love it and it lasts about a month even using it both day and night.</li>
            <li>The Murad website shows how to find out if the product you receive is authentic.</li>
            <li>love murad.</li>
            <li>I do love this Murad Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream.  </li>
            <li>Sun, sun and more sun.</li>
            <li>I love Murad.</li>
            <li>Skin feels better than a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Most lines have disappeard.</li>
            <li>Texture and color are better as well.</li>
            <li>It really works great for aging skin.</li>
            <li>so then went with Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Meaningful Beauty of which I used for about a year</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>Have been using Murad Resurgence for many years.</li>
            <li>I received the exact product I ordered and very quickly; the service was great.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the cream seems to be very rich</li>
            <li>I am in my early 50s, and have taken great care of myself and protected my skin.</li>
            <li>I am really looking good.</li>
            <li>I like the feel of the cream, very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>IN YOU FINE LINES DRYNESS</li>
            <li>YOU WILL NOTICE A HUGE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>I used Neutrogena Moisturizer, and it made my pores look huge.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Murad Night cream for several years and it is a great product.</li>
            <li>This night cream is light, but feels fabulous.  </li>
            <li>BECAUSE YOU WONT JUST LOOK GREAT OUTSIDE</li>
            <li>They even included a thank you for purchasing note with the product so you can tell customer service is important to them.</li>
            <li>It feels creamy, yet light on my skin, with no irritation.</li>
            <li>It is so hydrating, smooth and makes my skin look \\&quot;dewey\\&quot;, hydrated.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great about taking the product back.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>smooth texture</li>
            <li>, i add a drop of water to smooth all over my face bc</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li>but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li>One of the best things about this product is that it is for aging skin which is usually a recipe for my still oily skin to breakout, but not with this item.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m starting to be impressed.</li>
            <li>This would be a great product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for mature skin, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had dry skin and have searched for years for a great cream to use at night.</li>
            <li>I love the whole Resurgence line- from mask/eye</li>
            <li>Love the whole resurgence line.</li>
            <li>surely it can&#x27;t cost this much too make.</li>
            <li>loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to finally find something that gently smooths and revitalizes my skin.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always good to try new things, makes you appreciate the old!</li>
            <li>The one I received had a seal that had been scratched over (defaced) and a new sticker added on top.</li>
            <li>Makes you skin very soft and it smells great but no big changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth silky feel and goes on very evenly.</li>
            <li>My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great.</li>
            <li>I only use this cream at night with my nightly routine but it goes on nicely doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>This product is pricey, but absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The products are rapidly absorbed into my skin and leave it looking refreshed.</li>
            <li>My aging skin (early 60&#x27;s) has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>AND ALWAYS EAT RIGHT AND DRINK LOTS OF WATER REMENBER</li>
            <li>I normally like skincare products that are fragrance free</li>
            <li>I have probably tried at least a million night creams, and this is by far the best yet!  </li>
            <li>I am religiously using the resurgence line and love the products so far - have been on the regimen for about 2 months and see a distinct difference in the texture of my skin - improved smoothness/moisture and a lessening of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old with skin damage and dryness with fine lines.</li>
            <li>It has not caused any break-outs, it has stopped the flaking on certain parts of my face, reduced the laugh lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>the woman who gave me my facial a couple weeks ago said she&#x27;s seen more wrinkles on people in their 20&#x27;s than she sees on my face.</li>
            <li>This is the first time i used this vendor and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love their entire line.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try again and this fresh creamy batch is really working --</li>
            <li>and I bought it through her spa the first time, but found it here on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>so much I use it in the morning under my make up too!</li>
            <li>It might not be so good for oily skin, and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll feel about in the hot summer, but for winter and cooler weather</li>
            <li>This has been the first skin care product that really makes a difference to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>VERY MOISTURIZING.</li>
            <li>this stuff REALLY works.</li>
            <li>WHOLE GRAINS</li>
            <li>In the beginning I was using too much and my face felt sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for some months now and it really works.  </li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Nightly application has really helped.</li>
            <li>it really did not help at all.  </li>
            <li>cream really re-hydrates my skin and gives it a luster it hasn&#x27;t had for years.</li>
            <li>and I really can tell the difference already.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference when I use something else.  </li>
            <li>Even botox didnt help it that much.</li>
            <li>but Ive found other products that are much cheaper for much more then</li>
            <li>Will buy more of this and other Murad products.</li>
            <li>No different than the cheap creams except for high price.</li>
            <li>, I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing yet gentle to my Irish skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this leaves my face smooth but not greasy looking</li>
            <li>Decent but doesn&#x27;t meet my standards.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and some fine lines.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I think the price is too high...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as well as the rest of the Resurgence line.</li>
            <li>I plan to place another order for the same product once the first has run out!</li>
            <li>Hydration was minimal compared to nutrogena oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have bought well over 1.5 thousand dollars worth of creams and serums in the last 6 mo. of this year</li>
            <li>i have super sensitive, combo skin with occasional break-outs.  </li>
            <li>It is one of those products that I now would prefer not to live without.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for mature skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that is OK by design</li>
            <li>I have mature, sensitive skin and started using Murad products exclusively over 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Really, it is the only one you need from the resurgence line.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and/or combination skin</li>
            <li>Murad Resurgence Night Cream does not leave my face greasy, it is soft and hydrated every morning.</li>
            <li>The product does not appear to be what I ordered unless the packaging has changed completely.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>You must start that skin regime early.</li>
            <li>The skin care professional</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;great and look better (at least to myself, and isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about anyway?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy and my skin just seems to be better the next morning after I use it.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but I have found nothing as good.</li>
            <li>Favorite of all Night Creams I have used over the past 30 years!</li>
            <li>Have tried other less expensive brands, but this is the best!</li>
            <li>Some people complained about the smell, but it just smells fragrance free to me, not smelly.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend it for mature (over 50) women.  </li>
            <li>After hearing about all the knock-offs, I think I might consider purchasing directly from Murad - to see if there&#x27;s an obvious improvement?  </li>
            <li>a little goes a long way &amp; its super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I live in a fairly dry climate and that doesn&#x27;t help matters!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it for long, but like it so far</li>
            <li>I will buy it again, little expensive, but good.</li>

            <li> It does make your fine lines disappear with continual usage, very happy to have found this product!</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated and looks fairly radiant, but then again I also use vitamin E oil on my face.  </li>

            <li> Love all the products of the Murad Resurgence line, I will never use another product again!  </li>
            <li> Love Murad products!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Murad products!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> my favorite brand and night cream!</li>
            <li> Really amazing night cream.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a nice sparkly glow to the face.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and feels wonderful on the skin.</li>
            <li> (my husbands likes it too) and I like the sheen that adds a nice glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have aging combination skin; this product seemed to cause some breaking out when I used it during warm weather.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use much to be effective.</li>
            <li> These Murad products are awesome and have really improved the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, nice thickness, and makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> No bad odor, great feel.</li>
            <li> The night cream is very nice; however, I find that I need a bit more moisturizing, so I top it off by adding my Avon Ultimate night cream (which is just amazing) and this seems to work beautifully for my dryer skin in Colorado country!</li>
            <li> I love being able to get this procuct whenever I want to without being on the Murad monthly plan!</li>
            <li> The best is Resurgence night cream in my non professional opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is just an OK night cream with moisturizing properties on its own.</li>
            <li> and I have light, dryish skin; I am looking really good.</li>
            <li> BUT IF YOU USE DR MURADS PRODUCTS AND GET YOUR SELF ON A GREAT EATING THE RIGHT FOODS LOT OF VEGS FRUITS BERRIES AND</li>
            <li> I love this product line</li>
            <li> Love love this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li> My lines are softened, my skin is more supple and I have gotten many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Your face feels better the moment it is applied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the cleansing cream which was ok</li>
            <li> (I like Obagi C better),</li>
            <li> I love all the Murad products.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better in the morning after using this at night.</li>
            <li> Will know more when I finish the tube.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> Not so sure it does so well.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Five more words are required, so I&#x27;ll just say it again ...</li>
            <li> Murad Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I believe it helps nourish my skin and leaves it more supple.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this night cream.  </li>
            <li> Love all the Murad products</li>
            <li> Skin does feel softer and texture looks a lot better</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love it and it lasts about a month even using it both day and night.</li>
            <li> The Murad website shows how to find out if the product you receive is authentic.</li>
            <li> love murad.</li>
            <li> I do love this Murad Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream.  </li>
            <li> Sun, sun and more sun.</li>
            <li> I love Murad.</li>
            <li> Skin feels better than a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Most lines have disappeard.</li>
            <li> Texture and color are better as well.</li>
            <li> It really works great for aging skin.</li>
            <li> so then went with Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Meaningful Beauty of which I used for about a year</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> Have been using Murad Resurgence for many years.</li>
            <li> I received the exact product I ordered and very quickly; the service was great.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the cream seems to be very rich</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50s, and have taken great care of myself and protected my skin.</li>
            <li> I am really looking good.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the cream, very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> IN YOU FINE LINES DRYNESS</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOTICE A HUGE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> I used Neutrogena Moisturizer, and it made my pores look huge.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Murad Night cream for several years and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> This night cream is light, but feels fabulous.  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE YOU WONT JUST LOOK GREAT OUTSIDE</li>
            <li> They even included a thank you for purchasing note with the product so you can tell customer service is important to them.</li>
            <li> It feels creamy, yet light on my skin, with no irritation.</li>
            <li> It is so hydrating, smooth and makes my skin look \\&quot;dewey\\&quot;, hydrated.</li>
            <li> Amazon was great about taking the product back.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> smooth texture</li>
            <li> , i add a drop of water to smooth all over my face bc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li> but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> One of the best things about this product is that it is for aging skin which is usually a recipe for my still oily skin to breakout, but not with this item.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m starting to be impressed.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for mature skin, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry skin and have searched for years for a great cream to use at night.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Resurgence line- from mask/eye</li>
            <li> Love the whole resurgence line.</li>
            <li> surely it can&#x27;t cost this much too make.</li>
            <li> loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to finally find something that gently smooths and revitalizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always good to try new things, makes you appreciate the old!</li>
            <li> The one I received had a seal that had been scratched over (defaced) and a new sticker added on top.</li>
            <li> Makes you skin very soft and it smells great but no big changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth silky feel and goes on very evenly.</li>
            <li> My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great.</li>
            <li> I only use this cream at night with my nightly routine but it goes on nicely doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is pricey, but absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The products are rapidly absorbed into my skin and leave it looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> My aging skin (early 60&#x27;s) has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> AND ALWAYS EAT RIGHT AND DRINK LOTS OF WATER REMENBER</li>
            <li> I normally like skincare products that are fragrance free</li>
            <li> I have probably tried at least a million night creams, and this is by far the best yet!  </li>
            <li> I am religiously using the resurgence line and love the products so far - have been on the regimen for about 2 months and see a distinct difference in the texture of my skin - improved smoothness/moisture and a lessening of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old with skin damage and dryness with fine lines.</li>
            <li> It has not caused any break-outs, it has stopped the flaking on certain parts of my face, reduced the laugh lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> the woman who gave me my facial a couple weeks ago said she&#x27;s seen more wrinkles on people in their 20&#x27;s than she sees on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i used this vendor and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love their entire line.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try again and this fresh creamy batch is really working --</li>
            <li> and I bought it through her spa the first time, but found it here on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> so much I use it in the morning under my make up too!</li>
            <li> It might not be so good for oily skin, and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll feel about in the hot summer, but for winter and cooler weather</li>
            <li> This has been the first skin care product that really makes a difference to my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> VERY MOISTURIZING.</li>
            <li> this stuff REALLY works.</li>
            <li> WHOLE GRAINS</li>
            <li> In the beginning I was using too much and my face felt sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some months now and it really works.  </li>
            <li> Price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Nightly application has really helped.</li>
            <li> it really did not help at all.  </li>
            <li> cream really re-hydrates my skin and gives it a luster it hasn&#x27;t had for years.</li>
            <li> and I really can tell the difference already.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference when I use something else.  </li>
            <li> Even botox didnt help it that much.</li>
            <li> but Ive found other products that are much cheaper for much more then</li>
            <li> Will buy more of this and other Murad products.</li>
            <li> No different than the cheap creams except for high price.</li>
            <li> , I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing yet gentle to my Irish skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this leaves my face smooth but not greasy looking</li>
            <li> Decent but doesn&#x27;t meet my standards.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and some fine lines.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think the price is too high...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as well as the rest of the Resurgence line.</li>
            <li> I plan to place another order for the same product once the first has run out!</li>
            <li> Hydration was minimal compared to nutrogena oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have bought well over 1.5 thousand dollars worth of creams and serums in the last 6 mo. of this year</li>
            <li> i have super sensitive, combo skin with occasional break-outs.  </li>
            <li> It is one of those products that I now would prefer not to live without.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for mature skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is OK by design</li>
            <li> I have mature, sensitive skin and started using Murad products exclusively over 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Really, it is the only one you need from the resurgence line.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and/or combination skin</li>
            <li> Murad Resurgence Night Cream does not leave my face greasy, it is soft and hydrated every morning.</li>
            <li> The product does not appear to be what I ordered unless the packaging has changed completely.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> You must start that skin regime early.</li>
            <li> The skin care professional</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;great and look better (at least to myself, and isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about anyway?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and my skin just seems to be better the next morning after I use it.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I have found nothing as good.</li>
            <li> Favorite of all Night Creams I have used over the past 30 years!</li>
            <li> Have tried other less expensive brands, but this is the best!</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the smell, but it just smells fragrance free to me, not smelly.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend it for mature (over 50) women.  </li>
            <li> After hearing about all the knock-offs, I think I might consider purchasing directly from Murad - to see if there&#x27;s an obvious improvement?  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way &amp; its super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I live in a fairly dry climate and that doesn&#x27;t help matters!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for long, but like it so far</li>
            <li> I will buy it again, little expensive, but good.</li>
            <li> what I got, I got a small bottle for way too much money.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star rating because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> My skin actually does stay moisturized all night long!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s with blotchy, pale skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, however, they always fall short of Murad.</li>
            <li> It never irritates my skin, and my skin never feels dry.</li>
            <li> still felt dry after use</li>
            <li> It helps with my dry skin and doesn&#x27;t feel too oily.</li>
            <li> I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to see a slight glow/brightness to my skin.</li>
            <li> , it was just as or more expensive than Murad and I was not satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> it is very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> The skin softened and little by little it grew smaller, and finally was no longer.</li>
            <li> No matter how rough my day is with this Night-time cream my face wakes up refreshed.</li>
            <li> I spent a LOT of time in the sun, tanning my skin, and my face is now</li>
            <li> Used to use this product line exclusively, tried something else being curious and my skin paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they are expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I will never look for any other skin care products because I don&#x27;t have to</li>
            <li> The other line- Age reform -has shellfish in it-</li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t see any of the other benefits it claims to have.</li>
            <li> I forgot my ID the other day and the grocery store would not let me buy alcohol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but always return to Murad Resurgence Age-Balancing NIght Cream --</li>
            <li> I have used other night creams and living in Wisconsin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this,as well as other Murad products for years and am always complimented on my complexion.  </li>
            <li> and you are having trouble with dry patches that will not go away, then this is the product for you.    </li>
            <li> Also, the words &amp;#34;Resurgence,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;night cream, and &amp;#34;Age-Balancing&amp;#34; are missing and it comes in a jar instead of in the white tube with the green lettering.</li>
            <li> When I think of all those other products and money I wasted.</li>
            <li> I no longer have issues with dryness and my wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE PRICEY,</li>
            <li> I used this in the summer at night and my broke out a little.</li>
            <li> so have returned to Murad products and will be staying with Murad this time, no more experimenting as none other can compare.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money trying to &#x27;save&#x27; money.</li>
            <li> I just started using this moisturizer a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> used it for a few weeks no drastic improvement in skin texture..</li>
            <li> to heavy of a cream-skin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the gold you&#x27;ll wear everyday.  </li>
            <li> $25 less!</li>
            <li> , I had a tube, years ago, that had must have been past its expiration date, because the oil had separated...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too lazy to keep up with a routine.</li>
            <li> I used Murad products for several years than decided it was just to expensive</li>
            <li> This stuff is VERY expensive  - instead, I&#x27;d suggest that you try other similar products to see how their results are: like Aveeno and Revitalize.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, hormonal changes and chemo have aged me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 81, am my friends  and strangers say I appear to be in my late 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The cream is rather thick, but does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> You need to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money).</li>
            <li> Share the secret.</li>
            <li> It can produce dramatic results when used in tandem with step 2, the Murad Age-Diffusing Serum  (with 8% Glycolic Acid).</li>
            <li> but this has a weird play dough smell.</li>
            <li> but it is difficult to tell if there has been any improvement in my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see when the cold Wi.</li>
            <li> Fells like plastic, unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> Disappointed, can&#x27;t say I saw any results after a month. :-(</li>
            <li> I used this tube of product, but would not purchase again,  IMO it smells awful :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this night cream a lot. It isn&#x27;t heavy and my skin just seems to be better the next morning after I use it. I will be 55 this month and nobody knows it.</li>
            <li> Non greasy so doesn&#x27;t get all over bedding.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product line but Ive found other products that are much cheaper for much more then what I got, I got a small bottle for way too much money.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any results at all!&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend and will not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money. No different than the cheap creams except for high price.</li>
            <li> I am religiously using the resurgence line and love the products so far - have been on the regimen for about 2 months and see a distinct difference in the texture of my skin - improved smoothness/moisture and a lessening of fine lines and wrinkles. The night cream is very nice; however, I find that I need a bit more moisturizing, so I top it off by adding my Avon Ultimate night cream (which is just amazing) and this seems to work beautifully for my dryer skin in Colorado country!</li>
            <li> Resurgence Age Balancing night cream is a great night cream. I use it on my neck also. It renews and balances out the oil in my skin. Amazon is my go to place to purchase Murad at great prices.</li>
            <li> Decent but doesn&#x27;t meet my standards. I normally like skincare products that are fragrance free but this has a weird play dough smell. I haven&#x27;t experienced any benefit.</li>
            <li> Love love this product. It leaves a nice sparkly glow to the face.</li>
            <li> VERY MOISTURIZING. A LITTLE PRICEY, BUT I WOULD RATHER SPEND MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT I KNOW WORKS.</li>
            <li> I use this day and night. It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found and I use in conjunction with the Murad Resurgence Eye Cream. I no longer have issues with dryness and my wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have mature, sensitive skin and started using Murad products exclusively over 10 years ago.  The Age-Balancing Night Cream is part of Murad&#x27;s Resurgence line, and I have been very happy with it.  It never irritates my skin, and my skin never feels dry.</li>
            <li> I have probably tried at least a million night creams, and this is by far the best yet!  Reasonably priced and feels wonderful on the skin. My skin actually does stay moisturized all night long!  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine. Well, at 56 I just felt my skin wasn&#x27;t looking great and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money). My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great. That was when I decided to invest in the entire Resurgence line of products. I started with the wash to day/night treatments, the mask etc. It was a costly order but the results are worth it! It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing. Even my husband noticed the difference. Don&#x27;t waste money trying to &#x27;save&#x27; money. I will never look for any other skin care products because I don&#x27;t have to, I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li> I love the whole Resurgence line- from mask/eye cream/ day and night cream and serum. I am 40 years old with skin damage and dryness with fine lines. My lines are softened, my skin is more supple and I have gotten many compliments on my skin. The other line- Age reform -has shellfish in it- so I stick with the resurgence. I have tried multiple products- skinceuticals/ Perricone- they did nothing for me. This is the one I love best.</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Murad Night cream for several years and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> No matter how rough my day is with this Night-time cream my face wakes up refreshed. It&#x27;s awesome and I&#x27;m sold. I&#x27;ve been using it now for over 2 years!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Really, it is the only one you need from the resurgence line.  Moisturizes, but not greasy.  Your face feels better the moment it is applied.  I have been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> Never saw any earth-shattering results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for long, but like it so far</li>
            <li> This night cream is light, but feels fabulous.  I could truly see a difference after 4 weeks.  If it weren&#x27;t for the price, it would be my permanent night cream!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Left my face greasy &amp; I don&#x27;t have oily skin. Couldn&#x27;t return so out of the money. Its not inexpensive either.</li>
            <li> I use this night cream in conjunction with the cream cleanser and the toner.  My skin feels hydrated and looks fairly radiant, but then again I also use vitamin E oil on my face.  The cream is rather thick, but does not feel greasy.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I have been using it for about 5 months now, good stuff. Does the work.  I will buy it again, little expensive, but good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s with blotchy, pale skin. I just started using this moisturizer a few weeks ago. It has a smooth silky feel and goes on very evenly. It makes my skin feel refreshed. The smell is luscious  (my husbands likes it too) and I like the sheen that adds a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing it under makeup. Not sure if that is OK by design but I use a primer over it and I think my foundation stays on a bit longer.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend it for mature (over 50) women.  Have tried other less expensive brands, but this is the best!</li>
            <li> i never tried mural cream before I&#x27;ve always used arbonne!! def going back to arbonne! used it for a few weeks no drastic improvement in skin texture..to heavy of a cream-skin still felt dry after use</li>
            <li> If you want an excellent night cream, then, look no farther. To me this is the best one ever, ...it balances out your skin, hydrates, not greasy, absorbs, and the list goes on and on. Truly a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love being able to get this procuct whenever I want to without being on the Murad monthly plan! Great price and service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m around 40 and I have to say after running out of this product and seeing the difference in my skins texture, glow, and smoothness...this stuff REALLY works. The best part about it is that the results are immediate...no having to go through 3 bottles to see a change. I&#x27;ve tried the cleansing cream which was ok (I like Obagi C better), the day lotion - nothing to write home about, and the eye cream...pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and/or combination skin and you are having trouble with dry patches that will not go away, then this is the product for you.    It has not caused any break-outs, it has stopped the flaking on certain parts of my face, reduced the laugh lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> LOVE,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. Murad Resurgence Night Cream does not leave my face greasy, it is soft and hydrated every morning.</li>
            <li> USE THIS EVERY NIGHT AND YOUR SKIN IN THE MORNING WILL FILL GREAT. USE ALL OF THE ANTI AGING PRODUCTS AND WITHIN A WEEK YOU WILL NOTICE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN YOU FINE LINES DRYNESS IN YOU SKING AND ALWAYS EAT RIGHT AND DRINK LOTS OF WATER REMENBER YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT AND PUT INTO YOUR BODY IF YOU KEEP EATING JUNK YOUR SKIN WILL BE JUNK BUT IF YOU USE DR MURADS PRODUCTS AND GET YOUR SELF ON A GREAT EATING THE RIGHT FOODS LOT OF VEGS FRUITS BERRIES AND WHOLE GRAINS YOU WILL ADD ANOTHER 10 YEARS ON YOU LIFE BECAUSE YOU WONT JUST LOOK GREAT OUTSIDE BUT YOU WILL FELL AND LOOK GREAT ON THE OUT SIDE AS WELL.&lt;br /&gt;CATHY DAHL</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it&#x27;s just too heavy for me. Also, I didn&#x27;t see any of the other benefits it claims to have.</li>
            <li> This is the best night cream ever.  I use it with the Murad Age-defying Serum.. I love all the Murad products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and I am getting all kinds of compliments on my skin.  I just turned 40 and the woman who gave me my facial a couple weeks ago said she&#x27;s seen more wrinkles on people in their 20&#x27;s than she sees on my face. :)  I forgot my ID the other day and the grocery store would not let me buy alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for years and like them.  Amazon makes them affordable.</li>
            <li> I am not associated with Murad, but have been using their creams for years.  The best is Resurgence night cream in my non professional opinion.  It is the way that my skin responds to it......hydration, yes.......and no redness what so ever.  I keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li> I have aging combination skin; this product seemed to cause some breaking out when I used it during warm weather. I might give it another go now that it&#x27;s winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but always return to Murad Resurgence Age-Balancing NIght Cream -- I use it day and night!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Don&#x27;t need to use much to be effective.</li>
            <li> I like Murad products a lot gives me plenty of moisture even in the desert areas.</li>
            <li> The product does not appear to be what I ordered unless the packaging has changed completely. Also, the words &amp;#34;Resurgence,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;night cream, and &amp;#34;Age-Balancing&amp;#34; are missing and it comes in a jar instead of in the white tube with the green lettering. The consistency of the cream seems to be very rich so I&#x27;ll keep it as a moisturizer and still try to order the age-balancing night cream elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better in the morning after using this at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the night cream for 3 weeks and I&#x27;m starting to see a slight glow/brightness to my skin. I like the feel of the cream, very light and absorbs quickly. You need to use a very small amount. In the beginning I was using too much and my face felt sticky. I gave it a 3 star rating because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough. Will know more when I finish the tube. So far, I&#x27;m starting to be impressed.</li>
            <li> Love all the products of the Murad Resurgence line, I will never use another product again!  It does make your fine lines disappear with continual usage, very happy to have found this product!</li>
            <li> It feels good but it is difficult to tell if there has been any improvement in my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. Hydrates well and my skin feels so soft in the morning. I have used other night creams and living in Wisconsin it is very dry in the winter. Let&#x27;s see when the cold Wi. Weather comes rolling around. I&#x27;ll keep in touch.</li>
            <li> Love Murad products!  Like giving your face a drink of water.</li>
            <li> Not so sure it does so well.  My wife and I have used it for a month, and not a lot of results seen.  This stuff is VERY expensive  - instead, I&#x27;d suggest that you try other similar products to see how their results are: like Aveeno and Revitalize.  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do once we are out of this product brand.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! I LOVE Murad products!</li>
            <li> Favorite of all Night Creams I have used over the past 30 years!</li>
            <li> Good product for the money</li>
            <li> Love the whole resurgence line. I only use this cream at night with my nightly routine but it goes on nicely doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. I have dry skin and this leaves my face smooth but not greasy looking</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, nice thickness, and makes my skin smooth. Expensive, but I have found nothing as good. Lasts longer than you&#x27;d think, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some months now and it really works.  One of the best things about this product is that it is for aging skin which is usually a recipe for my still oily skin to breakout, but not with this item.  My skin has never looked better.  This product is pricey, but absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i used this vendor and would recommend to anyone. I received the exact product I ordered and very quickly; the service was great. They even included a thank you for purchasing note with the product so you can tell customer service is important to them. I plan to place another order for the same product once the first has run out! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I am 61yo. This is the best night cream I have ever purchased. Price is reasonable.  When I think of all those other products and money I wasted. I will continue to buy Murad products.</li>
            <li> I love their entire line.  It&#x27;s one of the best products I have ever used.  Five more words are required, so I&#x27;ll just say it again ... I love it!</li>
            <li> Fells like plastic, unpleasant smell I would never try this brand again  Should have returned it for my money back</li>
            <li> This has been the first skin care product that really makes a difference to my skin.  My hair stylist even told me that my skin looked great! After one month, I can definitely see an improvement in the smoothness and note a softer texture. It feels creamy, yet light on my skin, with no irritation. I am so happy to finally find something that gently smooths and revitalizes my skin. I am in my early 50s, and have taken great care of myself and protected my skin. Unfortunately, hormonal changes and chemo have aged me. Nightly application has really helped. I can highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;-- Please note, I had a tube, years ago, that had must have been past its expiration date, because the oil had separated...it really did not help at all.  I decided to try again and this fresh creamy batch is really working --</li>
            <li> I have used Murad products for 25 years and they are excellent, and made by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This is great for the winter. I have combination skin that is oily in the t zone. I used this in the summer at night and my broke out a little. I would only use this in the winter when my skin is drier. This would be a great product for dry skin.  I began using this at age 30 and I&#x27;m 32 now. You must start that skin regime early.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s with very dry skin. This did nothing for me. Hydration was minimal compared to nutrogena oil free moisturizer. Went back to that. It&#x27;s always good to try new things, makes you appreciate the old!</li>
            <li> I like the age-balancing cream. It helps with my dry skin and doesn&#x27;t feel too oily. It is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Murad Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream is fantastic! The skin care professional I see&lt;br /&gt;recommended it and I bought it through her spa the first time, but found it here on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;for $25 less! It is one of those products that I now would prefer not to live without. As&lt;br /&gt;a much younger person I spent a LOT of time in the sun, tanning my skin, and my face is now&lt;br /&gt;paying the price of that action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream really re-hydrates my skin and gives it a luster it hasn&#x27;t had for years. I feel&lt;br /&gt;great and look better (at least to myself, and isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about anyway?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It was delivered rapidly. The only reason I can&#x27;t give it&lt;br /&gt;five stars is I think the price is too high...surely it can&#x27;t cost this much too make.</li>
            <li> murad&#x27;s age balancing night cream is great! easy to use and feels wonderful on your skin. will buy it again</li>
            <li> good stuff and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> This cream does not leave your skin sticky. It penetrates well and I have been using it every night. I believe it helps nourish my skin and leaves it more supple.</li>
            <li> I love it excellent cream</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this night cream.  I use it both in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> These Murad products are awesome and have really improved the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is just an OK night cream with moisturizing properties on its own. It&#x27;s promoted as step 3 of a skin care regimen. It can produce dramatic results when used in tandem with step 2, the Murad Age-Diffusing Serum  (with 8% Glycolic Acid).</li>
            <li> Excellent skin care product.</li>
            <li> Used to use this product line exclusively, tried something else being curious and my skin paid for it.  Love all the Murad products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this,as well as other Murad products for years and am always complimented on my complexion.  I&#x27;m going to continue using Murad&#x27;s skin care regimen.  The products are rapidly absorbed into my skin and leave it looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, can&#x27;t say I saw any results after a month. :-(</li>
            <li> Just started using this night cream.  I noticed that this product is used by some of the spa salons in my city so wanted to try it.  Like it a lot and will continue to use it.  Skin does feel softer and texture looks a lot better</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for mature skin, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and some fine lines. I bought the serum and the night cream and I really can tell the difference already. Yes, they are expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. I used Neutrogena Moisturizer, and it made my pores look huge. The combination of this and the serum minimizes pores. Some people complained about the smell, but it just smells fragrance free to me, not smelly.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream for day or night and leaves skin glowing and feeling supple and youthful. I have tried everything. This is one of the best for over 40 skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream. I&#x27;ve always had dry skin and have searched for years for a great cream to use at night. I live in a fairly dry climate and that doesn&#x27;t help matters! I&#x27;ve been using all Murad products for about two years and been experimenting with the different lines. I like this cream so much I use it in the morning under my make up too! It is so hydrating, smooth and makes my skin look \\&quot;dewey\\&quot;, hydrated. I love it and it lasts about a month even using it both day and night.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for mature skin. Does not leave any oily residue on skin,makes it moist and nourished. Will buy more of this and other Murad products.</li>
            <li> The Murad website shows how to find out if the product you receive is authentic. The one I received had a seal that had been scratched over (defaced) and a new sticker added on top. I assume this means it was an expired product or otherwise defective. Amazon was great about taking the product back.</li>
            <li> My aging skin (early 60&#x27;s) has never looked better.  I didn&#x27;t realize how thirsty it was until I discovered this Murad line.  It might not be so good for oily skin, and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll feel about in the hot summer, but for winter and cooler weather it&#x27;s fantastic.  Great price through Amazon!</li>
            <li> i have super sensitive, combo skin with occasional break-outs.  this cream smells like blueberry muffin mix-light &amp; fruity.  smooth texture, i add a drop of water to smooth all over my face bc a little goes a long way &amp; its super moisturizing.  has calmed &amp; cleared my skin up &amp; seems to have made it smoother &amp; pores a bit smaller.  hope it still works in the summer, since it is so moisturizing.  loving it so far. best night cream i&#x27;ve tried &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  love murad.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Super moisturizing yet gentle to my Irish skin.</li>
            <li> Great product - love it!</li>
            <li> Best night cream ever, my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I am 33 and I used the cream for 20 days. I noticed the obvious wrinkle line on my forehead disappeared. Hopefully it is because of this product.</li>
            <li> I do love this Murad Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream.  I can really tell a difference when I use something else.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive.  No bad odor, great feel.</li>
            <li> Sun, sun and more sun. I&#x27;ve lived with constant sun on my skin. as I lived in Bermuda. I&#x27;ve never pampered my skin. I&#x27;m too lazy to keep up with a routine. I&#x27;ve purchased cleansers, day cream, night cream, eye cream, etc.; all with a promise to be good to my skin. It lasted a couple of day, and I&#x27;d forget to use them. When I was 70, I started using the age-balancing night cream; nothing else. I had what appeared to be a mole on the side of my nose. The doctor suggested burning it off. I faithfully used the night cream day and night on this unsightly lump. The skin softened and little by little it grew smaller, and finally was no longer. I&#x27;m 81, am my friends  and strangers say I appear to be in my late 60&#x27;s. Thank you Murad.</li>
            <li> I love Murad. I started using it three months ago. My skin looks great.</li>
            <li> my favorite brand and night cream!</li>
            <li> I got the Resurgence cleansing product, the Resurgence day cream and this product. It DOES actually fulfill my expectations. Not greasy and lasts and lasts. Skin feels better than a baby&#x27;s and it DOES help ease wrinkles. I have bought well over 1.5 thousand dollars worth of creams and serums in the last 6 mo. of this year and they dont do what this system does. This system works THE BEST.  I am really looking good. Most lines have disappeard. Have a line from mough to chin which is about %75 gone. Even botox didnt help it that much. And there is a 1 between my eyebrows which is also disappearing. I can&#x27;t  laud the Resurgence line enough. Also use the PaloVia laser and NuFace microcurrent. Considering I&#x27;ll be 65 next month and I have light, dryish skin; I am looking really good. Texture and color are better as well. The Resurgence isnt cheap, but Amazon tends to have the best selection of prices. But I would rather pay for products which work than pay for those which dont.</li>
            <li> perfect night cream for over 50 skin.  good value</li>
            <li> I have used murad age-balancing night cream for years.  It always moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.  I have tried other products, however, they always fall short of Murad. It is not a miracle worker...but what face cream is?</li>
            <li> Really amazing night cream.  The treatment package, serum, night cream, day moisturizer is awesome!  Do not want to be without it.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It really works great for aging skin. I highly recommend it as well as the rest of the Resurgence line.</li>
            <li> I used Murad products for several years than decided it was just to expensive so then went with Cindy Crawford&#x27;s Meaningful Beauty of which I used for about a year, it was just as or more expensive than Murad and I was not satisfied with the results so have returned to Murad products and will be staying with Murad this time, no more experimenting as none other can compare. I use all the Age-Balancing products, the night cream is wonderful as is the rest of the products.  By the way I am almost 69 years of age and look twenty years younger.  Try it, it is the best out there and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Item was as promised at a great price. Quick shipment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Night Cream for about a month.  It&#x27;s OK.  I use it in conjunction with Murad&#x27;s Hydro-Dynamic Ultimate Moisture Creme AM &amp; PM.  After hearing about all the knock-offs, I think I might consider purchasing directly from Murad - to see if there&#x27;s an obvious improvement?  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I used this tube of product, but would not purchase again,  IMO it smells awful :(</li>
            <li> Night cream that lasts through the night.</li>
            <li> The best night cream that you&#x27;ll love to wear.  It&#x27;s fabulous.  Feels wonderful and gives you the results you expect.  It&#x27;s the gold you&#x27;ll wear everyday.  You will have compliments.  Share the secret.</li>
            <li> Have been using Murad Resurgence for many years.</li>
            <li> Makes you skin very soft and it smells great but no big changes in my skin.</li>
