            <li>Perfect!  </li>
            <li>Count me as a very happy customer.</li>
            <li>The Wisp mask with this fabric frame is a great concept.</li>
            <li>seller has great price tho</li>
            <li>Works great and would buy again.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it was much more affordable.</li>
            <li>It fit perfect.</li>
            <li>It wears good and stays in place all night.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, fast shipping, excellent price, quality on the fabric frame is much better and does not break easily.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So just be care full using it and getting a good night sleep.</li>
            <li>The fabric is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with  it.</li>
            <li>I love my wisp mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot more luck with it.</li>
            <li>I really received great shipping time on this frame.</li>
            <li>Hurts the pocketbook, though, for sure.</li>
            <li>This one leave no imprint and is much more</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>These do wear out after about 6-8 months--but most bi-pap accessories (frames and headgear) do.</li>
            <li>Am sleeping better since I got the fabric frame.</li>
            <li>Fabric is nice and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly and is so much more comfortable than my old plastic one I had!</li>
            <li>Fast service, good price</li>
            <li>: The product is excellent, much better than the plastic that came with my machine leaving dents in my face and breaking apart in less than 6 months.  </li>
            <li>This is way better than the original plastic frame that came with my CPAP.  </li>
            <li>so nice to have a fresh clean one.</li>
            <li>Super glad we took time to look at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have happy to finally receive it.</li>
            <li>If you have one of the original plastic mask frames trust me</li>
            <li>this is a replacement as the original.</li>
            <li>It is actually more comfortable and fits better than the one that originally came from the Medical Supply.</li>
            <li>I strongly suspect the manufacturer is fully aware of the defects but likes selling lots of replacement frames.</li>
            <li>This is way more affordable and better quality solution than stuff from some of the bigger CPAP suppliers.</li>
            <li>If you are currently using the flexible plastic headgear, I would say give this a try, it&#x27;s so much better!</li>
            <li>exactly like the original.</li>
            <li>Exactly like my original one.</li>
            <li>The same thing I could&#x27;ve spent $80 for at $25, and the quality is great!</li>
            <li>Was it worth the wait?  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly it is way less flexible than the silicone frame that you get when you order the set up.</li>
            <li>Exactly what came with my BiPap.  </li>
            <li>The company needs to do much better to create a viable and lasting product.</li>
            <li>it is comfortable and just as sturdy as the gel and soft</li>
            <li>Wish the clear plastic was available.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I ordered and was so much more comfortable than the previous frame than I had.  </li>
            <li>Son (4yrs old) loves this one so much better than that old plastic one that they had before coming out with this one.  </li>
            <li>Positive attributes-</li>
            <li>Fast service and just what the Dr ordered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for some time now and really like it.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Really comfortable but only lasted 7 months.</li>
            <li>Along with the head gear this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and unlike other reviews I&#x27;ve not had issues with things breaking on it.</li>
            <li>Glad that I did, as my other one was wore out.</li>
            <li>It is so much lighter than older models.</li>
            <li>This one was an exact replacement to the old.</li>
            <li>I bought this fabric frame (and for much less than retail) here and love it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So, if you need anything before hand, it&#x27;s normally on you.  </li>
            <li>I ended up taping it together when I found I could purchase a new one here.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>I had read reviews that the new frames lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first frame I had lasted only about a month.</li>
            <li>It breaks easily after a few months use.</li>
            <li>I recently swapped out my old plastic headgear frame for this fabric one, and I must say I really prefer it.  </li>
            <li>There are no clips with the frame, so save your old clips to use.</li>
            <li>It is soft and flexible and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li>So far, the product works as described.  </li>
            <li>will report back after I get a few more months use from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every bad review deserves a good one when a positive update is possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I was afraid this would not be as solid as the strap that originally came with my mask, it has held up really well!</li>

            <li> As this  was already noted  in a few comments, it gets broken very easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected,Just ordered it as a back up as mine is slowly stretching and will eventually fail.&lt;br /&gt;amazon</li>
            <li> but I think I can wipe it down with a soft damp cloth no problem.  </li>
            <li> It is soft to the touch but firm enough to do what it should.</li>
            <li> I figured I had waited too long to get a warranty</li>
            <li> The Wisp in general is one of the most annoying CPAP masks I have tried.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will hold up long term with daily use and oils from my face getting on it.  </li>
            <li> - it is very flimsy and poorly made.</li>
            <li> This lasts only a few weeks and starts to break apart.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected and a lot cheaper than buying from the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I had patched it up to work but it kept breaking at other points.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and less expensive than form other sources.</li>
            <li> My old frame was tattered and broken.</li>
            <li> Mine lasted less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with that as far as I know.</li>
            <li> works, not much more else to say.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s washable,</li>
            <li> I know ordering medical equipment online is scary.</li>
            <li> I replace this part at least  every three months.</li>
            <li> : Service was slow, inconsistent and not informative.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the silicone version is not much better.</li>
            <li> The plastic is thin here and looks to be the weak spot on the frame.</li>
            <li> The plastic inside the fabric is very thin and breaks.</li>
            <li> It will fall apart within three or four weeks which makes it very expensive at $29.00.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY expensive.  </li>
            <li> Nothing to do with seller, just a bad design.</li>

            <li> It is actually more comfortable and fits better than the one that originally came from the Medical Supply. It was promptly shipped and came in a factory sealed bag. The best part is that it was much more affordable. Count me as a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping, excellent price, quality on the fabric frame is much better and does not break easily.</li>
            <li> The same thing I could&#x27;ve spent $80 for at $25, and the quality is great!</li>
            <li> I love my wisp mask. It is so much lighter than older models. I just didn&#x27;t like the feeling of the plastic frame. I bought this fabric frame (and for much less than retail) here and love it. It is very comfortable and unlike other reviews I&#x27;ve not had issues with things breaking on it. I&#x27;ve used it for some time now and really like it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get the fabric frame. The plastic inside the fabric is very thin and breaks. Get the plastic one. I&#x27;ve had a lot more luck with it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS HEADGEAR FRAME - it is very flimsy and poorly made. It will fall apart within three or four weeks which makes it very expensive at $29.00. The company needs to do much better to create a viable and lasting product. Unfortunately the silicone version is not much better. I strongly suspect the manufacturer is fully aware of the defects but likes selling lots of replacement frames.</li>
            <li> Paid only a portion of the price here than anywhere else!  Super glad we took time to look at Amazon. Son (4yrs old) loves this one so much better than that old plastic one that they had before coming out with this one.  thanks</li>
            <li> The Wisp mask with this fabric frame is a great concept. I do like wearing it.The only problem is try not to roll around on it while sleeping?  I am on my 3rd fabric frame and 2nd from Amazon. If you toss and turn a lot the plastic material under the fabric will at some point will break and just be held by the elastic material. So just be care full using it and getting a good night sleep.</li>
            <li> works, not much more else to say.  not a knockoff product.  so nice to have a fresh clean one.</li>
            <li> Positive attributes- It shipped quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative- Surprisingly it is way less flexible than the silicone frame that you get when you order the set up. The Wisp in general is one of the most annoying CPAP masks I have tried. Its extremely uncomfortable on the face, which is why I wanted to get the fabric frame, thinking it would be more flexible. That was not that case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to stay away from the Wisp all together.</li>
            <li> I recently swapped out my old plastic headgear frame for this fabric one, and I must say I really prefer it.  It is soft and flexible and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  Not sure how it will hold up long term with daily use and oils from my face getting on it.  Not sure if it&#x27;s washable, but I think I can wipe it down with a soft damp cloth no problem.  If you are currently using the flexible plastic headgear, I would say give this a try, it&#x27;s so much better!</li>
            <li> My old frame was tattered and broken. This one was an exact replacement to the old.</li>
            <li> So far, the product works as described.  The frame that came with the CPAP machine, broke after almost two months.  For those of you who have health insurance, to pay for the various parts of your CPAP machine, and the headgear, take a look at what your insurance company is being billed.  It&#x27;s VERY expensive.  Not to mention,  the insurance company will only pay for replacement parts at pre-determined intervals.  So, if you need anything before hand, it&#x27;s normally on you.  This product is is waaay cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nicer than the one I bought somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I bought this January of 2014 and I&#x27;m just replacing it now.  Nothing wrong with that as far as I know.</li>
            <li> Nothing to do with seller, just a bad design. It breaks easily after a few months use. This is our 3rd buy in 2 yrs. seller has great price tho</li>
            <li> I really received great shipping time on this frame. Glad that I did, as my other one was wore out. Works great and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected,Just ordered it as a back up as mine is slowly stretching and will eventually fail.&lt;br /&gt;amazon rocks.</li>
            <li> Really comfortable but only lasted 7 months. Bought another because it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s preferred mask. Hurts the pocketbook, though, for sure.</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly and is so much more comfortable than my old plastic one I had! I love it!</li>
            <li> Along with the head gear this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Every bad review deserves a good one when a positive update is possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The product is excellent, much better than the plastic that came with my machine leaving dents in my face and breaking apart in less than 6 months.  I ended up taping it together when I found I could purchase a new one here.  This one leave no imprint and is much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Service was slow, inconsistent and not informative.  They say it has been shipped when it had not been while I was kept waiting with the one I had being held together with masking tape.  It was only after 2 request of where the shipment was I received notice it was back ordered and not shipped as they stated.  I received it almost 3 weeks later.  Was it worth the wait?  I don&#x27;t know about that.  I have happy to finally receive it.</li>
            <li> This is way better than the original plastic frame that came with my CPAP.  If you have one of the original plastic mask frames trust me it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it breaks.  This is way more affordable and better quality solution than stuff from some of the bigger CPAP suppliers.</li>
            <li> Everything it says it is. I know ordering medical equipment online is scary. Is it the brand it claims to be? Will it work? It does, and it is.</li>
            <li> beter than the gel that it comes with  it is comfortable and just as sturdy as the gel and soft</li>
            <li> exactly like the original. I have had no problems with it at this point.</li>
            <li> The first frame I had lasted only about a month. I had patched it up to work but it kept breaking at other points. I figured I had waited too long to get a warranty so I ordered a new one. I had read reviews that the new frames lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is not showing any defects. It is a lot easier to hold the seal than with my patched up one. (I know, duh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will report back after I get a few more months use from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-13-2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this every night and it has not worn out. I am pleased with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9-2-2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic which ties into where the pillow mounts broke last night. The plastic is thin here and looks to be the weak spot on the frame. I turn over a couple of times during the night and may have stressed it. But now I will have to find another supplier for the frame.</li>
            <li> breaks at nose pad mount after about 6 week</li>
            <li> Fast service, good price</li>
            <li> Love this product. It wears good and stays in place all night. It is soft to the touch but firm enough to do what it should.</li>
            <li> Purchased almost a year ago and it still fits.  Remember to purchase nasal/nose piece.  It is not included.</li>
            <li> As this  was already noted  in a few comments, it gets broken very easily. The company needs to improve the quality of this product. This lasts only a few weeks and starts to break apart. This applies both to fabric and plastic versions. Please pass this to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Exactly like my original one. The fabric is very comfortable.  These do wear out after about 6-8 months--but most bi-pap accessories (frames and headgear) do.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I ordered and was so much more comfortable than the previous frame than I had.  Am sleeping better since I got the fabric frame.</li>
            <li> this is a replacement as the original.Wish the clear plastic was available.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and less expensive than form other sources.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected and a lot cheaper than buying from the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my face like the plastic strap that came with the headgear did. Fabric is nice and comfortable.</li>
            <li> While I was afraid this would not be as solid as the strap that originally came with my mask, it has held up really well! Highly recommend.</li>
