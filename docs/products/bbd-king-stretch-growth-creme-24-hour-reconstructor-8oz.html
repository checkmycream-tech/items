            <li>Great hair product leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>But used as a sealant and not as a moisturizer, hair grease is actually more effective than natural oils at sealing in moisture.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of cheap bathroom products.</li>
            <li>Having gotten that out the way, let me say, this product is FABULOUS at adding and retaining moisture in your hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair tangle free and stops breakage.  </li>
            <li>love this hair product ,my hair very soft&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always used this in the past and it is a very good product.</li>

            <li>Pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>My hair was pretty damaged</li>
            <li>I also use it to wrap my hair at night, it leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>hoping they will carry larger size to realize greater savings.  </li>
            <li>but I was told I needed to take a picture and send it to them first</li>
            <li>this product is good for softening the hair and adding moisture without making it feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get it, however the product leaked out of its container apparently it overheated.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this prioduct, pricey but worth it, which it was larger container for the price, but........</li>
            <li>t makes my hair very soft, no greasy and keeps the moisture!</li>
            <li>This product moisturizes very well and it leaves your hair soft  </li>
            <li>so I use it twice a day when I have my natural hair out.  </li>
            <li>I use it ALONG with a sealant (my hair is natural btw).</li>
            <li>As a cancer survivor I wanted to grow my hair back naturally.</li>

            <li> It may not be in the prettiest bottle, and the smell is awful, but this product is very effective at moisturizing afro hair in it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li> because  i haven use long</li>
            <li> My hair has not been this long since I was a child.</li>
            <li> Like when you go into a public bathroom and you can smell the cheap products they used to hide the bad odor of the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was crushed when they told me they were sold out....</li>
            <li> I use about a quarter size amount and work it through my hair while it is wet.</li>
            <li> I did get an email offering me a small portion of my money back.</li>
            <li> Stretch never let&#x27;s me down when it comes to breakage.</li>
            <li> I hate it so much that I had to add scented natural oil (egyptian musk) to cover the smell.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few months if anything changes</li>
            <li> however it is extremely over priced and the size is very small, the photo makes the jar look much larger than it actually is : (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and I usually get this from a prof beauty supply.</li>
            <li> but i pray that it work iam so tired of</li>
            <li> I did not use the product because I was afraid the overheating may have changed its properties.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>

            <li> this product is good for softening the hair and adding moisture without making it feel greasy or heavy. however it is extremely over priced and the size is very small, the photo makes the jar look much larger than it actually is : (</li>
            <li> Item shipped as promised.</li>
            <li> Love this product....Five-star!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product every day. i cant say i dont realy like it because  i haven use long but i pray that it work iam so tired of these  wig.it is just in the top  that iam having  the problem.  if  you  know  of anything i can use to go along with the stretch growth please let me know. i will be so greatful.  i cant tell anybody anything untill see some progress then i will be  glade to tell everybody.&lt;br /&gt;  GOD BLESS  Juanita  Daniel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it definitely helped with hair growth and manageability.  My hair has not been this long since I was a child.</li>
            <li> Like the product, but like the bigger size ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fully convinced of the use but it does well keeping my hair moisturized. My hair was pretty damaged so I use it twice a day when I have my natural hair out.  Will update in a few months if anything changes</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and I apply the stretch growth cream to straighten my hair, it works wonders. I noticed that my hair has grown some since using it about two weeks ago. I also use it to wrap my hair at night, it leaves my hair soft and smooth. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking to maintain healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product.  it is a bit pricy but have to adjust my budget to afford it as I want to give it a 6 month trial period.. then I can  compare condition of my hair.  hoping they will carry larger size to realize greater savings.  husband is bald and experimenting with this product.</li>
            <li> Great hair product leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Great Great Great customer service. The product works great leaves the hair soft and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so I havent seen a change in the length of my hair yet but I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I can recommend it to my friends lam seeing I results already.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing product that does not require one to use a large amount to achieve desired effects; I love it.</li>
            <li> As a cancer survivor I wanted to grow my hair back naturally. I really like this prioduct, pricey but worth it, which it was larger container for the price, but........t makes my hair very soft, no greasy and keeps the moisture! I will continue to use it  and I would recommend it also</li>
            <li> I have always used this in the past and it is a very good product. Love,love,love it. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Stretch never let&#x27;s me down when it comes to breakage. I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and I usually get this from a prof beauty supply. I was crushed when they told me they were sold out....I love amazon!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product because I saw it in a you tube video. I was excited to get it, however the product leaked out of its container apparently it overheated. I tried to get a refund but I was told I needed to take a picture and send it to them first, I didn&#x27;t want to go out an purchase a camera so they refused to take the product back give me my money back. I did get an email offering me a small portion of my money back. I did not use the product because I was afraid the overheating may have changed its properties. So I got stuck giving money away.... I will never purchase from this company again... Buyer be warned their customer service dos not exist!</li>
            <li> This product is actually a five star product. But I gave it four because of the horrid scent. Let&#x27;s talk about the scent. It&#x27;s awful. Reminds me of cheap bathroom products. Like when you go into a public bathroom and you can smell the cheap products they used to hide the bad odor of the bathroom. That&#x27;s what the smell of this product reminds me of. I hate it so much that I had to add scented natural oil (egyptian musk) to cover the smell. Having gotten that out the way, let me say, this product is FABULOUS at adding and retaining moisture in your hair. I use it ALONG with a sealant (my hair is natural btw). My sealant of choice is......blue magic hair grease. I know a lot of naturals are against hair grease. But used as a sealant and not as a moisturizer, hair grease is actually more effective than natural oils at sealing in moisture. But you must put a moisturizer first! Now back to the BBD Stretch cream. It may not be in the prettiest bottle, and the smell is awful, but this product is very effective at moisturizing afro hair in it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li> love this hair product ,my hair very soft&lt;br /&gt;GLAD TO HAVE THIS  LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS WHAT I BEEN WAITING</li>
            <li> I uses stretch everyday,seeing results so im very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I  love this product delivery was on time.  This product moisturizes very well and it leaves your hair soft  It does make your hair grow and it also leaves your hair with a great shine</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I use it after I wash my hair. It leaves my hair tangle free and stops breakage.  I use about a quarter size amount and work it through my hair while it is wet. My roller sets turns out beautiful with smooth and shiny curls!  You must use heat to activate the product (blow dryer or hair dryer). Pricey but worth it.  Highly recommend!</li>
