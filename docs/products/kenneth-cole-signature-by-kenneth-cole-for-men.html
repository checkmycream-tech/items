            <li>The smell of this perfume is really good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is too good to leave out of your product line.</li>
            <li>I bought this and sent it to him as a gift, and he loved it.</li>

            <li>The price was great and it was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great cologne for men, strong &amp; manly scent.</li>
            <li>What kind of perfume is it, after u spray nobody can even smell it.</li>
            <li>Anyhoo, since I started wearing it again I&#x27;ve had three people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing because they liked it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came in the original packaging and smells great.</li>
            <li>Smells soooo good and clean....</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying it in a store, or finding a sample of something to know how it smells on you before purchasing to make sure that it is a good fit.</li>
            <li>Both have a spicy aroma to them, but Signature has more of a woodsy smell whereas L&#x27;Homme doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite cologne&#x27;s for my husband.</li>
            <li>I have looked for it in stores and have not been able to find it.</li>
            <li>My advise is to buy from authentic dealers</li>
            <li>It is not, however, a cologne that I like thus the 4 star review :)</li>
            <li>Love this cologne</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS COLOGNE.</li>
            <li>This was an impulse buy many years ago while in college</li>
            <li>I may buy 2 or 3 more bottles just to keep in reserve.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents for my husband.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores, so it has been years since he&#x27;s worn it.</li>
            <li>glad i found it but told the boyfriend to go easy b/c</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s slowly becoming obsolete -</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of Kenneth Cole and this is great, the bottle is much bigger than the one I purchased at Burlington Coat Factory.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to John Varvatos which I feel is simmilar, but way too strong.</li>
            <li>I bought this 100 ml size to replace the same one that I loved, but in the 50 ml size &amp;  at really good price, almost the same price for twice the volume, sweet deal!!!</li>
            <li>This in turn gives it more of a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>it was the first one to come in Its my favorite purchase of Kenneth Cole</li>
            <li>and it has the special blend of Violet and Expresso coffee which is so unique</li>
            <li>This product is great smells really good and last a long time..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of colognes, and this one is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>PERFECT, ILL GET MORE</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It smell very very very very very very very very very very very very very well!</li>
            <li>It was very reasonably priced and he was excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap knock off of the real Signature.</li>
            <li>By God, if manly success had a smell, this would be it.  </li>
            <li>My brother had previously gotten this as a gift from someone, and loved it.</li>
            <li>When I first started dating my Husband he wore this.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>It has a great woodsy, slight tobacco, hint of vanilla, masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is no girly, sweet, flowery scent, as many other \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; colognes on the market are.  </li>
            <li>He said the first time he put it on, he got compliments pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I find this to be a bit on the strong side and certainly a cologne I only use during the fall/winter.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cologne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfy.  </li>
            <li>I think this scent goes very well with some peoples body chemistry and not others.</li>
            <li>It is extremely masculine with hints of wood and leather, yet there is a sweetness to it&#x27;s profile that makes it appropriate for all occasions but particularly romantic affairs.  </li>
            <li>No, this one is sophisticated, woodsy, leathery, urban, and definitely masculine.  </li>
            <li>stop, local mall to try to find a new scent to replace this old favorite.</li>
            <li>, it is a nice change of pace from my usual scent (Eau Sauvage).  </li>
            <li>(Previously, it was RSVP; this one is better than RSVP.)  </li>
            <li>The original Signature I would buy in the stores lasted all day long.  </li>
            <li>clean and fresh, but does not last long on my body.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>Not all sniffers smell things the exact same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW Kenneth Cole...</li>
            <li>It is his favorite cologne and he has a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li>Its scent brings to mind the classy office of a high-powered business executive or lawyer in his high-rise building, complete with immaculate leather furniture, seductive lighting, a bottle of cognac, and a view toward conquest and celebration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion, no other Cologne smells as grood as this!!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this might be a fake knock off.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Pretty sure this might be a fake knock off.  </li>
            <li> Bought this a few years ago, now difficult to find.. except of course on Amazon which has pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li> After about 20+ minutes in the men&#x27;s fragrance section wafting little spray sticks of about 2 dozen colognes (some multiple times), I finally settled on Yves Saint Laurent-L&#x27;Homme.</li>
            <li> This is a fake, no relation to the original.</li>
            <li> I scoured the internet looking for other vendors and wondering how this could be so?...</li>
            <li> May respond differently on other guys.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like plunking down $160 for a bottle if I could find something at least somewhat similar for half that.</li>
            <li> Feel like 35 bucks have been wasted.</li>
            <li> Kenneth Cole hasn&#x27;t sold this fragrance for years on their website, so I&#x27;m not sure where this stuff is coming from.</li>
            <li> Color is very pale</li>
            <li> This seller is REALLY slow.</li>
            <li> Since then, it has been very hard to find anywhere for him to buy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this scent online because I know there are knock offs everywhere</li>
            <li> WTF?!?</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>

            <li> PERFECT, ILL GET MORE</li>
            <li> This item was a birthday gift for my best friend, who ran out of Signature, which I had given him originally!  He enjoys the fragance!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of Kenneth Cole and this is great, the bottle is much bigger than the one I purchased at Burlington Coat Factory.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute;, he always bought it at stores but it&#x27;s way more expensive. Bought it here &amp; it&#x27;s just as great as the ones sold in stores! Great smell, packaging is great quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review WAAAY after purchasing this but I wanted to give a suggestion on another option. My bottle has finally come to an end and I typed in a search for this cologne. To my shock I come to find the price has more than doubled! I scoured the internet looking for other vendors and wondering how this could be so?...Ahhhh, I see. Out of production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next stop, local mall to try to find a new scent to replace this old favorite. I didn&#x27;t feel like plunking down $160 for a bottle if I could find something at least somewhat similar for half that. After about 20+ minutes in the men&#x27;s fragrance section wafting little spray sticks of about 2 dozen colognes (some multiple times), I finally settled on Yves Saint Laurent-L&#x27;Homme. Both have a spicy aroma to them, but Signature has more of a woodsy smell whereas L&#x27;Homme doesn&#x27;t. This in turn gives it more of a fresh scent. Still not the same but rather similar, and pleasing to the olfactory senses (and pocketbook).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there&#x27;s my recommendation if you are looking to find a similar replacement to Signature. Or go do some research in the men&#x27;s fragrance dept. for what you like. Not all sniffers smell things the exact same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW Kenneth Cole...WTF?!? Why the hell did you discontinue Signature you bleepity-bleeps!</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne, it is a nice change of pace from my usual scent (Eau Sauvage).  I find this to be a bit on the strong side and certainly a cologne I only use during the fall/winter.  It is extremely masculine with hints of wood and leather, yet there is a sweetness to it&#x27;s profile that makes it appropriate for all occasions but particularly romantic affairs.  I prefer this to John Varvatos which I feel is simmilar, but way too strong.</li>
            <li> it was the first one to come in Its my favorite purchase of Kenneth Cole</li>
            <li> Great product and seller</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cologne&#x27;s for my husband. I have looked for it in stores and have not been able to find it. I was so happy when I found it on Amazon. The price was great and it was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfy.  It smell very very very very very very very very very very very very very well!</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is really good. But the problem if even if spray it around 10-15 times, nobody can smell  it. What kind of perfume is it, after u spray nobody can even smell it. Really bad. Feel like 35 bucks have been wasted.</li>
            <li> very good product. excellent quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of colognes, and this one is my absolute favorite.  (Previously, it was RSVP; this one is better than RSVP.)  You could say it&#x27;s the King of Colognes.  This is no girly, sweet, flowery scent, as many other \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; colognes on the market are.  No, this one is sophisticated, woodsy, leathery, urban, and definitely masculine.  By God, if manly success had a smell, this would be it.  Its scent brings to mind the classy office of a high-powered business executive or lawyer in his high-rise building, complete with immaculate leather furniture, seductive lighting, a bottle of cognac, and a view toward conquest and celebration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is no longer in production, however.  Kenneth Cole, bring it back!  This stuff is too good to leave out of your product line.</li>
            <li> lasted about 2 hours....</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in stores but if anything 9 out of 10 amazon has them.. This product is great smells really good and last a long time..</li>
            <li> I odered this for my husband... It&#x27;s both our favorite!! Love LOVE signature!! Smells soooo good and clean.... Don&#x27;t understand why Kenneth Cole stopped making this but I&#x27;m thankful for Amazon!! In my opinion, no other Cologne smells as grood as this!!</li>
            <li> This is a fake, no relation to the original. Color is very pale ans scent even paler.  This is a cheap knock off of the real Signature. I was trying to find this product as it was out of stock for a while. My advise is to buy from authentic dealers</li>
            <li> It is the best cologne for men I have ever tried. and it has the special blend of Violet and Expresso coffee which is so unique</li>
            <li> Great price and great delivery!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Uncle for his birthday. It is his favorite cologne and he has a hard time finding it. It was very reasonably priced and he was excited to receive it. It is not, however, a cologne that I like thus the 4 star review :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this scent online because I know there are knock offs everywhere but this is not one of them. Came in the original packaging and smells great. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> My brother had previously gotten this as a gift from someone, and loved it. Since then, it has been very hard to find anywhere for him to buy. I bought this and sent it to him as a gift, and he loved it. He said the first time he put it on, he got compliments pretty much all day. I think this scent goes very well with some peoples body chemistry and not others. I would recommend trying it in a store, or finding a sample of something to know how it smells on you before purchasing to make sure that it is a good fit.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell ladies love it, will stop you in a bar and ask what you are wearing. Suck that the stoped making this. This seller is REALLY slow.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne but it&#x27;s slowly becoming obsolete - which is why I had to buy it via Amazon.  glad i found it but told the boyfriend to go easy b/c it may be the last bottle he gets!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOGNE. This was an impulse buy many years ago while in college but I haven&#x27;t looked back since. I may buy 2 or 3 more bottles just to keep in reserve.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents for my husband. It has a great woodsy, slight tobacco, hint of vanilla, masculine fragrance. Kenneth Cole needs to bring it back!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  The original Signature I would buy in the stores lasted all day long.  Pretty sure this might be a fake knock off.  Kenneth Cole hasn&#x27;t sold this fragrance for years on their website, so I&#x27;m not sure where this stuff is coming from.</li>
            <li> When I first started dating my Husband he wore this. We haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores, so it has been years since he&#x27;s worn it. I&#x27;m so glad I orderred it! Love the smell!!!!</li>
            <li> Great smell great product</li>
            <li> Great cologne for men, strong &amp; manly scent. I bought this 100 ml size to replace the same one that I loved, but in the 50 ml size &amp;  at really good price, almost the same price for twice the volume, sweet deal!!!</li>
            <li> clean and fresh, but does not last long on my body. May respond differently on other guys. This is my second time purchasing this cologne</li>
            <li> Bought this a few years ago, now difficult to find.. except of course on Amazon which has pretty much everything.  Anyhoo, since I started wearing it again I&#x27;ve had three people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing because they liked it so much.&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I guess it works.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> this is the best thing i have ever had,better than chanel,paco raban and the others,and this is very rare fragnance</li>
            <li> Truly great smelling. ..!!!</li>
