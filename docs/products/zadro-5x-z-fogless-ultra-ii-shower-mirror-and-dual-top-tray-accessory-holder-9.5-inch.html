            <li>these things aren&#x27;t perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality</li>
            <li>but the one I liked the best they stopped selling.</li>
            <li>This is a great saving mirror.  </li>
            <li>Great for shower shaving.</li>
            <li>Great mirror for shower.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go again.</li>
            <li>) - just put them in a cup of bleach over night and they&#x27;ll be good as new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the magnification!  </li>
            <li>I love how close the reflection is!</li>
            <li>The suction cups work great, strong and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Installation was very easy and there is a ledge that holds my shave cream/oil and brush.  </li>
            <li>Easy to see shaving misses!</li>
            <li>LOVE this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I Love It.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much better mirror I could have.  </li>
            <li>I love the product but quality control could be improved.</li>
            <li>Most shower shaving products do not work.  </li>
            <li>Price is ok and free shipping.</li>
            <li>As for the mirror itself, it&#x27;s bright, big, adjustable for close-up shaving and near perfect.</li>
            <li>Other than that what do you expect it to shave your face for you lmao!!!!!!</li>
            <li>All have worked fine in the shower for shaving.</li>
            <li>This mirror is very large and magnifies my reflection which helps make shaving more easy.  </li>
            <li>It magnifys the face at the right level to have a very comfortable shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>when you think fog free, you think it won&#x27;t fog at all.</li>
            <li>Not under warranty and too cheap to want to replace anyway.</li>
            <li>Not to sound like I&#x27;m a detail driven person, as one who shaves his head, a mirror in the shower is fairly important.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups are fantastic - never seen anything stick like that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a nice mirror!</li>
            <li>I was able to find a far better shower mirror with razor hook in Menard&#x27;s for about $5.</li>
            <li>It maginifies because my vision isn&#x27;t what it used to be and this one comes with a special towel to clean it.</li>
            <li>Just replaced one I had for like 5 years they start to not be as clear but for $30 every 5 years these are nice in the shower</li>
            <li>Not a bad product to start with, I guess.  </li>
            <li>But it fixes itself quickly by falling off.</li>
            <li>The mirror is also larger than most fogless mirrors which makes shaving much more convenient.</li>
            <li>The new ones include a shelf on top that will hold razors (2-4) and the can of shaving cream, but it&#x27;s not trustworthy for two reasons.</li>
            <li>My last mirror was good, but the stainless steel frame turned out not to be too stainless and rusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not fog up in a hot shower.</li>
            <li>It worked a couple months pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This item does exactly what I need it to do.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was always able to just put it back.  </li>
            <li>Spray the thing with hot water if steams up.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower!</li>
            <li>First it has no &#x27;rail&#x27; around the shelf</li>
            <li>You definitely get a better, closer shave in the shower, this mirror allows you to do that.  </li>
            <li>I dropped the first one and broke.</li>
            <li>look, if you shave in the shower you&#x27;re most likely using disposable blades of some type</li>
            <li>: Mirror fell out of the frame in the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, I guess the old adage: You get what you pay for applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s what I was looking for, the price was good, and it seems to be something that will last for a bit.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy enough to wipe the fog off-</li>
            <li>to attach to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Suction cups are strong enough to hold mirror + shaving gear.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>and that was fine (CLR for daily showers or 409).</li>
            <li>Much easier.</li>
            <li>My preference, seems so much easier than using the sink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the magnification feature, but I really didn&#x27;t notice too much of a change when I rotated the mirror.  </li>
            <li>But...it&#x27;s NOT totally fog free.</li>
            <li>very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The mirror is a cheap plastic like material and the image is not clear.</li>
            <li>Mostly fog free, or at least it stays fog free for longer than other mirrors I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 of them last me a grand total of about 4 years.  </li>
            <li>The shelf with little cutouts for toothbrushes and razors sits on top of the mirror, and the mirror comes with three suction cups to mount it, or you can use the adhesive tape that&#x27;s supplied with it to stick it to your shower wall.  </li>
            <li>Not hard to do.</li>
            <li>I suspect they may have cheaped out on construction, but we&#x27;ll see when the new one arrives.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I refuse to glue together a brand new item out of the box.</li>
            <li>Very clear and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>This replaced a very old and worn out unit we got from the Container Store.</li>
            <li>I had another of the exact same mirror for over 3 years.</li>
            <li>the fog free marketing is just not true</li>
            <li>mirror is a large mirror made of plastic with the only metal part I noticed was the screw holding it to the mount.  </li>
            <li>Have to spray with water every once in awhile to stay clear.</li>
            <li>These old eyes appreciate this product.</li>
            <li>Also, the first 2 I bought had been in the warehouse so long the glue holding the mirror to its frame</li>
            <li>When I finally called the co. about this problem, they offered and sent me one straight from their shop in LA.</li>
            <li>Do not use anything remotely abrasive to clean (water only).</li>
            <li>Adheres to any flat surface very well i.e. tiles.</li>
            <li>well worth it for the pleasure of shaving in a steamy shower and not having your wife nag you about cleaning all the little hair shavings out of the sink.</li>
            <li>So I got another that got hard to see and clean within a year.</li>
            <li>But, one with magnification is a whole other thing.  </li>
            <li>I did have to get double sided adhesive to keep it up there, but it is big, if you splash water on it you can see yourself clearly</li>

            <li> I did have to get double sided adhesive to keep it up there, but it is big, if you splash water on it you can see yourself clearly</li>
            <li> The zoom is more like a funhouse mirror to me, as it does not accurately reflect your features, and I&#x27;ve given up trying - I just stand close to it, although my face looks giant and a little scary first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li> Mirror image not clear.. Distorted view and fogs up constantly.</li>
            <li> It lasted 13 long years, all in all</li>
            <li> had quit holding and was loose, making the item unusable.</li>
            <li> this mirror, while a nice size, does still fog up, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I have had other mirrors by this company.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my fiance and he loves the fact it is magnifying since his eyesight isn&#x27;t as sharp as it was during his thirties.  </li>
            <li> I like the small flat table to place the tooth brush and razor.  </li>
            <li> I should note though, after looking at the image here, it looks like I&#x27;ve been mounting it upside down for years and because of the suction cup design, that could make it easier to fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve gotten my shower mirror cost down to $1 a month.  </li>
            <li> Broke in less than 2 days.</li>
            <li> so things can just rol off onto the shower floor where they typically break.</li>
            <li> Major disappointment, my mirror is on the way back.</li>
            <li> Only reason why not 5 stars is the shelf is weak.</li>
            <li> I remember to just give the mirror a little push every day when I shower</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve just give it a little spray with shower cleaner once a month</li>
            <li> This one for a little over two months and the mirror fell out.</li>
            <li> Nothing a little Goop couldn&#x27;t fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stick on firmly and ended up shattering all over.</li>
            <li> few tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it does stick (for a few seconds)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The mirror is not located in a spot where I&#x27;d put the shave cream can on it, but it&#x27;s too narrow from the looks of it.  </li>
            <li> one week, one month, who knows?--and everything you have trusted to the shelf will fall off onto the floor, usually breaking each item in the process.</li>
            <li> Bad quality, design and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> how that would happen given the design of mine - its literally just once piece of plastic that used to fall off an smash into the ground at least 200 times.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad the mirror unit itself won&#x27;t stay stuck to the center core of the frame/support.</li>
            <li> So, I paid $30 for a piece of plastic that I cannot return and is now useless!</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror in February and within three months the mirror fell out of the base.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terribly distorted.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Only reason why not 5 stars is the shelf is weak. Other than that what do you expect it to shave your face for you lmao!!!!!! And it can travel with you.</li>
            <li> Broke in less than 2 days. Bad quality, design and a total waste of money. Didn&#x27;t stick on firmly and ended up shattering all over.</li>
            <li> Very clear and sturdy.  I like the small flat table to place the tooth brush and razor.  Very good quality</li>
            <li> So far so good. Does not fog up in a hot shower. Do not use anything remotely abrasive to clean (water only). My experience with this product is that it lasts a year or so before surface becomes too cloudy to see yourself properly.</li>
            <li> The mirror part of our mirror was bend causing a distorted reflection therefore it couldn&#x27;t be used.  However it didn&#x27;t fog up so that part works.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product to start with, I guess.  It worked a couple months pretty well.  But the 3 suction cups don&#x27;t hold, the thing came unstuck, crashed, and the mirror came out of its housing.  Now it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> This item does exactly what I need it to do.  However, it does fog up but a wipe and you&#x27;re good to go again.</li>
            <li> Love the magnification!  Now I can shave even if I&#x27;m not wearing my contacts.  Mostly fog free, or at least it stays fog free for longer than other mirrors I have used.</li>
            <li> I was given one of these as a gift in 2000.  It lasted 13 long years, all in all, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fell off the window once every couple of months, but never broke until last week.  I was always able to just put it back.  I should note though, after looking at the image here, it looks like I&#x27;ve been mounting it upside down for years and because of the suction cup design, that could make it easier to fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen several reviews that state that the mirror fell out.  I have no idea how that would happen given the design of mine - its literally just once piece of plastic that used to fall off an smash into the ground at least 200 times.  I suspect they may have cheaped out on construction, but we&#x27;ll see when the new one arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a few tips:&lt;br /&gt;if the suction cups get moldy (mine did once, don&#x27;t know why) - just put them in a cup of bleach over night and they&#x27;ll be good as new.&lt;br /&gt;If I remember to just give the mirror a little push every day when I shower, it won&#x27;t fall - I often forgot.&lt;br /&gt;my fog-less coating wore off years ago, I&#x27;ve just give it a little spray with shower cleaner once a month and that was fine (CLR for daily showers or 409).</li>
            <li> I get shower mirrors for shaving from Bed Bath and Beyond but the one I liked the best they stopped selling. So I got another that got hard to see and clean within a year. I decided to look on nextag.com for shower mirror and led me to this one. I decided to try it. Price is ok and free shipping. It maginifies because my vision isn&#x27;t what it used to be and this one comes with a special towel to clean it. It holds to the shower tiles with suction cups and has adhesive pad if you need it and has a shelf for razors and holders for razors if you use the disposable razors I do.</li>
            <li> I have had other mirrors by this company. All have worked fine in the shower for shaving. Spray the thing with hot water if steams up. But, one with magnification is a whole other thing.  These old eyes appreciate this product. Thank you Zadro.</li>
            <li> Mirror was not connected upon unpacking. Never could get it to stay on so returned it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mirror.  It really doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower! Like how it is adjustable.  It is bigger than our last mirror and this makes shaving easier for my husband.</li>
            <li> I Love It.  This mirror works as promised.  I&#x27;ve had a shower mirror for 10 years and just replaced it with this mirror.  I didn&#x27;t know how much better mirror I could have.  Now I do!</li>
            <li> Have had this for a couple of weeks now:&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Easy to attach to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Suction cups are strong enough to hold mirror + shaving gear.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change magnification&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;More like &#x27;fog resistant&#x27; than &#x27;fogless&#x27;</li>
            <li> I had another of the exact same mirror for over 3 years. This one for a little over two months and the mirror fell out. I cannot glue it back on! So, I paid $30 for a piece of plastic that I cannot return and is now useless!</li>
            <li> This is a great saving mirror.  It magnifys the face at the right level to have a very comfortable shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Major disappointment, my mirror is on the way back. It&#x27;s so bad the mirror unit itself won&#x27;t stay stuck to the center core of the frame/support. When it does stick (for a few seconds) it&#x27;s terribly distorted. But it fixes itself quickly by falling off. And it hasn&#x27;t even gotten into the humid environment yet.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very large and magnifies my reflection which helps make shaving more easy.  Installation was very easy and there is a ledge that holds my shave cream/oil and brush.  I wish there was a lip on the ledge where I rest my shave cream, but not a big deal at all.</li>
            <li> This mirror claims to have a zoom control that enables you to see as close up as necessary. The zoom is more like a funhouse mirror to me, as it does not accurately reflect your features, and I&#x27;ve given up trying - I just stand close to it, although my face looks giant and a little scary first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li> when you think fog free, you think it won&#x27;t fog at all. this mirror, while a nice size, does still fog up, which is annoying. it&#x27;s easy enough to wipe the fog off-the fog free marketing is just not true</li>
            <li> This replaced a very old and worn out unit we got from the Container Store. I love how close the reflection is! Easy to see shaving misses!</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror in February and within three months the mirror fell out of the base. Continues to fall out regardless of what I do. Not under warranty and too cheap to want to replace anyway. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Mirror image not clear.. Distorted view and fogs up constantly.</li>
            <li> Used one for years but one day it fell and broke apart. The new ones include a shelf on top that will hold razors (2-4) and the can of shaving cream, but it&#x27;s not trustworthy for two reasons. First it has no &#x27;rail&#x27; around the shelf so things can just rol off onto the shower floor where they typically break. Second, the suction cups holding the unit to the glass or tile in the shower will unstick at some point--one week, one month, who knows?--and everything you have trusted to the shelf will fall off onto the floor, usually breaking each item in the process. Also, the first 2 I bought had been in the warehouse so long the glue holding the mirror to its frame had quit holding and was loose, making the item unusable. When I finally called the co. about this problem, they offered and sent me one straight from their shop in LA. It took 2-3 weeks but I finally got it and it was glued properly. As for the mirror itself, it&#x27;s bright, big, adjustable for close-up shaving and near perfect.</li>
            <li> Great for shower shaving. Much easier. My preference, seems so much easier than using the sink. This item makes it simple.</li>
            <li> Not to sound like I&#x27;m a detail driven person, as one who shaves his head, a mirror in the shower is fairly important.  My last mirror was good, but the stainless steel frame turned out not to be too stainless and rusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is a large mirror made of plastic with the only metal part I noticed was the screw holding it to the mount.  The shelf with little cutouts for toothbrushes and razors sits on top of the mirror, and the mirror comes with three suction cups to mount it, or you can use the adhesive tape that&#x27;s supplied with it to stick it to your shower wall.  I put this mirror under the shower head about eye level and it does not fog up.  I like the shelf as it holds all of my shaving and toothpaste stuff.  The mirror is not located in a spot where I&#x27;d put the shave cream can on it, but it&#x27;s too narrow from the looks of it.  I don&#x27;t use the magnification feature, but I really didn&#x27;t notice too much of a change when I rotated the mirror.  Overall, it&#x27;s what I was looking for, the price was good, and it seems to be something that will last for a bit.</li>
            <li> You definitely get a better, closer shave in the shower, this mirror allows you to do that.  But...it&#x27;s NOT totally fog free.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a nice mirror! The suction cups are fantastic - never seen anything stick like that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed it fog quite often though and I have to splash water on it, but I still like it better than the expensive Sharper Image bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for shower. This is my second one I bought. I dropped the first one and broke. Adheres to any flat surface very well i.e. tiles. Turn mirror to adjust magnification. Fogless is just so so. Have to spray with water every once in awhile to stay clear.</li>
            <li> I love the product but quality control could be improved. When I received it the mirror had come off and was stuck to the edge so I had to peel it off and purchase double sided tape to repair it. Not hard to do. Just a hassle I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> Just replaced one I had for like 5 years they start to not be as clear but for $30 every 5 years these are nice in the shower</li>
            <li> look, it&#x27;s an inexpensive shower mirror.  these things aren&#x27;t perfect.  they will fog up, just put some soap on it and rinse it off or get a mouthfull of water and spit on it.  don&#x27;t expect the suction cups to last a lifetime.  you&#x27;re paying $25+/- for this thing, it&#x27;s not meant to last a lifetime.  look, if you shave in the shower you&#x27;re most likely using disposable blades of some type and you&#x27;re probably spending $8-20 a month on blades.  consider this $2 a month as part of your shower/shaving expense.  I&#x27;ve had 2 of them last me a grand total of about 4 years.  so i&#x27;ve gotten my shower mirror cost down to $1 a month.  well worth it for the pleasure of shaving in a steamy shower and not having your wife nag you about cleaning all the little hair shavings out of the sink.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose, well made. very sturdy. A must have for a guy that shaves in the shower. You can actually see yourself.</li>
            <li> I opened the box and the &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; fell out of its frame. The mirror is a cheap plastic like material and the image is not clear. Tried to put the mirror back in its place and it wrapped. I refuse to glue together a brand new item out of the box. I sent it back. I was able to find a far better shower mirror with razor hook in Menard&#x27;s for about $5.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my fiance and he loves the fact it is magnifying since his eyesight isn&#x27;t as sharp as it was during his thirties.  The mirror is also larger than most fogless mirrors which makes shaving much more convenient.</li>
            <li> This product works for us.</li>
            <li> This item works as well as it should.  I did have to get double sided adhesive to keep it up there, but it is big, if you splash water on it you can see yourself clearly (may take a couple slashes per shower no biggie) and you can definitely turn it to magnify your face.  Most shower shaving products do not work.  This does.</li>
            <li> Pros: The suction cups work great, strong and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Mirror fell out of the frame in the first two weeks. Nothing a little Goop couldn&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;  Cheaply made, I guess the old adage: You get what you pay for applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again...NO</li>
