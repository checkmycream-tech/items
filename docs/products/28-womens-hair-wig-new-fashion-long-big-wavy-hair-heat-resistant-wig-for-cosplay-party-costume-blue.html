            <li>I feel like I have ecomplished the best order of my life by buying this.</li>
            <li>The bangs were the perfect length already (I didn&#x27;t have to do any trimming, which you sometimes have to do with wigs with bangs).</li>
            <li>but it was the perfect color</li>
            <li>Excellent value!</li>

            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>For such a cheap price, this is a beautiful wig!</li>
            <li>It tangles really easy but aside from that it&#x27;s amazing!&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>It is a BEAUTIFUL blue colour-</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted, and the curls are nice too.</li>
            <li>It came out fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Super cute.</li>
            <li>She wrapped her hair up in the hair net that comes with this and the wig fits great.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s comfortable too.</li>
            <li>Smooth, not overly shiny, doesnt tangle.</li>
            <li>like genuine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth more than you pay.</li>
            <li>Beautiful just what I expected!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how easy it will tangle yet, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>People commented on how much they liked my hair (some people even thought it was my real hair).</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly as well.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li>I always worry that they will end up looking too shiny and cheap in real life.</li>
            <li>Great piece of hair this wig is soft to touch and flow like human hair</li>
            <li>Conventions are very long all day events, so comforts important, and this wig was very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I received this wig super fast</li>
            <li>Luckily it came super early</li>
            <li>It is so soft and vibrant:)</li>
            <li>I already own the purple and pink wig from this company.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly like I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li>However, first thing out of the package, one of the adjustment straps just fell off.</li>
            <li>The wig was packaged well, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it is styled and how it fit-</li>
            <li>but I think I like the darker blue better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on getting a few more colors in this style and length because they are fabulous.</li>
            <li>(I ordered the blue, and it was the same shade as the picture) and it&#x27;s a good length.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the photo, same shape, not too shiny and such a beautiful shade of blue!</li>
            <li>The inside has adjustable clips so you can make sure it stays as snug or as loose on your head as you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>First impressions: High quality for the price</li>
            <li>Silky look and feel, much like real hair.</li>
            <li>and it stayed on the whole day.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really matter for what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s no real. :)</li>
            <li>I ordered the blue and hot pink wig for a party and they were fabulous!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t shed like at all, the color in the picture is spot on, though what I got was a little more curly than I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Have fun with blue hair!!!!</li>
            <li>Super soft and long and comes with wig cap!</li>
            <li>Photo is true to the actual blue color of the wig.</li>
            <li>i am a big fan of wild colors when it come to my hair and this blue states BOLD.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautifully colored wig, but it&#x27;s SO thin and shorter than I expected!</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned...</li>
            <li>It was also carefully packaged upon arrival, first inside the shipping package, then a plastic bag with cardboard in it</li>
            <li>Normally hats and wigs are too big for my head.</li>
            <li>Cool wig for Halloween not for everyday tho...</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this was too small for my small head.</li>
            <li>, shipping was right on time (few hours early).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a vibrant blue and is very long.</li>
            <li>Came out of the package and was ready to wear.. brushed it out a little</li>

            <li> False color advertising, color is too light compare to pic  </li>
            <li> I was worried it would look super costumey and the hair would be thin or something.</li>
            <li> She put it up in a loose, low ponytail and wore it with a hat.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a medium/small head and long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; so I didn&#x27;t expect it to look as long on me.</li>
            <li> Bangs aren&#x27;t as long as they are in the picture.</li>
            <li> I feel like i wasted money, its for dress up, not for everyday use, its very shiney and synthetic looking.</li>
            <li> With some manipulation and only wearing the hair a certain way, I can hide it, but I am skeptical of it lasting a day or night without showing.</li>
            <li> I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look at the estimated delivery date, so I almost died when it wasn&#x27;t expected before Halloween.</li>
            <li> It does not fit properly or stay on my head.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be lighter</li>
            <li> so before I had expected it!</li>
            <li> at least not in my opinion, the scalp is very white in places</li>
            <li> preferably somewhere dark.</li>
            <li> Wig cap fits snug but not tight with my medium length, thin hair in a bun at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I forgot I was wearing it half the time</li>
            <li> but I combed it through and emptied half a can of hairspray on it</li>
            <li> and it s very cute,not bad for price.i</li>
            <li> The hair is very thin at the back of the wig and the cap is visible.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look thin and doesn&#x27;t shed like</li>
            <li> Mine looks completely fake and puffy/frizzy.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed!</li>

            <li> My daughter has a medium/small head and long hair. She wrapped her hair up in the hair net that comes with this and the wig fits great. She says it&#x27;s comfortable too. She wore it all day and it looks awesome. Because it&#x27;s inexpensive I was worried it would look super costumey and the hair would be thin or something. Not so! It&#x27;s fine! She loves it. She put it up in a loose, low ponytail and wore it with a hat. Super cute.</li>
            <li> First impressions: High quality for the price, shipping was right on time (few hours early). Photo is true to the actual blue color of the wig. I&#x27;m planning on getting a few more colors in this style and length because they are fabulous. Wig cap fits snug but not tight with my medium length, thin hair in a bun at the bottom. Silky look and feel, much like real hair. You can tell it&#x27;s a wig, but it&#x27;s a great looking wig. Don&#x27;t know how easy it will tangle yet, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly as pictured! I already own the purple and pink wig from this company. Smooth, not overly shiny, doesnt tangle.</li>
            <li> this. is. beautimos. like genuine. I feel like I have ecomplished the best order of my life by buying this. i will NO DOUBT be buying more from this seller. if you want a good wig, HERE YA GO.</li>
            <li> Great piece of hair this wig is soft to touch and flow like human hair it&#x27;s worth more than you pay.</li>
            <li> I received this wig super fast and it s very cute,not bad for price.i do wish it was fuller.</li>
            <li> I got this wig to cosplay at a convention, and it was better than I imagined. Conventions are very long all day events, so comforts important, and this wig was very comfortable. I forgot I was wearing it half the time and it stayed on the whole day. It also looked great. People commented on how much they liked my hair (some people even thought it was my real hair). The color is exactly like I thought it was going to be (I ordered the blue, and it was the same shade as the picture) and it&#x27;s a good length. The bangs were the perfect length already (I didn&#x27;t have to do any trimming, which you sometimes have to do with wigs with bangs). It&#x27;s definitely a great price for the quality and I&#x27;ll be wearing mine again for sure. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap price, this is a beautiful wig! It&#x27;s a vibrant blue and is very long. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; so I didn&#x27;t expect it to look as long on me. It doesn&#x27;t look thin and doesn&#x27;t shed like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Cool wig for Halloween not for everyday tho...at least not in my opinion, the scalp is very white in places so I had to take a sharpie to it. It came out fine for me.  Didn&#x27;t look at the estimated delivery date, so I almost died when it wasn&#x27;t expected before Halloween. Luckily it came super early and I was able to wear it with my costume . I</li>
            <li> Beautiful just what I expected! Super soft and long and comes with wig cap!</li>
            <li> When buying wigs online I always worry that they will end up looking too shiny and cheap in real life. Thankfully, this was not the case! It looks exactly like the photo, same shape, not too shiny and such a beautiful shade of blue! The inside has adjustable clips so you can make sure it stays as snug or as loose on your head as you&#x27;d like. It was also carefully packaged upon arrival, first inside the shipping package, then a plastic bag with cardboard in it so it didn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s shape then a net was around the actual wig. The one thing I would recommend with this is to buy a foam head to put it on so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled and will stay great shape.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blue and hot pink wig for a party and they were fabulous! Absolutely loved them.. looks just like the picture! Very full and was SO bright! Came out of the package and was ready to wear.. brushed it out a little but they did not have creases in them at all like I thought it would! Had so many compliments on them! Def would order another from here! I did not have the amazon prime so it arrived in 16 days. Shipping est was 17-28 days.. so before I had expected it!</li>
            <li> False color advertising, color is too light compare to pic  , looks better in picture, will not be buying</li>
            <li> I would give this wig a 2 if I hadn&#x27;t paid $10 for it. It is a BEAUTIFUL blue colour- exactly what I wanted, and the curls are nice too. However, first thing out of the package, one of the adjustment straps just fell off. I sewed it back on.The hair is very thin at the back of the wig and the cap is visible. With some manipulation and only wearing the hair a certain way, I can hide it, but I am skeptical of it lasting a day or night without showing. It&#x27;s definitely just a dress-up wig... preferably somewhere dark. Buy something more expensive if you&#x27;re looking for day-to-day wear.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE it!! It is so soft and vibrant:)</li>
            <li> Beautiful. You gotta brush it a lot but it was the perfect color and I love it</li>
            <li> Love it  it&#x27;s beautiful i am a big fan of wild colors when it come to my hair and this blue states BOLD. I love everything about this wig</li>
            <li> Have fun with blue hair!!!! Love it.</li>
            <li> So I got this wig to cosplay Tumblr from the interwebsseries. I recently got a lot of money and I decided I should get some wigs because I didn&#x27;t have any. I got about 6 wigs in all but, this is by far the best wig I got. It didn&#x27;t shed like at all, the color in the picture is spot on, though what I got was a little more curly than I thought it would be it doesn&#x27;t really matter for what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
            <li> Normally hats and wigs are too big for my head. Surprisingly, this was too small for my small head. It does not fit properly or stay on my head.</li>
            <li> The wig was packaged well, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it is styled and how it fit- will probably buy another in a different color</li>
            <li> I feel like i wasted money, its for dress up, not for everyday use, its very shiney and synthetic looking. I never wear it out, good thing halloween is coming, i can make some use of this.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and I love it. It sheds a bit but I combed it through and emptied half a can of hairspray on it and it seems to have stopped. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it out. As far as I&#x27;m concerned... You can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s no real. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent value! Very happy with how it looks and fits. My daughter is very excited to wear it for BronyCon!</li>
            <li> Wig looks nothing like it does in the picture or the pictures that customers posted. In those pictures it looks more natural/like hair. Mine looks completely fake and puffy/frizzy. It looks like one of the wigs you&#x27;d buy at walmart during Halloween.. Bangs aren&#x27;t as long as they are in the picture. They were very, very short.  Very Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really love the wig! I expected it to be lighter but I think I like the darker blue better. It tangles really easy but aside from that it&#x27;s amazing!&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Really beautiful wig for the price! Me and my sister both wore them for Comicon and they were a hit! Arrived quickly as well. Totally happy with it.</li>
            <li> Sent as Christmas gift. No feedback has been received.</li>
            <li> Love the wig.  Thank you :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautifully colored wig, but it&#x27;s SO thin and shorter than I expected!</li>
