            <li>It looks very nice on the face.</li>
            <li>It, at best, provides very light coverage.</li>
            <li>The vendor was great the items were delivered on time packaging was good.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would make my make up more flawless looking</li>
            <li>This one is good.  </li>
            <li>Darn good for the price.</li>
            <li>This serum primer is really good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about this Serum Primer</li>
            <li>Ordered this product because of the good reviews and just received it today.</li>
            <li>I saw good reviews on this</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m delighted that I tried it.</li>
            <li>I used to use DHC Velvet Skin and loved it, but ran out and was looking for something affordable at the moment.</li>
            <li>And it smells good--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a good primer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a good primer</li>
            <li>Feels so good on the skin....</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I needed a good foundation primer (one that goes over my lotion).  </li>
            <li>It seemed Covergirl and Olay will be good brand combination</li>
            <li>and I believe it&#x27;s a good product and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Feels great and has a very light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This primer works exceptionally well for me.    </li>
            <li>What I like best is that it is greaseless and &amp;#34;sinks in&amp;#34; quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth!</li>
            <li>For what you pay for it works but if you want a great look and hold it is better to send the money.</li>
            <li>I have used Olay products for many years and it is great</li>
            <li>Very nice, I really love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>I love this primer!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love It !</li>
            <li>If CG and Olay took these out, I would absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>The product is not oily or greasy, which was a pleasant surprise and a contrast to many lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for older skin!</li>
            <li>it works great leaving your face smooth and non greasy.</li>
            <li>If you are comfortable with using \\&quot;cones\\&quot; on your face this is a great cost saving alternative.</li>
            <li>This is a great light weight primer</li>
            <li>whatever moisturizer is handy</li>
            <li>Nice touch.</li>
            <li>I think this product is actually a nice substitute for foundation and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>It made my skin look and feel smoother, so that my foundation went on nicely and stayed that way all day.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy like many primers and doesn&#x27;t eat my makeup away (which occurs with some primers) and has a good texture and doesn&#x27;t cause creasing or bubbling.</li>
            <li>but it kind of made my make up look kind of flakey.</li>
            <li>gives a nice moist look</li>
            <li>Glides on flawlessly and makes application of my foundation super easy.</li>
            <li>I loved using this as a makeup primer and the packaging is sturdy and the pump works easily.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly  and keeps makeup looking great.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent which is nice since some people have sensitivity to smells.</li>
            <li>100 is very good value since most serums of this type command considerably higher prices.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s, have combination skin (oily on forehead, nose and chin), brown colour and fairly blemish free.</li>
            <li>This primer has a nice matte finish, which I love.</li>
            <li>It would probably work best on young persons.</li>
            <li>It is a preventative application rather than a repair, suitable for still youthful skin types.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best drugstore primers that I have tried.</li>
            <li>primer went on nice and smooth and dries to a kind of powdery feel.</li>
            <li>Too good to be true...</li>
            <li>It goes on silky and your skin feels very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very smooth application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and smoothing.  </li>
            <li>I tried a sample of this product and it felt very smooth.</li>
            <li>These are all very important things when choosing a primer.</li>
            <li>thing I did not see listed with this product that was very important to me, is it is oil free!</li>
            <li>:)      </li>
            <li>I could have pressed her for a more descriptive evaluation</li>
            <li>She says she will probably buy some more.  </li>
            <li>Foundation glides over it, and does not settle into the cracks and pores on my face - it just stays, evenly spread, on the top of the primer.  </li>
            <li>It gives my face more of a &#x27;matte&#x27; finish.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not the best judge of the merits of various potions that one might slap on the face.  </li>
            <li>I do love Olay products, and this joint Cover Girl product was another winner in my book.</li>
            <li>I was using Avon Magix and I would switch to this once because it smells cleaner and blends better with no greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am really glad I came across this product, and I thank those who wrote reviews about it which made me try it. :)</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over two years already, and I love it.</li>
            <li>This might be better for people who do not have issues with oily or break-out prone skin.</li>
            <li>I will definatley be buying more of this primer when it runs out.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>my skin is too tempermental for me to know for sure</li>
            <li>(I just picked up my second bottle on sale at Kroger for $11.99, which is the best deal I&#x27;ve seen without a coupon.)</li>
            <li>Plus its from two of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li>and I love it more with each use.</li>
            <li>The latest fad for cosmetics is these \\&quot;primers\\&quot; you put on your skin beneath your makeup.  </li>
            <li>What it seems to do is moisturize the skin, making it a bit more pliable for the makeup application.      </li>
            <li>this primer is more anti-aging then</li>
            <li>Love  this primer.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this primer.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel, and no yucky smell</li>
            <li>Some drug stores have it, most do not.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Each day I checked to make sure it was still not &#x60;shining&#x27; and my face still had a matte look to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 with oily olive skin, so maybe the product would work better on someone with drier, fairer skin.       </li>
            <li>, I think it worked better as that than as an age serum.   </li>
            <li>Mostly because of the heaviness I mentioned below.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff on my face since it smooths my skin on this aging Grandma</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t make my skin look any better.</li>
            <li>A favorite for my over-50 skin.</li>
            <li>Love this primer.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I have just used this product once and looks OK to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not shiny, oily, or greasy, and my powder mineral makeup goes on so much better.</li>
            <li>I brought miracle blur cream from l&#x27;oreal by recommendation and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is such  wonderful product to apply before you put on your foundation - makes your face look and feel so nice and smooth</li>
            <li>This is more like a lotion than a primer.</li>
            <li>Still use Perricone at night, but will be trying more of this line when it runs out.</li>
            <li>and maybe it would work better</li>
            <li>, I thought it would had better results.</li>
            <li>Works well, love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So it just sits on my counter mostly.  </li>
            <li>But I love primers.  </li>
            <li>Just gotta find one you love and stick with it.</li>
            <li>I soooo love this primer</li>
            <li>good, right?  </li>
            <li>Thbis is a good product, the price is right and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>got this in the mail and was so excited!</li>
            <li>Using it over a moisturizer felt a bit greasy to me, so the perfect combination was moisturizer with SPF, primer, then loose powder.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and makes my foundation look a bit more matte.</li>
            <li>This creamy solution glides on smoothly and immediately improves the appearance of my skin, making it look more luminous and even toned.  </li>
            <li>It made my face look more \\&quot;matte\\&quot; and went on smooth and velvety.</li>
            <li>This is a nice primer and economically priced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smooth out the skin, allowing makeup to be more easily applied.  </li>
            <li>Nice size bottle and the click pump lets just the right amount come out on your fingertip.</li>
            <li>What I experienced as I kept trying it was that it actually lessened the need for more foundation, powder etc.    </li>
            <li>Serum is easy to apply, and the quality is there.</li>
            <li>it was easy to buy.and</li>
            <li>It glides on easily, does not irritate her skin, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t have that strong odor like the rest of Covergirl/Olay face products.</li>
            <li>Although performance wise, the best I&#x27;ve tried in many ways, I most likely will not purchase this again due to the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was a bit torn at first on whether I liked this product.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and easily with no tugging, creasing, or stickiness.  </li>
            <li>Some women are fine with this and some women try to avoid the \\&quot;cones\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It reduces fine lines the day after you use it and it does in fact tighten your skin and even minimizes pore appearance.   </li>
            <li>This is a PRIMER, it is supposed to minimize fine lines/pores and help your makeup stay on longer.</li>
            <li>It worked out just fine.</li>
            <li>Instead, it just sat on top of my skin making it super moist and sticky.</li>
            <li>Works wonders under your foundation to smooth out the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth after I apply the serum.</li>
            <li>As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s light (and non-greasy).  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this products.</li>
            <li>so I always stick with light or mattifying primers/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30s with skin that still is prone to acne, so it&#x27;s important for me to use products that don&#x27;t contribute to the problem.</li>
            <li>But I do know that this felt light and didn&#x27;t feel at all greasy when I applied it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Instead of a smooth application, you get \\&quot;caking\\&quot; and areas where the make up looks blotchy.    </li>
            <li>The point here is that this moisturizer allowed my foundation to be applied just as smoothly and evenly as the primer did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s, have combination skin that is problem free 99% of the time.</li>
            <li>The primer does give a smoother look and minimizes the appearance of pores in my opinion, so I&#x27;m happy with the overall effect.</li>
            <li>personal experience (which does not include a great deal of serum primers) went like this:  </li>
            <li>Helps to apply foundation evenly and feels light on your face all day.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>My combination skin feels smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and blended well with my skin.</li>
            <li>I will not use a product on my face unless it is oil free.</li>
            <li>This primer applies smoothly and leaves a silky skin for apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>I use it under my makeup, everything goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>and I was always looking for a oil free product, they say this is oil free</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel my skin got smooth after I applied, but yes the make up does remain on face for a longer time.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Makes foundation or eye shadow go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>my wife has used covergirl and olay simply ageless serum primer for quite some time now and says it is a great product for her</li>
            <li>It is light not greasy, my makeup does not settle into lines, nor look blotchy.</li>
            <li>I use powder fondation and using this product make make up looks a lot better and fresh.</li>
            <li>This primer evens skin tone and makes foundation go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Smooth cream--</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic primer.</li>
            <li>Still, I have come to appreciate that certain products impart a satisfying smoothness to an increasingly craggy surface, and this particular one seems to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Not half as good as what I was using.  </li>
            <li>it works pretty good and cheaper than those high end primers!</li>
            <li>I am 60 and product helps provide a nice finish for older skin.</li>
            <li>And I use a primer, so I&#x27;m familiar with the concept.</li>
            <li>As a primer, which is what it is intended to be, it glides on smoothly and makes a nice foundation for your foundation -- helping it to look better and last longer.  </li>
            <li>Originally, I believed primers were just an additional unwarranted expense.    </li>
            <li>And I was really excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>When makeup primers first hit the market, I wondered if we were witnessing the introduction of yet another gimmick from the beauty industry to entice us to spend more money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally wear a foundation, however, I&#x27;ve been using the Covergirl serum underneath my day cream with good results.  </li>
            <li>When women reach a certain age, foundation doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly anymore as the skin starts to behave more like paper than spandex.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t have any breakouts, it was very moisturizing which i love, and my skin appeared smooth and almost poreless.</li>
            <li>This applies well, sinks in nicely and makes a nice foundation for, well, foundation.</li>
            <li>I like the feel of it on my skin, and it is a far better price than many of the primers I have used.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the true test of a product, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sticky &amp; helps keep your makeup nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Overall, I felt the product wasn&#x27;t greasy and made my skin feel good all day</li>
            <li>I wear this way more often though and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover.</li>
            <li>My skin really looked better after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>It prepares the skin so the make up goes easily and looks more natural.</li>
            <li>I am less than impressed with this, I continue to use it because I paid for it, but it really doesn&#x27;t do what it should</li>
            <li>I have lots of allergic reactions to lotions but this one has been fine for me since the first day it arrived.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I am 28, I have decent skin with out too many issues.</li>
            <li>My skin can occasionally get oily, and CG &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Serum Primer worked out wonderfully.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lucky, you might find it at Target.</li>
            <li>It has helped on very hot days as well.</li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s \\&quot;suitable for sensitive skin, oil free.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Before using this primer, or ANY primer, for that matter, you need to moisturize/spf your skin first!  </li>
            <li>It goes on softly and smooth and feels great all day long.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps to fill in the fine lines I have and makes everything else glide on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, feels great - not greasy or heavy but light and very natural.</li>
            <li>I really want the smooth look</li>
            <li>This product works nicely with the Covergirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless foundation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oil free, safe for sensitive skin ( which is an absolute must for me)</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Mature skin would benefit more from Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 37 years old and have always used a light weight oil free lotion as my preferred</li>
            <li>I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it may be okay for someone without sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I could have spent more</li>
            <li>Overall I liked it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not totally certain it makes foundation look better, I do know it makes my skin feel better--like hydrated. :)</li>
            <li>My makeup does go on more evenly after the application, although not any more so than when I use other \\&quot;age-defying\\&quot; products.    </li>
            <li>Right now mine is showing about 80% full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(foundation of any kind makes me look ghostly--evens out the bit of naturally occurring color in my pale, Irish face), so I don&#x27;t know if it does anything more than moisturize, but it makes me feel as if I have done something good and smoothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>cream is white, light to the touch and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>After using the primer for some time and being a little more adept at applying it lightly, then following lightly with foundation and dusting of mineral powder, the result is a smooth natural looking complexion.</li>
            <li>And so very small a price to pay for something this good!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t notice a huge improvement in my fine lines, but I do like the scent and feel of \\&quot;Simply Ageless\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but it certainly did improve the appearance of my skin for now!</li>
            <li>The actual product isn&#x27;t that great it makes my face look cakey and white.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the product very much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously used primers by Smashbox and Avon and liked both, but used them more for special occasions and not on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a white lotion that you smooth on your face when it&#x27;s clean, before doing make-up.    </li>
            <li>This one is quick to dry &amp; does not leave your skin feeling that you have too many layers of product on your face.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend to all women but particularly more mature women.  </li>
            <li>I am always willing to learn.</li>
            <li>This product may be better suited to younger women, as it hydrates and moisturizes but does not help repair or diminsh aging skin or skin damaged from sun exposure.</li>
            <li>and I began using foundation for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put my foundation on without putting this first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neater, faster and a lot more sanitary to dispense exactly the amount that I want with a simple press of the pump without repeatedly dipping my fingers into the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin also has a tendency to get pretty oily out here in this humid Texas heat</li>
            <li>I ended up using it only at nighttime because I did like okay it as a moisturizer but not as a primer.</li>
            <li>I tried the Simply Ageless Serum Primer and was pleased with the odor and consistency.</li>
            <li>I will spend the extra money and get something much better.</li>
            <li>it was a bigger size but thank you :)</li>
            <li>but then so does my moisturizer which I apply over the top of the Cover Girl/Olay Simply Ageless Serum Primer.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different foundations</li>
            <li>This product helps the makeup look more even, especially on \\&quot;older\\&quot; skin, but I think any oil-free moisturizer would do that.  </li>
            <li>I tried it alone the first day and it worked OK, but it did not provide enough moisture</li>
            <li>Even the hot &amp; humid ones.</li>
            <li>must say I did not think I would like this at first</li>
            <li>I applied it after my astringent but before my foundation and sure enough it was not greasy or oily as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>My local store keeps selling out, so I&#x27;m glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use a tinted moisturizer first, then apply this, then makeup... or just this and then makeup.</li>
            <li>I use Perricone products big bucks,  but found this to be even better for my daytime under makeup moisture</li>
            <li>It seems to set my liquid makeup even in hot weather.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m used to the they clear smooth feeling that the Lancome primer leaves on your face that allows the foundation to glide over your face without your face being shiney.  </li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Will order more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>My forehead lines are very noticeable and kind of deep, and they really almost looked like they went away.  </li>
            <li>First time using a primer - saw a recommendation in a beauty magazine.</li>
            <li>Color is white unlike some other primers that appear &amp;#34;clear.&amp;#34; Extremely light, easy to apply and spread across skin to cover more area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I will use it every day, but it&#x27;s a nice \\&quot;trick\\&quot; to have in my make up box for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>comes in a convenient pump dispenser, I didn&#x27;t notice a scent to it, applies smoothly, makes my make up stay on longer, very moisturizing but nowhere near grease-ville.</li>
            <li>I really did not notice any difference in the appearance of my skin and the feel wasn&#x27;t much different than my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It blends into my skin quickly and makes my face feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Plus container makes it extra easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t order the same thing more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Day cream goes on easily and makeup seems to last longer than without.  </li>
            <li>When used to treat overly dry spots, it did the trick better than almost anything else.   </li>
            <li>think the Olay product may have something to do with the moisturizing but do not think it helps any anti-aging problems as the chemicals would not be strong enough to make a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Of course my skin has large pores and a couple scars so aside from laser treatment or a chemical peel, I can&#x27;t expect perfection without going to a pro.   </li>
            <li>I LOVE trying new facial products!  </li>
            <li>actually worked like a good spot moisturizer for very dry skin</li>
            <li>Well, better yet, my sore red spots are a little better.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Paired together, my makeup stays on much longer and looks radiant.</li>
            <li>but I didnt really like it becasue</li>
            <li>If however, it really did something</li>
            <li>For some women, this might be one of those products that really helps with applying makeup.</li>
            <li>Really like this serum.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this primer to try.</li>
            <li>I really like this primer.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works really well under makeup foundation.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin &amp; need a primer</li>
            <li>&quot; This product really works.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>My face feels much smoother and looks healthier since I began using it.</li>
            <li>My make make goes on much smoother.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really work me.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin and truly helpful to your skin.</li>
            <li>I will change my rating if I am satisfied in near future.</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of primer, especially when \\&quot;primers\\&quot; were all the rage, and this product ranks below many other brands I have tried like Benefit, Clinique, TARTE, and my personal favorite, \\&quot;Philosophy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Other companies make primers that actually make the skin look more filled in and perfected I would say, but I don&#x27;t like the heaviness of those.</li>
            <li>As well there are some other harmful chemicals in this mixed with good for your skin ingredients.</li>
            <li>Palmitoyl Pentapeptide is an amino peptide, the age-defying ingredient in this serum and many other age-defying products.  </li>
            <li>However I am not convinced that this product is any better than any of the other millions of \\&quot;age-defying\\&quot; products out there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other primers that work much better (i.e. Wrinkle injection by Too Faced).  </li>
            <li>I can mix with a bit of foundation if I want just a super light shade for everyday.  </li>
            <li>Love this primer for under makeup feels smooth and soft to my face, hard to find in store.</li>
            <li>I start with Skinceuticals C E Ferulic, slick on this primer which glides on nicely, put on</li>
            <li>Nothing particularly good and nothing particularly bad - just OK.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long to dry, and I liked the fact that I didn&#x27;t notice any particular smell (which always bothers me when it&#x27;s on my face!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t phobic about suspected cancer causing ingredients then this Primer is highly recommended</li>
            <li>I used to use another high end primer but this CoverGirl/</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As an over-forty woman, I have to admit that I&#x27;m looking for any product that can make this ole&#x27; pelt of mine look a little better.</li>
            <li>Does give foundation a little more staying power.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel super heavy like other primers do; rather it applies like a nice, velvety moisturizer but with a bit of perfecting effect.</li>
            <li>Drier, thinner skin on the face means it is harder to get it on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This product does absolutely nothing for makeup on young skin under 35.</li>
            <li>Its foamy and is not silicone based, yet sinks into skin not providing any smooth surface for makeup to glide onto.</li>
            <li>I really was surprised when this worked.</li>
            <li>For everyday it works okay.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>I will give it a few more try&#x27;s before I make  a judgment.  </li>
            <li>The inclusion of Olay in the product is pure genius, it leaves your skin feeling soft &amp; smooth and the primer makes a great base for applying your foundation &amp; makeup.</li>
            <li>Its suppose to go on under your foundation, I put a light coat in certain areas of my face and found that it also made my face a little greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many products to have my skin appear poreless and would also make for a good base for bb cream.  </li>
            <li>No smell very soft and</li>
            <li>I live in Fla and it is HOT and HUMID and the last thing you want is something that feels weighty on your skin.  </li>
            <li>A nice primer for slightly dry to average skin types.  </li>
            <li>Generally I use primers on areas of concern not my whole face.  </li>
            <li>I did not see that the primer caused any fine lines or wrinkles to be less</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big believer in a consistent skin routine - cleaning, toning, moisturizing - but</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft !</li>
            <li>Truly I was surprised!  </li>
            <li>All of the Cover Girl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless products are considered moderately to highly hazardous (even developmental/reproductive toxicity) by the Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Environmental Working Group; you can check their database online for all sorts of other cosmetics you may be using.</li>
            <li>But I little more pricey, especially when my 40</li>
            <li>+ year old skin has to keep looking under 30 if I want to stay on tv.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky, not heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I much prefer the applicator of Simply Ageless.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer feels soft and creamy, without being too oily.  </li>
            <li>It tightens up areas for me around the eyes and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>If you are too young for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>far as the \\&quot;ageless\\&quot; claim goes...</li>
            <li>I have yet to break out in any way, pimples or otherwise, in the somewhat sensitive areas of application.  </li>
            <li>It is also considerably cheaper than most.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and one of the claims on the bottle</li>
            <li>so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>No skin irritation (I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wow what a product.</li>
            <li>If you are too young for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the fact that it is formulated for sensitive skin, but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll purchase it again unless it is made in a tinted formulation.</li>
            <li>it really does erase tiny lines around the eyes and reduces them on the forehead.</li>
            <li>Also, my foundation (liquid) seems to blend with it rather than sit on top of it, in such a way that my foundation looks blotchy and uneven.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect base.</li>
            <li>perfect for smoothing on your makeup base.</li>
            <li>I think anti-aging claims are easier for companies to make since they are not promising any results right away</li>
            <li>It also makes your skin feel extremely oily and takes some work to find the right amount to keep that from happening.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for the serum.</li>
            <li>It has very little scent as well, which is a huge bonus for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the primer does not have any sunscreening abilities, doesn&#x27;t work any better than a good-quality moisturizer for providing a smooth base under foundation, doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of moisturizing ingredients, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for the appearance of my skin</li>
            <li>It hides large poors and minimizes wrinkles just as well as the more expensive brand.  </li>
            <li>I consistantly use the old standby, Cover Girl, Clean Makeup Foundation (with that nostalgic, Noxema smell) and many other Cover Girl cosmetic products.  </li>
            <li>later I walk out with a new face.</li>
            <li>I have seen a rash of primer-type products lately and wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just another marketing gimmick, or if it was really a necessary step in my morning routine.    </li>
            <li>Also, I am used to serums being a clearish, thick liquid, but this is more like a regular face lotion, just a bit</li>
            <li>I had to apply such little product all over my face, it seems there was more facial contact as opposed to my regular lotion.</li>
            <li>It performs well, so it&#x27;s a shame there are parabens and a few other items that are not skin healthy</li>
            <li>It is slightly moisturizing, but with my dry skin I do use a light layer of moisturizer underneath it.      </li>
            <li>I generally use Olay serum on my face.  </li>
            <li>It makes your makep last all day as well as sets a clear canvas for applying foundation.</li>
            <li>I use and have used Cover Girl products ever since I was old enough to use makeup.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be noted, however,  that if you&#x27;re at all concerned about a natural approach to skin care, some of the following list of ingredients might give pause: Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Glycerin, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Sodium Chloride, Titanium Dioxide, Diethylhexyl Carbonate Niacinamide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Acetyl Glucosamine, PEG/PPG 18/18 Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Allantoin, Methicone, PEG 10 Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ethylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide 4, PEG 100</li>
            <li>After using it on and off for nearly a month I have arrived at a \\&quot;middle of the road\\&quot; stance.     </li>
            <li>I was paying too much money for the expensive department store products, only to discover this product works better and is priced well.</li>
            <li>That said, I can&#x27;t say for sure if this serum made my skin any worse in that sense...</li>
            <li>I am used to applying a light weight lotion and with this you get the smallest, I mean</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin, so this is not an issue for me,</li>
            <li>I usually purchase from amazon because I receive it conveniently at my door and quickly.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it goes on well and provides a good base for makeup.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, you need to wait a few minutes for it to absorb.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Darn good for the price.</li>
            <li> This serum primer is really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about this Serum Primer</li>
            <li> Ordered this product because of the good reviews and just received it today.</li>
            <li> I saw good reviews on this</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m delighted that I tried it.</li>
            <li> I used to use DHC Velvet Skin and loved it, but ran out and was looking for something affordable at the moment.</li>
            <li> And it smells good--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for a good primer.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a good primer</li>
            <li> Feels so good on the skin....</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> I needed a good foundation primer (one that goes over my lotion).  </li>
            <li> It seemed Covergirl and Olay will be good brand combination</li>
            <li> and I believe it&#x27;s a good product and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Feels great and has a very light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This primer works exceptionally well for me.    </li>
            <li> What I like best is that it is greaseless and &amp;#34;sinks in&amp;#34; quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth!</li>
            <li> For what you pay for it works but if you want a great look and hold it is better to send the money.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay products for many years and it is great</li>
            <li> Very nice, I really love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> I love this primer!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love It !</li>
            <li> If CG and Olay took these out, I would absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> The product is not oily or greasy, which was a pleasant surprise and a contrast to many lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product for older skin!</li>
            <li> it works great leaving your face smooth and non greasy.</li>
            <li> If you are comfortable with using \\&quot;cones\\&quot; on your face this is a great cost saving alternative.</li>
            <li> This is a great light weight primer</li>
            <li> whatever moisturizer is handy</li>
            <li> Nice touch.</li>
            <li> I think this product is actually a nice substitute for foundation and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look and feel smoother, so that my foundation went on nicely and stayed that way all day.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s kind.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy like many primers and doesn&#x27;t eat my makeup away (which occurs with some primers) and has a good texture and doesn&#x27;t cause creasing or bubbling.</li>
            <li> but it kind of made my make up look kind of flakey.</li>
            <li> gives a nice moist look</li>
            <li> Glides on flawlessly and makes application of my foundation super easy.</li>
            <li> I loved using this as a makeup primer and the packaging is sturdy and the pump works easily.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly  and keeps makeup looking great.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent which is nice since some people have sensitivity to smells.</li>
            <li> 100 is very good value since most serums of this type command considerably higher prices.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s, have combination skin (oily on forehead, nose and chin), brown colour and fairly blemish free.</li>
            <li> This primer has a nice matte finish, which I love.</li>
            <li> It would probably work best on young persons.</li>
            <li> It is a preventative application rather than a repair, suitable for still youthful skin types.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best drugstore primers that I have tried.</li>
            <li> primer went on nice and smooth and dries to a kind of powdery feel.</li>
            <li> Too good to be true...</li>
            <li> It goes on silky and your skin feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very smooth application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and smoothing.  </li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product and it felt very smooth.</li>
            <li> These are all very important things when choosing a primer.</li>
            <li> thing I did not see listed with this product that was very important to me, is it is oil free!</li>
            <li> :)      </li>
            <li> I could have pressed her for a more descriptive evaluation</li>
            <li> She says she will probably buy some more.  </li>
            <li> Foundation glides over it, and does not settle into the cracks and pores on my face - it just stays, evenly spread, on the top of the primer.  </li>
            <li> It gives my face more of a &#x27;matte&#x27; finish.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not the best judge of the merits of various potions that one might slap on the face.  </li>
            <li> I do love Olay products, and this joint Cover Girl product was another winner in my book.</li>
            <li> I was using Avon Magix and I would switch to this once because it smells cleaner and blends better with no greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am really glad I came across this product, and I thank those who wrote reviews about it which made me try it. :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over two years already, and I love it.</li>
            <li> This might be better for people who do not have issues with oily or break-out prone skin.</li>
            <li> I will definatley be buying more of this primer when it runs out.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It feels nice, goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> my skin is too tempermental for me to know for sure</li>
            <li> (I just picked up my second bottle on sale at Kroger for $11.99, which is the best deal I&#x27;ve seen without a coupon.)</li>
            <li> Plus its from two of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li> and I love it more with each use.</li>
            <li> The latest fad for cosmetics is these \\&quot;primers\\&quot; you put on your skin beneath your makeup.  </li>
            <li> What it seems to do is moisturize the skin, making it a bit more pliable for the makeup application.      </li>
            <li> this primer is more anti-aging then</li>
            <li> Love  this primer.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this primer.  </li>
            <li> Love the feel, and no yucky smell</li>
            <li> Some drug stores have it, most do not.  </li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> Each day I checked to make sure it was still not &#x60;shining&#x27; and my face still had a matte look to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 with oily olive skin, so maybe the product would work better on someone with drier, fairer skin.       </li>
            <li> , I think it worked better as that than as an age serum.   </li>
            <li> Mostly because of the heaviness I mentioned below.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff on my face since it smooths my skin on this aging Grandma</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t make my skin look any better.</li>
            <li> A favorite for my over-50 skin.</li>
            <li> Love this primer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I have just used this product once and looks OK to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not shiny, oily, or greasy, and my powder mineral makeup goes on so much better.</li>
            <li> I brought miracle blur cream from l&#x27;oreal by recommendation and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is such  wonderful product to apply before you put on your foundation - makes your face look and feel so nice and smooth</li>
            <li> This is more like a lotion than a primer.</li>
            <li> Still use Perricone at night, but will be trying more of this line when it runs out.</li>
            <li> and maybe it would work better</li>
            <li> , I thought it would had better results.</li>
            <li> Works well, love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So it just sits on my counter mostly.  </li>
            <li> But I love primers.  </li>
            <li> Just gotta find one you love and stick with it.</li>
            <li> I soooo love this primer</li>
            <li> good, right?  </li>
            <li> Thbis is a good product, the price is right and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> got this in the mail and was so excited!</li>
            <li> Using it over a moisturizer felt a bit greasy to me, so the perfect combination was moisturizer with SPF, primer, then loose powder.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and makes my foundation look a bit more matte.</li>
            <li> This creamy solution glides on smoothly and immediately improves the appearance of my skin, making it look more luminous and even toned.  </li>
            <li> It made my face look more \\&quot;matte\\&quot; and went on smooth and velvety.</li>
            <li> This is a nice primer and economically priced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smooth out the skin, allowing makeup to be more easily applied.  </li>
            <li> Nice size bottle and the click pump lets just the right amount come out on your fingertip.</li>
            <li> What I experienced as I kept trying it was that it actually lessened the need for more foundation, powder etc.    </li>
            <li> Serum is easy to apply, and the quality is there.</li>
            <li> it was easy to buy.and</li>
            <li> It glides on easily, does not irritate her skin, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t have that strong odor like the rest of Covergirl/Olay face products.</li>
            <li> Although performance wise, the best I&#x27;ve tried in many ways, I most likely will not purchase this again due to the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was a bit torn at first on whether I liked this product.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and easily with no tugging, creasing, or stickiness.  </li>
            <li> Some women are fine with this and some women try to avoid the \\&quot;cones\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It reduces fine lines the day after you use it and it does in fact tighten your skin and even minimizes pore appearance.   </li>
            <li> This is a PRIMER, it is supposed to minimize fine lines/pores and help your makeup stay on longer.</li>
            <li> It worked out just fine.</li>
            <li> Instead, it just sat on top of my skin making it super moist and sticky.</li>
            <li> Works wonders under your foundation to smooth out the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth after I apply the serum.</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s light (and non-greasy).  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this products.</li>
            <li> so I always stick with light or mattifying primers/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s with skin that still is prone to acne, so it&#x27;s important for me to use products that don&#x27;t contribute to the problem.</li>
            <li> But I do know that this felt light and didn&#x27;t feel at all greasy when I applied it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Instead of a smooth application, you get \\&quot;caking\\&quot; and areas where the make up looks blotchy.    </li>
            <li> The point here is that this moisturizer allowed my foundation to be applied just as smoothly and evenly as the primer did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s, have combination skin that is problem free 99% of the time.</li>
            <li> The primer does give a smoother look and minimizes the appearance of pores in my opinion, so I&#x27;m happy with the overall effect.</li>
            <li> personal experience (which does not include a great deal of serum primers) went like this:  </li>
            <li> Helps to apply foundation evenly and feels light on your face all day.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> My combination skin feels smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and blended well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I will not use a product on my face unless it is oil free.</li>
            <li> This primer applies smoothly and leaves a silky skin for apply makeup.  </li>
            <li> I use it under my makeup, everything goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> and I was always looking for a oil free product, they say this is oil free</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel my skin got smooth after I applied, but yes the make up does remain on face for a longer time.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Makes foundation or eye shadow go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> my wife has used covergirl and olay simply ageless serum primer for quite some time now and says it is a great product for her</li>
            <li> It is light not greasy, my makeup does not settle into lines, nor look blotchy.</li>
            <li> I use powder fondation and using this product make make up looks a lot better and fresh.</li>
            <li> This primer evens skin tone and makes foundation go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Smooth cream--</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic primer.</li>
            <li> Still, I have come to appreciate that certain products impart a satisfying smoothness to an increasingly craggy surface, and this particular one seems to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> Not half as good as what I was using.  </li>
            <li> it works pretty good and cheaper than those high end primers!</li>
            <li> I am 60 and product helps provide a nice finish for older skin.</li>
            <li> And I use a primer, so I&#x27;m familiar with the concept.</li>
            <li> As a primer, which is what it is intended to be, it glides on smoothly and makes a nice foundation for your foundation -- helping it to look better and last longer.  </li>
            <li> Originally, I believed primers were just an additional unwarranted expense.    </li>
            <li> And I was really excited to get this product.</li>
            <li> When makeup primers first hit the market, I wondered if we were witnessing the introduction of yet another gimmick from the beauty industry to entice us to spend more money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally wear a foundation, however, I&#x27;ve been using the Covergirl serum underneath my day cream with good results.  </li>
            <li> When women reach a certain age, foundation doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly anymore as the skin starts to behave more like paper than spandex.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t have any breakouts, it was very moisturizing which i love, and my skin appeared smooth and almost poreless.</li>
            <li> This applies well, sinks in nicely and makes a nice foundation for, well, foundation.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it on my skin, and it is a far better price than many of the primers I have used.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the true test of a product, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not heavy or sticky &amp; helps keep your makeup nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Overall, I felt the product wasn&#x27;t greasy and made my skin feel good all day</li>
            <li> I wear this way more often though and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover.</li>
            <li> My skin really looked better after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It prepares the skin so the make up goes easily and looks more natural.</li>
            <li> I am less than impressed with this, I continue to use it because I paid for it, but it really doesn&#x27;t do what it should</li>
            <li> I have lots of allergic reactions to lotions but this one has been fine for me since the first day it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am 28, I have decent skin with out too many issues.</li>
            <li> My skin can occasionally get oily, and CG &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Serum Primer worked out wonderfully.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lucky, you might find it at Target.</li>
            <li> It has helped on very hot days as well.</li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s \\&quot;suitable for sensitive skin, oil free.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before using this primer, or ANY primer, for that matter, you need to moisturize/spf your skin first!  </li>
            <li> It goes on softly and smooth and feels great all day long.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to fill in the fine lines I have and makes everything else glide on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, feels great - not greasy or heavy but light and very natural.</li>
            <li> I really want the smooth look</li>
            <li> This product works nicely with the Covergirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless foundation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil free, safe for sensitive skin ( which is an absolute must for me)</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Mature skin would benefit more from Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and have always used a light weight oil free lotion as my preferred</li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it may be okay for someone without sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I could have spent more</li>
            <li> Overall I liked it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not totally certain it makes foundation look better, I do know it makes my skin feel better--like hydrated. :)</li>
            <li> My makeup does go on more evenly after the application, although not any more so than when I use other \\&quot;age-defying\\&quot; products.    </li>
            <li> Right now mine is showing about 80% full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (foundation of any kind makes me look ghostly--evens out the bit of naturally occurring color in my pale, Irish face), so I don&#x27;t know if it does anything more than moisturize, but it makes me feel as if I have done something good and smoothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> cream is white, light to the touch and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> After using the primer for some time and being a little more adept at applying it lightly, then following lightly with foundation and dusting of mineral powder, the result is a smooth natural looking complexion.</li>
            <li> And so very small a price to pay for something this good!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice a huge improvement in my fine lines, but I do like the scent and feel of \\&quot;Simply Ageless\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but it certainly did improve the appearance of my skin for now!</li>
            <li> The actual product isn&#x27;t that great it makes my face look cakey and white.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used primers by Smashbox and Avon and liked both, but used them more for special occasions and not on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a white lotion that you smooth on your face when it&#x27;s clean, before doing make-up.    </li>
            <li> This one is quick to dry &amp; does not leave your skin feeling that you have too many layers of product on your face.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend to all women but particularly more mature women.  </li>
            <li> I am always willing to learn.</li>
            <li> This product may be better suited to younger women, as it hydrates and moisturizes but does not help repair or diminsh aging skin or skin damaged from sun exposure.</li>
            <li> and I began using foundation for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my foundation on without putting this first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neater, faster and a lot more sanitary to dispense exactly the amount that I want with a simple press of the pump without repeatedly dipping my fingers into the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin also has a tendency to get pretty oily out here in this humid Texas heat</li>
            <li> I ended up using it only at nighttime because I did like okay it as a moisturizer but not as a primer.</li>
            <li> I tried the Simply Ageless Serum Primer and was pleased with the odor and consistency.</li>
            <li> I will spend the extra money and get something much better.</li>
            <li> it was a bigger size but thank you :)</li>
            <li> but then so does my moisturizer which I apply over the top of the Cover Girl/Olay Simply Ageless Serum Primer.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different foundations</li>
            <li> This product helps the makeup look more even, especially on \\&quot;older\\&quot; skin, but I think any oil-free moisturizer would do that.  </li>
            <li> I tried it alone the first day and it worked OK, but it did not provide enough moisture</li>
            <li> Even the hot &amp; humid ones.</li>
            <li> must say I did not think I would like this at first</li>
            <li> I applied it after my astringent but before my foundation and sure enough it was not greasy or oily as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> My local store keeps selling out, so I&#x27;m glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use a tinted moisturizer first, then apply this, then makeup... or just this and then makeup.</li>
            <li> I use Perricone products big bucks,  but found this to be even better for my daytime under makeup moisture</li>
            <li> It seems to set my liquid makeup even in hot weather.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m used to the they clear smooth feeling that the Lancome primer leaves on your face that allows the foundation to glide over your face without your face being shiney.  </li>
            <li> I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Will order more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> My forehead lines are very noticeable and kind of deep, and they really almost looked like they went away.  </li>
            <li> First time using a primer - saw a recommendation in a beauty magazine.</li>
            <li> Color is white unlike some other primers that appear &amp;#34;clear.&amp;#34; Extremely light, easy to apply and spread across skin to cover more area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will use it every day, but it&#x27;s a nice \\&quot;trick\\&quot; to have in my make up box for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> comes in a convenient pump dispenser, I didn&#x27;t notice a scent to it, applies smoothly, makes my make up stay on longer, very moisturizing but nowhere near grease-ville.</li>
            <li> I really did not notice any difference in the appearance of my skin and the feel wasn&#x27;t much different than my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It blends into my skin quickly and makes my face feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Plus container makes it extra easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t order the same thing more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Day cream goes on easily and makeup seems to last longer than without.  </li>
            <li> When used to treat overly dry spots, it did the trick better than almost anything else.   </li>
            <li> think the Olay product may have something to do with the moisturizing but do not think it helps any anti-aging problems as the chemicals would not be strong enough to make a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Of course my skin has large pores and a couple scars so aside from laser treatment or a chemical peel, I can&#x27;t expect perfection without going to a pro.   </li>
            <li> I LOVE trying new facial products!  </li>
            <li> actually worked like a good spot moisturizer for very dry skin</li>
            <li> Well, better yet, my sore red spots are a little better.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Paired together, my makeup stays on much longer and looks radiant.</li>
            <li> but I didnt really like it becasue</li>
            <li> If however, it really did something</li>
            <li> For some women, this might be one of those products that really helps with applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Really like this serum.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this primer to try.</li>
            <li> I really like this primer.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works really well under makeup foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin &amp; need a primer</li>
            <li> &quot; This product really works.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> My face feels much smoother and looks healthier since I began using it.</li>
            <li> My make make goes on much smoother.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really work me.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin and truly helpful to your skin.</li>
            <li> I will change my rating if I am satisfied in near future.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of primer, especially when \\&quot;primers\\&quot; were all the rage, and this product ranks below many other brands I have tried like Benefit, Clinique, TARTE, and my personal favorite, \\&quot;Philosophy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Other companies make primers that actually make the skin look more filled in and perfected I would say, but I don&#x27;t like the heaviness of those.</li>
            <li> As well there are some other harmful chemicals in this mixed with good for your skin ingredients.</li>
            <li> Palmitoyl Pentapeptide is an amino peptide, the age-defying ingredient in this serum and many other age-defying products.  </li>
            <li> However I am not convinced that this product is any better than any of the other millions of \\&quot;age-defying\\&quot; products out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other primers that work much better (i.e. Wrinkle injection by Too Faced).  </li>
            <li> I can mix with a bit of foundation if I want just a super light shade for everyday.  </li>
            <li> Love this primer for under makeup feels smooth and soft to my face, hard to find in store.</li>
            <li> I start with Skinceuticals C E Ferulic, slick on this primer which glides on nicely, put on</li>
            <li> Nothing particularly good and nothing particularly bad - just OK.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to dry, and I liked the fact that I didn&#x27;t notice any particular smell (which always bothers me when it&#x27;s on my face!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t phobic about suspected cancer causing ingredients then this Primer is highly recommended</li>
            <li> I used to use another high end primer but this CoverGirl/</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As an over-forty woman, I have to admit that I&#x27;m looking for any product that can make this ole&#x27; pelt of mine look a little better.</li>
            <li> Does give foundation a little more staying power.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel super heavy like other primers do; rather it applies like a nice, velvety moisturizer but with a bit of perfecting effect.</li>
            <li> Drier, thinner skin on the face means it is harder to get it on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing for makeup on young skin under 35.</li>
            <li> Its foamy and is not silicone based, yet sinks into skin not providing any smooth surface for makeup to glide onto.</li>
            <li> I really was surprised when this worked.</li>
            <li> For everyday it works okay.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> I will give it a few more try&#x27;s before I make  a judgment.  </li>
            <li> The inclusion of Olay in the product is pure genius, it leaves your skin feeling soft &amp; smooth and the primer makes a great base for applying your foundation &amp; makeup.</li>
            <li> Its suppose to go on under your foundation, I put a light coat in certain areas of my face and found that it also made my face a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried so many products to have my skin appear poreless and would also make for a good base for bb cream.  </li>
            <li> No smell very soft and</li>
            <li> I live in Fla and it is HOT and HUMID and the last thing you want is something that feels weighty on your skin.  </li>
            <li> A nice primer for slightly dry to average skin types.  </li>
            <li> Generally I use primers on areas of concern not my whole face.  </li>
            <li> I did not see that the primer caused any fine lines or wrinkles to be less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big believer in a consistent skin routine - cleaning, toning, moisturizing - but</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft !</li>
            <li> Truly I was surprised!  </li>
            <li> All of the Cover Girl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless products are considered moderately to highly hazardous (even developmental/reproductive toxicity) by the Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Environmental Working Group; you can check their database online for all sorts of other cosmetics you may be using.</li>
            <li> But I little more pricey, especially when my 40</li>
            <li> + year old skin has to keep looking under 30 if I want to stay on tv.</li>
            <li> It goes on silky, not heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I much prefer the applicator of Simply Ageless.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels soft and creamy, without being too oily.  </li>
            <li> It tightens up areas for me around the eyes and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> If you are too young for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> far as the \\&quot;ageless\\&quot; claim goes...</li>
            <li> I have yet to break out in any way, pimples or otherwise, in the somewhat sensitive areas of application.  </li>
            <li> It is also considerably cheaper than most.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and one of the claims on the bottle</li>
            <li> so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> No skin irritation (I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wow what a product.</li>
            <li> If you are too young for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that it is formulated for sensitive skin, but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll purchase it again unless it is made in a tinted formulation.</li>
            <li> it really does erase tiny lines around the eyes and reduces them on the forehead.</li>
            <li> Also, my foundation (liquid) seems to blend with it rather than sit on top of it, in such a way that my foundation looks blotchy and uneven.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect base.</li>
            <li> perfect for smoothing on your makeup base.</li>
            <li> I think anti-aging claims are easier for companies to make since they are not promising any results right away</li>
            <li> It also makes your skin feel extremely oily and takes some work to find the right amount to keep that from happening.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for the serum.</li>
            <li> It has very little scent as well, which is a huge bonus for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the primer does not have any sunscreening abilities, doesn&#x27;t work any better than a good-quality moisturizer for providing a smooth base under foundation, doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of moisturizing ingredients, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for the appearance of my skin</li>
            <li> It hides large poors and minimizes wrinkles just as well as the more expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> I consistantly use the old standby, Cover Girl, Clean Makeup Foundation (with that nostalgic, Noxema smell) and many other Cover Girl cosmetic products.  </li>
            <li> later I walk out with a new face.</li>
            <li> I have seen a rash of primer-type products lately and wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just another marketing gimmick, or if it was really a necessary step in my morning routine.    </li>
            <li> Also, I am used to serums being a clearish, thick liquid, but this is more like a regular face lotion, just a bit</li>
            <li> I had to apply such little product all over my face, it seems there was more facial contact as opposed to my regular lotion.</li>
            <li> It performs well, so it&#x27;s a shame there are parabens and a few other items that are not skin healthy</li>
            <li> It is slightly moisturizing, but with my dry skin I do use a light layer of moisturizer underneath it.      </li>
            <li> I generally use Olay serum on my face.  </li>
            <li> It makes your makep last all day as well as sets a clear canvas for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> I use and have used Cover Girl products ever since I was old enough to use makeup.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be noted, however,  that if you&#x27;re at all concerned about a natural approach to skin care, some of the following list of ingredients might give pause: Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Glycerin, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Sodium Chloride, Titanium Dioxide, Diethylhexyl Carbonate Niacinamide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Acetyl Glucosamine, PEG/PPG 18/18 Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Allantoin, Methicone, PEG 10 Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ethylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide 4, PEG 100</li>
            <li> After using it on and off for nearly a month I have arrived at a \\&quot;middle of the road\\&quot; stance.     </li>
            <li> I was paying too much money for the expensive department store products, only to discover this product works better and is priced well.</li>
            <li> That said, I can&#x27;t say for sure if this serum made my skin any worse in that sense...</li>
            <li> I am used to applying a light weight lotion and with this you get the smallest, I mean</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin, so this is not an issue for me,</li>
            <li> I usually purchase from amazon because I receive it conveniently at my door and quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it goes on well and provides a good base for makeup.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, you need to wait a few minutes for it to absorb.</li>
            <li> I normally haven&#x27;t used a primer, but am getting older and it does make a subtle difference around my eyes and with the look of my pores.</li>
            <li> Although, a little goes a long way and the bottle is rather large</li>
            <li> have marked it down by several stars because it has parabens (methylparaben, ethylparaben).</li>
            <li> If you desire more dramatic results, you should look at other offerings in the Olay line but if you&#x27;re looking for a  lightweight, moisturizing serum to wear either under makeup or alone, this is</li>
            <li> Actually I recommend to people how have a dry skin touch.</li>
            <li> -I could never wear this under make up unless you waited several hours for it to dry.   </li>
            <li> You never really know if any of these things actually work.</li>
            <li> It just sits on the skin and makes it slippery, the foundation doesn&#x27;t stay long.</li>
            <li> This is what I expected from Simply Ageless.  </li>
            <li> Item was open everywhere all empty</li>
            <li> Makes a good base for make up.</li>
            <li> This Serum Primer is a good base to use before applying your mineral makeups, etc.</li>
            <li> I previously had purchased a much more expensive primer from a Nordstroms</li>
            <li> I have used only one other brand, and this one is less expensive and so much better.</li>
            <li> However, lots of other products, when applied before makeup, do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> believe some other reviewers stated they did not like that the bottle was not see through because you do not know when the serum is low.</li>
            <li> im disappointed though because Ive been using it for like two weeks and have had so many breakouts!</li>
            <li> Even after blending I notice that it makes my skin look flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin so some parts of my face is oily and some I would have dry patches.</li>
            <li> It does not leave much in the way of detectable residue, so it doesn&#x27;t LOOK like lotion (or far worse, makeup!).  </li>
            <li> I have a combination skin (oily and dry)</li>
            <li> It works just as well as my more expensive products yet without the heavy scent.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sensitive to products at all!!</li>
            <li> About the products as well, it is white (not lavender in the lighting I use in my house) and has a funny smell (not good) that is very faint and dissipates quickly</li>
            <li> In my 40s I realized that my splotchy ugly skin needed something more</li>
            <li> also makes a great base for foundation!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it until it is empty and  update my review at that time.</li>
            <li> I use minimal concealer and no foundation.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea if this will do anything about being \\&quot;ageless,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but I felt like my skin was wet for hours after application.</li>
            <li> so my makeup stays on longer then a few short hour&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was out of my regular primer and decided to give this a try as it&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper</li>
            <li> \\&quot;A little goes a long way.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It has almost no smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I applied moisturizer before and then only a small amount of primer (dime size).</li>
            <li> I like how my makeup looks when I use this compared to the other brand I was using.</li>
            <li> age-reversing as other reviewers have stated as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe other people like this but not for me.</li>
            <li> Have used other primers, one by Maybelline, which allowed me to go without additional make-up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference in my skin, but my main purpose is preventative care.</li>
            <li> It creates a very smooth base for your makeup to glide over.</li>
            <li> was a bit of a let down from that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other primers, but this is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> and maybe, just maybe, you&#x27;ll have less wrinkles down the road if you use their product every day.</li>
            <li> The only negative comment I have is that it smells a little medicine-like.</li>
            <li> DHC has a primer that makes your skin feel like satin, makes pores appear less visible and using the cover girl primer</li>
            <li> but I order from amazon and it is actually slightly cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, this , after applied, flaked off.</li>
            <li> I can use less.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product previously but couldn&#x27;t seem to find it in my city.  </li>
            <li> Seems to help make my wrinkles and lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Visibly Firm Face Lotion, Active Copper, SPF-20, 1.7-Ounce Bottle]],</li>
            <li> but this stuff didn&#x27;t sit on the skin like my usual primer but sinks in a bit and leaves a greasy</li>
            <li> Now, staring down 50, I have tried a few &#x27;primers&#x27; under foundation, and I like them.  </li>
            <li> it made my foundation feel a little cakey.  </li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s no miracle product, but I think it makes a little difference and doesn&#x27;t irritate my fussy skin.</li>
            <li> A little greasier than I would have thought, but it does the job</li>
            <li> The scent, although subtle, didn&#x27;t trill me; it&#x27;s not natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to really explain it, but my skin felt so weird after applying.  </li>
            <li> I had no problem with sensitivity and was using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday before I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its a waste of $$.</li>
            <li> Once it was applied it felt a bit heavy and made my face look greasy.</li>
            <li> and I have tried a few.  </li>
            <li> -the product felt heavy and greasy compared to others of it</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly, never sticky.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing when I didn&#x27;t use primer.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> No strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> (It has no strong smell, either, which is another plus.)</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t believe that anything can &#x27;anti-age&#x27; us, and I have tried a lot of expensive anti-aging products.  </li>
            <li> I use Primer&#x27;s in the past.</li>
            <li> It smooths and helps to conceal small flaws</li>
            <li> usually apply a moisturizing sunscreen under my foundation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I buy into all these additional products.</li>
            <li> Not just small bumps, whiteheads, you could visibly see how clogged my pores were.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Lancome but its $35</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it helped my make-up stay on any longer than usual.</li>
            <li> It it hard to find in Stores around my house</li>
            <li> if you nknow what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I am 30 and those sparkly flakes are not a good plan for my skin.</li>
            <li> problem I&#x27;ve found is that it&#x27;s hard to find!  </li>
            <li> Found this less expensive on Amazon than at drug stores (where btw it&#x27;s difficult to find.)</li>
            <li> wish cosmetics companies would all drop parabens from their ingredients, but as of now, they&#x27;re still very common.</li>
            <li> And the primer helps the foundation stay on, so that at the end of the workday I am not (quite) a blotchy scary pallid hag.  </li>
            <li> For now I am not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> After using it every day for two weeks and getting angry every morning, I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> but sadly it seems to have been discontinued by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried expensive primers, and this works just as well.  </li>
            <li> but it proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> However, it proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> (it is extremely faint as well so not a deal breaker).</li>
            <li> (we find them in doctor&#x27;s prescriptions as well unfortunately).</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong when taking care of your face</li>
            <li> sorry Ellen:(</li>
            <li> It also arrived with the lid off and leaking, so that was totally lame as well.  :(</li>
            <li> In my 20s I never used base or foundation.  </li>
            <li> Not a concealer...just a base.</li>
            <li> (I know, that&#x27;s bad!)</li>
            <li> Leaves horrible greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Compared to a Clinique aging serum I used, this Cover Girl/Olay product just felt horrible.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m awful about moisturizing my face</li>

            <li> Smooths out my skin before I apply my foundation...</li>
            <li> Works wonders under your foundation to smooth out the wrinkles. Great price!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! It makes my foundation easier to apply! I highly recommend this product! It goes on very smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m a Sephora girl. I go in and think I&#x27;m there to get a mascara and $800 later I walk out with a new face. So I know makeup!  And I use a primer, so I&#x27;m familiar with the concept. This one is good.  Darn good for the price. But I little more pricey, especially when my 40+ year old skin has to keep looking under 30 if I want to stay on tv. :)      Did it make me ageless? No, but it didn&#x27;t make me look my age either!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife to use and to give her opinion. She said it is \\&quot;OK\\&quot;. Nothing particularly good and nothing particularly bad - just OK. That sounds like a 3 star rating to me. I could have pressed her for a more descriptive evaluation but if you knew my wife you would know why I could not do that. However, if you want to give it a shot  just come on over to the house and give me the opportunity to observe your technique. I am always willing to learn.</li>
            <li> This product works nicely with the Covergirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless foundation.  Paired together, my makeup stays on much longer and looks radiant.</li>
            <li> This serum primer is really good. It last all day and when I put it on my face my skin is smoother and look younger. I have been using it for three days and I noticed a difference on my skin! Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about this Serum Primer but I didnt really like it becasue it made my foundation feel a little cakey.  Its suppose to go on under your foundation, I put a light coat in certain areas of my face and found that it also made my face a little greasy.  I will stick to my Benefit Porefessional it works great leaving your face smooth and non greasy.</li>
            <li> When I applied to my face it stung...made my face red...made it itch..and I&#x27;m not sensitive to products at all!! What gives? I definitely will not buy this again! Too good to be true...sorry Ellen:(</li>
            <li> CoverGirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Serum Primer, 1-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my wife, and she loves it.  She says she will probably buy some more.  That&#x27;s the true test of a product, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  September, 2010</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now. It goes on smoothly, feels great - not greasy or heavy but light and very natural. Works great under foundation. My face feels smooth after I apply the serum. This product may be better suited to younger women, as it hydrates and moisturizes but does not help repair or diminsh aging skin or skin damaged from sun exposure. All in all a very nice product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a primer before. I have used this for a week now and like the results. It goes on smoothly and makes my foundation look a bit more matte. It has helped on very hot days as well. My skin looks great. The only negative comment I have is that it smells a little medicine-like. Just a trace though. Nice size bottle and the click pump lets just the right amount come out on your fingertip.</li>
            <li> In my 20s I never used base or foundation.  In my 30s a tinted moisturizer was enough.  In my 40s I realized that my splotchy ugly skin needed something more and I began using foundation for the first time in my life.  Now, staring down 50, I have tried a few &#x27;primers&#x27; under foundation, and I like them.  This primer works exceptionally well for me.    It goes on smoothly and easily with no tugging, creasing, or stickiness.  When it&#x27;s on, I look in the mirror and I see a difference - my skin tone is now even.  Foundation glides over it, and does not settle into the cracks and pores on my face - it just stays, evenly spread, on the top of the primer.  It gives my face more of a &#x27;matte&#x27; finish.  And the primer helps the foundation stay on, so that at the end of the workday I am not (quite) a blotchy scary pallid hag.  So, as a primer, it does what it says and I am very happy with it.  I have tried a similar Philosophy product (much more expensive) and this works just as well.    I see some reviewers discussing this product with regards to it&#x27;s anti-aging and moisturizing properties.  Personally, I don&#x27;t believe that anything can &#x27;anti-age&#x27; us, and I have tried a lot of expensive anti-aging products.  So I&#x27;m not looking for this to make me younger.  It is slightly moisturizing, but with my dry skin I do use a light layer of moisturizer underneath it.      BOTTOM LINE:  As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s light (and non-greasy).  As a primer, which is what it is intended to be, it glides on smoothly and makes a nice foundation for your foundation -- helping it to look better and last longer.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use and have used Cover Girl products ever since I was old enough to use makeup.  I consistantly use the old standby, Cover Girl, Clean Makeup Foundation (with that nostalgic, Noxema smell) and many other Cover Girl cosmetic products.  This primer, however, will not be something that I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this primer, or ANY primer, for that matter, you need to moisturize/spf your skin first!  I have used many different brands of primer, especially when \\&quot;primers\\&quot; were all the rage, and this product ranks below many other brands I have tried like Benefit, Clinique, TARTE, and my personal favorite, \\&quot;Philosophy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, try Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;The Present\\&quot;.  You will be happy you did...</li>
            <li> Still basically a 60&#x27;s hippie at heart, I&#x27;m not the best judge of the merits of various potions that one might slap on the face.  Still, I have come to appreciate that certain products impart a satisfying smoothness to an increasingly craggy surface, and this particular one seems to do a good job.  I start with Skinceuticals C E Ferulic, slick on this primer which glides on nicely, put on whatever moisturizer is handy (haven&#x27;t wedded to any products there), and then brush on the blush.  Even looks good in the magnifying mirror!  I like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it goes on well and provides a good base for makeup. I had no problem with sensitivity and was using it everyday. If you aren&#x27;t phobic about suspected cancer causing ingredients then this Primer is highly recommended But I&#x27;ve decided not to use it because of the Parabens that it contains. If however, it really did something (like make me look much younger!) different than similar products and simple moisturizers then I might have reconsidered whether to use it or not. This is one of those products that you are going to have to try (buy it somewhere where you can return it after trying it) to see if it works for you. For some women, this might be one of those products that really helps with applying makeup.</li>
            <li> This primer lives up to it&#x27;s hype. It goes on silky, not heavy. It creates a very smooth base for your makeup to glide over. No strong fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t feel yucky by the end of the day. I used this over my regular moisturizer, under my \\&quot;powder foundation\\&quot;. I do love Olay products, and this joint Cover Girl product was another winner in my book. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and I loved this product!</li>
            <li> Not half as good as what I was using.  I threw it away</li>
            <li> This is a real nice product. It prepares the skin so the make up goes easily and looks more natural.</li>
            <li> I loved using this as a makeup primer and the packaging is sturdy and the pump works easily.  It blends into my skin quickly and makes my face feel soft and moisturized.  I was using Avon Magix and I would switch to this once because it smells cleaner and blends better with no greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I think the Olay product may have something to do with the moisturizing but do not think it helps any anti-aging problems as the chemicals would not be strong enough to make a noticeable difference. It is somewhat costly at $13 or so per bottle but it makes makeup go on smoother so I recommend trying to find it on sale.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for older skin! Use it with the foundation, great!</li>
            <li> A nice primer for slightly dry to average skin types.  Generally I use primers on areas of concern not my whole face.  Originally, I believed primers were just an additional unwarranted expense.    What I experienced as I kept trying it was that it actually lessened the need for more foundation, powder etc.    After using the primer for some time and being a little more adept at applying it lightly, then following lightly with foundation and dusting of mineral powder, the result is a smooth natural looking complexion.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s, have combination skin (oily on forehead, nose and chin), brown colour and fairly blemish free. I do have widening pores so I thought I would try this for make-up smoothness. I applied moisturizer before and then only a small amount of primer (dime size). Even after blending I notice that it makes my skin look flaky and dry. I do notice however, that my make-up holds for longer and doesn&#x27;t appear as oily. It also feels lighter on my face. I really want the smooth look so I think I will try another primer next time.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product because of the good reviews and just received it today. Tried it immediately out of excitement and it was amazing!!!  I have extremely sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve tried so many products to have my skin appear poreless and would also make for a good base for bb cream.  My skin didn&#x27;t have any breakouts, it was very moisturizing which i love, and my skin appeared smooth and almost poreless. i love it! I am really glad I came across this product, and I thank those who wrote reviews about it which made me try it. :)</li>
            <li> Nice touch. I really enjoy using this products. Actually I recommend to people how have a dry skin touch. thx</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time - no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over two years already, and I love it. I can&#x27;t put my foundation on without putting this first.</li>
            <li> I use Primer&#x27;s in the past. I saw good reviews on this so I wanted to try it. It holds up to the price. For what you pay for it works but if you want a great look and hold it is better to send the money. For everyday it works okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn or even heard of a primer before but CoverGirl &amp; Olay have made me a fan.  This creamy solution glides on smoothly and immediately improves the appearance of my skin, making it look more luminous and even toned.  It smooths and helps to conceal small flaws but this isn&#x27;t an \\&quot;age repair\\&quot; serum, nor does it claim to be.  If you desire more dramatic results, you should look at other offerings in the Olay line but if you&#x27;re looking for a  lightweight, moisturizing serum to wear either under makeup or alone, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the skincare preparations that I have used were packaged in jars but I much prefer the applicator of Simply Ageless.  It&#x27;s neater, faster and a lot more sanitary to dispense exactly the amount that I want with a simple press of the pump without repeatedly dipping my fingers into the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product immensely and I&#x27;m delighted that I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with occassional break-outs. My skin also has a tendency to get pretty oily out here in this humid Texas heat so I always stick with light or mattifying primers/moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;This primer went on nice and smooth and dries to a kind of powdery feel. After awhile, however, my skin would start feeling oily and I don&#x27;t think it helped my make-up stay fresh/natural looking either. I ended up using it only at nighttime because I did like okay it as a moisturizer but not as a primer. This might be better for people who do not have issues with oily or break-out prone skin.</li>
            <li> As an over-forty woman, I have to admit that I&#x27;m looking for any product that can make this ole&#x27; pelt of mine look a little better. I have seen a rash of primer-type products lately and wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just another marketing gimmick, or if it was really a necessary step in my morning routine.    I tried the Simply Ageless Serum Primer and was pleased with the odor and consistency. It made my face look more \\&quot;matte\\&quot; and went on smooth and velvety. I don&#x27;t use foundation, but I did notice that my eyeshadow and blush lasted longer.     I think this product is actually a nice substitute for foundation and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I previously had purchased a much more expensive primer from a Nordstroms and I have to say this Covergirl Primer performs just as well at a fraction of the price.  It hides large poors and minimizes wrinkles just as well as the more expensive brand.  I will definatley be buying more of this primer when it runs out.  Although, a little goes a long way and the bottle is rather large so I anticipate that the Primer will last a while.</li>
            <li> Love it. No smell very soft and I like how my makeup looks when I use this compared to the other brand I was using. Will stick to this one from now on.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am 28, I have decent skin with out too many issues. I used to use DHC Velvet Skin and loved it, but ran out and was looking for something affordable at the moment. I am less than impressed with this, I continue to use it because I paid for it, but it really doesn&#x27;t do what it should and that is keep your makeup on and in place. It also makes your skin feel extremely oily and takes some work to find the right amount to keep that from happening. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, next time I will spend the extra money and get something much better.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get over the almost rubbery texture. It&#x27;s hard to really explain it, but my skin felt so weird after applying.  It also arrived with the lid off and leaking, so that was totally lame as well.  :(</li>
            <li> I still have to try it I bet I&#x27;ll like who&#x27;s it was a bigger size but thank you :)</li>
            <li> Really like this serum. It goes on silky and your skin feels very smooth. The price was cheaper than Walmart and I received the product in a timely manner. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I just turned 60 in March and  I am told I do not look it  and I want to keep it that way!!  I used  this product for 3 weeks now and have not seen any difference in my skin. It feels nice, goes on smoothly but then so does my moisturizer which I apply over the top of the Cover Girl/Olay Simply Ageless Serum Primer. I will continue to use it until it is empty and  update my review at that time. For now I am not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice a huge improvement in my fine lines, but I do like the scent and feel of \\&quot;Simply Ageless\\&quot;. My makeup does go on more evenly after the application, although not any more so than when I use other \\&quot;age-defying\\&quot; products.    I did notice that cyclomethicone and dimethicone are the third and fourth ingredients. Some women are fine with this and some women try to avoid the \\&quot;cones\\&quot;. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the cones so I will continue to use it. It works just as well as my more expensive products yet without the heavy scent.    If you are comfortable with using \\&quot;cones\\&quot; on your face this is a great cost saving alternative.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! It&#x27;s oil free, safe for sensitive skin ( which is an absolute must for me) comes in a convenient pump dispenser, I didn&#x27;t notice a scent to it, applies smoothly, makes my make up stay on longer, very moisturizing but nowhere near grease-ville. I would absolutely recommend this primer to try.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels soft and creamy, without being too oily.  It has very little scent as well, which is a huge bonus for me.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference in my skin, but my main purpose is preventative care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s with skin that still is prone to acne, so it&#x27;s important for me to use products that don&#x27;t contribute to the problem. That said, I can&#x27;t say for sure if this serum made my skin any worse in that sense... my skin is too tempermental for me to know for sure what contributes to a breakout day to day. But I do know that this felt light and didn&#x27;t feel at all greasy when I applied it. It didn&#x27;t take long to dry, and I liked the fact that I didn&#x27;t notice any particular smell (which always bothers me when it&#x27;s on my face!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish cosmetics companies would all drop parabens from their ingredients, but as of now, they&#x27;re still very common.</li>
            <li> Quite frankly I&#x27;d been spoiled.  DHC has a primer that makes your skin feel like satin, makes pores appear less visible and using the cover girl primer was a bit of a let down from that.  I really did not notice any difference in the appearance of my skin and the feel wasn&#x27;t much different than my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I never ever thought about getting a serum primer, until I kept seeing this advertized in magazines.  It seemed like it would just be another thing to have to keep buying.  Well, it&#x27;s worth it.  It goes on so well, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  It just feels good!  And it smells good--nothing perfumey.  While I&#x27;m not totally certain it makes foundation look better, I do know it makes my skin feel better--like hydrated. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this primer. It doesn&#x27;t feel super heavy like other primers do; rather it applies like a nice, velvety moisturizer but with a bit of perfecting effect. Of course my skin has large pores and a couple scars so aside from laser treatment or a chemical peel, I can&#x27;t expect perfection without going to a pro.   Other companies make primers that actually make the skin look more filled in and perfected I would say, but I don&#x27;t like the heaviness of those. This applies well, sinks in nicely and makes a nice foundation for, well, foundation. Again, it&#x27;s no miracle product, but I think it makes a little difference and doesn&#x27;t irritate my fussy skin. (It has no strong smell, either, which is another plus.) I wish it were a bit cheaper for a \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; brand, but if you shop around you can get it cheaper. (I just picked up my second bottle on sale at Kroger for $11.99, which is the best deal I&#x27;ve seen without a coupon.)</li>
            <li> Found CoverGirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Primer to be as advertised.  Use it daily.  Makes a good base for make up.</li>
            <li> Its a great primer and moisturizer. I use it everyday before I apply my makeup. Plus its from two of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for over a year and I love it more with each use. I use it as a mousturizer. It tightens up areas for me around the eyes and makes my skin feel so soft. It has a very light scent which is nice since some people have sensitivity to smells. I enjoy it. It it hard to find in Stores around my house but I order from amazon and it is actually slightly cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;This also makes a great base for foundation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sticking with my Roc anti aging primer. This stuff burned my eyes... Something a product has NEVER done to me and it didn&#x27;t even look like I put anything on. Didn&#x27;t like the results at all. And I was really excited to get this product.</li>
            <li> I may have been misled, but I was looking for a product to give me a foundation for my foundation? if you nknow what I mean.  My makeup just seems to stay on the surface of my skin and doesn&#x27;t cover any thing.  I have tried many different foundations so I thought maybe I needed a primer.  Well, this one is not it.  After using it every day for two weeks and getting angry every morning, I gave up on it. There was no difference if I used it or if I didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m still looking for a good primer.</li>
            <li> Leaves horrible greasy residue. I have normal skin and I felt like I had a film on my face all day.  This is a moisturizer not a primer..</li>
            <li> I have combination skin so some parts of my face is oily and some I would have dry patches. This primer tend to make my face oily but it&#x27;s still a good primer</li>
            <li> The latest fad for cosmetics is these \\&quot;primers\\&quot; you put on your skin beneath your makeup.  What it seems to do is moisturize the skin, making it a bit more pliable for the makeup application.      This is a white lotion that you smooth on your face when it&#x27;s clean, before doing make-up.    When women reach a certain age, foundation doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly anymore as the skin starts to behave more like paper than spandex. Drier, thinner skin on the face means it is harder to get it on smoothly. Instead of a smooth application, you get \\&quot;caking\\&quot; and areas where the make up looks blotchy.    This product helps the makeup look more even, especially on \\&quot;older\\&quot; skin, but I think any oil-free moisturizer would do that.  If you are too young for wrinkles. you probably don&#x27;t need this product.</li>
            <li> When makeup primers first hit the market, I wondered if we were witnessing the introduction of yet another gimmick from the beauty industry to entice us to spend more money. Conversely, I also wondered if they were onto something.  I grabbed the opportunity to review Simply Ageless Primer and satisfy my curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smooth out the skin, allowing makeup to be more easily applied.  However, lots of other products, when applied before makeup, do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product under [[ASIN:B0026P3GZS CoverGirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Foundation]].  I did not see that the primer caused any fine lines or wrinkles to be less apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply a moisturizing sunscreen under my foundation.  My weapon of choice has been [[ASIN:B000067BL6 Neutrogena Visibly Firm Face Lotion, Active Copper, SPF-20, 1.7-Ounce Bottle]], but sadly it seems to have been discontinued by the manufacturer.  The point here is that this moisturizer allowed my foundation to be applied just as smoothly and evenly as the primer did. (Both products contain a form of silicone called dimethicone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the primer does not have any sunscreening abilities, doesn&#x27;t work any better than a good-quality moisturizer for providing a smooth base under foundation, doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of moisturizing ingredients, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for the appearance of my skin, I just don&#x27;t see the point in using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s, have combination skin that is problem free 99% of the time. No wrinkles (yet), no acne, etc. I use a cleaner and moisturizer at night (sometimes I add astringent or toner if I feel oily), and just a moisturizer in the mornings. I&#x27;ve previously used primers by Smashbox and Avon and liked both, but used them more for special occasions and not on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This CoverGirl &amp; Olay primer says it can be used alone, over a moisturizer and under make-up. I tried it alone the first day and it worked OK, but it did not provide enough moisture and there is no SPF. Using it over a moisturizer felt a bit greasy to me, so the perfect combination was moisturizer with SPF, primer, then loose powder. I use minimal concealer and no foundation. The primer does give a smoother look and minimizes the appearance of pores in my opinion, so I&#x27;m happy with the overall effect. I&#x27;m not sure I will use it every day, but it&#x27;s a nice \\&quot;trick\\&quot; to have in my make up box for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the \\&quot;ageless\\&quot; claim goes...this primer is more anti-aging then age-reversing as other reviewers have stated as well. I think anti-aging claims are easier for companies to make since they are not promising any results right away and maybe, just maybe, you&#x27;ll have less wrinkles down the road if you use their product every day. I&#x27;m a big believer in a consistent skin routine - cleaning, toning, moisturizing - but I&#x27;m not sure I buy into all these additional products.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this product, and (since I&#x27;m the one writing the review) I tried it too with good result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should a man try a skin primer?  I sleep with a sleep-apnea machine that is in constant contact with areas around my nose.  The areas just below my eyes seem to take a beating and I often wake up with that area flushed, red, and sore.  Lotions haven&#x27;t helped, so I figured I&#x27;d take the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal experience (which does not include a great deal of serum primers) went like this:  The product is not oily or greasy, which was a pleasant surprise and a contrast to many lotions I&#x27;ve used.  It does not leave much in the way of detectable residue, so it doesn&#x27;t LOOK like lotion (or far worse, makeup!).  Very smooth application.  I have yet to break out in any way, pimples or otherwise, in the somewhat sensitive areas of application.  And I have to second the comment of a prior reviewer:  \\&quot;A little goes a long way.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All good, right?  Well, better yet, my sore red spots are a little better.  SOLD!  I like it!</li>
            <li> I broke out almost instantly from this product. Not just small bumps, whiteheads, you could visibly see how clogged my pores were. I took a break from it &amp; tried again to see if in fact it was the primer &amp; again, almost instantly I broke out. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I always use this. I usually purchase from amazon because I receive it conveniently at my door and quickly. Is a great product as a primer.</li>
            <li> You never really know if any of these things actually work. You hope that they do, and help somewhat. Serum is easy to apply, and the quality is there. It&#x27;s an individual decision.</li>
            <li> Love  this primer.  It&#x27;s very light and smoothing.  Helps to apply foundation evenly and feels light on your face all day.</li>
            <li> Color is white unlike some other primers that appear &amp;#34;clear.&amp;#34; Extremely light, easy to apply and spread across skin to cover more area. Feels great and has a very light, pleasant scent. Plus container makes it extra easy to use.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this in the regular drug stores anymore. It&#x27;s a perfect base. Not heavy or sticky &amp; helps keep your makeup nice throughout the day. Even the hot &amp; humid ones.</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing for makeup on young skin under 35. Its a waste of $$. Its foamy and is not silicone based, yet sinks into skin not providing any smooth surface for makeup to glide onto. What&#x27;s the point of using this? For that Ill just wear a better moisturizer and be done with it. CG, you suck.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I wait about 30 seconds before putting on my makeup.  I have tried expensive primers, and this works just as well.  Why pay the money if you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered it and I normally don&#x27;t order the same thing more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. Doesn&#x27;t make my face sweaty/dewy like some primers and lotions do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice primer and economically priced.  I like the feel of it on my skin, and it is a far better price than many of the primers I have used.</li>
            <li> Love this primer.  Absorbs quickly  and keeps makeup looking great.</li>
            <li> Feels so good on the skin....I LOVE trying new facial products!  I will continue to use Olay Simply Ageless Serum Primer......</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find this in my local stores anymore so I found it here and bought two! Like to wear under foundation for smoothness.  Love the feel, and no yucky smell</li>
            <li> This face primer works well, and does the work it&#x27;s meant for.</li>
            <li> This primer has a nice matte finish, which I love. My skin can occasionally get oily, and CG &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Serum Primer worked out wonderfully. It made my skin look and feel smoother, so that my foundation went on nicely and stayed that way all day. There is no noticable scent, which is a plus. I have absolutely no idea if this will do anything about being \\&quot;ageless,\\&quot; but it certainly did improve the appearance of my skin for now!</li>
            <li> I have routinely used primers before make-up.  Most are expensive &amp; have problems.  This one is quick to dry &amp; does not leave your skin feeling that you have too many layers of product on your face.  It is also considerably cheaper than most.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I&#x27;ve found is that it&#x27;s hard to find!  Some drug stores have it, most do not.  If you&#x27;re lucky, you might find it at Target.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be of a lighter texture, it does seem to cover well!  It would probably work best on young persons.</li>
            <li> A  lightweight, creamy formula to prep skin for foundation while moisturizing and hydrating. 30ml bottle with pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is white, light to the touch and goes on easily.  I don&#x27;t generally wear a foundation, however, I&#x27;ve been using the Covergirl serum underneath my day cream with good results.  My combination skin feels smooth and moisturized. Day cream goes on easily and makeup seems to last longer than without.  Overall, I felt the product wasn&#x27;t greasy and made my skin feel good all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted, however,  that if you&#x27;re at all concerned about a natural approach to skin care, some of the following list of ingredients might give pause: Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Glycerin, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Sodium Chloride, Titanium Dioxide, Diethylhexyl Carbonate Niacinamide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Acetyl Glucosamine, PEG/PPG 18/18 Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Allantoin, Methicone, PEG 10 Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ethylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide 4, PEG 100 Stearate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Palmitoyl Pentapeptide is an amino peptide, the age-defying ingredient in this serum and many other age-defying products.  It is a preventative application rather than a repair, suitable for still youthful skin types. Mature skin would benefit more from Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, Covergirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Serum Primer 100 is very good value since most serums of this type command considerably higher prices.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product and it felt very smooth. The scent, although subtle, didn&#x27;t trill me; it&#x27;s not natural. Also, I am used to serums being a clearish, thick liquid, but this is more like a regular face lotion, just a bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have marked it down by several stars because it has parabens (methylparaben, ethylparaben). These products should not be included in any beauty products as they have been linked to cancer. As a breast cancer survivor, I would not recommend this product to any women for this one issue! All of the Cover Girl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless products are considered moderately to highly hazardous (even developmental/reproductive toxicity) by the Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Environmental Working Group; you can check their database online for all sorts of other cosmetics you may be using.</li>
            <li> Love It ! Makes your skin so soft !</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and blended well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Seems almost like face sunscreen. Nice consistency. Does give foundation a little more staying power. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have the mica flakes a lot of primers have to give your skin a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. I am 30 and those sparkly flakes are not a good plan for my skin.</li>
            <li> A little greasier than I would have thought, but it does the job ok. Once it&#x27;s gone though, I&#x27;ll be going back to my Smashbox primer.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of &#x60;Serum Primer&#x27; before trying this. I am 37 years old and have always used a light weight oil free lotion as my preferred choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did not see listed with this product that was very important to me, is it is oil free! I did not see it listed on the page at all. It is listed on the bottle though. I will not use a product on my face unless it is oil free. I have combination skin and anything with oil makes my skin breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I did not think I would like this at first but it proved me wrong. I am used to applying a light weight lotion and with this you get the smallest, I mean almost nothing size dab of serum with each pump. I did not like that I had to apply such little product all over my face, it seems there was more facial contact as opposed to my regular lotion. Once it was applied it felt a bit heavy and made my face look greasy. However, it proved me wrong. I applied it after my astringent but before my foundation and sure enough it was not greasy or oily as I thought it would be. Each day I checked to make sure it was still not &#x60;shining&#x27; and my face still had a matte look to it. I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe some other reviewers stated they did not like that the bottle was not see through because you do not know when the serum is low. All you have to do is look at the bottom of the pump and there is an area that shows where the pump is at. Right now mine is showing about 80% full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this product. I probably would not have picked it up but now that I have tried it and it works I will only be using this in the future. A little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was a bit torn at first on whether I liked this product.  After using it on and off for nearly a month I have arrived at a \\&quot;middle of the road\\&quot; stance.     I think there is some merit in this product, but not perhaps as it is indicated.  It reduces fine lines the day after you use it and it does in fact tighten your skin and even minimizes pore appearance.   However I am not convinced that this product is any better than any of the other millions of \\&quot;age-defying\\&quot; products out there and I have tried a few.  In fact some of the points I mention make it prohibitive.    I&#x27;m 45 with oily olive skin, so maybe the product would work better on someone with drier, fairer skin.       Some Points:  -the product felt heavy and greasy compared to others of it&#x27;s kind.  I live in Fla and it is HOT and HUMID and the last thing you want is something that feels weighty on your skin.  Compared to a Clinique aging serum I used, this Cover Girl/Olay product just felt horrible.  -It actually worked like a good spot moisturizer for very dry skin, I think it worked better as that than as an age serum.   Mostly because of the heaviness I mentioned below. When used to treat overly dry spots, it did the trick better than almost anything else.   -I could never wear this under make up unless you waited several hours for it to dry.   Perhaps it&#x27;s the Fla climate but I felt like my skin was wet for hours after application.</li>
            <li> This is a PRIMER, it is supposed to minimize fine lines/pores and help your makeup stay on longer. I have normal/dry skin and use this after moisturizing and before my BB cream. It definitely helps to fill in the fine lines I have and makes everything else glide on very smoothly. It has almost no smell and a little goes a long way. I used to use another high end primer but this CoverGirl/Olay primer works just as well and is a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> why do they have to put parabens in products! As well there are some other harmful chemicals in this mixed with good for your skin ingredients. They even put talc in this. That said (and why only three stars), it doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy like many primers and doesn&#x27;t eat my makeup away (which occurs with some primers) and has a good texture and doesn&#x27;t cause creasing or bubbling. These are all very important things when choosing a primer. Although performance wise, the best I&#x27;ve tried in many ways, I most likely will not purchase this again due to the harmful ingredients. If CG and Olay took these out, I would absolutely love this product! About the products as well, it is white (not lavender in the lighting I use in my house) and has a funny smell (not good) that is very faint and dissipates quickly (it is extremely faint as well so not a deal breaker). It performs well, so it&#x27;s a shame there are parabens and a few other items that are not skin healthy (we find them in doctor&#x27;s prescriptions as well unfortunately).</li>
            <li> There is no color in this primer.  I use it with the Cover Girl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Foundation.</li>
            <li> The vendor was great the items were delivered on time packaging was good. The actual product isn&#x27;t that great it makes my face look cakey and white.</li>
            <li> Very nice, I really love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff on my face since it smooths my skin on this aging Grandma</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, this , after applied, flaked off.</li>
            <li> I generally use Olay serum on my face.  I&#x27;ve seen this combo of Cover Girl + Olay and decided to try it.  It goes on smoothy under makeup and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Made my skin oily and break out. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t make my skin look any better. Wish I could return it&#x27;s just sitting in a drawer.</li>
            <li> This works really well under makeup foundation.  I use it underneath Max Factor panstick, and it makes it easier to apply without streaks.</li>
            <li> This Serum Primer is a good base to use before applying your mineral makeups, etc. Not a concealer...just a base.</li>
            <li> This primer applies smoothly and leaves a silky skin for apply makeup.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of primers, some costing well over $50. I always come back to this one.  Applies smoothly, never sticky.  A favorite for my over-50 skin.</li>
            <li> The jury&#x27;s still out on this one as I have only used it once. It didn&#x27;t seem to do what it claim&#x27;s. I will give it a few more try&#x27;s before I make  a judgment.  I have very oily skin &amp; need a primer so my makeup stays on longer then a few short hour&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like putting a light-weight moisturizer on your face.  Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t have that strong odor like the rest of Covergirl/Olay face products.</li>
            <li> Love this primer. Helps my make up stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three years and I do not have one wrinkle on my face! My friends keep asking me \\&quot;How do you keep your face so smooth?\\&quot; This product really works. When you first put it on, you need to wait a few minutes for it to absorb. I have normal to dry skin, so this is not an issue for me, If you have oily skin it might not absorb well. It works great under my foundation, I use the Cover Girl Simply Ageless Foundation. If you are using a liquid foundation then this product might not work for you. I was paying too much money for the expensive department store products, only to discover this product works better and is priced well. My local store keeps selling out, so I&#x27;m glad to find it here on Amazon. Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> I was out of my regular primer and decided to give this a try as it&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper and I can get it at the drug store.  When I saw the word serum on the bottle, I assumed it would be a gel-based primer but it&#x27;s the same texture as too-greasy moisturizer.  I understand that primer is supposed to create sort of a canvas for foundation but this stuff didn&#x27;t sit on the skin like my usual primer but sinks in a bit and leaves a greasy film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and one of the claims on the bottle is that it&#x27;s \\&quot;suitable for sensitive skin, oil free.\\&quot;  I tried it several times to give it the benefit of the doubt since our skin may not react the same every time.  But it always made my skin itch under my foundation.  I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it may be okay for someone without sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it was easy to buy.and I received it in just a couple of days</li>
            <li> The stores in my area run out of this primer.  I use it under my makeup, everything goes on smoothly.  CoverGirl you have a stocking problem in the RGV.</li>
            <li> Thbis is a good product, the price is right and easy to use.  It looks very nice on the face.</li>
            <li> I have just used this product once and looks OK to me. I have a combination skin (oily and dry) and I was always looking for a oil free product, they say this is oil free but I can still feel my skin gets oily after some time(specially under eye area)also I didn&#x27;t feel my skin got smooth after I applied, but yes the make up does remain on face for a longer time. I will change my rating if I am satisfied in near future.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing when I didn&#x27;t use primer. I have used only one other brand, and this one is less expensive and so much better. It&#x27;s not shiny, oily, or greasy, and my powder mineral makeup goes on so much better. I can use less. My skin also feels great when I put this silky feeling primer on.</li>
            <li> This primer does not do the job. Does not attenuate the lines of the face or the pores, and my make up is gone at the end of the afternoon. I brought miracle blur cream from l&#x27;oreal by recommendation and I love it.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.  It does not act as a primer.  It, at best, provides very light coverage.</li>
            <li> Good price. There is no color to this (foundation of any kind makes me look ghostly--evens out the bit of naturally occurring color in my pale, Irish face), so I don&#x27;t know if it does anything more than moisturize, but it makes me feel as if I have done something good and smoothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for the serum. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. I put it on and was expecting it to absorb into my skin. Instead, it just sat on top of my skin making it super moist and sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels great after cleansing face, and it&#x27;s perfect for wearing under makeup.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> got this in the mail and was so excited! im disappointed though because Ive been using it for like two weeks and have had so many breakouts! ugh I guess I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> This is such  wonderful product to apply before you put on your foundation - makes your face look and feel so nice and smooth and I highly recommend to all women but particularly more mature women.  And so very small a price to pay for something this good!</li>
            <li> so far I like it.  makes my face shiny though.</li>
            <li> This is what I use for Moisturizer before putting on my makeup every day.  I will use this forever and I also have this coming to me on my subscriptions from AMAZON.  THANKS</li>
            <li> This is more like a lotion than a primer. It doesn&#x27;t leave a matte finish and it makes my skin look oily--opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Also, my foundation (liquid) seems to blend with it rather than sit on top of it, in such a way that my foundation looks blotchy and uneven. It&#x27;s like it thins the foundation out or something. I&#x27;m going back to Revlon Photofinish.</li>
            <li> ...of this product.  I really like this and I&#x27;m awful about moisturizing my face (I know, that&#x27;s bad!) , probably because I don&#x27;t like the feel of them. I wear this way more often though and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover. I sometimes use a tinted moisturizer first, then apply this, then makeup... or just this and then makeup.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.  I can mix with a bit of foundation if I want just a super light shade for everyday.  No skin irritation (I have sensitive skin so all cosmetics are potentially problematic).  Makes foundation or eye shadow go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> my wife has used covergirl and olay simply ageless serum primer for quite some time now and says it is a great product for her</li>
            <li> I use Perricone products big bucks,  but found this to be even better for my daytime under makeup moisture/primer. My skin really looked better after a couple of weeks. It is light not greasy, my makeup does not settle into lines, nor look blotchy. It seems to set my liquid makeup even in hot weather. Still use Perricone at night, but will be trying more of this line when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a primer and this does the trick for the money... I&#x27;m sure I could have spent more and maybe it would work better but I like the feel of this.  It goes on softly and smooth and feels great all day long.</li>
            <li> I would use this serum under my makeup. It worked out just fine. It would cover my pores and scars perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use it all the tme I go out .It works great and covers the wrinkles.This is the first time I have used&lt;br /&gt;this make . I have used Olay products for many years and it is great so when I saw cover girl with Olay&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it.No regretsit is great</li>
            <li> My mother loves it.  It glides on easily, does not irritate her skin, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Use every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this cause I needed a good foundation primer (one that goes over my lotion).  I usually buy Lancome but its $35 so i thought I&#x27;d try this one.  This one came out white like a lotion and left a greasy feeling on my face like a lotion.  I guess I&#x27;m used to the they clear smooth feeling that the Lancome primer leaves on your face that allows the foundation to glide over your face without your face being shiney.  Maybe other people like this but not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other primers, but this is one of my favorites! My face feels much smoother and looks healthier since I began using it.</li>
            <li> I like the silky way this feels going on. I normally haven&#x27;t used a primer, but am getting older and it does make a subtle difference around my eyes and with the look of my pores. I don&#x27;t think it helped my make-up stay on any longer than usual. Overall I liked it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wow what a product. My make make goes on much smoother. I feel and look much younger. They were not kidding when they advertised simple and ageless. I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Found this less expensive on Amazon than at drug stores (where btw it&#x27;s difficult to find.) Glides on flawlessly and makes application of my foundation super easy.</li>
            <li> It seemed Covergirl and Olay will be good brand combination but it didn&#x27;t really work me. The paraben in the product had already made me biased against it. It just sits on the skin and makes it slippery, the foundation doesn&#x27;t stay long.</li>
            <li> It was recommend by Ellen Degeneras and I believe it&#x27;s a good product and does the job.  I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A great base for your foundation. Mattifies and evens skin tone.</li>
            <li> If you are too young for wrinkles. you probably don&#x27;t need this product. Didn&#x27;t like the product very much, I thought it would had better results.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy like a lot of primer products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Have used other primers, one by Maybelline, which allowed me to go without additional make-up.  This is what I expected from Simply Ageless.  I appreciate the fact that it is formulated for sensitive skin, but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll purchase it again unless it is made in a tinted formulation.</li>
            <li> I use powder fondation and using this product make make up looks a lot better and fresh. I always suggest this to my friends</li>
            <li> This is a great light weight primer</li>
            <li> This primer evens skin tone and makes foundation go on smoothly.  What I like best is that it is greaseless and &amp;#34;sinks in&amp;#34; quickly.</li>
            <li> I use this for moisturizer around my eyes at night..it really does erase tiny lines around the eyes and reduces them on the forehead. I  use this under Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse Foundation when I wear foundation. It is gentle on the skin and truly helpful to your skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth cream--I used every night on my face.  I have lots of allergic reactions to lotions but this one has been fine for me since the first day it arrived.  Also fits in my carry-on ziplock for travel.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product previously but couldn&#x27;t seem to find it in my city.  When I did find it on Amazon, I ordered enough to last me for quite some time.  Works well, love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, love it.</li>
            <li> it works pretty good and cheaper than those high end primers!</li>
            <li> I love it. Seems to help make my wrinkles and lines less noticeable. Will order more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I really was surprised when this worked. My forehead lines are very noticeable and kind of deep, and they really almost looked like they went away.  Truly I was surprised!  I used foundation over it (CG smoothers) and it did make my face look smoother, but especially my forehead.  The only issue I have is after I used it I did get a couple of red bumps on my face, which I never have blemishes, so I attributed it to the primer (only reason for 4 stars, not 5).  Could be my face wasn&#x27;t used to it, who knows.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other primers that work much better (i.e. Wrinkle injection by Too Faced).  So it just sits on my counter mostly.  But I love primers.  Just gotta find one you love and stick with it.</li>
            <li> Love this primer for under makeup feels smooth and soft to my face, hard to find in store. you can&#x27;t go wrong when taking care of your face this is an awesome product</li>
            <li> Item was open everywhere all empty</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would make my make up more flawless looking but it kind of made my make up look kind of flakey.</li>
            <li> perfect for smoothing on your makeup base. gives a nice moist look</li>
            <li> I soooo love this primer it gives me that&#x27;s silky look when I apply it under my powder.&lt;br /&gt;I av purchased it twice and I will keep buying.&lt;br /&gt;its wonderful</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic primer. The inclusion of Olay in the product is pure genius, it leaves your skin feeling soft &amp; smooth and the primer makes a great base for applying your foundation &amp; makeup.</li>
            <li> First time using a primer - saw a recommendation in a beauty magazine. I am 60 and product helps provide a nice finish for older skin.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best drugstore primers that I have tried. It makes your makep last all day as well as sets a clear canvas for applying foundation. Will purchase again.</li>
