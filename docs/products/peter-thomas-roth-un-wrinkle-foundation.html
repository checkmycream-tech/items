            <li>I think it is a better product than similar ones I used from  Lanc√¥me, Dior and Chanel.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your face really good before bed or it will break you out, even if your skin is a little dry like mine.</li>

            <li>I find that this product does what it advertises, and I like the fact that there aren&#x27;t so many different shades to choose from as I feel that is more confusing.  </li>
            <li>I truly cannot tell I am wearing foundation,  even in boad daylight,  other than the fact that my skin looks very smooth and even-toned I have already gotten many compliments about how god my skin look, in just the few days i have started using it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I rarely if ever write product reviews but this one deserves one! I LOVE this foundation. I will start by saying I am 45, light to medium pretty even skin tone so I purchased the medium shade. I was also blessed with good genes and have always looked younger. I just bought my 2nd bottle which says a lot! I am a makeup junkie, if its out there I have tried it. I have been told more in the past month how beautiful and young I look more than ever!! People are shocked I have 22 year old twins. I do not use a powder over this, that is what was clogging my fine lines and pores. I have to look very closely to see my fine lines without smiling. I use my cleansing and moisturizing ritual, this foundation and cream blush, mascara and liner and I am out the door in record time! My face feels amazing, so light not heavy with makeup. I decided to write this when I received a note from my cousin whom I saw over the holiday weekend, she wrote, &amp;#34;,yesterday I kept staring at you amazed at how young and beautiful you look&amp;#34;. I do live a &amp;#34;relatively&amp;#34; clean life, but I owe a lot to this foundation as well! Buy it, you will not be disappointed. PLEASE do not discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> this make up is great for mature skin - looks natural and blends well - it is my new favorite brand</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the Un-Wrinkle Foundation by Peter Thomas Roth that I recently purchased, and I would definitely reorder this product. This product was actually recommended to me by an esthetician after I had tried other similar products.  I find that this product does what it advertises, and I like the fact that there aren&#x27;t so many different shades to choose from as I feel that is more confusing.  The shades of foundation that are offered are just right and would suit everyone&#x27;s skin who tries it.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more products by Peter Thomas Roth, and I would order again through Amazon.com as the product was delivered faster than I expected, and that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> There was some confusion between PTR Un-Wrinkle Foundation and PTR Make-up Less Un-Wrinkle Foundation. I was expecting the latter. I did not like the Un-Wrinkle Foundation for me. Too drying and cakey! Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize I had the wrong one until after I tried it and the vendor, Payless Beauty, would not accept an exchange for the correct product.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I have purchased this make-up.  I am over 60 years of age, and I do notice quite a difference in the look of my face.  I am used to purchasing expensive make-up, but so far I like the fact that with this foundation my forehead doesn&#x27;t get oily, and the make-up looks smooth all day into the evening.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product by watching a YouTube clip of a makeup artist applying it and saying it was his favorite.&lt;br /&gt;If an artist liked it, I thought it had to be good. The price isn&#x27;t cheap people, but it is so worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks flawless/not cakey, smooth/not fuzzy, and dewy/not matte.&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this foundation is you can layer it, because it is sorta like a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;My only critique is, I have a physically demanding job and sweat, after 4 hours at work the makeup starts sliding.&lt;br /&gt;Because it is like a tinted moisturizer, you can just dab on a little where you need it to touch it up.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried the light might be too light for my skin (read some other reviews), so I got the medium and looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;Once I have my first tan of the season, I know it will look even better. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go any lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I make sure I blend some into my neck, so the contrast isn&#x27;t so strong and obvious.&lt;br /&gt;You can apply it with your fingers (that is how the makeup artist in the video did it), but I like to use a makeup blender (a wet sponge).&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be repurchasing this item!</li>
            <li> This foundation is really top notch quality. It gives nice coverage but not thick or crack at all. My under eye skin is getting loose and it is easily look wrinkled with foundation but this one does not show it at all. I love it. I think it is a better product than similar ones I used from  Lanc√¥me, Dior and Chanel. You can&#x27;t go wrong with PeterThomasRoth.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle that I use . I love it because it is oil free has vitamin A, E and C . no perfumes since my skin is sensitive and acne prone. the color is good , not too light and not too dark. it lasts all day at work.</li>
            <li> I do like the coverage but it&#x27;s a little too oily for my skin. Going on in the morning seems okay but about an hour later it&#x27;s just too oily. I think if you have real dry skin it would work better.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding the perfect foundation for my crazy 51 yr old skin but this is it for me! Love it! Goes on great helps with smoothing and filling wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look so soft and creamy without actually adding color. It jus enhances my own.  It is immediate and lasting.  Maybe it&#x27;s a bit pricy, but you only need such a small amount that it will last a long time, so it&#x27;s worth every penny.  Now that summer is here I am going to purchase the next shade darker, though it disappears into you skin so well I may not need to.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful foundation, especially for dry skin.  Does not settle into fine lines and is not cakey.  I have tried many different types of foundation products and this is by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I like this foundation. It really doesn&#x27;t hide my wrinkles but it will cover any spots. Make sure you wash your face really good before bed or it will break you out, even if your skin is a little dry like mine. Overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I need this stuff to start my day off right !</li>
            <li> Very smooth application and my face looks flawless. This is a great product. I would recommend to a friend. Love the prices for PTR on Amazon.</li>
            <li> only foundaton I will use</li>
            <li> Way too expensive, not even sure it&#x27;s worth the money, but it is the foundation I use.</li>
            <li> I really like this make up. I have combination skin. My T zone is very oily. This foundation feels great on my skin. The T zone does not get oily and it is not dry and cakey.I think of my skin tone as being between light and medium. The medium shade works well with my skin tone. I am glad I chose it as the light looked too light.  I am a fan of Peter Thomas Roth products and this does not diasppoint.</li>
            <li> I love PTR products, but I hate foundation.  I have tried to avoid it for the last 25 years (I am 41), but my age spots finally caught up with me so I had to cave.  I tried many drugstore products (eg neutrogena), and some dept store products (eg cllinique) and all of them felt too heavy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the PTR unwrinkle line, so I decided to give this product a try - and I LOVE it!! I truly cannot tell I am wearing foundation,  even in boad daylight,  other than the fact that my skin looks very smooth and even-toned I have already gotten many compliments about how god my skin look, in just the few days i have started using it.  It is NOT cakey at all, and it is NOT oily at all.  It is the perfect consistency, and i cannot say enough good things about it. I wish I had discovered this product years ago!!</li>
            <li> I have used Un-wrinkle Foundation once and will not be using it again.  It makes every pore, wrinkle, crease on my face stand out.  These are the reasons that I switched to using powder instead of liquid foundations. I have learned my lesson - try before you buy!</li>
            <li> it was a great smooth transaction, was the product I was looking for. would purchase again from this sellar for the product.</li>
            <li> This leaves a natural glowing finish.  It&#x27;s not full coverage, but does leave my face with a natural, dewy glow.  I get a lot of compliments on my skin &amp; lack of wrinkles due to this makeup.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have advanced rosacea and it covers it moderately. I typically use DHC&#x27;s primer first, then Makeup Forever&#x27;s concealer on seriously red spots, then finish with an all over application of this foundation for a great finish.  Yes, it&#x27;s hot.  But what makeup isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> I loved this foundation - it didn&#x27;t sit in fine lines and wrinkles and the shade I chose worked perfectly for my skin tone.  Didn&#x27;t look fake at all or like a mask - it was the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup because of the dewy qualities, however, yes it is dewy but it is so orange! I bought the medium, I do not even think if I had a heavy tan I could use this product! Even a tan cannot hide the orange color! It is very long lasting if I could just find the right color! I like the dewy look this make up has, now for finding the right color, the choices are very limited!</li>
            <li> I purchased this foundation because I have used it in the past and I do like it - it works good.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the foundation not sure if I really like the color but goes on really nice and feels good on the skin</li>
            <li> covers nicely without feeling caked. and great protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> love how smooth it is in not heavy great coverage</li>
