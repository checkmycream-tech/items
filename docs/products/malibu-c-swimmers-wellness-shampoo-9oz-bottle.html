            <li>Has a great tropical scent</li>
            <li>Product is of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as Neutrogena anti-residue.</li>
            <li>Good to keep the chlorine from discoloring hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, too</li>

            <li>I love their shampoo for well water,so I would think this is also a good product for the appropriate issue.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and leaves hair feeling good.</li>
            <li>YOU HAVE TO BE SURE</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found to keep my hair from turning into straw with 4x/week deep water aerobics.</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans my hair nicely and has a fresh citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>I do feel it removes minerals and build up just fine.</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and very, very clean all day-no more greasy spots, even if I&#x27;m pressed for time and wash in a hurry!</li>
            <li>it has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not cheap, Malibu C is the best shampoo for swimmers who are looking to wash the chlorine out of their hair.  </li>
            <li>right sfter getting out of the pool and my hair is in much better shape.</li>
            <li>Removes the smell of chlorine and helps keep my kids hair super smooth and shiny after their weekly swim.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has brought my hair back to its normal brown color and taken all the reddish chemical staining out, and added incredible shine and softness-even my daughter noticed.</li>
            <li>Make sure you condition your hair very well after.  </li>
            <li>Always keeps my hair in good condition, even after swimming daily in chlorine pool!</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and doesn&#x27;t cling to the hair, the price isn&#x27;t bad-you can get this anywhere online for around $10-$12 for a 9 oz.</li>
            <li>Everything was as expected and love the product!</li>
            <li>It really works if you swim in a pool chlorinated to the tilt!</li>
            <li>My daughter swims about 3 times per week in a chlorinated pool and this shampoo leaves her hair soft, shiny and free of chlorine smell.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair shiney and fun to put your hands through, so soft!</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to chlorine and tend to have sneezing fits and congestion right after swimming.  </li>
            <li>There are larger sizes available as well.</li>
            <li>and I can really feel a difference in how my hair feels after using this.</li>
            <li>This worked very well to get rid of my 6yo daughter&#x27;s gummy post-swim hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much to get the job done (I generally keep a smaller bottle in my swim bag) and you can tell a very noticeable improvement in getting your hair to feel soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Able to remove chlorine/minerals from hard water.  </li>
            <li>I recommend using the Malibu C Swimmers Water Action Conditioner after the shampoo</li>
            <li>-this is really the only quibble I have about it.</li>
            <li>Great product for those with hard water, won&#x27;t let the minerals settle in and create dull, lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a decent shampoo, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s removing the yellow from my hair.</li>
            <li>I live in an area with heavily chlorinated water-even the filter on my shower wasn&#x27;t helping much-</li>
            <li>I recently moved to a new apt and my blonde hair turned green from hard water.</li>
            <li>I have been plagued in the past with sticky, greasy areas that simply would not rinse clean.</li>
            <li>In particular, even if I use Malibu, I notice a chemical \\&quot;chlorine\\&quot; smell when I sweat or get wet afterwards.  </li>

            <li> It can be a little rough on your hair and will take the color out of your hair.  Make sure you condition your hair very well after.  But that said, it&#x27;s the best at getting the chlorine out of your hair and out of your skin as well.  I use it also as a shower gel.  I am very sensitive to chlorine and tend to have sneezing fits and congestion right after swimming.  This is your best defense.</li>
            <li> Though it smells like blueberry bubble gum this stuff works great.YOU HAVE TO BE SURE THAT YOU FULLY LATHER DOWN TO THE ROOTS OF YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> I swim five times per week.  Even after using Malibu, I notice that my body (especially my hair) continues to smell like chlorine.  In particular, even if I use Malibu, I notice a chemical \\&quot;chlorine\\&quot; smell when I sweat or get wet afterwards.  The only thing that I have ever found that works for this problem is something called SwimSpray, which uses vitamin C.  They have a website at [...].</li>
            <li> I do water workouts, so my color treated hair was starting to turn green.  I started using this and the conditioner right sfter getting out of the pool and my hair is in much better shape.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for swimmers.</li>
            <li> Product is of good quality.  Meeting my hair needs.  Able to remove chlorine/minerals from hard water.  Smells clean and leaves hair feeling good.</li>
            <li> I exercise in the pool 3 days a week and my hair started to &#x27;gum&#x27; up, making it hard to pull a comb through.  My hairdresser recommended this shampoo.  I use it only on the days I swim and it has made a huge difference.  It took less than a week for my hair to return to its natural shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone doing water aerobics.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for chlorine from swimming pools or iron from well water....</li>
            <li> Works well for post-swimming</li>
            <li> I have used Malibu C Shampoo for several summers. Always keeps my hair in good condition, even after swimming daily in chlorine pool! Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product for those with hard water, won&#x27;t let the minerals settle in and create dull, lifeless hair.  I recommend using the Malibu C Swimmers Water Action Conditioner after the shampoo so minerals don&#x27;t settle in through rinsing.  Best with both used together.  It works!  Makes hair shiney and fun to put your hands through, so soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say because my problem was well water and not swimmers-however-I love their shampoo for well water,so I would think this is also a good product for the appropriate issue.</li>
            <li> I live in an area with heavily chlorinated water-even the filter on my shower wasn&#x27;t helping much-and then I tried this! I am so glad I did. This shampoo used to be known as Malibu 2000,but though the brand name has changed somewhat the quality has not. I have been plagued in the past with sticky, greasy areas that simply would not rinse clean. The chemicals in the water also discolored it, and even when washed every day, it hung limp and stringy by evening. This shampoo has brought my hair back to its normal brown color and taken all the reddish chemical staining out, and added incredible shine and softness-even my daughter noticed. My hair stays soft and very, very clean all day-no more greasy spots, even if I&#x27;m pressed for time and wash in a hurry!

The scent is mild and doesn&#x27;t cling to the hair, the price isn&#x27;t bad-you can get this anywhere online for around $10-$12 for a 9 oz. bottle. There are larger sizes available as well. No propylene glycol or parabens. It took about a week before I began to see significant results, but stick with it-you will be happy you did.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Neutrogena anti-residue.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  My daughter swims about 3 times per week in a chlorinated pool and this shampoo leaves her hair soft, shiny and free of chlorine smell.  She has been using it regularly for about 3 months now.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not cheap, Malibu C is the best shampoo for swimmers who are looking to wash the chlorine out of their hair.  You don&#x27;t need to use very much to get the job done (I generally keep a smaller bottle in my swim bag) and you can tell a very noticeable improvement in getting your hair to feel soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected and love the product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found to keep my hair from turning into straw with 4x/week deep water aerobics. It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up in my hair either.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to remove yellow build up on my hair due to well water and copper pipes.  I don&#x27;t think it has really worked to remove the yellow, but the discoloring is not getting worse, so maybe the shampoo is helping.  The shampoo cleans my hair nicely and has a fresh citrus smell.  Overall it&#x27;s a decent shampoo, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s removing the yellow from my hair.</li>

            <li> Good to keep the chlorine from discoloring hair.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo for my girls (they swim twice a week) and the pool destroys their hair!  This product does a great job removing the chemicals from their hari.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it neutralizes the chlorine smell from the swimming pool. I have had a problem with my hair turning green from swimming and when I use this, about twice or three times a week,  I never have a problem.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s vegan so there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals in it. Clean really well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling tough or dirty. Keeps my hair from being damaged after being in chlorine everyday</li>
            <li> Made my hair really dry and brittle feeling. Has a great tropical scent and I really wanted to love it. I do feel it removes minerals and build up just fine.</li>
            <li> This worked very well to get rid of my 6yo daughter&#x27;s gummy post-swim hair.</li>
            <li> If you do a lot of swimming this is the best shampoo to combat chlorine in pools - works great.</li>
