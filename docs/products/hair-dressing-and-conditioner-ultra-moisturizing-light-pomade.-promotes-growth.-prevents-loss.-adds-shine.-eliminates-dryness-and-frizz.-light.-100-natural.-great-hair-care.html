            <li> But the main secret they do not know is I have a medical condition known as \\&quot;scaly scalp\\&quot;, in laymen&#x27;s terms,</li>

            <li> I started to realize that this stuff is making my daughters hair look very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> This condition causes my scalp to peel, with large flakes visible everywhere, worse than dandruff.  </li>
            <li> When applying regularly, my scalp no longer peels; it remains moisturized, not greasy, clogged or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair, work outside often, and live in a cold, dry climate.  </li>
            <li> Very dry and made her curls look crunchy and shortend her hair length to tight dry curls that look like they want to break.  </li>

            <li> It is also comes in a small jar and after a week or 2 (if that) I can see this product  being gone (it may last longer for someone with shorter hair).    </li>
            <li> Whenever I use other dressings containing petroleum products and or mineral oil</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair that tries to frizz and tie itself into knotted snarls.</li>
            <li> This repeated procedure dried out my hair, causing extreme breakage.  </li>

            <li> Everyone longs to know my secret (which is your product).  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Vienna&#x27;s Hair Conditioner since 2000. I have long, thick curly hair that tries to frizz and tie itself into knotted snarls. I had tried all kinds of products on my hair in addition to regular after-shampoo conditioners, even oil products like ordinary baby oil. Nothing tamed my hair or stayed non-greasy until I found Vienna&#x27;s Hair Conditioner. It has seen me through summer sun in my outdoor job, regular coloring to cover the grey, and weekends out fishing in the sun and wind on our boat. One of the best things about Vienna&#x27;s Hair Conditioner is that it works without greasing up. Other products give me skin blemishes around my hair line from too much greasiness, but Vienna&#x27;s stays clean on my hair. Once you try Vienna&#x27;s Hair Conditioner, I know you&#x27;ll stay with it.I&#x27;ve loved it for eight years now!</li>
            <li> The product did leave my hair softer and shiny without looking overgreased and feeling heavy. I admit that initially the smell had me worried but when I applied the product, I noticed that the smell sort of disappated. Overall I would rate it above average but wouldn&#x27;t give it the \\&quot;it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ll every use again\\&quot; line.</li>
            <li> In the description, it says non-greasy.  What a joke.  It is totally greasy.  I would not recommend this to anyone unless you will be washing your hair right after you put it in!  It was a waste of my money.  Also, it does not smell good either.</li>
            <li> this stuff is a little pricey but a little of it goes a very long way, not greasy, smells good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a hair that tends to be really dry and tangled all the time. this left my hair too oily and the smell was too over powering. i had to store it in a refrigerator cos it melts at room temperature. i will not be purchasing this again</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars (even though I do not like it and it does nothing for my hair but make it dry and  very brittle, because it is supposed to be natural (otherwise I would have given it a 2).    However, not to be harsh but to offer my honest opinion and experience.  This product is totally greasy.  I have naturally curly hair (african american mixed with native american and white).   I was expecting this product to enhance my curls and add  shine and help promote growth as I read in other testimonials.  I placed in the palm of my hand and ran in through my hair and even tried to grease my scalp with it.  It is greasy. However, it is a light grease (not heavy) so it turns into an oil faste and it bleeds on to   my face and everywhere else my hair lays (pillows, walls, etc). Messy  It is also comes in a small jar and after a week or 2 (if that) I can see this product  being gone (it may last longer for someone with shorter hair).    After placing this in my hair for a few hours, my mother looked at my hair and say OH MY GOSH  what happened to your curly hair. In her words, she said my hair looked very dry, brittle, and like straw.  She said it looked like I had nappy hair and she had never seen my hair like that before.  She told  me whatever I put in my hair to never use it again.  Needless to say, I felt the same way hoping the effects would go away. I normally do not have to perm my hair  but I went ahead and permed it after seeing the condition of my hair after I put this on it.    The good side is that I think it is a good skin conditioner, for scalp, face, hands etc.   After putting it on and the grease leaking everywhere on my face and hands (they were very smooth)  but that is not what the product is for. So if you are looking for a product that is NON-greasy  (This is NOT IT).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s very light wieght &amp; i LOVE the way it smells! I&#x27;m also impressed at the fact that it&#x27;s all natural &amp; it absorbs quickly into your hair/scalp with no greasy build up. Leaves your hair very healthy looking &amp; very smooth! Very healthy for your hair! As long as she continues to make it..i&#x27;ll be buying!</li>
            <li> I started to realize that this stuff is making my daughters hair look very dry and brittle.  I don&#x27;t understand why, but it did.  It also looked like her hair was stunted. Almost as if it didn&#x27;t want to grow and shine anymore.  It was the weirdest thing, because i really wanted this stuff to work.  Especially becuz of that high price.  So I tryed it a couple of times and each time i was hating the way my daughters hair was starting to look.  Very dry and made her curls look crunchy and shortend her hair length to tight dry curls that look like they want to break.  But it does make the hair easier to comb, which is weird.  I dunno.  It didn&#x27;t work for me anymore.  This item is waaaay over priced for the things it DON&#x27;T do.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this hair product. It is by far the best I have ever used in my life. I live in a very dry appartment. My hair was paying a toll. I am a mixed woman with kinky hair. My hair is down to my lower back. I press it because It is a puffy mess when I wear it natural. HOWEVER when I use this product It builds a curl in my hair! Takes away all the frizz! Dosnt make my hair heavy. Or greasy. I use it on my pressed hair too. This stuff is amazing. I cant wait to see what it does for my problematic scalp and split ends!</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would meet my expectations. But, to my surprise it met all my expectations! This product delivers everything it says it would and more. I&#x27;ve read a lot of positive things about this product and I must say that everything I read is true. It makes my hair very healthy looking and well conditioned, without leaving my hair feeling greasy. I am African American, but I believe that this product would work well on ANY hair type. This product has 100% natural ingredients, no parabens, petroleum, alcohol, mineral oil, or any other harsh product. I noticed that when I flat iron my hair using this product, not only is it smooth and silky but the frizz is gone! A lot of people think that my hair is relaxed, but it&#x27;s not. I love the smell of this product, and a little goes a long way. I think it&#x27;s well worth the price! This product deserves five stars. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, work outside often, and live in a cold, dry climate.  This product has worked well to make my hair look and feel healthy again.  Great product from a great company.</li>
            <li> This product is sooo good it has made my hair grow and stop breaking off. I recommend this product to any body who&#x27;s hair is falling out or breaking off. This is A good product and the smell is great and it&#x27;s not too greasy and it works. The only thing is I wish they made A bigger jar, me and my family just can&#x27;t keep enough around the house.</li>
            <li> Aces!! Vienna&#x27;s Hair Dressing &amp; Conditioner is the perfect gift every Christmas (and any time of the year) for my family. Just like the very first time they ever received this product, their faces light up like it&#x27;s the very first time. We love Vienna&#x27;s Herbal Compounds and all they do for our continued good health, bodies and minds. Aunt Laura</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this hair dress it was light not heavy gave sheen and moisture to the hair. I would recommend this pomade for women of color that are looking for something to give their hair life and shine without that heavy weighed down feeling.</li>
            <li> Dear Vienna,     For years, I have been receiving countless compliments regarding my hair, \\&quot;how long and pretty it is, how healthy, light and shiny it is\\&quot;.  Everyone longs to know my secret (which is your product).  But the main secret they do not know is I have a medical condition known as \\&quot;scaly scalp\\&quot;, in laymen&#x27;s terms, \\&quot;Seborrhea/Seborrheic Dermatitis\\&quot;, in medical terms.    This condition causes my scalp to peel, with large flakes visible everywhere, worse than dandruff.  The doctor prescribed a medicated shampoo and moisturizer, which requires shampooing every 2-3 days. (Side Note: That is a lot of shampooing, drying and \\&quot;bumbing\\&quot; for a SISTA with relaxed hair).  This repeated procedure dried out my hair, causing extreme breakage.  But then, I discovered Vienna&#x27;s Hair Dressing and Conditioner!    I have been using this product for 7 or more years and it has been the main solution to my scaly scalp condition.  I no longer have to use the medication every 2-3 days, instead every 2-3 weeks (yes Lord).  When applying regularly, my scalp no longer peels; it remains moisturized, not greasy, clogged or heavy.  As a result, my hair is as healthy, light, and appealing to the eye as it has ever been.  Thank you Vienna for the solution to my hair and scalp care problems.  I know this testimonial sounds like a commercial, but it is much more than that; it is the truth!    Additionally, this product is great for all ages.  My grandmother and mother have been using this hair and scalp conditioner for as long as I have, and they experience the same wonderful results.  I also use this product on my 18 month-old cousin, keeping her scalp moisturized, and hair healthy, smooth and shiny.    S. Walker</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a hair dressing containing no petroleum products.  Because of this my hair is always soft and manageble.  Whenever I use other dressings containing petroleum products and or mineral oil my hair has always become hard and brittle.  Not so with your product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product a few months ago for my 8 yrs. old son who has a very dry scalp and I just started using Vienna a few weeks ago on my dry overprocessed hair and my hair looks much more healthier and alive. I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I have had the absolute pleasure of watching this all natural hand made product made first hand.  Each batch is consistently produced.  The aroma pleasantly lingers but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> so far I like this hair dress because of all the natural ingredients.The only thing that I dislike is that it is very watery and messy so I placed it in a bowl so that it would&#x27;nt grease up my dresser.I may have to place it in the refrigerator so that it can stiffen up. In a month or so I will see how well this product really works on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product was nothing like reviewed on Amazon. After using it the first time, my scalp was very irritated and instead of moisturizing my hair, it felt very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed this this pomade.</li>
