            <li>This keeps my curly hair from drying out and becoming frizz prone.</li>

            <li>The smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair incredibly silky - more than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Smells like cheap perfume.  </li>

            <li>Between washings I just rewet and blot with a towel and it looks better than right after washing.</li>
            <li>i love the smell, the texture, the fact that i dont need to use too much to hydrate my hair!</li>
            <li>I love it that much!</li>
            <li>loved this pproduct, if you have coarse curly hair</li>
            <li>and my hair is very curly and gets rowdy if I don&#x27;t apply the appropriate conditioner</li>
            <li>and I like to think it&#x27;s actually good for my hair, but if you don&#x27;t like having product left after your shower, you might try a lighter product.</li>
            <li>but it still looks good the next day when rewetted and restyled.</li>
            <li>Definitely would order again!Shiny, healthy hair!  </li>
            <li>I am always searching for the shampoo and conditioner that really works for my fine but wavy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is longish color treated (very blond) fine and curly with a lot of gray.</li>
            <li>It leaves my fine yet frizzy and curly hair soft, shiny, and smooth while still boosting curl.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair feels so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>worth the money..</li>
            <li>and I know this because my skin can be even more sensitive than hers, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem.</li>
            <li>Washes away clean, leaving my hair soft and light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice and much lighter than the cheap drug store conditioner I&#x27;d used for so long.</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally wavy/curly hair and this made it the texture of fried straw.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what its name is...</li>
            <li>This stuff is just great for curly thick hair.  </li>
            <li>this is usually my first step after wetting my scalp), brush it through, then do the rest of my shower ablutions before rinsing.</li>
            <li>Finally found my favorite products for my hair...</li>
            <li>Really works well on my curls!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first product review ever.</li>
            <li>One has to learn how much is just right.  </li>
            <li>it is so the first day after washing is not as good as the second or third day.</li>
            <li>It really does live up to its name!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feminine and I like it, so this is actually a positive for me, but if you don&#x27;t like fragrance then this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Curly hair is DRY hair and this makes it way more manageable for both of us.</li>
            <li>It still makes my hair feel and look easily 25 times healthier than it usually does, and it actually does a nice job of keeping the curls looking cute and relaxed throughout the day (while keeping them together enough not to</li>
            <li>Probably if you like really &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34; sauvignon blanc wines, you might like this.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is REALLY curly.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Davines conditioner.</li>
            <li>When I scrunched my hair, the sound was similar to running your fingers through hay.</li>
            <li>It has made a very noticeable difference in the softness of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The ingredient list on the product page is very misleading, perfume is not even listed.  </li>
            <li>After reading all of the reviews I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>When I wear it straight</li>
            <li>When I wear it straight</li>
            <li>I have better results with regular old Pantene than this.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many other products including the morrocan oil line...</li>
            <li>My hair feels conditioned and soft for the first day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have very curly fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Have used Loves for curly hair for years, the pink one, which is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I will be re purchasing and well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>The product had become thinned out and runny from sitting in my mail box, but cooled to a nice thick consistency.</li>
            <li>It is mild enough to use on my toddler who has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Left my curls soft, not greasy or weighed down and the next day just put a little product on my hands scrunched with water and was good to go love this product</li>
            <li>I live in AZ and during the day we are already in the one hundreds.</li>
            <li>I use the Love Shampoo and Conditioner and Defining Protein Sculpting Lotion then blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li>I use the love pink too but this stuff gives just enough grip to keep curls shape..</li>
            <li>I ordered Love conditioner since I had used it in the past..</li>
            <li>Leaves my curls feeling so soft!</li>
            <li>It also has kind of an off-putting chemical smell--it doesn&#x27;t linger once you&#x27;re out of the shower, but it&#x27;s not really pleasant while you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Curl Conscious and Tigi&#x27;s Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim and have been completely converted.</li>
            <li>She was buying it for nearly triple the price from her &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; salon.</li>
            <li>After conditioning my hair with this product, it made my hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and my almost two year old</li>
            <li>love the scent and that so little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My hair is now super soft but still has volume, the frizz is gone as long as I use a deffuser or let dry naturally.</li>
            <li>It never occurred to me to research the ingredients especially with the uniformly high ratings.</li>
            <li>Be careful and aware...</li>
            <li>As with all hair conditioners, less is better for hair not to be waited down.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft but not flat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li>minimal amount is needed, the jar makes it easy use too much &amp; waste it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommend this for my long curly natural hair.  </li>

            <li> It is mild enough to use on my toddler who has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Left my curls soft, not greasy or weighed down and the next day just put a little product on my hands scrunched with water and was good to go love this product</li>
            <li> I live in AZ and during the day we are already in the one hundreds.</li>
            <li> I use the Love Shampoo and Conditioner and Defining Protein Sculpting Lotion then blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use the love pink too but this stuff gives just enough grip to keep curls shape..</li>
            <li> I ordered Love conditioner since I had used it in the past..</li>
            <li> Leaves my curls feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> It also has kind of an off-putting chemical smell--it doesn&#x27;t linger once you&#x27;re out of the shower, but it&#x27;s not really pleasant while you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Curl Conscious and Tigi&#x27;s Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and have been completely converted.</li>
            <li> She was buying it for nearly triple the price from her &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; salon.</li>
            <li> After conditioning my hair with this product, it made my hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and my almost two year old</li>
            <li> love the scent and that so little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is now super soft but still has volume, the frizz is gone as long as I use a deffuser or let dry naturally.</li>
            <li> It never occurred to me to research the ingredients especially with the uniformly high ratings.</li>
            <li> Be careful and aware...</li>
            <li> As with all hair conditioners, less is better for hair not to be waited down.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft but not flat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li> minimal amount is needed, the jar makes it easy use too much &amp; waste it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommend this for my long curly natural hair.  </li>
            <li> this was recommended by my hairstyist after i expressed frustration with my long straight asian hair that has a slight wave</li>
            <li> but i feel it as the others products i use for less money, just normal</li>
            <li> I recently colored my hair with a demi-permanent that left my hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I take a long time rinsing and even sometimes I still feel like there&#x27;s some left.</li>
            <li> Kinda weird that nobody mentioned that this stuff smells strongly of grapefruit, so if you don&#x27;t like grapefruit, do not buy.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m going to go with the larger size, as I love the product and hate the container for the smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> However, because the parabens are listed at the very bottom of the ingredients list that means its a very, very small amount in the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It does condition well for dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> For me, a person who doesn&#x27;t like to spend money needlessly on things like shampoo, I can tell you this stuff is worth it, especially for the price you can find it for here.</li>
            <li> It was getting so brittle and frizzy and dry -- until I bought this stuff!</li>
            <li> I also like to alternate shampoos and conditioners for change and less of a buildup.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, which I also highlight so it can get very dry.</li>
            <li> If you already have any type of chemical treatment done to your hair using Davine&#x27;s conditioner could be too harsh or the last straw for your hair.</li>
            <li> Plus a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do not need any other products.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the paraben.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> All other products weigh my hair down or leave it sticky.</li>
            <li> its hard to open  </li>
            <li> it smells too sour or something; maybe I got one that was spoiled somehow?</li>
            <li> i was let down.</li>
            <li> it claims to be for curly hair and a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> So very confusing that both have the same name:Love????</li>
            <li> I started with just a quarter size blob on mid and bottom of my shoulder length thin hair and that worked well.  </li>
            <li> At the recommendation of my hairdresser, I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks of using this</li>
            <li> I kept trying it out of stubbornness since it&#x27;s so expensive, but I&#x27;m down to the last use or two</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m shocked at how much I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> terrific hair management product for dry thick curly stupid hair.</li>
            <li> My hair became hard to manage and brittle after use.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is silky and thick, and smells like a dream.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is thick and you can feel the moisture being brought to the hair as you are applying it.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you have curly, thick, unruly hair</li>
            <li> We rotate this with some other things but are sad to see it no longer on subscribe.</li>

            <li> only gripe is that the plastic jars are TERRIBLE.</li>

            <li> for cold (tahoe) and hot/humid  hawaii).</li>
            <li> The reason I tried this on her is the baby conditioners weren&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I know it is expensive, but if you hate your hair (or just get mad at it), and you need something that will revitalize and de-frizz your hair, go for it.</li>
            <li> I think the smell is unpleasant and it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> i hate the packaging though.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again--it smells too sour or something; maybe I got one that was spoiled somehow? Probably if you like really &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34; sauvignon blanc wines, you might like this. But to me, it smells like cat pee on a gooseberry bush. Also, the lip on the cap gathers water that never dries in my shower. When I go to pick it up, it dumps cold water on me. It does condition well for dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> loved this pproduct, if you have coarse curly hair this is the conditioner for you. Left my curls soft, not greasy or weighed down and the next day just put a little product on my hands scrunched with water and was good to go love this product</li>
            <li> love the scent and that so little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This keeps my curly hair from drying out and becoming frizz prone. Essential in a low humidity area. The fact that it smells wonderful doesn&#x27;t hurt, either.</li>
            <li> I love Davines products and this conditioner is great!  It leaves my fine yet frizzy and curly hair soft, shiny, and smooth while still boosting curl.  It also smells amazing and is cheaper on Amazon than at my salon.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommend this for my long curly natural hair.  Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair feels so soft and healthy.  It&#x27;s really nice and much lighter than the cheap drug store conditioner I&#x27;d used for so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6months and my hair is very curly and gets rowdy if I don&#x27;t apply the appropriate conditioner but this one is amazing! It does exactly what its name is...it Loves your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my hair feel and smells afterwards. A great buy!</li>
            <li> i love the smell, the texture, the fact that i dont need to use too much to hydrate my hair! i hate the packaging though. its hard to open  and i always get water in the container when i am in the shower</li>
            <li> This stuff is just great for curly thick hair.  It smells good, leaves hair moisturized and healthy looking.  Takes the frizz out but gives me nice bouncy curls. I&#x27;ve also used Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Curl Conscious and Tigi&#x27;s Curls Rock.  They&#x27;re pretty good but like Davines a bit better.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it smells wonderful and it does its job better than expected. It&#x27;s everthing it claims to be for curly hair and a little goes along way. Worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and have been completely converted. This conditioner is silky and thick, and smells like a dream. I put it in my hair (I only shampoo about once a week, so this is usually my first step after wetting my scalp), brush it through, then do the rest of my shower ablutions before rinsing. It makes my hair incredibly silky - more than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used. My husband has actually started petting my head while we&#x27;re watching t.v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things to know before you buy:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell is quite strong. It&#x27;s feminine and I like it, so this is actually a positive for me, but if you don&#x27;t like fragrance then this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s tough to get this out of your hair - I take a long time rinsing and even sometimes I still feel like there&#x27;s some left. Again, for me this doesn&#x27;t affect the way my hair looks and I like to think it&#x27;s actually good for my hair, but if you don&#x27;t like having product left after your shower, you might try a lighter product.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every product out their for my twins biracial curls. I finally found Davines a couple months back and I can finally say I have found the company that gets their type hair. Most of their products are well made, do what they say will do, smells wonderful, and NEVER leaves hair oily, dry, stinky, or build up. This conditioner is thick and you can feel the moisture being brought to the hair as you are applying it. I know one review said it was runny, I did not have that issue. I live in AZ and during the day we are already in the one hundreds. The product had become thinned out and runny from sitting in my mail box, but cooled to a nice thick consistency. It smells divine and works whether you heat it or not. Rinses easily as well. If you have curls this is the conditioner to use!!</li>
            <li> i was let down. didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> As with all hair conditioners, less is better for hair not to be waited down.  One has to learn how much is just right.  I started with just a quarter size blob on mid and bottom of my shoulder length thin hair and that worked well.  I also like to alternate shampoos and conditioners for change and less of a buildup.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! It really does live up to its name!!! It enhances my curls/waves. It makes my hair soft but not flat. Great product!</li>
            <li> I am a product junky. I am always searching for the shampoo and conditioner that really works for my fine but wavy hair. This is it. I found my match. I will be re purchasing and well worth the extra money. Finally found my favorite products for my hair...thank you thank you! My hair is now super soft but still has volume, the frizz is gone as long as I use a deffuser or let dry naturally. I do not need any other products. It smells good and a little goes a long way. Give it a try and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> A must to go with the shampoo!! Follow with the Davines oil.Makes hair feel so healthy and look shiny!!&lt;br /&gt;So worth the money..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My girlfriend turned me on to it. She was buying it for nearly triple the price from her &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; salon. Now, of course, we get it from Amazon. For me, a person who doesn&#x27;t like to spend money needlessly on things like shampoo, I can tell you this stuff is worth it, especially for the price you can find it for here.</li>
            <li> Really works well on my curls!  I receive many compliments in my hair!  Definitely would order again!Shiny, healthy hair!  Thanks! Debi D</li>
            <li> My hair is REALLY curly.  At the recommendation of my hairdresser, I use this everyday.  I shampoo my hair occasionally.  Most days I use this as if it were shampoo when I wash my hair.  This is a core hair treatment that has changed my hair in a great way.  I have used it in this way for about 5 years and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is MARVELOUS for my naturally curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore the grapefruity smell, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the plastic jars are TERRIBLE. They&#x27;re annoying to deal with in the shower and I find the edges sort of sharp / unpleasant on pruny fingertips. Next time I&#x27;m going to go with the larger size, as I love the product and hate the container for the smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> I really like this Davines conditioner. My hair feels conditioned and soft for the first day. However, the moisture doesn&#x27;t last into the second day. I have coarse and curly hair so I need more moisture that stays. I will buy this conditioner again but I switch between Davines and Color Proof during the week.</li>
            <li> I love Davines products (well, love smoothing and this one, anyway).  I actually ordered this by mistake (I was trying to get the Love, Smoothing conditioner), and was pretty upset at first, but this seems to be just as wonderful.  It still makes my hair feel and look easily 25 times healthier than it usually does, and it actually does a nice job of keeping the curls looking cute and relaxed throughout the day (while keeping them together enough not to frizz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I know it is expensive, but if you hate your hair (or just get mad at it), and you need something that will revitalize and de-frizz your hair, go for it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally wavy/curly hair and this made it the texture of fried straw.  I kept trying it out of stubbornness since it&#x27;s so expensive, but I&#x27;m down to the last use or two and I just have to give up and throw it out.  I have better results with regular old Pantene than this.  It also has kind of an off-putting chemical smell--it doesn&#x27;t linger once you&#x27;re out of the shower, but it&#x27;s not really pleasant while you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li> I ordered Love conditioner since I had used it in the past.. When I received it it said Love for curly,wavey, hair--mine is Love for harsh,frizzy hair. So very confusing that both have the same name:Love????</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner. I love the way it feels, the way my curls are and the smell is heavenly. It is my one and only!</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for  curly hair. I use the love pink too but this stuff gives just enough grip to keep curls shape..</li>
            <li> I recently colored my hair with a demi-permanent that left my hair extremely dry. When I scrunched my hair, the sound was similar to running your fingers through hay. After conditioning my hair with this product, it made my hair incredibly soft. My only concern was the various forms of paraben listed in the ingredients list. However, because the parabens are listed at the very bottom of the ingredients list that means its a very, very small amount in the conditioner. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the paraben.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has made a very noticeable difference in the softness of my hair.  My hair actually bounces again!  It was getting so brittle and frizzy and dry -- until I bought this stuff!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this conditioner.</li>
            <li> this was recommended by my hairstyist after i expressed frustration with my long straight asian hair that has a slight wave but when short, will frizz &amp; fro.&lt;br /&gt;great for cold (tahoe) and hot/humid  hawaii). minimal amount is needed, the jar makes it easy use too much &amp; waste it.</li>
            <li> We do like this and might continue to buy it. The subscribe and save was nice. I have curly hair and my almost two year old does too. Curly hair is DRY hair and this makes it way more manageable for both of us. It is mild enough to use on my toddler who has sensitive skin and I know this because my skin can be even more sensitive than hers, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem. The reason I tried this on her is the baby conditioners weren&#x27;t cutting it. She looked like a puffball. A few weeks of using this and she has glorious curls now. We rotate this with some other things but are sad to see it no longer on subscribe.</li>
            <li> Worst thing I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair. Smells like cheap perfume.  Have used Loves for curly hair for years, the pink one, which is fabulous.  Used this once and have to return. Cannot stand the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and all Davines products. Good prices here.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing!  I have medium length, thick hair. It only takes a dab of this wonderful conditioner to cover every strand.  Washes away clean, leaving my hair soft and light.  Best part is, I can brush my hair directly after washing! no additional detangler needed!  The smell is fresh and pleasant.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  Good value for money, smells great, like it better than the one recommended for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Love by Davines. It smells wonderful and it keeps your hair conditioned not greased. I have very curly fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. You can not go wrong with this product. Wait until you smell it- You will Love it Bigtime!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this conditioner! Best I have ever used! I have curly hair, which I also highlight so it can get very dry. This conditioner is amazing! A little goes a very long way. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and smelling great! I was even able stop using my frizzease once I started using this. I highly recommend this for curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li> terrific hair management product for dry thick curly stupid hair.</li>
            <li> This product contains a very strong perfume that makes it unusable in my opinion.  The ingredient list on the product page is very misleading, perfume is not even listed.  Perfume is listed on the actual product label but you don&#x27;t know this until you receive it.</li>
            <li> Nuf said. If you have curly, thick, unruly hair this conditioner is for you!! Been using it for 5 years now. Have tried many other products including the morrocan oil line...this is the bomb!! Hope they never stop making it! This is my first product review ever. I love it that much!</li>
            <li> Leaves my curls feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I think the smell is unpleasant and it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair.  I&#x27;ve had much better results with $5 conditioner.  After reading all of the reviews I really wanted to like this product and I&#x27;m shocked at how much I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything out there and this is the only stuff that works for me! I have naturally curly, fine, thin hair. All other products weigh my hair down or leave it sticky. My hair curls better the dirtier it is so the first day after washing is not as good as the second or third day. I use the Love Shampoo and Conditioner and scrunch in Momo Serum and then finish with No. 9 Structuring Mist for Wizards. Between washings I just rewet and blot with a towel and it looks better than right after washing. When I wear it straight I use the Love Shampoo and Conditioner and Defining Protein Sculpting Lotion then blow dry and flat iron. When I wear it straight I wash it more often but it still looks good the next day when rewetted and restyled. Either way my hair is smooth and hydrated without any sticky residue.  Plus a little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> One of them is lye. If you already have any type of chemical treatment done to your hair using Davine&#x27;s conditioner could be too harsh or the last straw for your hair. It never occurred to me to research the ingredients especially with the uniformly high ratings. My hair became hard to manage and brittle after use. Be careful and aware...Virgin hair might not have the same issues.</li>
            <li> I love all Davines products. My hair is longish color treated (very blond) fine and curly with a lot of gray. This ones great for me.</li>
            <li> it help my hair to be soft while its wet and i comb it but i feel it as the others products i use for less money, just normal, i thought it will make a difference defining the curls, i will give it more time to see if my hair change for better.</li>
            <li> Kinda weird that nobody mentioned that this stuff smells strongly of grapefruit, so if you don&#x27;t like grapefruit, do not buy.</li>
