    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I found this listed on the Skindeep EWG site as a non-toxic hairspray and was happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great scent.</li>
            <li>This item smells really great and might make a good Dessert Topping or maybe a Cologne</li>
            <li>Hold is good.</li>
            <li>When it dries, however, it holds surprisingly quite well.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>And it is very strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>It has provided great all day hold for fly aways and simple styles.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray</li>
            <li>It is a nice, light hairspray with no nasty chemicals or offensive smells.</li>
            <li>Smells okay.  </li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>I love the rest of Mari&#x27;s products though.</li>
            <li>This hairspray held well, but severely damaged my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a light smell that disappears once it dries.</li>
            <li>It feels much nicer on my scalp and knowing it has better ingredients makes me feel better about putting it on my head.</li>
            <li>But it is a good natural hairspray.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to give the spray about ten minutes drying time, &amp; you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>- this hair spray gives a very firm hold, perfect for ladies like me who have baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It holds very well in wind and humidity yet combs out easily.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t do heavy applications with it, but I am happy.</li>
            <li>The hold is fine, but it smells like natural insect repellant to me.</li>
            <li>Works great once dried!!</li>
            <li>It was ok but it made my hair go flat.</li>
            <li>My first review was on how it worked very well on long, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Really like this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I would use it in places that you really want some hold.  </li>
            <li>Really wets hair when applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, it just smells like a cheap, little kid&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>If you use to much hair gets wet as no denat alcohol to evaporate quick.</li>
            <li>An organic hair spray that really holds my fine hair without weighing it down!</li>
            <li>Keeps hair in place and smells natural.</li>
            <li>However, it is such a strong scent that I had to take my rating down 2 stars.</li>
            <li>was acceptable hairspray but not a strong enough hold to last more than a couple hours</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was expecting a hair spray that wouldn&#x27;t hold up to the slightest breeze &amp; figured I&#x27;d have to get used to it, as I&#x27;m tired of breathing in the chemicals used in regular hair sprays.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll do a few pumps, finish getting ready and then come back to it and do a few more.</li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes for a light spraying to dry</li>
            <li>Decent hair spray but goes on to wet and</li>
            <li>Very slight fragrance when you first spritz it on but</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a firm hold.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the Vodka really dried out my hair badly.  </li>

            <li> Finally!  An organic hair spray that really holds my fine hair without weighing it down!</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray</li>
            <li> Works great.  Keeps hair in place and smells natural.</li>
            <li> The hold is fine, but it smells like natural insect repellant to me. I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell and had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li> I replaced my animal tested hairsprays with this and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! It is a little wet, like the other reviews say, but no more than the Treseme  hairspray I have used in the past. It has a light smell that disappears once it dries. It holds all day (I don&#x27;t do any crazy updos, just ponytails and buns mostly). Overall this product has my repeat business!</li>
            <li> This item smells really great and might make a good Dessert Topping or maybe a Cologne but as a Hair Spray?  Nope, not at all.</li>
            <li> Really like this hairspray.  It holds very well in wind and humidity yet combs out easily.  Very slight fragrance when you first spritz it on but quickly&lt;br /&gt;disappears in seconds.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The product works well and I do appreciate that it is organic. It feels much nicer on my scalp and knowing it has better ingredients makes me feel better about putting it on my head. However, it is such a strong scent that I had to take my rating down 2 stars. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, it just smells like a cheap, little kid&#x27;s perfume. And it is very strong and overpowering. They should just leave out any scent in the product and it would be a total winner.</li>
            <li> I am editing my initial review from 5 stars to 3 .  My first review was on how it worked very well on long, fine hair.  After using it for a few months, I was not happy with it as it was very sticky, heavy and I could not comb through my hair at all.  I also think it was a reason for my hair breaking off at mid length if I did.  I would use it in places that you really want some hold.  I won&#x27;t repurchase this.  I have since moved on to Shear Miracle.</li>
            <li> This hairspray held well, but severely damaged my fine hair.  There was lots of breakage while trying to comb my hair out.</li>
            <li> Stopped my itching from regular spays. Hold is good. If you use to much hair gets wet as no denat alcohol to evaporate quick.</li>
            <li> I found this listed on the Skindeep EWG site as a non-toxic hairspray and was happy to find it here on Amazon. It is a nice, light hairspray with no nasty chemicals or offensive smells. It takes a few minutes for a light spraying to dry so you can&#x27;t do heavy applications with it, but I am happy. It has provided great all day hold for fly aways and simple styles. Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, I hope this review is helpful!</li>
            <li> was acceptable hairspray but not a strong enough hold to last more than a couple hours</li>
            <li> Great scent. Really wets hair when applied. Doesn&#x27;t have a firm hold.</li>
            <li> A little over priced. But it is a good natural hairspray. Works great once dried!!</li>
            <li> It was ok but it made my hair go flat.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was expecting a hair spray that wouldn&#x27;t hold up to the slightest breeze &amp; figured I&#x27;d have to get used to it, as I&#x27;m tired of breathing in the chemicals used in regular hair sprays.  I was wrong - this hair spray gives a very firm hold, perfect for ladies like me who have baby fine hair.  Just make sure to give the spray about ten minutes drying time, &amp; you&#x27;re good to go.  No need to spray your hair to death, either, due to the firmness of the hold.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Smells okay.  Holds okay, but unfortunately the Vodka really dried out my hair badly.  It takes quite a while to dry completely and then still felt a little tacky. I returned this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. It does spray on fairly wet so I&#x27;ll do a few pumps, finish getting ready and then come back to it and do a few more. When it dries, however, it holds surprisingly quite well.</li>
            <li> Decent hair spray but goes on to wet and not enough hold. I love the rest of Mari&#x27;s products though.</li>
