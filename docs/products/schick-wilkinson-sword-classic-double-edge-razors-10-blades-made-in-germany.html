            <li>however gave me an excellent shave</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great blade!.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d like to point out that you can get some excellent deals on blades both in the sample packs and also thru Amazon on the Wilkerson blades.  </li>
            <li>For the price these are an excellent value.</li>
            <li>My husband believes these are the best razor blades for shaving his face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find that perfect blade.</li>
            <li>and I think I just found that perfect blade for me.</li>
            <li>These blades are an excellent buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By comparison, I used PolSilver blades and they are very good and cause no problems to my skin.</li>
            <li>A very good blade.</li>
            <li>These blades are great.</li>
            <li>great value and service</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune for overpriced multi blade refills and want a good close shave.</li>
            <li>But to be fair I must admit that the Derby gave me a smoother shave</li>
            <li>Barbasol Aloe is also good tho</li>
            <li>good shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>the Gillette Foamy in the can is the best choice both to lather up and to help get the beard off and quickly too tho</li>
            <li>These are excellent blades and have just the right feel when shaving.</li>
            <li>it seems to me that the Gillette Foamy seems to give you a closer and smoother shave and the scent is rather nice as well.....  </li>
            <li>Prorasso is clearly the best as it will give you the closest shave</li>
            <li>these blades gives the user  a good clean shave without nicking the skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure there are many out there that understand the difference.  </li>
            <li>so the Gillette foam and the Wilkerson Blades are the best obtainable locally...  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>Fantastic blade , very fast delivery &amp; great customer service.</li>
            <li>I receive a clean shave each time.</li>
            <li>in a test between several different blades together with shaving creames I can honestly say that these German made &#x27;Wilkerson blades&#x27; are the best.  </li>
            <li>but I can only speak from my own experiences and</li>
            <li>but it left more stubble behind so that tells me it doesn&#x27;t cut as good, Or rather that the Wilkerson blade is the sharper blade tho the Derby gave me a &#x27;good shave&#x27; The Wilkerson blade</li>
            <li>so be careful in using it as a good shave creme or soap</li>
            <li>, I think you&#x27;ll find em worth your while.....  </li>
            <li>I take my DE razor apart after each shave and clean the blade , then I put a dab of pure glycerin on the blade to prevent the blade from rusting.</li>
            <li>Good sharp blades.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as, say, Feather or Derby -- but I like them a lot, and they cost less.</li>
            <li>But as to removing your beard closer and getting your face &#x27;baby smooth&#x27; barbershop style then the Wilkerson blade was better hands down.  </li>
            <li>The wilkinson sword holds its edge just as good, if not better than the majority of brands out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price good and a product that is hard to find</li>
            <li>and I think there the real deal as with all the Post Office closings and stuff</li>
            <li>really helps here and in-</li>
            <li>Also, the blades shipped fast to my home.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the swords.</li>
            <li>But if your beard is tough, Or your on a tight schedule and have to shave a bit   quicker than the Wilkerson is the best choice as it will get the beard off.  </li>
            <li>Performed pretty much as have the other blades I have been trying.</li>
            <li>My Advise:  If your face is soft, Or sensitive stay with the Derby</li>
            <li>even though I&#x27;ll continue to buy my usual, these worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Pretty sharp!</li>
            <li>Sharp enough to give me a smooth shave but not to sharp to butcher my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d allow a little extra time to do the job right.  </li>
            <li>These work well and are quite sharp; when I use them properly they shave very closely and don&#x27;t nick and cut.</li>

            <li> I only needed a few and these were the only ones here not sold in bulk.</li>
            <li> Ordered these while traveling in a remote area.</li>
            <li> that I bought off of here and they shave you close, have very little irritation and can be bought at your local grocery store for $1.19.</li>
            <li> The Wilkerson is a &#x27;sharp blade&#x27;</li>
            <li> They are sharp but do not nick my face.</li>
            <li> Seemed to stay sharp longer than my Feathers?</li>
            <li> Very rough shave, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I still use Merkur Platinum&#x27;s sometimes, but these are sharper, and seem to give me less skin irritation.</li>
            <li> If you have a tight schuedle to keep then</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should return them to amazon, or try to sell them to someone on ebay.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Feather, tried these,</li>
            <li> Yes it is sharp, but it caused me terrible skin irritation and redness that no other blade had done.</li>
            <li> So if your not happy with the blades your using I&#x27;d buy a pack of these and give them a try.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t the &#x27;ultra thin&#x27; blades I remembered.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to safety razor shaving, but this blade is awful.</li>
            <li> So I did not order these from this seller, but bought them in store, and they are by far the worst blades i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> They gave me terrible irritation and cut me multiple times.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, you couldn&#x27;t cut your finger with it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its the coating on the blade, or the metal itself that its made of but its so bad</li>
            <li> I hate to throw them out</li>

            <li> These blades are great. I use them with my[[ASIN:B003YJ70NY Feather Double-Edge Razor]] that I bought off of here and they shave you close, have very little irritation and can be bought at your local grocery store for $1.19. I would recommend these for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune for overpriced multi blade refills and want a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Yes I know that some don&#x27;t like them but I can only speak from my own experiences and in a test between several different blades together with shaving creames I can honestly say that these German made &#x27;Wilkerson blades&#x27; are the best.  Now yesterday I tried a Derby blade with the same shave creme, Same razor (a Weishi) and the same pressure and angle and it was close to being a draw.....  But as to removing your beard closer and getting your face &#x27;baby smooth&#x27; barbershop style then the Wilkerson blade was better hands down.  But to be fair I must admit that the Derby gave me a smoother shave but it left more stubble behind so that tells me it doesn&#x27;t cut as good, Or rather that the Wilkerson blade is the sharper blade tho the Derby gave me a &#x27;good shave&#x27; The Wilkerson blade however gave me an excellent shave and I&#x27;m sure there are many out there that understand the difference.  My Advise:  If your face is soft, Or sensitive stay with the Derby it&#x27;s a great blade!.  But if your beard is tough, Or your on a tight schedule and have to shave a bit   quicker than the Wilkerson is the best choice as it will get the beard off.  On Shave Cremes:  Prorasso is clearly the best as it will give you the closest shave but it takes time to put on and to shave with it properly.  If you have a tight schuedle to keep then the Gillette Foamy in the can is the best choice both to lather up and to help get the beard off and quickly too tho Barbasol Aloe is also good tho it seems to me that the Gillette Foamy seems to give you a closer and smoother shave and the scent is rather nice as well.....  Now I bought the Wilkerson Blades here in town at the Local Wal Mart for a buck.67 and I think there the real deal as with all the Post Office closings and stuff I felt it safer to try and use supplies that i could get locally so the Gillette foam and the Wilkerson Blades are the best obtainable locally...  But I&#x27;d like to point out that you can get some excellent deals on blades both in the sample packs and also thru Amazon on the Wilkerson blades.  So if your not happy with the blades your using I&#x27;d buy a pack of these and give them a try.  Last Tip:  The Wilkerson is a &#x27;sharp blade&#x27; so be careful in using it as a good shave creme or soap really helps here and in-till you get used to this blade I&#x27;d allow a little extra time to do the job right.  Still buy a pack and try em, I think you&#x27;ll find em worth your while.....  Indiana Ed</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as, say, Feather or Derby -- but I like them a lot, and they cost less. For the price these are an excellent value.</li>
            <li> So I did not order these from this seller, but bought them in store, and they are by far the worst blades i&#x27;ve ever used. They gave me terrible irritation and cut me multiple times. I would NOT recommend them</li>
            <li> These are excellent blades and have just the right feel when shaving. They are sharp but do not nick my face.</li>
            <li> My husband believes these are the best razor blades for shaving his face.</li>
            <li> Delivery on time and razors on point eevery time.</li>
            <li> Good sharp blades. I still use Merkur Platinum&#x27;s sometimes, but these are sharper, and seem to give me less skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to safety razor shaving, but this blade is awful. Yes it is sharp, but it caused me terrible skin irritation and redness that no other blade had done. I don&#x27;t know if its the coating on the blade, or the metal itself that its made of but its so bad I can&#x27;t use the rest of them. Not sure if I should return them to amazon, or try to sell them to someone on ebay. I hate to throw them out but there is no way i&#x27;ll use them on my face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison, I used PolSilver blades and they are very good and cause no problems to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with the quality of the blades. I receive a clean shave each time.</li>
            <li> Ordered these while traveling in a remote area. (They confiscated my Feathers at the airport). I only needed a few and these were the only ones here not sold in bulk. Surprisingly pleased with the quality. Seemed to stay sharp longer than my Feathers? Maybe my imagination.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Feather, tried these, even though I&#x27;ll continue to buy my usual, these worked just fine. A very good blade.</li>
            <li> great value and service</li>
            <li> No problems with any part of it.&lt;br /&gt;Timing and quality as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price good and a product that is hard to find</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, you couldn&#x27;t cut your finger with it.  Very rough shave, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These work well and are quite sharp; when I use them properly they shave very closely and don&#x27;t nick and cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find that perfect blade. I&#x27;ve tried several and I think I just found that perfect blade for me. Sharp enough to give me a smooth shave but not to sharp to butcher my face. I take my DE razor apart after each shave and clean the blade , then I put a dab of pure glycerin on the blade to prevent the blade from rusting. I&#x27;ve been getting approx 7-9 good shaves per blade. Fantastic blade , very fast delivery &amp; great customer service.</li>
            <li> These blades are an excellent buy. I ve purchased several sampler packs before and really only rely on two brands out of the twenty or so i tried. The wilkinson sword holds its edge just as good, if not better than the majority of brands out there. I highly recommend the swords.</li>
            <li> these blades gives the user  a good clean shave without nicking the skin. Also, the blades shipped fast to my home. I would definitely recommend these blades and this seller.</li>
            <li> Pretty sharp! You can get about two to three shaves per blade</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t the &#x27;ultra thin&#x27; blades I remembered. Performed pretty much as have the other blades I have been trying.</li>
