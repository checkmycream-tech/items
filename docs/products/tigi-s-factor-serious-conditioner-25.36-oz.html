            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product!!</li>
            <li>When I went to the salon, even my hairstylist was impressed.</li>
            <li>It is the best conditioner I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li>Seems like it&#x27;s working the best for curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Wonderful and is everything anyone says of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of conditioner products and this is the best!  </li>

            <li>Would happily purchase again</li>
            <li>Works great on damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>the amazing scooper hat comes along with it as well!</li>
            <li>Additionally, the smell of the conditioner might be \\&quot;off\\&quot; because instead of it smelling pleasant, it smelled almost medicinal.  </li>
            <li>I loved using the conditioner</li>
            <li>and I really loved applying it with</li>
            <li>I have nothing but great things to say about this conditioner filled with great oils.  </li>
            <li>The seller was great and the order arrived quickly!!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this conditioner!!!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this hair conditioner!</li>
            <li>I could not believe how beautiful my hair was looking, shiny, not frizzy smooth.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>When using s factor my hair looked sooo amazing.</li>
            <li>When you put it in it has a nice tingling feeling &amp;</li>
            <li>It smells good and it&#x27;s huge, so you can get a lot out of it.</li>
            <li>I have natural curley hair and this has been the best conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner provided me with an amazingly silky smooth feel!</li>
            <li>I love love love love this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll soak in more with the heat.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Use it and you will see the difference :-)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Very rich.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it still seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, just about twice a week and my hair feels smooth.</li>
            <li>Then I rinse it with cool water.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner should be cotton candy pink and have a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>When I rinse my hair out and style it, it feels sooooo soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>It genuinely rejuvenates your hair and makes it feel super soft.</li>
            <li>I use it once or twice  a week, leave it on for 2-3 minutes, comb through and my hair is ridiculously soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and easy to run a comb through.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product when one of my friends brought it over.</li>
            <li>My hair actually has more bounce to it afterwards.</li>
            <li>First time I tried at the hair salon.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product, my hair is markedly improved since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair a light ash blonde every 4 weeks or so</li>
            <li>I used shampoo, deep conditioner and silky smooth serum</li>
            <li>I have very processed hair and this stuff on it</li>
            <li>The large  jar of S-Factor conditioner that I purchased from this seller is highly suspect.  </li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Works great for dull dry hair!</li>
            <li>It is a very good value (big size) and you only need to use a small amount (I have currently have medium length hair).</li>
            <li>It made me feel so professional!</li>
            <li>when you rinse it out it leaves your hair sooo soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I found a small hair like an eyelash inside the jar floating on top of the conditioner when I opened the jar to clean up the mess.  </li>
            <li>I always apply it to damp hair and allow it to sit for 15-20 minutes, then blow dry on low heat to just activate it a little more.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and have used it for years, but this came old, discolored and smelled wrong.</li>
            <li>It appeared as if someone had painted or applied a \\&quot;rubbed on\\&quot; transfer on the labelling of the jar since writing/labelling on shampoo/conditioner bottles are generally permanent and waterproof for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive, but worth it because my hair finally doesn&#x27;t look dried out!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive, but worth it because my hair finally doesn&#x27;t look dried out!</li>
            <li> It also lasted for a long time, and I have very long hair-</li>
            <li> My hair used to be dry, lackluster and brittle due to the procedures it received (bleaching, heat straightening, anticurl) and as soon as I started using this, it got way shinier and prettier.</li>
            <li> this size will last you probably a year; and I say that given I have very long hair, that is really thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of other products, but this was recommended to me by a hair dresser.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t flatten or weight down your hair like other conditioners.</li>
            <li> which is probably the reason why some of the conditioner spilled out of the jar and conditioner was dripping down the sides.  </li>
            <li> It should not be brownish salmon color and smell like odd chemicals.</li>
            <li> Bought this product a year and 3 months ago, and I still have half the tub.</li>
            <li> ( after wash) I used it for half a year and start loosing lots of hair, no kidding.</li>
            <li> The logo and bar code on this product were half gone.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse and curly hair and this product had no problems taming it!</li>
            <li> I have used this Conditioner once a week for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I feel ripped off on this product especially considering I paid $36 ....$49 with shipping and on what is probably a knock-off product that was damaged, probably tampered and poorly packaged.  </li>
            <li> I no longer need to add additional styling product to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> But I had a very stressful year and was very sick</li>
            <li> It just means the product is seriously outdated.</li>
            <li> It came very poorly packaged in Priority Mail envelope...and that&#x27;s it......</li>

            <li> Love, Love, Love this conditioner!!!  Have bought it several times.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy hair that I straighten with every wash.  I use this product once a week.  I leave it on for twenty minutes and run the hair dryer over it, so it&#x27;ll soak in more with the heat.  Then I rinse it with cool water.  My hair turns out silky and straightens well.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of other products, but this was recommended to me by a hair dresser.  It&#x27;s more expensive, but worth it because my hair finally doesn&#x27;t look dried out!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of the product.  My hair stylist recommended TIGI S-Factor to me over a year ago to use on a weekly basis to control damage to my hair. I actually use it on a regular basis when I shampoo and condition.  It&#x27;s an excellent product!!</li>
            <li> Very rich. Stops breakage immediately</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when one of my friends brought it over. I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m forever indebted to my friend for introducing me to this. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  It genuinely rejuvenates your hair and makes it feel super soft. I dye my hair a light ash blonde every 4 weeks or so and it wasn&#x27;t in the healthiest of states. This product changed that. I always apply it to damp hair and allow it to sit for 15-20 minutes, then blow dry on low heat to just activate it a little more. When I rinse my hair out and style it, it feels sooooo soft and healthy. I love love love love this product! I use it on a weekly basis and it makes such a difference and it doesn&#x27;t flatten or weight down your hair like other conditioners. My hair actually has more bounce to it afterwards. Plus, it smells phenomenal. Definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and have used it for years, but this came old, discolored and smelled wrong. This conditioner should be cotton candy pink and have a pleasant scent. It should not be brownish salmon color and smell like odd chemicals. It just means the product is seriously outdated. Fortunately, it still seems to work ok.</li>
            <li> I have used this Conditioner once a week for a few years now. Works great for dull dry hair!</li>
            <li> Bought this product a year and 3 months ago, and I still have half the tub. It is a very good value (big size) and you only need to use a small amount (I have currently have medium length hair). If you use it once a week your hair will be softer and stronger. My hair used to be dry, lackluster and brittle due to the procedures it received (bleaching, heat straightening, anticurl) and as soon as I started using this, it got way shinier and prettier. When I went to the salon, even my hairstylist was impressed. Use it and you will see the difference :-)</li>
            <li> I work at a beauty store, this conditioner in a smaller container cost $30 this big jar will last you a year and it cost $30 it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this product! When you put it in it has a nice tingling feeling &amp; when you rinse it out it leaves your hair sooo soft. Definitely one of my favorite deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it&#x27;s huge, so you can get a lot out of it. I don&#x27;t use it every day, just about twice a week and my hair feels smooth.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love this conditioner. this size will last you probably a year; and I say that given I have very long hair, that is really thick.  I use it once or twice  a week, leave it on for 2-3 minutes, comb through and my hair is ridiculously soft and easy to manage.  The value of this size is also unbeatable.</li>
            <li> It is the best conditioner I have ever purchased! I would recommend this item to anyone and everyone! I have very thick coarse and curly hair and this product had no problems taming it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hair conditioner!</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s working the best for curly and frizzy hair. First time I tried at the hair salon. I could not believe how beautiful my hair was looking, shiny, not frizzy smooth. I had to buy me one. I used shampoo, deep conditioner and silky smooth serum( after wash) I used it for half a year and start loosing lots of hair, no kidding. A lot. But I had a very stressful year and was very sick and it could be it, I am buying S Factor again hopping my hair will not fall. When using s factor my hair looked sooo amazing. Pricy though.</li>
            <li> The large  jar of S-Factor conditioner that I purchased from this seller is highly suspect.  The logo and bar code on this product were half gone.  It appeared as if someone had painted or applied a \\&quot;rubbed on\\&quot; transfer on the labelling of the jar since writing/labelling on shampoo/conditioner bottles are generally permanent and waterproof for obvious reasons. Actually, all of the labelling on the jar was coming off in my hands as I held the jar. I include this info here in the product review as a cautionary tale for anyone considering purchasing from this seller.  Additionally, the smell of the conditioner might be \\&quot;off\\&quot; because instead of it smelling pleasant, it smelled almost medicinal.  It came very poorly packaged in Priority Mail envelope...and that&#x27;s it......which is probably the reason why some of the conditioner spilled out of the jar and conditioner was dripping down the sides.  Lastly, I found a small hair like an eyelash inside the jar floating on top of the conditioner when I opened the jar to clean up the mess.  I feel ripped off on this product especially considering I paid $36 ....$49 with shipping and on what is probably a knock-off product that was damaged, probably tampered and poorly packaged.  I should have read the seller reviews.</li>
            <li> I have natural curley hair and this has been the best conditioner I have ever used.  It makes my hair soft and easy to run a comb through.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but great things to say about this conditioner filled with great oils.  My hair melts like the butter the moment this conditioner is in my hair!  I sometime add an egg to it to create a protein treatment to strengthen my hair bi-weekly.  A must have in my hair care regimen!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and is everything anyone says of it.  I have very processed hair and this stuff on it turns it into immediate silk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before, at the suggestion of my hairstylist. It lasts forever and is a great product. I would highly recommend this. The seller was great and the order arrived quickly!! Would happily purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of conditioner products and this is the best!  Works great on damaged hair.  Leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> This conditioner provided me with an amazingly silky smooth feel! I loved using the conditioner and I really loved applying it with the amazing scooper hat comes along with it as well! It made me feel so professional! It also lasted for a long time, and I have very long hair- so that&#x27;s saying a lot! I will be buying again sometime in the future!&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, my hair is markedly improved since I&#x27;ve started using it. I no longer need to add additional styling product to tame my hair.</li>
