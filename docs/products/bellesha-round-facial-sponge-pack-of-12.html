    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am SO impressed.</li>
            <li>These sponges are excellent for cleansing the face, makeup removal, and  exfoliation.</li>
            <li>The size is just perfect.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think these are perfect, though:  </li>
            <li>My wife commandeered this package when it arrived, and she has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>GOOD STUFF!</li>
            <li>the thickness is perfect, the texture is nice, I found more uses for them than I</li>
            <li>They should be good to help her keep her face</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I received this product for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li>bacteria build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice aspect of the sponge is that it is bio-degradable.  </li>
            <li>The are really nice sponges for washing your face, or even removing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, mine came with 12 nice spongy pieces doe under</li>
            <li>they are the perfect mix of soft and exfoliating and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect for the face,  because they are not harsh on the skin and they remove makeup easily.</li>
            <li>and they turn into magic.</li>
            <li>I love these sponges.</li>
            <li>The 12 pack is an ok value, just plan to replace the pack quarterly.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shouLd kill the bacteria and can give you a lot more use out of them.  </li>
            <li>Love these cleansing sponges.  </li>
            <li>and I love them -</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sponges are durable and can be re-used many times.  </li>
            <li>These are great sponges for gently scrubbing your face.</li>
            <li>OMG, they are more than perfect, and I will order them as long as Amazon carries them!!</li>
            <li>like these sponges, they have a nice texture and just the right</li>
            <li>I rinse them out well before using and they are fine.  </li>
            <li>My skin was silky when I got through with my wash, smooth but not</li>
            <li>My moisurizer went on like a dream and absorbed better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>/&gt; smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;They feel great on my skin, and I now use them not only in my skin but in the shower as well.  </li>
            <li>wetting the sponge is important so the sponge does not catch on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I received a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li>these are gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While she said that these facial sponges have a nice \\&quot;feel\\&quot; to them, it&#x27;s their after effect she likes best: her face feels thoroughly scrubbed, and her pores feel open and \\&quot;fresh.\\</li>
            <li>The price is better than right, so I ordered.</li>
            <li>These sponges have a nice balance of gentleness and cleansing action so that they do not cause my rosacea to flair while keeping my skin clean when used with my favorite gel pore cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>While she wished either the package OR the Amazon page had a little more information on it (on their use or preservation or makeup), she still is extremely happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you use just take the ones you use to clean your face (not remove makeup), wash them out with clean soapy water, and them put them in the microwave for about a minute.  </li>
            <li>These are very neat, little pads, the perfect size to clean</li>
            <li>Still, these are a great buy, and I really like most of these little sponges,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.</li>
            <li>After using these sponges for several weeks I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>&quot; She feels that the sponges do a great job of exfoliating without being rough, and her skin feels far better for it.</li>
            <li>These are great little sponges.</li>
            <li>When you have sensitive or acne-prone skin (I do), you shouldn&#x27;t use anything too abrasive or it&#x27;ll just irritate your skin more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re holding up well, and feel like just the right size and shape for me.</li>
            <li>Works really well to clean the face.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with a few days, because bacteria and mold loves to grow in wet warm places.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to replace a cellulose sponge which I can&#x27;t replace, it isn&#x27;t sold locally any more, and I found these in my browsing.</li>
            <li>Pretty neat.  </li>
            <li>They are not harsh but remove dead skin very effectively.</li>
            <li>These are soft enough that they don&#x27;t bother my skin, but they still do an effective job of makeup removal in conjunction with my gentle skin cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She believes that these sponges are good abrasives that leave no residue behind except the sensation of being clean, and of being \\&quot;awake and alive.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get much use from them.  </li>
            <li>These, however, really serve a purpose:  </li>
            <li>They work really well without being too abrasive nor too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use my sponge twice daily and loved the slightly rough texture.  </li>
            <li>These are just the right balance between soft and abrasive.</li>
            <li>so many other brands often cause.  </li>
            <li>Strong recommendation is to let the hydrated sponge dry between uses to avoid</li>
            <li>The easiest way to keep a sponge bacteria free is to let it air dry between uses.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, therefore need to use something gentle to wash my face with.</li>
            <li>The slightly rough texture leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It feels like you get such a deep clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many other ways to disinfect these, just check them out on the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;The entire reason I like to use them is they disposable, and I am busy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a light grey color, and expand to double or triple</li>
            <li>I received these sponges for reviewing purposes, I would suggest the sponges to be made slightly thicker and somewhat larger for more durability and easier use.</li>
            <li>They are soft and yet the texture is slightly grainy, which isn&#x27;t really the right word, but all I can come up with to describe it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Good facial sponge if you don&#x27;t mind the roughness, but if you are wanting something soft like my wife, this might be a bit too much.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the manufacturer and learned that they are made out of natural cellulose (</li>
            <li>It feels like it has a light exfoliating effect, but not scratchy or harsh feeling.</li>
            <li>However, they expand to about three times size once wet and provide just the right amount of abrasion and softness.  </li>

            <li>For cosmetics use I particularly like using them remove the facial facial</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t wear much makeup and doesn&#x27;t care for the rough texture.</li>
            <li>They are gentle enough to use daily without leaving my skin overtly red.  </li>
            <li>I have developed some problems with rosacea in middle age and too abrasive of cleaning products aggravate the condition.  </li>
            <li>I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; texture of these facial sponges.  </li>
            <li>There is also a slight smell to them when first opened.</li>
            <li>Nice slightly rougher texture and less dense than other sponges, which makes these easier to dry out.</li>

            <li> When I got my Bellesha Round Facial Sponge pack of 12, I had my sixteen year old son use it.  </li>
            <li> My face feels smoother but NOT dry like some other tools the literally scrap all of your skin off.  </li>
            <li> Based on our usage, each sponge, once hydrated and in normal use, will easily last at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> They are crispy when removed from the bag, but wet them</li>
            <li> We use them everyday for facial cleansing.  </li>
            <li> My wife tried these, but they are a bit course and rough for her skin.  </li>
            <li> BelleSha Round Facial Sponge pack says you get 3 pieces in each pack.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Their sizes are:  3.6&amp;#34; x 3.6&amp;#34; x 0.4&amp;#34;  (it is about 1/2 that thickness before you wet it.  </li>
            <li> Once a week I wet the sponge and throw it in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> But it is not so rough that it causes skin</li>
            <li> The Bellasha Round Facial Sponge pack of 12 contains twelve small circular facial sponges.</li>
            <li> They feel stiff when they are dry and become sift when you wet them.  </li>
            <li> The texture is a bit rough, but that assists in exfoliation or removal of dead skin, which helps with rejuvenation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, they are a little on the skimpy side, being only 11/16&amp;#34; thick and 2 3/4&amp;#34; in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this every morning with a little face wash on it to exfoliate my face and it works wonders!  </li>
            <li> They arrived packaged tightly as little hard disks.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ve been exposed to something softer and smoother in the past--</li>
            <li> He suffers from teenage acne.  </li>
            <li> The porosity lets them make tons of suds with very little of my face cleanser (save that money, honey!).</li>
            <li> they are very small though.  </li>
            <li> I do NOT have bad acne, but I do get the occasional breakout and blackheads around my nose.  </li>
            <li> This is very delicate however exfoliates well.</li>
            <li> Each sponge is approximately 3 inches in diameter.  </li>

            <li> I was looking to replace a cellulose sponge which I can&#x27;t replace, it isn&#x27;t sold locally any more, and I found these in my browsing. The price is better than right, so I ordered. OMG, they are more than perfect, and I will order them as long as Amazon carries them!! They are crispy when removed from the bag, but wet them and they turn into magic. The porosity lets them make tons of suds with very little of my face cleanser (save that money, honey!). They are soft and yet the texture is slightly grainy, which isn&#x27;t really the right word, but all I can come up with to describe it. My skin was silky when I got through with my wash, smooth but not like I had overwashed it. My moisurizer went on like a dream and absorbed better than it ever has. I am SO impressed. Would highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing these for almost a year.  they are the perfect mix of soft and exfoliating and not overbearing.  they are very small though.  if you have arthritis or issues with dexterity, I wouldn&#x27;t  purchase these.  There is also a slight smell to them when first opened. I rinse them out well before using and they are fine.  I use one sponge for about two weeks before tossing.</li>
            <li> When I got my Bellesha Round Facial Sponge pack of 12, I had my sixteen year old son use it.  He suffers from teenage acne.  I reminded him every morning and evening to use it.  After only three days we could already tell a difference on his face!  I asked him if he would keep using the Bellesha sponges and he said he would.  Yay…I found something he will use and works for him.&lt;br /&gt;  I use my sponge twice daily and loved the slightly rough texture.  It was just enough to open up the pores and let my face ‘breathe’, without making my face red from the scrubbing so many other brands often cause.  My skin feels soft afterwards.  I do like them and would order them again!</li>
            <li> I love these sponges. They are perfect for the face,  because they are not harsh on the skin and they remove makeup easily. GOOD STUFF!</li>
            <li> I was not sure about these sponges at first. They arrived packaged tightly as little hard disks. However, they expand to about three times size once wet and provide just the right amount of abrasion and softness.  My teenager immediately took to using the sponges and says her face is cleaner because of it.  She especially likes the ability to remove cosmetics.  We use them everyday for facial cleansing.  These are not disposable sponges.  Each sponge can be used repeatedly for quite a while.  Strong recommendation is to let the hydrated sponge dry between uses to avoid bacteria build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice aspect of the sponge is that it is bio-degradable.  Based on our usage, each sponge, once hydrated and in normal use, will easily last at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> I do NOT have bad acne, but I do get the occasional breakout and blackheads around my nose.  I use this every morning with a little face wash on it to exfoliate my face and it works wonders!  My face feels smoother but NOT dry like some other tools the literally scrap all of your skin off.  This is very delicate however exfoliates well.</li>
            <li> The Bellasha Round Facial Sponge pack of 12 contains twelve small circular facial sponges. My wife tried these, but they are a bit course and rough for her skin.  She doesn&#x27;t wear much makeup and doesn&#x27;t care for the rough texture. She will let our daughter use them, as she is entering the age with acne starting. They should be good to help her keep her face clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good facial sponge if you don&#x27;t mind the roughness, but if you are wanting something soft like my wife, this might be a bit too much.</li>
            <li> After using these sponges for several weeks I have been very satisfied. They are gentle enough to use daily without leaving my skin overtly red.  Each sponge lasts about a week with moderate daily usage. The 12 pack is an ok value, just plan to replace the pack quarterly. I received these sponges for reviewing purposes, I would suggest the sponges to be made slightly thicker and somewhat larger for more durability and easier use.</li>
            <li> but seems to do the job nonetheless I feel like my sons skin is clearer since he started using these.</li>
            <li> Nice slightly rougher texture and less dense than other sponges, which makes these easier to dry out.</li>
            <li> I have developed some problems with rosacea in middle age and too abrasive of cleaning products aggravate the condition.  These sponges have a nice balance of gentleness and cleansing action so that they do not cause my rosacea to flair while keeping my skin clean when used with my favorite gel pore cleanser.  I received a 12 pack of these sponges in return for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> These sponges are excellent for cleansing the face, makeup removal, and  exfoliation. They are sturdy and can be used over and over again. The size is just perfect. They can be used for men or women of all ages. The texture is a bit rough, but that assists in exfoliation or removal of dead skin, which helps with rejuvenation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work</li>
            <li> Good it makes my face really&lt;br /&gt; smooth</li>
            <li> The are really nice sponges for washing your face, or even removing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BelleSha Round Facial Sponge pack says you get 3 pieces in each pack.  However, mine came with 12 nice spongy pieces doe under $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their sizes are:  3.6&amp;#34; x 3.6&amp;#34; x 0.4&amp;#34;  (it is about 1/2 that thickness before you wet it.  Then the water expands them.  Pretty neat.  :)&lt;br /&gt;Weight is almost negligible.  The size in the ad says they are 5.9&amp;#34; x 3.9&amp;#34; x 1.8&amp;#34;.  All I can figure, is that must be including the packing material.  These are very neat, little pads, the perfect size to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a light grey color, and expand to double or triple their size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I am done using one, I rinse it out well with soap, and then i spray  it with alcohol or witch hazel.  Some folks claim to get weeks of use our of them.  I am happy with a few days, because bacteria and mold loves to grow in wet warm places.  Always keep your sponges as dry as possible. Check out your loofah...same thing &amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make the sponges last the longest, you use just take the ones you use to clean your face (not remove makeup), wash them out with clean soapy water, and them put them in the microwave for about a minute.  This shouLd kill the bacteria and can give you a lot more use out of them.  Some people actually use the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other ways to disinfect these, just check them out on the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;The entire reason I like to use them is they disposable, and I am busy.  Still, these are a great buy, and I really like most of these little sponges,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my sponges only 4 stars because two were ripped.</li>
            <li> Love these cleansing sponges.  Works really well to clean the face.  Recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo21IHBUC997MKI]]I have been using BellaSha sponges for over two weeks and I love them - the thickness is perfect, the texture is nice, I found more uses for them than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package has 12 sponges.  Each sponge is approximately 3 inches in diameter.  As you see in attached video which shows all sponges on 1 inch grid mat they are slightly different in size.  They feel stiff when they are dry and become sift when you wet them.  Neither the packaging nor Amazon description states the material that they made out. I contacted the manufacturer and learned that they are made out of natural cellulose (wood fibers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel great on my skin, and I now use them not only in my skin but in the shower as well.  They are not harsh but remove dead skin very effectively. For cosmetics use I particularly like using them remove the facial facial mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are durable and can be re-used many times.  The easiest way to keep a sponge bacteria free is to let it air dry between uses. Once a week I wet the sponge and throw it in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  Note: wetting the sponge is important so the sponge does not catch on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these sponges, they have a nice texture and just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review&lt;br /&gt;[sample provided for testing and review]</li>
            <li> I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; texture of these facial sponges.  I guess I&#x27;ve been exposed to something softer and smoother in the past--and I didn&#x27;t get much use from them.  These, however, really serve a purpose:  The slightly rough texture leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  But it is not so rough that it causes skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think these are perfect, though:  For me, they are a little on the skimpy side, being only 11/16&amp;#34; thick and 2 3/4&amp;#34; in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from BelleSha.</li>
            <li> These are great sponges for gently scrubbing your face. They work really well without being too abrasive nor too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to knock off a star though because they are significantly smaller than the advertised 9 x 9 x 1.5 cm. Even when soaked and fully expanded, they only measure about 7 x 7 x .8 cm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I received a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li> These are just the right balance between soft and abrasive. When you have sensitive or acne-prone skin (I do), you shouldn&#x27;t use anything too abrasive or it&#x27;ll just irritate your skin more. These are soft enough that they don&#x27;t bother my skin, but they still do an effective job of makeup removal in conjunction with my gentle skin cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re holding up well, and feel like just the right size and shape for me. I received this for review.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, therefore need to use something gentle to wash my face with. these are gentle yet effective. I only wish they were a bit bigger</li>
            <li> My wife commandeered this package when it arrived, and she has been very happy with it. While she wished either the package OR the Amazon page had a little more information on it (on their use or preservation or makeup), she still is extremely happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While she said that these facial sponges have a nice \\&quot;feel\\&quot; to them, it&#x27;s their after effect she likes best: her face feels thoroughly scrubbed, and her pores feel open and \\&quot;fresh.\\&quot; She feels that the sponges do a great job of exfoliating without being rough, and her skin feels far better for it. She believes that these sponges are good abrasives that leave no residue behind except the sensation of being clean, and of being \\&quot;awake and alive.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m under orders to give this pack of sponges a five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.</li>
            <li> These are great little sponges. Anyone who combats acne could benefit from this sponge. It feels like you get such a deep clean. After using them every day for a a week or so my skin felt softer and looked noticeably brighter. It feels like it has a light exfoliating effect, but not scratchy or harsh feeling. The pack comes with 12 sponges. I guess you could reuse them but I did not. I received this product for a fair and honest review.</li>
