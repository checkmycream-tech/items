    <ol>
            <li> Lets just say I gave it away... I felt like I had nothing from Clinique on. But it got to me quick...</li>
            <li> It came before the date!! Really like this product.</li>
            <li> My lipstick broke on the day that it arrived. I&#x27;m not sure if it wasn&#x27;t already broken when I got it. I kept it because I needed it for my wedding.</li>
            <li> This had been a giveaway, so did not have the proper tube that was expected.  I had intended it to be a gift.</li>
            <li> I love many of Clinique&#x27;s lip colors, but this is my favorite.  Goes with everything and the blue in it makes my teeth look whiter!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, well packaged.  Lovely full tube of lipstick in a modern yet neutral shade.  It seems to look great against any color blouse or sweater I&#x27;m wearing.  Recommend this product and seller to all!</li>
            <li> Clinqu makes my fav lipstick. I am sensitive to cosmetics and have no problem with this brand. Plus I love the color choices.</li>
            <li> This lipstick actually stays longer, and color does not fade. It is not watery lipstick.  I like it. The color is true what shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> This was exactly as the product is known to me,. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> yes I got that too very pleased and will shop again someday soon for Christmas for sure have a great day  m.s. o&#x27;reilly</li>
            <li> Too dry, would be nice if it had a little more moisturinzing effect.</li>
            <li> It came in a zip lock bag without a box and lipstick is ruined all around the side.</li>
            <li> It has soft texture and the color is nice too. It does not last long though. Needs to be reapplied often.</li>
            <li> This is a was a very flattering color on me (I have medium/olive skin) and on my friend who has a very light complexion. I think it would look good on anyone! I usually receive compliments whenever I wear it:)</li>
            <li> Good a tube of this as a sample from Clinique.  Love the color.  Ordered extra to carry.</li>
            <li> After receiving this as a GWP, it took me a while (much too long) to try. I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Ice Bloom&amp;#34; for awhile, but &amp;#34;A Different Grape&amp;#34; is now my absolute favorite lipstick. I have very fair skin, with cool tones, and this shade is perfect for me. (I don&#x27;t know if it would look quite so good on darker complexions.) It is not quite red, more like a pinkish-red, with some purple. For my skintone, it looks very classic and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually layer some lip balm on top -- I don&#x27;t think the lipstick itself is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This Clinique lipstick is one of the nicest colors I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It&#x27;s soft and creamy and stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> I use diarly. I like very much because it is creamy and give me shine on my mouth. I recommended it.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my friend&#x27;s 10 year old daughter,expected more from Clinique,no coverage and didn&#x27;t holdup.</li>
            <li> Came completely untouched, and scent/everything else is exactly as it should be</li>

            <li> My favorite for years</li>
            <li> This is a great color and the price was even better.  I bought 2 for the price of 1 in the store!</li>
            <li> I originally got this shade in a sample and fell in love with it When it broke and smushed, I had to hurry and buy a new one in case I could never find it again. This is a nice wine-y shade with good coverage, and it stays on for quite a while! Yay!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an add-on item, and like it very much.  It is creamy and gives a dressy finish for fair blondes like myself.
