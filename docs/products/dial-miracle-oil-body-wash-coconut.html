            <li>, this is the best dial wash i used so far.</li>
            <li>and it has a top smell to it</li>
            <li>I love this and demand to know why Dial took it off the market.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent is grape seed oil and lemongrass.  </li>
            <li>It may not be cheaper than, say Walmart, but they don&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Dial bodywash; what more is there to say?......</li>
            <li>and i was very happy to find that they made a body wash in the same sent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>This makes your body smell great and nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>I like all of the Dial body washes, but this one is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>It probably won&#x27;t wow you and leave you wanting to stuff your face in the bottle, but it&#x27;s definitely nice and pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I first bought the hand soap and loved the smell off it</li>
            <li>I love the scent, I love the texture, and I will most certainly be ordering more over and over.  </li>
            <li>it is wonderful to smell something other then flowers.</li>
            <li>(Fine for guys who don&#x27;t want to smell like the gals, the kids, or a cologne factory.)</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s in the grapeseed oil filled beads, but it just blew me away.</li>
            <li>This is the best body wash for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find a body wash that is not geared towards gals or guys; this is perfect for both!</li>
            <li>and the smell is clean and fresh, not flowery or fruity.</li>
            <li>It just smells clean and botanical and fresh without being perfumy.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered very quickly and was packaged really well.  </li>
            <li>The Grapeseed/Lemongrass scent is so unique and refreshing that I just ordered a couple bottles of the White Peach.</li>
            <li>NutriSkin leaves my skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash, it smells so nice and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>It really makes you feel clean, doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and just leaves you feeling fresh!  </li>
            <li>Makes you feel clean and soft smooth at same time.</li>
            <li>Smart, smart smart.</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend noticed how much softer my skin was, without prompting.</li>
            <li>regrettably they are not real gold, otherwise i would have ordered more than what i did.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have tried the very expensive body washes from specialty stores and many drugstore brands, all promising to be the most moisturizing, and this is the only one that really lived up to its promise.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to find it in stores lately</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product as long as Amazon offers it.</li>

            <li> The smell alone is KILLER. So fresh and clean and wonderful. Dial hit it OUT of the ballpark on this one. The consistency is wonderful in the shower and your skin feels great afterwards. This body wash actually makes you want to take a shower just to use it. I just found they made a hand soap to match because it smells so good. They need to give the folks that came up with this product a raise!! Smart, smart smart. I wish there were entire lines of products with this scent. Candles, fabric softener, spray cleaner, etc. I&#x27;m sold !</li>
            <li> We love this soap in my home!  We have been using it for years and recently all of the local stores (Walmart, Target) have stopped carrying this product.  I found it on Amazon for home subscription and it has been awesome!  The product will show up at the door on the specified day and we will never run our again!</li>
            <li> This product is just the best!  I hadn&#x27;t been able to find it in stores lately so I was so happy when I found it on Amazon!  It really makes you feel clean, doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and just leaves you feeling fresh!  I love the scent, I love the texture, and I will most certainly be ordering more over and over.  The product was delivered very quickly and was packaged really well.  No spills, no problems,</li>
            <li> this is a must have it makes your skin feel great and it has a top smell to it, this is the best dial wash i used so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for the pricier luxury moisturizing body washes, but I picked this one up when I was in a hurry at Target and WOW. I have never, ever, in my entire life used a body wash that was so moisturizing. I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my skin because it was just incredible how well this stuff worked. I guess it&#x27;s in the grapeseed oil filled beads, but it just blew me away. I have tried the very expensive body washes from specialty stores and many drugstore brands, all promising to be the most moisturizing, and this is the only one that really lived up to its promise. I cannot stop raving about this stuff. The smell is really nice too. It probably won&#x27;t wow you and leave you wanting to stuff your face in the bottle, but it&#x27;s definitely nice and pleasant and not overpowering. Even my boyfriend noticed how much softer my skin was, without prompting.</li>
            <li> I love this and demand to know why Dial took it off the market. Everytime I find something my skin tolerates...poof it&#x27;s gone. No one in Alabama carries it. You can keep your coconuts and your pink sea salts. Please bring this back.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash for such a reasonable price.  My favorite scent is grape seed oil and lemongrass.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We like this grapeseed and lemongrass body wash because it leaves your skin moisturized when daily exposure to the elements seems to have a drying effect on it. Has a very nice smell and was economical,here on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body wash from dial, and I was sad to see it leave the shelf. I found it on amazon for cheaper than the convenient store on the corner. It may not be cheaper than, say Walmart, but they don&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li> I have used the Dial Grapeseed Oil &amp; Lemongrass Glycerin bar soap for quite a while now &amp; thought I would give the body wash a try. It is as good as I had hoped. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is so dry &amp; itchy after a shower. My skin feels soft &amp; the body wash isn&#x27;t irritating to my skin as some soaps can be.</li>
            <li> This soap is nice. I like the gold beads... regrettably they are not real gold, otherwise i would have ordered more than what i did.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash I can ever remember using. It smells good without being overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I will continue to use this product as long as Amazon offers it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Dial definitely hit it out of the park with this one. Finally, a product that actually does what it promises! NutriSkin leaves my skin so soft and smooth I almost don&#x27;t recognize it, and I&#x27;m diabetic with an ongoing dry skin problem. The Grapeseed/Lemongrass scent is so unique and refreshing that I just ordered a couple bottles of the White Peach. I can&#x27;t recommend NutriSkin enough. Love it, love it.</li>
            <li> Normally I dry out every winter and my legs and arms bleed. This year after switching to this, I didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Dial bodywash; what more is there to say?......and the smell is clean and fresh, not flowery or fruity. (Fine for guys who don&#x27;t want to smell like the gals, the kids, or a cologne factory.)</li>
            <li> I first bought the hand soap and loved the smell off it and i was very happy to find that they made a body wash in the same sent. I love the smell</li>
            <li> Best body wash I have ever used</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash, it smells so nice and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. One of my favourite body wash since now.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a body wash that is not geared towards gals or guys; this is perfect for both! It just smells clean and botanical and fresh without being perfumy.</li>
            <li> This makes your body smell great and nice and soft.  I will only purchase Dial Body washes.  I wish they would sell it cheaper to match Walmart prices.</li>
            <li> I like all of the Dial body washes, but this one is probably my favorite. It smells great and you feel really clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and cleans very well, bought all I could!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes you feel clean and soft smooth at same time. I like the smell it is wonderful to smell something other then flowers. makes my old tough skin feel so soft as can be you feel some what younger.</li>
