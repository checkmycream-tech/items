            <li>Delicious is right!  :)</li>
            <li>I own the large bottle of Be Delicious but don&#x27;t like taking it on trips for fear of it breaking.  </li>
            <li>it was the day I applied this amazing perfume</li>
            <li>Nice to travel as it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li>The seller also sent me a mini bottle of Ooh La La perfume (had never heard of) which was nice as well.  </li>
            <li>Drip free perfume in a &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34;.. what more can I can!!  </li>
            <li>Not a problem any more!  :)</li>
            <li>It smells soooo good and is super convenient to take with you on the go.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite smell the same as in the bottle, however it is perfect to pack in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>she would like to order more.</li>
            <li>This frangrance is an appropriate work fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This will probably be my favorite scent of all time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply a sexy scent that lingers with you and wakes up your senses.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad i did.</li>
            <li>This is a nice and clean scent.</li>
            <li>I love how easy the roller applies and the smell lasts all day, received product faster than specified.....</li>
            <li>It is a great clean, fresh scent that smells fruity but not overly fuity or cheap.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;d be lying if I said I was someone that guys take notice of often, but guys frequently comment on how good I smell and</li>
            <li>i bought this gift for my babygirl, she loves it, i know that it has to be good because she is very finicky, she told me they</li>
            <li>(I forget the name) version of be delicious on the other side</li>
            <li>I have a strong sensitivity to scented things (cologne, aftershave, perfume, cleaning products, etc.)</li>
            <li>definably recommended this product (perfume) if you like the light scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anything with DKNY be delicious ill try, my most favorite scent in the world, I would be devastated if it ever becomes un available.</li>
            <li>is such an amazing scent!</li>
            <li>Love this perfume and really like the portable factor!  </li>
            <li>I find that this lasts a good amount of time as well, especially if you use a dab of the lotion as well.</li>
            <li>The roller ball is great because you don&#x27;t waste your fragrance misting yourself.</li>
            <li>I only put a light dab or two on my clothing, just in case but have been able to wear it without a problem twice already.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I don&#x27;t have this exact rollerball, the one I have is dual sided, with the light pink</li>
            <li>am actually looking forward to try the blossom version :-)&lt;br /&gt;Jazz</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on my first roll-on.</li>
            <li>How many times have you left the house and realized you forgot to put perfume on?!  </li>
            <li>Just be aware and ready for that.</li>
            <li>But sometimes way too much comes out.</li>
            <li>I bought the rollerball from Dilliards 3 years ago and would only use it on special occasions or if I was going out with friends, so it lasted me awhile.</li>
            <li>This is a good price, it&#x27;s small, portable and a powerful scent (not overwhelming).</li>
            <li>I keep in in my purse and use it whenever I want to smell a little sweet!</li>
            <li>This little gem gets tucked right in</li>

            <li> I tried an impostor version that Walmart had....and I loved the smell of that body spray.&lt;br /&gt;I actually search for the name and found it in here Amazon.com....then I saw the small traveling tube and I decided to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;THe day I received it it was the day I applied this amazing perfume... I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it after my shower,and weird enough I even applied it when I go to bed it is SUCH a delicate soft and casual smell it does NOT bother my nose or have I gotten a headache alike other perfumes can cause.&lt;br /&gt;I definably recommended this product (perfume) if you like the light scent.&lt;br /&gt;I am actually looking forward to try the blossom version :-)&lt;br /&gt;Jazz</li>
            <li> I have a strong sensitivity to scented things (cologne, aftershave, perfume, cleaning products, etc.) and haven&#x27;t been able to wear perfume for years, until now!  I smelled this on a co-worker and loved it, I noticed it didn&#x27;t seem to trigger my allergies/asthma so figured I&#x27;d take a gamble.  I only put a light dab or two on my clothing, just in case but have been able to wear it without a problem twice already.  It&#x27;s a somewhat fruity smell.  Delicious is right!  :)</li>
            <li> Anything with DKNY be delicious ill try, my most favorite scent in the world, I would be devastated if it ever becomes un available. I love how easy the roller applies and the smell lasts all day, received product faster than specified.....thank you</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law loved having Be Delicious in a mini form so she could take it with her anywhere. She loves the scent and the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and clean scent. I had to buy it after I got a sample in the mail. This is a good price, it&#x27;s small, portable and a powerful scent (not overwhelming). I&#x27;ve been wearing to for 8 hours and I can still smell it. Use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift.  The person had been asking for it all year long.  It was perfect and just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> My sister in law gave me one because I had put it on my wish list.  This is the only scent I have worn since it came out years ago.  The roller I received is defective - no scent at all - just smells like rubbing alcohol.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the vendor or a bad batch, but I wish I knew how to return it without letting her know.</li>
            <li> Yummy scent that lasts all day. Nice to travel as it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. I&#x27;m still working on my first roll-on.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume scent!  And to have it in this convenient, purse size is just great!  How many times have you left the house and realized you forgot to put perfume on?!  Not a problem any more!  :)</li>
            <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t have this exact rollerball, the one I have is dual sided, with the light pink (I forget the name) version of be delicious on the other side and I LOVE it! It smells soooo good and is super convenient to take with you on the go. To be honest, I&#x27;d be lying if I said I was someone that guys take notice of often, but guys frequently comment on how good I smell and women are always asking what it is that I&#x27;m wearing. I find that this lasts a good amount of time as well, especially if you use a dab of the lotion as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite smell the same as in the bottle, however it is perfect to pack in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> i bought this gift for my babygirl, she loves it, i know that it has to be good because she is very finicky, she told me they she would like to order more.</li>
            <li> This frangrance is an appropriate work fragrance. It is not overpowering. It has subtle floral and apples tones. I have noticed that I need a late afternoon &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; when I am going out after work. The roller ball is great because you don&#x27;t waste your fragrance misting yourself. This fits in my purse and I&#x27;ve flown with it stored in my carry on with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love rollerball perfumes, and this DKNY Be Delicious is such an amazing scent! I keep in in my purse and use it whenever I want to smell a little sweet!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and really like the portable factor!  I own the large bottle of Be Delicious but don&#x27;t like taking it on trips for fear of it breaking.  This little gem gets tucked right in and I don&#x27;t worry at all.  The seller also sent me a mini bottle of Ooh La La perfume (had never heard of) which was nice as well.  Yea for rollerball!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It is a great clean, fresh scent that smells fruity but not overly fuity or cheap.</li>
            <li> But sometimes way too much comes out. Might be due to pressure changes when in checked luggage. Just be aware and ready for that.</li>
            <li> This will probably be my favorite scent of all time. It smells so yummy but it has a floral undertone that is wonderful. I think people smell different notes everytime they smell it. I was wearing it last week and someone hugged me and said I smell like watermelon, and I never detected that scent with this perfume before. It&#x27;s simply a sexy scent that lingers with you and wakes up your senses. I bought the rollerball from Dilliards 3 years ago and would only use it on special occasions or if I was going out with friends, so it lasted me awhile. Dilliards stopped selling the rollerball so I had to find it online and I&#x27;m so glad i did.</li>
            <li> Drip free perfume in a &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34;.. what more can I can!!  It&#x27;s the best thing ever. I love, love, love it!!!</li>
