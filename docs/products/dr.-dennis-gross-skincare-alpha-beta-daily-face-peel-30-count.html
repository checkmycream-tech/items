            <li>I have since started using the Glycolix peel pads and they work great for my skin.</li>
            <li>This system is a great skincare system.  </li>
            <li>great for maintenance of skin and exfoliation esp during winter months</li>
            <li>Used before you have a great price.</li>
            <li>I loved this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use this twice a week and love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and makes my skin look great.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product .</li>
            <li>Having received a sample of this from a rival cosmetics company, I tried the product and liked it.  </li>
            <li>, it kept my face clean and bright.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and feels nicely astringent, so it seems like it SHOULD be doing something.  </li>
            <li>One of my most favorite beauty products.  </li>
            <li>All that I can day is it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>And I do love the product.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin with a healthy shine of cell renewal.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both use it and love it.</li>
            <li>I am not a person who enjoys writing product reviews, but this product is one of the best skin care products I have used in a long while.</li>
            <li>This alpha/beta peel works just as described, and it&#x27;s so easy to use you</li>
            <li>After using it, my skin felt great but would become oilier later on in the day.</li>
            <li>Which, led to the product being cheaper than the rival cosmetic company, and with 2 day free delivery, how could I resist?  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin super clean and Dewey looking for days after.</li>
            <li>If your skin is just too sensitive to have a real chemical peel this may be a good choice for you.</li>
            <li>It does such a nice job to soften and smooth out the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>But at the end of 10 days I honestly don&#x27;t see any major difference in age or sun spots, pore size, wrinkles or anything else.  </li>
            <li>Due to the price, I wanted more information and honest ratings, which led me to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy, two-step process that takes about three minutes (two minutes for the first step, one for the second), and I highly recommend this peel for easy and effective skin cell turnover.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a very gentle peel.</li>
            <li>I was hoping from the claims of this product and other positive reviews that it would be a great new product for my skin</li>
            <li>AND I recently developed some mild roacea!</li>
            <li>I have noticed smaller pores and more even tone.  </li>
            <li>when I use it, I remember exactly why I buy it again.  </li>
            <li>You notice the difference in your skin the very 1st time you use this product!</li>
            <li>though to be fair, maybe its helping something under the surface, or long term, that isn&#x27;t apparent day to day.</li>
            <li>Many of these products really are targeted for younger people with skin issues, but we older females need product too!  </li>
            <li>Really oily forehead, super dry and flaky around my chin and nose, with a healthy dose of adult acne.</li>
            <li>Right after you use it, your skins looks brighter and taught, but that&#x27;s true of almost any product, including basic moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>, my skin looks dull and this is a great mini peel to keep things looking young.  </li>
            <li>I really do notice a difference in texture and clarity after I began using this product.  </li>
            <li>Been using this peel for about 3 years and what I really like about it</li>
            <li>is that it really brightens up your complexion, and smooths the appearance.</li>
            <li>the older I get.</li>
            <li>Its a good product as it is does not consume too much time for application but at the same time I would recommend going for the two-step individual packs rather than this box as this tends to dry out within a month.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells a little trial size/starter pack for pretty cheap if you&#x27;re hesitant at all.</li>
            <li>I think if I used them everyday I would see even more results.</li>
            <li>This product is probably more heavy duty than my skin requires.</li>
            <li>The only con is the price, but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>however I noticed no difference other than I began breaking out more than ever especially around and on my nose.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t using it to clear up acne as some reviewers, so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but was just eager for something to brighten and renew my middle-40s skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Use it with the vitamin D serum for the complete package......</li>
            <li>I used this everyday for the entire month but didn&#x27;t see a significant change in my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday more like every other day.  </li>
            <li>The cleasing Witch Hazel feels a bit harsh though in the first pad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I loved this stuff. I noticed a difference when I was using it, however; I stopped using it bc I decided to try out other products. Overall, this is something that I would purchase again and I did! I never broke out from it, it kept my face clean and bright.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle peel. If your skin is just too sensitive to have a real chemical peel this may be a good choice for you. I have sensitive skin but I get facials with chemical peels and never had a problem. I tried this because I burned my skin with a stronger at home peel. I used this everyday for the entire month but didn&#x27;t see a significant change in my skin. I have since started using the Glycolix peel pads and they work great for my skin.</li>
            <li> This system is a great skincare system.  Easy to use and makes my skin look great.  I have noticed smaller pores and more even tone.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday more like every other day.  I do notice a difference when I have not used them in a while, my skin looks dull and this is a great mini peel to keep things looking young.  I think if I used them everyday I would see even more results.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 10 days (packets, not jar) and saw little difference.  Wasn&#x27;t using it to clear up acne as some reviewers, so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but was just eager for something to brighten and renew my middle-40s skin.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and feels nicely astringent, so it seems like it SHOULD be doing something.  But at the end of 10 days I honestly don&#x27;t see any major difference in age or sun spots, pore size, wrinkles or anything else.  Right after you use it, your skins looks brighter and taught, but that&#x27;s true of almost any product, including basic moisturizer.  So, can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend, though to be fair, maybe its helping something under the surface, or long term, that isn&#x27;t apparent day to day.</li>
            <li> This alpha/beta peel works just as described, and it&#x27;s so easy to use you won&#x27;t need to pay hundreds of dollars for facials at spas again.  I use this once a week, and it helps to clarify and exfoliate my skin.  I really do notice a difference in texture and clarity after I began using this product.  It&#x27;s an easy, two-step process that takes about three minutes (two minutes for the first step, one for the second), and I highly recommend this peel for easy and effective skin cell turnover.</li>
            <li> I am not a person who enjoys writing product reviews, but this product is one of the best skin care products I have used in a long while. I am over 50,  my skin was dull and uneven prior to using this product.  I have seen an obvious improvement since using Dr. Gross skincare Daily facial peel. My ,skin is brighter, even skin tone and pore size appear smaller. I have been using this product for about a month, but noticed improvement within 2 weeks.  Will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite beauty products.  I do feel like it&#x27;s a splurge when I buy it, but when I use it, I remember exactly why I buy it again.  It does such a nice job to soften and smooth out the texture of my skin.  Amazon sells a little trial size/starter pack for pretty cheap if you&#x27;re hesitant at all.</li>
            <li> great for maintenance of skin and exfoliation esp during winter months</li>
            <li> it is different with the one I bought from store.</li>
            <li> I discovered this peal when I began having issues with my skin. All that I can day is it is fantastic! It reversed my problems and now I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> If I could return this product I would. I was hoping from the claims of this product and other positive reviews that it would be a great new product for my skin however I noticed no difference other than I began breaking out more than ever especially around and on my nose. I had to stop the product after about 3 weeks because I could not take the acne anymore. Initially thought  it was cleaning from deep below and getting out all the impurities then I would notice a difference but that never happened.</li>
            <li> I have terrible combination skin. Really oily forehead, super dry and flaky around my chin and nose, with a healthy dose of adult acne. AND I recently developed some mild roacea! It just gets worse and worse the older I get. But Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta face peel has made a big improvement! The dryness is gone, my forehead is less shiny, and I&#x27;ve seen a definite improvement in my acne. Still not perfect, but you can&#x27;t change genetics. This is great stuff!</li>
            <li> You notice the difference in your skin the very 1st time you use this product! pores are smaller and your skin slowly becomes clearer with time. I use this twice a week and love it!</li>
            <li> Used before you have a great price.</li>
            <li> I just began using this product on September 7, 2012. As yet, I have no opinion as to its claimed effectiveness.  I do think I see a slight improvement in my problems, which are whiteheads that are very hard to remove. My face shows no redness of tenderness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to go out into the sun, living in Hawaii, I see no adverse effects doing that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the time it takes to keep rubbing the two pads on your face until they \\&quot;appear dry\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diane Tippett</li>
            <li> This product is probably more heavy duty than my skin requires. After using it, my skin felt great but would become oilier later on in the day.</li>
            <li> Having received a sample of this from a rival cosmetics company, I tried the product and liked it.  Due to the price, I wanted more information and honest ratings, which led me to Amazon.  Which, led to the product being cheaper than the rival cosmetic company, and with 2 day free delivery, how could I resist?  And I do love the product.  I am outside a lot, and in the hot, humid weather, desperately needed a pick me up for my skin.  This is the best product I have ever used for my aging skin. Many of these products really are targeted for younger people with skin issues, but we older females need product too!  Finally found something I can stick with.  At my age (mid 50&#x27;s) I was not sure that would ever happen!</li>
            <li> Been using this peel for about 3 years and what I really like about it is that it really brightens up your complexion, and smooths the appearance. It also rids of the comedones (weird bumps on the surface of your skin) after continued use and it&#x27;s not drying or irritating at all. I only use it once a week because I use other products to combat my oily, acne prone skin. The only con is the price, but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t the worst that I have tried, but definitely is not the best.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean very well.  It also has not made a difference on my face.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin with a healthy shine of cell renewal.  I prefer the Extra Strength.  The cleasing Witch Hazel feels a bit harsh though in the first pad.</li>
            <li> Its a good product as it is does not consume too much time for application but at the same time I would recommend going for the two-step individual packs rather than this box as this tends to dry out within a month.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product . Leaves your skin super clean and Dewey looking for days after. Use it with the vitamin D serum for the complete package......Addicting!  My husband and I both use it and love it.</li>
