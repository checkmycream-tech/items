            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I have seborrhea dermatitis and it works just as good as the prescription shampoo</li>
            <li>Hubby says that this is the best treatment that he&#x27;s used over many years, and he&#x27;s tried a LOT including many prescription products.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, it has done wonders for my dandruff!</li>
            <li>I used to use the ZNP bar before it was discontinued and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Happily, this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>This is very effective and you should see result within the first couple of washes.</li>
            <li>This product works wonderfully...even better than prescription products.</li>
            <li>great product, reasonably priced</li>
            <li>My skin felt so much better after just one use and it continues to improve.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow directions and lather twice.</li>
            <li>does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and is not off putting would like more for the mmoney</li>
            <li>but if the other products work as well, I would be very impressed.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I even use the shampoo on my facial hair and it works great there also.  </li>
            <li>This seems like an overall good product, but didn&#x27;t work for the psoriasis/dermatitis on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many dandruff shampoos, and I am glad to say that besides the unpleasant smell, this one&#x27;s the best by far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, and works very fast.</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past, and always had great results with it.</li>
            <li>Dermazinc is better than what&#x27;s available in your local pharmacy, but 40% of the itching and flaking from intense seborrhea are back.</li>
            <li>take much too shampoo&lt;</li>
            <li>I must revise my original review as the formula has changed since my last order.</li>
            <li>Even though i used already more then half of bottle.</li>
            <li>The product works okay and helped me a little bit, but I think you need to keep using the product to get continued results.</li>
            <li>I need a few more shampoos.</li>
            <li>and then I would have to find something new.  </li>
            <li>Dermazinc cleared my scalp completely, I have been using it for a year</li>
            <li>I use it for all showers, and my dandruff has gone away completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early for me to tell if it does what I want to do to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for producing a product that actually lives up to it&#x27;s advertisement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried a dozen other products with varying success, no other product has worked so well!</li>
            <li>My recommendation is try several and pay attention to the main ingredient.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works for me when no other over the counter dandruff shampoo will.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews much, but after trying 4 other shampoos, this one does the trick.</li>
            <li>While the active ingredient is still the same, the first three ingredients on the label are now completely different.</li>
            <li>Whether it works for you probably depends on whether the active ingredient is well suited for the flora/fauna on your skin as well as your hormones and other factors, but well worth a try.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help a longstanding problem.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic.  I have struggled with sebhorric dermatitis for years and whatever worked would only work for a short period of time and then I would have to find something new.  Numerous visits to the dermatologist with the same results.  To make matters worse as I got older and needed to dye my hair all the dandruff shampoos stripped the color.  Dermazinc cleared my scalp completely, I have been using it for a year and it still works great!  My hairdresser took the name of it to recommend to other clients as she couldn&#x27;t believe the difference and it doesn&#x27;t effect my hair color at all.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
            <li> My scalp is still itching a lot. Even though i used already more then half of bottle. Did not make any difference before and after and so overprice((/</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully...even better than prescription products.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Hubby says that this is the best treatment that he&#x27;s used over many years, and he&#x27;s tried a LOT including many prescription products.</li>
            <li> Product works great and received it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I used to use the ZNP bar before it was discontinued and it was amazing. Dermazinc is better than what&#x27;s available in your local pharmacy, but 40% of the itching and flaking from intense seborrhea are back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews much, but after trying 4 other shampoos, this one does the trick. I have used this in the past, and always had great results with it. Literally after 2 uses, it kicks in and works. My recommendation is try several and pay attention to the main ingredient. In my case Zinc Pyrithione 2% works. Head and Shoulders is at 1%, and didn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s worth the money, and works very fast. I use it for all showers, and my dandruff has gone away completely. I hope this stays on the market, and thank you for the product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works for me when no other over the counter dandruff shampoo will. I have seborrhea dermatitis and it works just as good as the prescription shampoo my Dr. give me!</li>
            <li> The product works okay and helped me a little bit, but I think you need to keep using the product to get continued results.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early for me to tell if it does what I want to do to my hair.  I need a few more shampoos.</li>
            <li> If head and shoulders doesn&#x27;t get the job done for you, try this product in consult with your dermatologist.  This is very effective and you should see result within the first couple of washes.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, it has done wonders for my dandruff!</li>
            <li> great product, reasonably priced</li>
            <li> This product actually works.  No more itchy, flaky scalp. I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo but if the other products work as well, I would be very impressed.  Thanks for producing a product that actually lives up to it&#x27;s advertisement.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many dandruff shampoos, and I am glad to say that besides the unpleasant smell, this one&#x27;s the best by far. My scalp didn&#x27;t itch even days after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Not that big diference.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for scalp flare ups.</li>
            <li> worked some what, but not 100% gone&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t take much too shampoo&lt;br /&gt;swo overall not badf for the price&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I tried others but this worked for me the best but everyone is different so just try it for a month.</li>
            <li> This seems like an overall good product, but didn&#x27;t work for the psoriasis/dermatitis on my scalp. It may have kept things in check, but it didn&#x27;t disappear. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Works great for me. My skin felt so much better after just one use and it continues to improve. I&#x27;d tried a dozen other products with varying success, no other product has worked so well!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this along with the Dermazinc Face cream and it works like nothing else.  Had a hard time controlling my dermatitis, so i decided to give this stuff a shot.  Works great. May take a few days to acclimate to (with face cream and shampoo, had minor raise is itchiness, but after a few days, it went away and my face cleared up and stayed clear along with my scalp. I attributed the itchyness to my skin finally healing.  I even use the shampoo on my facial hair and it works great there also.  So if ya have tried everything else out there, try this. It works!!</li>
            <li> I must revise my original review as the formula has changed since my last order. I am sending it back. While the active ingredient is still the same, the first three ingredients on the label are now completely different. This even looks and smells different. The ingredients have been altered to include the harshest and, in my opinion, worse ingredients you can find in shampoo. Such a shame. At least I can now save a ton of cash buying something in the drug store that costs less than 20% of what this stuff does. Why did you change????????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research trying to find a shampoo to treat seborrhic dermatitis that wouldn&#x27;t strip my hair. Happily, this fit the bill. I use this everyday in conjunction with ketoconazole once a week and I am very pleased. Whether it works for you probably depends on whether the active ingredient is well suited for the flora/fauna on your skin as well as your hormones and other factors, but well worth a try.Be sure to follow directions and lather twice.</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and is not off putting would like more for the mmoney but it is medicated</li>
