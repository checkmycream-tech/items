    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Since some adults bite their nails this is perfect for it.</li>
            <li>Best to reapply after washing hands.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST product if you want your child to stop sucking their thumb, OR to stop nail biting.  </li>
            <li>Best priced deterent too.</li>
            <li>the product was a great price, but didnt work well for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while she would insert thumb into mouth and not be happy with the experience.  </li>
            <li>He thought it smells great and liked the taste!</li>
            <li>then put some on my own fingers and couldn&#x27;t even tell that it was there!</li>
            <li>That is a good sign.</li>
            <li>On a good day I can get her to take her thumb out of her mouth by saying \\&quot;Thumb!\\&quot; and she will pull it out.  </li>
            <li>and she commented that it tasted really good.</li>
            <li>The good part was that it was inexpensive and according to the ingredients, made from cayenne pepper and citric acid.</li>
            <li>Good Luck.</li>
            <li>this works good</li>
            <li>He said it didn&#x27;t taste good, but he continued to bite.  </li>
            <li>He was putting it on, himself, and then commenting that it tasted good.  </li>
            <li>The result was that my son was sucking even more his thumb, what a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad to buy the good stuff at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use the money to buy something better!</li>
            <li>, hope it works better!</li>
            <li>Thus I can&#x27;t wait until she breaks the habit on her own.  </li>
            <li>And though I do not bite my nails, I put it on my own nails and tried to see what the taste was like.  </li>
            <li>It kind of annoys me because if I scratch my eye or my nose</li>
            <li>Put it on my own nails.</li>
            <li>He even told me he kind of likes the taste.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Mmm, I kind of like it.  </li>
            <li>Not an effective product.</li>
            <li>Now we are going to try Mavala Stop since it has gotten so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>an he was done an he liked not sucking it,so he asked for me to put it on him every night,ty guys.</li>
            <li>Our son is kind of wimpy with spicy stuff</li>
            <li>As I am a busy Mom, I would prefer a product that worked for a couple of days... and this one works best if you apply it a couple of times a day.  </li>
            <li>When i first saw this in stores i jumped for joy.</li>
            <li>And my baby seems to suck even more</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy something with better reviews.</li>
            <li>The stuff works a wee bit better for my preschooler; it helps her remember not to put her hands in her mouth -</li>
            <li>I hoped either they made this better</li>
            <li>I thought it would be OK though, since the thumb-sucker doesn&#x27;t like carbonation or spice.  </li>
            <li>I am not to sure this product works on my son.</li>
            <li>This takes LONGER to ship and has to be applied 4x more then any others.</li>
            <li>i just brought the Mavala hope to have better luck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad we did.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I think she sucked her thumbs even more once</li>
            <li>I hope to have better luck with that than I did with Thum.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have said it better.</li>
            <li>If I wanted my child to put these products in his mouth I&#x27;d be sure to leave my nail polish remover, alcohal and paint in his reach.</li>
            <li>Chances of a home made pepper preparation working are better.</li>
            <li>Maybe for thumb-sucking this product might be better</li>
            <li>and I am able to stand this taste.</li>
            <li>now I am going to have to spend more money on a product and order something over the internet.</li>
            <li>At the time I bought this product, my grand daughter was about 4.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works better for babies and toddlers.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how many coats I put on her fingers or how often I apply it, she will continue sucking her thumbs after she forgets that it&#x27;s on there.</li>
            <li>I think she enjoyed the taste, it&#x27;s a scrappy product,</li>
            <li>we found the ThumbGuard products sold here on Amazon to be the best and final solution.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;bye~:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already got into a nail or skin pretty good before this \\&quot;reminder\\</li>
            <li>you so much happy new year&lt;</li>
            <li>He liked the taste so much he asked for more.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply</li>
            <li>I tried it on my own finger first and it has no discernible taste.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want everything she ate to be tainted by the more powerful stuff</li>
            <li>Hot sauce is a better deterant.</li>
            <li>Hot sauce/taco sauce seem to work better and even that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to have found something</li>
            <li>Mild hot sauce would have been more of a deterent.</li>
            <li>My sweet, clean, comforting thumb.      </li>
            <li>son is special needs, so perhaps he is just too involved to notice.</li>
            <li>My child sucked it right off her fingers!</li>
            <li>Our world is so full of toxicity in our water and air, in pesticides,</li>
            <li>This product is not half as effective.</li>
            <li>It wears off terribly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Applying the solution to one&#x27;s nails is easy, but once there, there&#x27;s no real unpleasant consequences to biting one&#x27;s nails --</li>
            <li>My son found this to be more of an inveresting new flavor.</li>
            <li>She has always been a picky eater, so maybe her taste buds are more sensitive than mine.  </li>
            <li>It certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li>The bottle was broken at the top &amp; some leaked out, but fortunately was able to use most of it.</li>
            <li>Also, my 2 yo quickly became used to the taste and it didn&#x27;t bother her even when first applied.  </li>
            <li>It must be water-based cause any water washes it right off</li>
            <li>I stopped using right away.</li>
            <li>kept going right in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It worked for my daughter right away, she stopped put her finger in the mouth on the first day, not even trying to do it again afterward.</li>
            <li>My nails are nice and long now thanks to Thum!</li>
            <li>Using a substance with Bitrex (a powerful bittering agent, used to denature alcohol and discourage the consumption of poisonous substances like antifreeze) is likely a better solution.</li>
            <li>I finally painted it on my own nail and sucked on it.. doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything at all.  </li>
            <li>The taste is stronger than Mavala and although she does still suck occasionally it has been great, especially for the unconcious sucking while she is asleep.</li>
            <li>You can simple avoid hurt areas and just put it on the nail, then put more on after the skin has healed just a bit.</li>
            <li>and i told him this is the first time I see dirt under his nails.</li>
            <li>First you realize:</li>
            <li>Wish I would have come here first.</li>
            <li>A minute after we first applied it, I heard her say \\&quot;Ew!\\</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine putting \\&quot;hot pepper\\</li>
            <li>I did not look at all 100+ reviews before writing this but most seemed to say it was simply ineffective.</li>
            <li>We picked this up at Walmart and wish we&#x27;d seen the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>I once tried Tabasco on my first kid&#x27;s thumbs to get him to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>We put this on our daughter&#x27;s pacifiers and after putting it in her mouth twice and once more the next day she was cured from needing a pacifier.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty yucky tasting.  </li>
            <li>The reason I went with this product is because I was able to go to my local store and get it, but</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but after I have seen the result, I am impressed and now a believer.</li>
            <li>Thankfully this product was not expensive because it did not work.</li>
            <li>My son (5) was thrilled and came unfortunately over and over again and asked me to put more Thum on his fingernail!</li>
            <li>I bought the Thum for my 23 year old son because he bites his nails to the quick.</li>
            <li>From the reviews I knew it had a more mild flavor than other polishes on the market, but my daughter old still eats 75% of her food with her hands</li>
            <li>Very ineffective.</li>
            <li>I put it on the tip of her nail like it says and when that didnt work i put it on the whole thumb that still didnt work.</li>
            <li>We have gone through the whole bottle now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to see if anything like that is available locally.</li>
            <li>put this on her nail and told her it was going to be REALLY yucky if she put it in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward 25 years or so...  </li>
            <li>She was prepared to kick the habit and agreed that we should put on \\&quot;the stuff that tastes really bad.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>find one that&#x27;s really yucky because this one is sort of yummy.\\</li>
            <li>She has not sucked her Thumb since, so it really worked for our situation.</li>
            <li>This worked very well to persuade my 5yo daughter to quit biting her fingernails AND toenails.</li>
            <li>She wants it on twice a day.  </li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed.</li>
            <li>but now it doesn&#x27;t matter how much I use or when I put it on.</li>
            <li>, this stuff is really yukky, my daughter cant stand me putting this stuff on, Buy Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting</li>
            <li>I purchased this to break my 3 year olds nail biting habit (like mother like son) and it didn&#x27;t really do the trick</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much of a taste for me at all.</li>
            <li>But there she is, fast asleep and sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>My 4 1/2 yr daughter is great at trying not to suck her thumb, but sucks it when she is fast asleep in the early am.  </li>
            <li>Just like many other reviewers reported.</li>
            <li>Very mild taste and doesn&#x27;t stay very long.</li>
            <li>After having seen some reviews I tried first to buy Mavala at our local drug stores without success.</li>
            <li>Can hurt eyes, but once dry it doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off onto eyes easily.  </li>
            <li>thumb guards are the only true solution.</li>
            <li>Now I have ordered Marvala and am desperately awaiting the product having seen all the successful reviews!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff my girls tend to try and suck all the nasty flavor off and just continue to suck their thumbs, but it is still the best stuff I have found to fight thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>Good thing it was only a few dollars</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money by buying this product!!</li>
            <li>We put on a little nail polish and when putting this on, told her it makes it more shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on small children, but for an adult this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>If you want a product that works, make sure it&#x27;s a nail polish that needs reapply every few days, not this product that washes off.</li>
            <li>, then he put his thumb right back in.</li>
            <li>, them stuck it right back in.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;re on to something new.  </li>
            <li>So I thought to give THUM, the only available product in local drug stores, a chance.</li>
            <li>My 5 yr old said she was able to take a few drinks of water and</li>
            <li>My husband has used a similar type of product, so first I applied two coats to just his thumb nail.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married next year and want to kick the habit, so I figured I&#x27;d give this stuff a shot.    </li>
            <li>So as with many other reviewers, I ultimately found this ineffective.  </li>
            <li>My daughter said, &amp;#34;It was hot for only a while&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>We applied a little bit the first day, followed by a huge amount the following days because this stuff DID NOT WORK.</li>
            <li>I learned pretty quickly that if I endured the burn for 10 seconds or so, I could then have my thumb the rest of the night as usual.  </li>
            <li>your buying this for an Adult who is sucking their thumb&lt;</li>
            <li>My 2 year old isn&#x27;t fazed by this product.</li>
            <li>We tried this on our 18 month old.</li>
            <li>I tried this for my 2 yr old who has started biting his nails.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I wish I read the reviews before wasting my money.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I were trying to cure our daughter of thumb sucking while she slept (15 months old).  </li>
            <li>Tried this Thum out on my 2 1/2 year old son to stop his thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old bites his nails</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4.5 year old thumb-sucker.  </li>
            <li>My dad used this to try to get me to stop sucking my thumb when I was about 9 months old.</li>
            <li>I could taste that there is some spice to it since I&#x27;m sensitive to spices.  </li>
            <li>I brought this product from walmart at the advise of my than 2yr old son&#x27;s speech therapist.</li>
            <li>I purchased it at Walmart and intended to try it on my 6 year old because she&#x27;s been biting her nails.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to help encourage my 3 year old son to stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>So, I applied it on thumb of my 2 years old and guess what there was no effect whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 3yr old, when I put it on her index finger</li>
            <li>Thum does not work, my 4 year old</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t deter my 2 year old at all.</li>
            <li>This product just does not work for me as an adult.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old didn&#x27;t skip a beat...</li>
            <li>I purchased this from a pharmacy with the hopes my 2 year old would stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t phase my 2 year old at all.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY........</li>
            <li>We were able to put it on him, but it did not deter him in the least.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to help my 2 year old daughter stop chewing her nails.</li>
            <li>No bad taste not useful doesn&#x27;t help anyone stop biting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He&#x27;s still doing it, at first he said &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34; and 30 minutes later there he goes again with the finger sucking, all 10 fingers are back in his mouth.  </li>
            <li>We even put a layer on her nail, let it dry and reapplied a few more layers</li>
            <li>My concern is that she is becoming bald as she pulls her hair out as she sucks her fingers.  </li>
            <li>Put it on your fingernail and you can barely taste a thing!  </li>
            <li>He came home the first day and said, \\&quot;That stuff only works the first time.\\&quot;      Total waste of money.      </li>
            <li>It left a barely mild burning/tingling sensation on my tongue and down my throat for all of a minute before I drank some water.  </li>
            <li>But it definitly was strong enough he called it Mr Nasty Thumb (LOL) when he tasted his thumb with Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both tried it after that and found that it had very little taste at all and certainly did not stay on for very long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My son is biting his nails less, but it wears off quickly and he&#x27;s back into it.</li>
            <li>I tried it myself and there was barely any flavor to it all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult who&#x27;s been subconsciously biting my nails for years.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 2 year old son who is constantly biting his nails.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s \\&quot;worked\\&quot; during the day so far, but it&#x27;s entirely placebo.  </li>
            <li>Applied a liberal double coat and my 2 year old wasn&#x27;t phased by it</li>
            <li>oh no, it barely tastes like anything so it won&#x27;t stop me from biting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li>There was no &#x27;bitter&#x27; taste at all, just my thumb.  </li>
            <li>Our 21 month old likes to suck her index and middle fingers.  </li>
            <li>Bought this from local pharmacy to stop six year old daughter from biting nails.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at my local pharmacy to help my 2 year old stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>We purchased this through our local pharmacy to try on our 2 year old son.  </li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter who only sucked her fingers at night at bed quit sucking them after using this product every night for 1.5 weeks!</li>
            <li>When we apply to his finger tip and finger he stops sucking his finger for a few minutes then keeps right on going.</li>
            <li>Only time broke my habit when I was ready so not sure much would have helped.  </li>
            <li>There is no bitter deterrent; just spicy, and that doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old baby girl sucks her first two fingers.  </li>
            <li>2 yr old said \\&quot;spicy!\\&quot; when she first tried it, but now just sucks her thumb anyways.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my 18 Month old, did not work for even a single time</li>
            <li>These are some of the very products I keep under lock and key in an effort to protect my little one.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Since some adults bite their nails this is perfect for it.</li>
            <li> Best to reapply after washing hands.  </li>
            <li> This is the BEST product if you want your child to stop sucking their thumb, OR to stop nail biting.  </li>
            <li> Best priced deterent too.</li>
            <li> the product was a great price, but didnt work well for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while she would insert thumb into mouth and not be happy with the experience.  </li>
            <li> He thought it smells great and liked the taste!</li>
            <li> then put some on my own fingers and couldn&#x27;t even tell that it was there!</li>
            <li> That is a good sign.</li>
            <li> On a good day I can get her to take her thumb out of her mouth by saying \\&quot;Thumb!\\&quot; and she will pull it out.  </li>
            <li> and she commented that it tasted really good.</li>
            <li> The good part was that it was inexpensive and according to the ingredients, made from cayenne pepper and citric acid.</li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>
            <li> this works good</li>
            <li> He said it didn&#x27;t taste good, but he continued to bite.  </li>
            <li> He was putting it on, himself, and then commenting that it tasted good.  </li>
            <li> The result was that my son was sucking even more his thumb, what a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad to buy the good stuff at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use the money to buy something better!</li>
            <li> , hope it works better!</li>
            <li> Thus I can&#x27;t wait until she breaks the habit on her own.  </li>
            <li> And though I do not bite my nails, I put it on my own nails and tried to see what the taste was like.  </li>
            <li> It kind of annoys me because if I scratch my eye or my nose</li>
            <li> Put it on my own nails.</li>
            <li> He even told me he kind of likes the taste.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Mmm, I kind of like it.  </li>
            <li> Not an effective product.</li>
            <li> Now we are going to try Mavala Stop since it has gotten so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> an he was done an he liked not sucking it,so he asked for me to put it on him every night,ty guys.</li>
            <li> Our son is kind of wimpy with spicy stuff</li>
            <li> As I am a busy Mom, I would prefer a product that worked for a couple of days... and this one works best if you apply it a couple of times a day.  </li>
            <li> When i first saw this in stores i jumped for joy.</li>
            <li> And my baby seems to suck even more</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy something with better reviews.</li>
            <li> The stuff works a wee bit better for my preschooler; it helps her remember not to put her hands in her mouth -</li>
            <li> I hoped either they made this better</li>
            <li> I thought it would be OK though, since the thumb-sucker doesn&#x27;t like carbonation or spice.  </li>
            <li> I am not to sure this product works on my son.</li>
            <li> This takes LONGER to ship and has to be applied 4x more then any others.</li>
            <li> i just brought the Mavala hope to have better luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad we did.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I think she sucked her thumbs even more once</li>
            <li> I hope to have better luck with that than I did with Thum.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have said it better.</li>
            <li> If I wanted my child to put these products in his mouth I&#x27;d be sure to leave my nail polish remover, alcohal and paint in his reach.</li>
            <li> Chances of a home made pepper preparation working are better.</li>
            <li> Maybe for thumb-sucking this product might be better</li>
            <li> and I am able to stand this taste.</li>
            <li> now I am going to have to spend more money on a product and order something over the internet.</li>
            <li> At the time I bought this product, my grand daughter was about 4.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works better for babies and toddlers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how many coats I put on her fingers or how often I apply it, she will continue sucking her thumbs after she forgets that it&#x27;s on there.</li>
            <li> I think she enjoyed the taste, it&#x27;s a scrappy product,</li>
            <li> we found the ThumbGuard products sold here on Amazon to be the best and final solution.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;bye~:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already got into a nail or skin pretty good before this \\&quot;reminder\\</li>
            <li> you so much happy new year&lt;</li>
            <li> He liked the taste so much he asked for more.  </li>
            <li> easy to apply</li>
            <li> I tried it on my own finger first and it has no discernible taste.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want everything she ate to be tainted by the more powerful stuff</li>
            <li> Hot sauce is a better deterant.</li>
            <li> Hot sauce/taco sauce seem to work better and even that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to have found something</li>
            <li> Mild hot sauce would have been more of a deterent.</li>
            <li> My sweet, clean, comforting thumb.      </li>
            <li> son is special needs, so perhaps he is just too involved to notice.</li>
            <li> My child sucked it right off her fingers!</li>
            <li> Our world is so full of toxicity in our water and air, in pesticides,</li>
            <li> This product is not half as effective.</li>
            <li> It wears off terribly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Applying the solution to one&#x27;s nails is easy, but once there, there&#x27;s no real unpleasant consequences to biting one&#x27;s nails --</li>
            <li> My son found this to be more of an inveresting new flavor.</li>
            <li> She has always been a picky eater, so maybe her taste buds are more sensitive than mine.  </li>
            <li> It certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken at the top &amp; some leaked out, but fortunately was able to use most of it.</li>
            <li> Also, my 2 yo quickly became used to the taste and it didn&#x27;t bother her even when first applied.  </li>
            <li> It must be water-based cause any water washes it right off</li>
            <li> I stopped using right away.</li>
            <li> kept going right in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It worked for my daughter right away, she stopped put her finger in the mouth on the first day, not even trying to do it again afterward.</li>
            <li> My nails are nice and long now thanks to Thum!</li>
            <li> Using a substance with Bitrex (a powerful bittering agent, used to denature alcohol and discourage the consumption of poisonous substances like antifreeze) is likely a better solution.</li>
            <li> I finally painted it on my own nail and sucked on it.. doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything at all.  </li>
            <li> The taste is stronger than Mavala and although she does still suck occasionally it has been great, especially for the unconcious sucking while she is asleep.</li>
            <li> You can simple avoid hurt areas and just put it on the nail, then put more on after the skin has healed just a bit.</li>
            <li> and i told him this is the first time I see dirt under his nails.</li>
            <li> First you realize:</li>
            <li> Wish I would have come here first.</li>
            <li> A minute after we first applied it, I heard her say \\&quot;Ew!\\</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine putting \\&quot;hot pepper\\</li>
            <li> I did not look at all 100+ reviews before writing this but most seemed to say it was simply ineffective.</li>
            <li> We picked this up at Walmart and wish we&#x27;d seen the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> I once tried Tabasco on my first kid&#x27;s thumbs to get him to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> We put this on our daughter&#x27;s pacifiers and after putting it in her mouth twice and once more the next day she was cured from needing a pacifier.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty yucky tasting.  </li>
            <li> The reason I went with this product is because I was able to go to my local store and get it, but</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after I have seen the result, I am impressed and now a believer.</li>
            <li> Thankfully this product was not expensive because it did not work.</li>
            <li> My son (5) was thrilled and came unfortunately over and over again and asked me to put more Thum on his fingernail!</li>
            <li> I bought the Thum for my 23 year old son because he bites his nails to the quick.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I knew it had a more mild flavor than other polishes on the market, but my daughter old still eats 75% of her food with her hands</li>
            <li> Very ineffective.</li>
            <li> I put it on the tip of her nail like it says and when that didnt work i put it on the whole thumb that still didnt work.</li>
            <li> We have gone through the whole bottle now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to see if anything like that is available locally.</li>
            <li> put this on her nail and told her it was going to be REALLY yucky if she put it in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward 25 years or so...  </li>
            <li> She was prepared to kick the habit and agreed that we should put on \\&quot;the stuff that tastes really bad.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> find one that&#x27;s really yucky because this one is sort of yummy.\\</li>
            <li> She has not sucked her Thumb since, so it really worked for our situation.</li>
            <li> This worked very well to persuade my 5yo daughter to quit biting her fingernails AND toenails.</li>
            <li> She wants it on twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed.</li>
            <li> but now it doesn&#x27;t matter how much I use or when I put it on.</li>
            <li> , this stuff is really yukky, my daughter cant stand me putting this stuff on, Buy Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting</li>
            <li> I purchased this to break my 3 year olds nail biting habit (like mother like son) and it didn&#x27;t really do the trick</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much of a taste for me at all.</li>
            <li> But there she is, fast asleep and sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> My 4 1/2 yr daughter is great at trying not to suck her thumb, but sucks it when she is fast asleep in the early am.  </li>
            <li> Just like many other reviewers reported.</li>
            <li> Very mild taste and doesn&#x27;t stay very long.</li>
            <li> After having seen some reviews I tried first to buy Mavala at our local drug stores without success.</li>
            <li> Can hurt eyes, but once dry it doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off onto eyes easily.  </li>
            <li> thumb guards are the only true solution.</li>
            <li> Now I have ordered Marvala and am desperately awaiting the product having seen all the successful reviews!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff my girls tend to try and suck all the nasty flavor off and just continue to suck their thumbs, but it is still the best stuff I have found to fight thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Good thing it was only a few dollars</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money by buying this product!!</li>
            <li> We put on a little nail polish and when putting this on, told her it makes it more shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on small children, but for an adult this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you want a product that works, make sure it&#x27;s a nail polish that needs reapply every few days, not this product that washes off.</li>
            <li> , then he put his thumb right back in.</li>
            <li> , them stuck it right back in.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;re on to something new.  </li>
            <li> So I thought to give THUM, the only available product in local drug stores, a chance.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old said she was able to take a few drinks of water and</li>
            <li> My husband has used a similar type of product, so first I applied two coats to just his thumb nail.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married next year and want to kick the habit, so I figured I&#x27;d give this stuff a shot.    </li>
            <li> So as with many other reviewers, I ultimately found this ineffective.  </li>
            <li> My daughter said, &amp;#34;It was hot for only a while&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> We applied a little bit the first day, followed by a huge amount the following days because this stuff DID NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> I learned pretty quickly that if I endured the burn for 10 seconds or so, I could then have my thumb the rest of the night as usual.  </li>
            <li> your buying this for an Adult who is sucking their thumb&lt;</li>
            <li> My 2 year old isn&#x27;t fazed by this product.</li>
            <li> We tried this on our 18 month old.</li>
            <li> I tried this for my 2 yr old who has started biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I wish I read the reviews before wasting my money.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I were trying to cure our daughter of thumb sucking while she slept (15 months old).  </li>
            <li> Tried this Thum out on my 2 1/2 year old son to stop his thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old bites his nails</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4.5 year old thumb-sucker.  </li>
            <li> My dad used this to try to get me to stop sucking my thumb when I was about 9 months old.</li>
            <li> I could taste that there is some spice to it since I&#x27;m sensitive to spices.  </li>
            <li> I brought this product from walmart at the advise of my than 2yr old son&#x27;s speech therapist.</li>
            <li> I purchased it at Walmart and intended to try it on my 6 year old because she&#x27;s been biting her nails.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help encourage my 3 year old son to stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> So, I applied it on thumb of my 2 years old and guess what there was no effect whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 3yr old, when I put it on her index finger</li>
            <li> Thum does not work, my 4 year old</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t deter my 2 year old at all.</li>
            <li> This product just does not work for me as an adult.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old didn&#x27;t skip a beat...</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a pharmacy with the hopes my 2 year old would stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t phase my 2 year old at all.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY........</li>
            <li> We were able to put it on him, but it did not deter him in the least.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to help my 2 year old daughter stop chewing her nails.</li>
            <li> No bad taste not useful doesn&#x27;t help anyone stop biting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He&#x27;s still doing it, at first he said &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34; and 30 minutes later there he goes again with the finger sucking, all 10 fingers are back in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> We even put a layer on her nail, let it dry and reapplied a few more layers</li>
            <li> My concern is that she is becoming bald as she pulls her hair out as she sucks her fingers.  </li>
            <li> Put it on your fingernail and you can barely taste a thing!  </li>
            <li> He came home the first day and said, \\&quot;That stuff only works the first time.\\&quot;      Total waste of money.      </li>
            <li> It left a barely mild burning/tingling sensation on my tongue and down my throat for all of a minute before I drank some water.  </li>
            <li> But it definitly was strong enough he called it Mr Nasty Thumb (LOL) when he tasted his thumb with Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both tried it after that and found that it had very little taste at all and certainly did not stay on for very long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My son is biting his nails less, but it wears off quickly and he&#x27;s back into it.</li>
            <li> I tried it myself and there was barely any flavor to it all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult who&#x27;s been subconsciously biting my nails for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 2 year old son who is constantly biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s \\&quot;worked\\&quot; during the day so far, but it&#x27;s entirely placebo.  </li>
            <li> Applied a liberal double coat and my 2 year old wasn&#x27;t phased by it</li>
            <li> oh no, it barely tastes like anything so it won&#x27;t stop me from biting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li> There was no &#x27;bitter&#x27; taste at all, just my thumb.  </li>
            <li> Our 21 month old likes to suck her index and middle fingers.  </li>
            <li> Bought this from local pharmacy to stop six year old daughter from biting nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local pharmacy to help my 2 year old stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> We purchased this through our local pharmacy to try on our 2 year old son.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter who only sucked her fingers at night at bed quit sucking them after using this product every night for 1.5 weeks!</li>
            <li> When we apply to his finger tip and finger he stops sucking his finger for a few minutes then keeps right on going.</li>
            <li> Only time broke my habit when I was ready so not sure much would have helped.  </li>
            <li> There is no bitter deterrent; just spicy, and that doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old baby girl sucks her first two fingers.  </li>
            <li> 2 yr old said \\&quot;spicy!\\&quot; when she first tried it, but now just sucks her thumb anyways.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my 18 Month old, did not work for even a single time</li>
            <li> These are some of the very products I keep under lock and key in an effort to protect my little one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a mild little odd taste and in no way a deterrent</li>
            <li> He is very patient while I apply the nail polish to his finger, and he helps blow on it to dry it, but a few minutes later, the finger is back in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I knew I was in trouble when the older one tasted it and said,</li>
            <li> , I spilled a little bit of it on my table and 1.5 seconds later when I wiped it off the paint on my brand new table</li>
            <li> Let it dry, 2 minutes later, they were back to chewing their nails.  </li>
            <li> She sucks all 4 of her fingers consistently.</li>
            <li> My toddler stuck his thumb in his mouth, pulled it out and gave it a strange look, then went back to sucking it.</li>
            <li> Applied liberally to the finger nails of my 2 yrs old because they were chewing their nails off down into the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter (who has always sucked her thumb) had recently started sucking her thumb raw, so it was cracked and red.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old figured out that if he washed his hands a few times, this stuff would disappear....and back to biting he went.  </li>
            <li> It gets two stars because it is possible, with some children who are not particularly attached to thumb-sucking, that it could work.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want him to go as long as I did.  </li>
            <li> I was walking by then, and I climbed out of my bed in the middle of the night, walked into my parents bedroom, and rubbed my wet thumb with Thum on it all over his face and mouth.</li>
            <li> and that does not take long.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This item was complete waste of time for us.</li>
            <li> b/c you have to keep your mouth on your finger for a long time in order to get any sense of spice.</li>
            <li> IT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK, IT IS SOOO MILD, I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE, SADLY OUR CVS PHARMACIST RECOMMENDED IT,</li>
            <li> this product is straight bum, its suppose to have a pepper like taste and it basically a tingle, straight garbage, not bitter, sweet, sour, salty, nothing, just horrible</li>
            <li> what little \\&quot;burning\\&quot; from the solution is minimal (and I&#x27;m usually sensitive to spicy/hot stuff) and comes about a minute or so after one puts a finger in one&#x27;s mouth.    </li>
            <li> We have recently learned of Mavala and holy cow</li>
            <li> :/ so much for that $6.99 down the drain.</li>
            <li> She commented that while it didn&#x27;t stop her from biting while she&#x27;s doing it, it did burn her throat later, I guess when she ate and washed the polished nails down.....</li>
            <li> The other twin is still sucking her thumb, but only because I am still not consistent.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my three year old daughter who sucks her thumb non stop.</li>
            <li> my 2 year old, who is a thumb sucker, licked her finger looked and me and said, \\&quot;i like it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I put this on my 5year old daughter&#x27;s fingers that she sucks non-stop</li>
            <li> My 2 year old is a thumb sucker, and I am trying to wean him from it.</li>
            <li> Product has no taste, just peppery sensation, like spicy.  </li>
            <li> It does not taste spicy or bitter at all.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> She has blisters on both, and nothing we say stops it for longer than just a few minutes - especially when she&#x27;s sleepy.  </li>
            <li> it was a TOTAL waste of money, I can&#x27;t taste a THING and neither can</li>
            <li> This item is a total waste, I bought it for my 2yo daughter to encourage her to stop sucking her finger.</li>
            <li> We tried this product for our determined nail biter and it had absolutely no effect.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep her thumb out of her mouth at night or nap time, the flavor just is not strong enough.  </li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I will try something else.  </li>
            <li> She then asked if they had any other flavors.  </li>
            <li> I continued to read the product label to see what other poisons this company intended me to give my child.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I read the Active Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Cayenne Pepper Extract; Citric Acid; Isopropyl Alcohol; Acetone;</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Active ingredients:</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not really a bad taste, it&#x27;s a very faint bitter taste, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Many people said the kids just sucked past the bad flavor and kept on going.</li>
            <li> In a way I am happy I didn&#x27;t order it online b/c after the wait of it to get sent to me and then to get the disappointed of this product not working, I would have been angry.</li>
            <li> Its not worth the time and money to go get it.</li>
            <li> His nails are down to nothing.</li>
            <li> IT was sooo BAD and a fake not the original one.. as it had NO TASTE !!!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;hot\\&quot; can be rubbed into eyes and other areas where you do not want to have a burning sensation!    </li>
            <li> Adults don&#x27;t need the worst tastes or the spiciest after taste, what we need is a slightly less than gentle reminder and that is exactly what this is.</li>
            <li> then there is a lingering burning sensation for a few seconds, but you learn quickly not to.</li>
            <li> The little dude continued sucking his finger like nothing had been applied</li>
            <li> $7 down the drain!  </li>
            <li> Waste of Money.</li>
            <li> He stuck thumb in mouth, disliked taste, but within 30 minutes was sucking thumb again.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> waste of money.....</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> We will be seeing him again in a few months in hopes</li>
            <li> a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> even regular nail polish smell worse then</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> It was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my autistic son who bites his nails and fingers until they bleed and get infected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> it is a waste of money</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work, the child was biting their nails again as soon as it dried.</li>
            <li> It worked for a few hours, then the thumb-sucking resumed.</li>
            <li> As soon as this had dried on her nails...</li>
            <li> A company should not willingly sell a product with such a blatant disregard for the quality.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all for my son, he was sucking his thumb within minutes without a single complaint about the taste!  </li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t slow her down at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work it wipes r ight off the finger not very effective at all</li>
            <li> He is sucking his finger raw.</li>
            <li> My daughter, being a small child of 2 1/2, rubbed her teary eyes with the solution finger, which I can imagine burned like hell.</li>
            <li> It was pointless.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> You will not see effects of ingesting this small amount of poison immediately.</li>
            <li> I guess as an adult this might work for you, as it would remind you not to bite your nails, suck your fingers, but a child that has a SERIOUS bad habit I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Amazon, and especially Target, should be ashamed of selling such a worthless product.</li>
            <li> That stuff is disgusting and not tolerable even for the most determined thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> I paid $7 for this at the local pharmacy and was surprised because I didn&#x27;t think it tasted very bad and didn&#x27;t think it would work as a deterrent.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the negative reviews of this product, I was very skeptical if this would work for my 4 years old daughter.</li>
            <li> I was a thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> Ugh... this stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write this since the majority of reviews for Thum are negative.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter since she sucks her fingers, and decided to try it out myself to see how it worked.  </li>
            <li> This product does not work at all if your child really sucks his fingers or thum</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s 5 and still sucks her thumbs.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t phase her she still sucks her finger.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> still sucks her thumb after I applied it.</li>
            <li> My daughter bites her nails and sucks on her fingers</li>
            <li> Our initial hope for this product was swiftly lost---once our child had become acclimated to the taste, which is apparently not sufficiently repellent to deter thumb-sucking.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it just didn&#x27;t taste bad enough or what.</li>
            <li> --seriously people, why not just let your kid drink nail polish remover.    </li>
            <li> And eventually such toxicity accumulates in the body and years later something indeed dreadful could befall the person</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t taste bad enough.</li>
            <li> I want a treatment that actually tastes bad</li>
            <li> They replied that &amp;#34;They only SELL the product.&amp;#34;  I consider this extremely bad business.  </li>
            <li> At that time it is not a good deterrent.  </li>
            <li> stuff nasty - and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I am trying a Mavala Stop instead; too bad it takes so long to get here.  </li>
            <li> it literally sucks!  </li>
            <li> It really makes you stop nail bitting even if you have a long time with that bad habit that makes your hands look awful</li>
            <li> erm, I mean, Thum was applied!</li>
            <li> you are probably stupid enough to ingest Laquer, Acetone and  Isopropyl</li>
            <li> I am also disappointed I spent $7 on this product at Walgreens b/c</li>
            <li> and I could only taste a very faint pepper flavor that wasn&#x27;t at all unpleasant, and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s just too weak.</li>
            <li> Afterall we are talking about a product I intended to give to my two year old baby, but realizing the idea is that the product is supposed to taste terrible</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and can&#x27;t seem to kick this disgusting habit of biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> I asked what was wrong</li>
            <li> This product is useless.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t helped one bit, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I suspected that it was possibly just a bad batch, since it was literally worthless, so I contacted the seller.  </li>
            <li> My daughter used this product and unfortunately it did not work for her.  </li>
            <li> But for anyone with an established habit, it is unlikely to work.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it does not work.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need something to taste nasty and ruin food for me like the other things out there.</li>
            <li> This stuff is useless!</li>
            <li> This product help me stop biting my nails with its slightly unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> A bad summer cold helped me kick it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even taste that bad.</li>
            <li> Put it on my finger nail, tasted like a bad batch of salsa, but still tolerable if you eat salsa alot.  </li>
            <li> She never even flinched as if it tasted bad or noticed it was even there.  </li>
            <li> She still bit her nails just as bad.</li>
            <li> When I asked her if it tasted bad she always said no.</li>
            <li> Is this stuff supposed to taste bad?</li>
            <li> put it on your tongue and it tastes bad.  </li>
            <li> I feel sick.</li>
            <li> I was aghast!</li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed about this product.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  </li>
            <li> am very disappointed..</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> She was hysterical.</li>
            <li> This kinda works, it&#x27;s not that horrible tasting...</li>
            <li> This stuff was horrible.</li>
            <li> The awful taste is supposed to wake her up so she can choose to not suck her thumb...</li>

            <li> My wife bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I read the Active Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Cayenne Pepper Extract; Citric Acid; Isopropyl Alcohol; Acetone; Lacquer&lt;br /&gt;I threw it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;Are you kidding me???&lt;br /&gt;If your buying this for thumb sucking then I imagine its for a 2 year old.&lt;br /&gt;This is what you want for your child?&lt;br /&gt;If your buying this for an Adult who is sucking their thumb&lt;br /&gt;then you are probably stupid enough to ingest Laquer, Acetone and  Isopropyl Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Not me. not my child.</li>
            <li> The liquid caused delay, but didn&#x27;t stop the finger biting.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work it wipes r ight off the finger not very effective at all</li>
            <li> This product did not work for us.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old isn&#x27;t fazed by this product. Doesn&#x27;t work the way I need it to.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff my girls tend to try and suck all the nasty flavor off and just continue to suck their thumbs, but it is still the best stuff I have found to fight thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Waste of Money. Nothing else.</li>
            <li> We tried this on our 18 month old. He is sucking his finger raw. When we apply to his finger tip and finger he stops sucking his finger for a few minutes then keeps right on going. Very ineffective.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 18 Month old, did not work for even a single time</li>
            <li> This product works well enough but for a short while.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long. As I am a busy Mom, I would prefer a product that worked for a couple of days... and this one works best if you apply it a couple of times a day.  It must be water-based cause any water washes it right off and you need to start over.</li>
            <li> IT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK, IT IS SOOO MILD, I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE, SADLY OUR CVS PHARMACIST RECOMMENDED IT, LAST TIME I GO THEIR FOR ADVICE, LIARS!</li>
            <li> Do not use this on your children! It contains acetone, Isopropyl Alcohol, and Lacquer!!!!!    My daughter, being a small child of 2 1/2, rubbed her teary eyes with the solution finger, which I can imagine burned like hell. She was hysterical. The skin around her mouth turned blotch red.    Buy Clove Essential Oil and Dilute it 1:2 in olive oil.</li>
            <li> After having seen some reviews I tried first to buy Mavala at our local drug stores without success. So I thought to give THUM, the only available product in local drug stores, a chance. My son (5) was thrilled and came unfortunately over and over again and asked me to put more Thum on his fingernail! He thought it smells great and liked the taste! The result was that my son was sucking even more his thumb, what a great product. So watch out as children seem to become hooked on THUM! Now I have ordered Marvala and am desperately awaiting the product having seen all the successful reviews!</li>
            <li> My 2 year old baby girl sucks her first two fingers.  My concern is that she is becoming bald as she pulls her hair out as she sucks her fingers.  Thus I can&#x27;t wait until she breaks the habit on her own.  A friend gave me Thum.  And my baby seems to suck even more - now actually going to sleep with her fingers in her mouth.  Finally, after 3 days, I tried it.  Nothing.  No taste and definitely no cayenne pepper incentive.  Forget it.  Based on other reviews, I will try something else.  Thanx for the info.  Hopefully it will work on her fingers and her bottle nipple.</li>
            <li> I tried this for my 2 yr old who has started biting his nails.  And though I do not bite my nails, I put it on my own nails and tried to see what the taste was like.  I tasted nothing.  My son continues to bite his nails after an application.  My search continues.  I plan to try the Mavala product based on Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS I bought this in the children&#x27;s aisle at the pharmacy.  When I got home I saw that there was acetone, alcohol and laquer--seriously people, why not just let your kid drink nail polish remover.    Oh yeah, and it says, \\&quot;for external use only\\&quot;!!! it is for thumb sucking!  It also says  \\&quot;will stain clothing and furniture finishes\\&quot;    Disgraceful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my three year old daughter who sucks her thumb non stop. I put it on the tip of her nail like it says and when that didnt work i put it on the whole thumb that still didnt work. We have gone through the whole bottle now and she is still sucking her thumb. Do NOT waste your money by buying this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on small children, but for an adult this works perfectly. I don&#x27;t need something to taste nasty and ruin food for me like the other things out there. It kind of annoys me because if I scratch my eye or my nose then there is a lingering burning sensation for a few seconds, but you learn quickly not to. This product help me stop biting my nails with its slightly unpleasant taste. Since some adults bite their nails this is perfect for it. Adults don&#x27;t need the worst tastes or the spiciest after taste, what we need is a slightly less than gentle reminder and that is exactly what this is. My nails are nice and long now thanks to Thum!</li>
            <li> We applied a little bit the first day, followed by a huge amount the following days because this stuff DID NOT WORK. My 5 yr old said she was able to take a few drinks of water and the taste was GONE. I tried it myself and there was barely any flavor to it all. I guess as an adult this might work for you, as it would remind you not to bite your nails, suck your fingers, but a child that has a SERIOUS bad habit I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Wow, I wish I read the reviews before wasting my money.  I purchased the product to get my son to stop sucking his thumb.  My husband has used a similar type of product, so first I applied two coats to just his thumb nail.  Ben - 1 Mommy - 0.  I then decided to coat his entire thumb liberally with the product.  He stuck thumb in mouth, disliked taste, but within 30 minutes was sucking thumb again.  So I thought I would give it a taste.  Product has no taste, just peppery sensation, like spicy.  There is no bitter deterrent; just spicy, and that doesn&#x27;t last.  Save your money and buy something with better reviews.</li>
            <li> This kinda works, it&#x27;s not that horrible tasting...but it literally ruined the finish on my coffee table, I spilled a little bit of it on my table and 1.5 seconds later when I wiped it off the paint on my brand new table came off with it...BS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult who&#x27;s been subconsciously biting my nails for years. I&#x27;m getting married next year and want to kick the habit, so I figured I&#x27;d give this stuff a shot.    It has essentially no effect. Applying the solution to one&#x27;s nails is easy, but once there, there&#x27;s no real unpleasant consequences to biting one&#x27;s nails -- what little \\&quot;burning\\&quot; from the solution is minimal (and I&#x27;m usually sensitive to spicy/hot stuff) and comes about a minute or so after one puts a finger in one&#x27;s mouth.    Using a substance with Bitrex (a powerful bittering agent, used to denature alcohol and discourage the consumption of poisonous substances like antifreeze) is likely a better solution. I&#x27;ll have to see if anything like that is available locally.</li>
            <li> product works when you put it on, but you have to continue to apply it because it comes off with the smallest bit of water. It also will turn your nail a shade of red.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the local drugstore.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything.  It smells like acetone, but doesn&#x27;t taste like anything.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Worked well on one of my twins, though it took over a week because I didn&#x27;t apply it consistenly morning and night.  The other twin is still sucking her thumb, but only because I am still not consistent.  It seems to work well for up to 8 hours, though it comes off in a couple hand washings.  Best to reapply after washing hands.  Can hurt eyes, but once dry it doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off onto eyes easily.  Will hurt skin if there are any breaks or cuts.  You can simple avoid hurt areas and just put it on the nail, then put more on after the skin has healed just a bit.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were trying to cure our daughter of thumb sucking while she slept (15 months old).  We put this one here thumbs and she immediately began sucking her thumb while she was awake as well.  We returned the product and instead used two tube socks held in place by her long-sleeve pajamas.  That seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I bought the Thum for my 23 year old son because he bites his nails to the quick. He has been using Thum and his nails are growing, he showed me his nails and i told him this is the first time I see dirt under his nails. That is a good sign.</li>
            <li> This product does not work whatsoever!!</li>
            <li> Tried this Thum out on my 2 1/2 year old son to stop his thumb sucking. He liked the taste so much he asked for more.  Amazon, and especially Target, should be ashamed of selling such a worthless product. It almost amounts to fraud.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 2 year old son who is constantly biting his nails.  I put the medicine on for over a week.  My son continued to bite his nails and he would just say \\&quot;spice\\&quot; meaning he could taste something but it was not enough to deter him!</li>
            <li> I got this to stop my 3-year-old from sucking her thumb.  On a good day I can get her to take her thumb out of her mouth by saying \\&quot;Thumb!\\&quot; and she will pull it out.  But on cranky days or at night there is no stopping her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on her nail and told her it was going to be REALLY yucky if she put it in her mouth.  It&#x27;s \\&quot;worked\\&quot; during the day so far, but it&#x27;s entirely placebo.  It doesn&#x27;t keep her thumb out of her mouth at night or nap time, the flavor just is not strong enough.  I finally painted it on my own nail and sucked on it.. doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything at all.  It&#x27;s like a mild little odd taste and in no way a deterrent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to have to try something else!</li>
            <li> Tried this for my kid. Did not deter her. Put it on my own nails. Doesn&#x27;t even taste that bad. I sucked the flavor off instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product on both my kids. My toddler stuck his thumb in his mouth, pulled it out and gave it a strange look, then went back to sucking it. The stuff works a wee bit better for my preschooler; it helps her remember not to put her hands in her mouth - IF she&#x27;s in the mood to try to stop her nail biting and finger sucking. If she&#x27;s not in the mood to change, it doesn&#x27;t work at all. It&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t taste bad enough.</li>
            <li> Applied a liberal double coat and my 2 year old wasn&#x27;t phased by it AT ALL....  her fingers may as well have been dipped in candy.</li>
            <li> My mom used this on me when I was a kid.  I was a thumb sucker.  I learned pretty quickly that if I endured the burn for 10 seconds or so, I could then have my thumb the rest of the night as usual.  My sweet, clean, comforting thumb.      I eventually gave up my thumb sucking...  when I was 12!  A bad summer cold helped me kick it.  This didn&#x27;t.      Fast forward 25 years or so...  I tried this on my son, to break his finger sucking.  He&#x27;s 6.  He&#x27;s doing it in school.  It&#x27;s time to give it up.  I didn&#x27;t want him to go as long as I did.  I hoped either they made this better or he wouldn&#x27;t figure it didn&#x27;t last...  oh well.  He came home the first day and said, \\&quot;That stuff only works the first time.\\&quot;      Total waste of money.      We have recently learned of Mavala and holy cow is THAT stuff nasty - and long lasting.  I&#x27;m hanging my hopes on it.  Thum is for the birds.</li>
            <li> Ugh... this stuff sucks. First you realize: oh no, it barely tastes like anything so it won&#x27;t stop me from biting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;AND THEN... THEN comes the stomach ache. I feel sick. Would never recommend this for anyone. I want a treatment that actually tastes bad so I won&#x27;t bite.</li>
            <li> does not work, tried it for a week with no results</li>
            <li> if it was possible i would put zero stars.  my 2 year old, who is a thumb sucker, licked her finger looked and me and said, \\&quot;i like it\\&quot;. continued on her way with thumb in mouth.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old bites his nails so I bought this. He did not hesitate to continue biting even one minute after applying. He even told me he kind of likes the taste.</li>
            <li> the product was a great price, but didnt work well for my daughter. I put the product on her thumb nail before bed time and with in minutes, she was still sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4.5 year old thumb-sucker.  She was prepared to kick the habit and agreed that we should put on \\&quot;the stuff that tastes really bad.\\&quot;  Her 8-yr-old sister asked to have it done too, for solidarity only, since she doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb.  I knew I was in trouble when the older one tasted it and said, \\&quot;Mmm, I kind of like it.  It&#x27;s spicy and fizzy.\\&quot;  I thought it would be OK though, since the thumb-sucker doesn&#x27;t like carbonation or spice.  Wrong.  She had no qualms sucking her thumb with this stuff on and even asked me to \\&quot;please find one that&#x27;s really yucky because this one is sort of yummy.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m going for the Mavala next.</li>
            <li> Applied liberally to the finger nails of my 2 yrs old because they were chewing their nails off down into the nail bed.  Let it dry, 2 minutes later, they were back to chewing their nails.  Put it on my finger nail, tasted like a bad batch of salsa, but still tolerable if you eat salsa alot.  If the person can tolerate \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; (I know that&#x27;s relative) food, this won&#x27;t stop them.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old figured out that if he washed his hands a few times, this stuff would disappear....and back to biting he went.  If you want a product that works, make sure it&#x27;s a nail polish that needs reapply every few days, not this product that washes off.</li>
            <li> My dad used this to try to get me to stop sucking my thumb when I was about 9 months old. I was walking by then, and I climbed out of my bed in the middle of the night, walked into my parents bedroom, and rubbed my wet thumb with Thum on it all over his face and mouth. He woke up with burning eyes and mouth, and never used it again.</li>
            <li> Simply does not work.  Tried on my one-year-old daughter, and she was sucking her thumb minutes later.  Wish I would have come here first.</li>
            <li> I am not to sure this product works on my son. He continually chews his finger nails even when applied.</li>
            <li> this product is straight bum, its suppose to have a pepper like taste and it basically a tingle, straight garbage, not bitter, sweet, sour, salty, nothing, just horrible</li>
            <li> I wanted to write this since the majority of reviews for Thum are negative.  My four year old daughter (who has always sucked her thumb) had recently started sucking her thumb raw, so it was cracked and red. I paid $7 for this at the local pharmacy and was surprised because I didn&#x27;t think it tasted very bad and didn&#x27;t think it would work as a deterrent.  A minute after we first applied it, I heard her say \\&quot;Ew!\\&quot;  I asked what was wrong and she said it tasted spicy.  She has always been a picky eater, so maybe her taste buds are more sensitive than mine.  She has not sucked her Thumb since, so it really worked for our situation.</li>
            <li> This worked very well to persuade my 5yo daughter to quit biting her fingernails AND toenails. Did not work instantly, but kicked the habit over several weeks.  However, she hates anything spicy. Her sister loves spicy things and used to beg to use it!  So, it&#x27;s not going to work for everyone. If your child doesn&#x27;t like the taste, it will work. If they don&#x27;t mind it, it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter since she sucks her fingers, and decided to try it out myself to see how it worked.  It was pointless.  There was no &#x27;bitter&#x27; taste at all, just my thumb.  I could taste that there is some spice to it since I&#x27;m sensitive to spices.  It left a barely mild burning/tingling sensation on my tongue and down my throat for all of a minute before I drank some water.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I would have said -0- stars if I could have. There is NO taste-zero- to this product.  It was like there was nothing on my fingernail at all.</li>
            <li> I put this on my 5year old daughter&#x27;s fingers that she sucks non-stop and she commented that it tasted really good. She then asked if they had any other flavors.  Don&#x27;t bother with this.</li>
            <li> We applied this to our daughter&#x27;s thumb as soon as it came in. This stuff didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t slow her down at all. I guess it&#x27;s time to go &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; on this problem.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  The taste/burning sensation is delayed.  I&#x27;ve already got into a nail or skin pretty good before this \\&quot;reminder\\&quot; goes into effect.  At that time it is not a good deterrent.  I can&#x27;t imagine putting \\&quot;hot pepper\\&quot; taste onto a toddler or babies fingers!!  The \\&quot;hot\\&quot; can be rubbed into eyes and other areas where you do not want to have a burning sensation!    Not an effective product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as well as the Malava Stop. This product is not half as effective. This takes LONGER to ship and has to be applied 4x more then any others. The Malava is applied ONCE every TWO days and this is TWICE a day. Use the money to buy something better!</li>
            <li> I brought this product from walmart at the advise of my than 2yr old son&#x27;s speech therapist. This product does not work at all if your child really sucks his fingers or thum they will just lick there hands until its gone. and that does not take long. waste of money.....Do not buy this at all i just brought the Mavala hope to have better luck.</li>
            <li> This stuff was horrible. I put it on my sons finger nails. The next day the skin was peeling. I stopped using right away.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Does not work</li>
            <li> This product is useless. I purchased it at Walmart and intended to try it on my 6 year old because she&#x27;s been biting her nails. I tried it on my own finger first and it has no discernible taste. Package says it contains cayenne pepper extract and citric acid. It does not taste spicy or bitter at all.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old is a thumb sucker, and I am trying to wean him from it. Thought that this product might help, and it did - for about 20 min., then he put his thumb right back in. The packaging says to apply twice a day, but after a short time, the taste either went away, or my son got used to it. The good part was that it was inexpensive and according to the ingredients, made from cayenne pepper and citric acid.</li>
            <li> We are trying to stop our three year old from sucking her thumb and initially tried Mavala which worked like a charm for our 5 year old a few years ago but our youngest wasn&#x27;t bothered by the taste so I was about to spend a fortune on the thumb guard but thought for $3 I&#x27;d try Thum. I&#x27;m so glad we did. The taste is stronger than Mavala and although she does still suck occasionally it has been great, especially for the unconcious sucking while she is asleep. It certainly worth a try. Good Luck.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help encourage my 3 year old son to stop sucking his thumb.  We have tried applying this several times.  It hasn&#x27;t helped one bit, unfortunately.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Hot sauce is a better deterant.</li>
            <li> The little dude continued sucking his finger like nothing had been applied</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  It does not work at all. I suspected that it was possibly just a bad batch, since it was literally worthless, so I contacted the seller.  They replied that &amp;#34;They only SELL the product.&amp;#34;  I consider this extremely bad business.  A company should not willingly sell a product with such a blatant disregard for the quality. Whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy Thum, and I would also suggest avoiding this seller.</li>
            <li> IT was sooo BAD and a fake not the original one.. as it had NO TASTE !!!am very disappointed..&lt;br /&gt;GO buy it from a pharmacy</li>
            <li> We finally got our daughter to STOP sucking her thumb!  We put on a little nail polish and when putting this on, told her it makes it more shiny.  She wants it on twice a day.  Every once in a while she would insert thumb into mouth and not be happy with the experience.  The dentist told us should would end up needing braces if she kept sucking her thumb.  We will be seeing him again in a few months in hopes the out come will be a bit different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT TO STOP THE THUMB SUCKING!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So, I applied it on thumb of my 2 years old and guess what there was no effect whatsoever. I think Amazon should stop selling this product. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s 5 and still sucks her thumbs. A lot! Was told about Mavala Stop and searched my local drug stores to find some. Could not find Mavala Stop, but I did find Thum and decided to give it a go. It may as well have been Kool-Aid on my daughter&#x27;s thumbs cos it didn&#x27;t stop her at all. As a matter of fact, I think she sucked her thumbs even more once the Kool-Aid...erm, I mean, Thum was applied! I ended up ordering the Mavala Stop. I hope to have better luck with that than I did with Thum.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in the pharmacy and read the ingredients. I was aghast! Basically it&#x27;s cayenne pepper and Acetone and Isopropyl alcohol. It was nail polish with cayenne pepper. I did not look at all 100+ reviews before writing this but most seemed to say it was simply ineffective. How about TOXIC? Many people said the kids just sucked past the bad flavor and kept on going. That means these parents allowed their kids to eat nail polish. Our world is so full of toxicity in our water and air, in pesticides, etc., that we must attempt to minimize ingestion of poisons to whatever extent we can. You will not see effects of ingesting this small amount of poison immediately. If your child should get a rash or the flu you&#x27;ll never know it&#x27;s her body fighting off the toxic effects. And eventually such toxicity accumulates in the body and years later something indeed dreadful could befall the person---this is one of the reasons why all of us get illnesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company should be put out of business. I found this about Thum on the web. I couldn&#x27;t have said it better. \\&quot;Active ingredients: Cayenne pepper extract, citric acid&lt;br /&gt;Now these two ingredients alone made me pause. Afterall we are talking about a product I intended to give to my two year old baby, but realizing the idea is that the product is supposed to taste terrible I read on.  Also contains: Isopropyl Alcohal, Acetone, Laquer.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT??? I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!!! These are some of the very products I keep under lock and key in an effort to protect my little one. If I wanted my child to put these products in his mouth I&#x27;d be sure to leave my nail polish remover, alcohal and paint in his reach. I was absolutely amazed. I continued to read the product label to see what other poisons this company intended me to give my child.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 3yr old, when I put it on her index finger it would stop her for awhile but now it doesn&#x27;t matter how much I use or when I put it on. It doesn&#x27;t phase her she still sucks her finger.</li>
            <li> We picked this up at Walmart and wish we&#x27;d seen the reviews first.  It wears off terribly quickly.  If you have a child that thumbsucks with any frequency, you&#x27;ll be reapplying this several times a day, if not hourly.  Also, my 2 yo quickly became used to the taste and it didn&#x27;t bother her even when first applied.  The taste is soon gone, and so she could ignore it for a short time until she got to that point.    If you want to help your child stop thumb-sucking or nail-biting, try [[ASIN:B0000YUXI0 Mavala Stop-Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking Prevention, 10ml]].  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Did not work for my thumb sucker. The only thing that worked was Mavala Stop. That stuff is disgusting and not tolerable even for the most determined thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> this works good but after awhile my kid starting sucking her thumb even when I out this on, so I had to get: Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting, this stuff is really yukky, my daughter cant stand me putting this stuff on, Buy Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting</li>
            <li> this product may claim to stop thumb sucking and nail biting, but falls incerdiablly short!  it literally sucks!  my daughter has a nail biting habit and she didn&#x27;t even flinch when she put her fingers in her mouth, even coated her nails liberally.  then I tested mine and I couldn&#x27;t tast a thing.  a waste of money and time. and expencive peice of you know what.</li>
            <li> I bought this prduct at my local pharmacy and it didn&#x27;t do any help. this was for my son. it doen&#x27;t taste or smell like nothing. even regular nail polish smell worse then this. so I certanly would recomment to any one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Get gloves or the plastic thumb/finger guards. Liquids do not work. I once tried Tabasco on my first kid&#x27;s thumbs to get him to stop sucking his thumb. He started demanding Tabasco on his eggs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thumb guards are the only true solution. Worked for all my kids.</li>
            <li> It really makes you stop nail bitting even if you have a long time with that bad habit that makes your hands look awful</li>
            <li> This item was complete waste of time for us. I put the item on my son&#x27;s finger and waited for him to put his finger in his mouth. When he did, it was like nothing was on his finger. Tried it twice same result.</li>
            <li> Mild hot sauce would have been more of a deterent. My son found this to be more of an inveresting new flavor.</li>
            <li> When i first saw this in stores i jumped for joy. My son has been eating his nails for about six months now. I applied this and he kept doing it. Had no reaction to this. Save your money.</li>
            <li> We put this on our daughter&#x27;s pacifiers and after putting it in her mouth twice and once more the next day she was cured from needing a pacifier.  It is pretty yucky tasting.  We are keeping our fingers crossed that it will work the same for our son.</li>
            <li> Has absolutely no effect on my 2 yr old. Dont waste your money. Chances of a home made pepper preparation working are better.I am going to try Mavala Stop and hope that does the trick</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product and unfortunately it did not work for her.  It would bother her for about ten minutes and then the spiciness would wear off.  Hot sauce/taco sauce seem to work better and even that doesn&#x27;t work.  I think she&#x27;s never going to stop sucking her thumb...sigh!</li>
            <li> Our 21 month old likes to suck her index and middle fingers.  She has blisters on both, and nothing we say stops it for longer than just a few minutes - especially when she&#x27;s sleepy.  We bought this from our pharmacy, and it did not work at all.  She never even flinched as if it tasted bad or noticed it was even there.  Now we are going to try Mavala Stop since it has gotten so many good reviews.  Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> Our initial hope for this product was swiftly lost---once our child had become acclimated to the taste, which is apparently not sufficiently repellent to deter thumb-sucking.  So as with many other reviewers, I ultimately found this ineffective.  It gets two stars because it is possible, with some children who are not particularly attached to thumb-sucking, that it could work.  But for anyone with an established habit, it is unlikely to work.</li>
            <li> I remember my mom using this on me as a kid to try and break my thumb sucking habit and I remember it tasting really gross and scrubbing it off my thumb before bedtime.  Only time broke my habit when I was ready so not sure much would have helped.  I purchased this to break my 3 year olds nail biting habit (like mother like son) and it didn&#x27;t really do the trick so we&#x27;re on to something new.  Not sure if it just didn&#x27;t taste bad enough or what.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a local store in hopes that is would help my son stop biting his nails and keep his hands out of his mouth.  I applied it while he was sleep....did not work.  He did stop for about 30 seconds and started back.  Did not work for us!</li>
            <li> Thum does not work, my 4 year old still sucks her thumb after I applied it. WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t deter my 2 year old at all. She still bit her nails just as bad. When I asked her if it tasted bad she always said no. I even tried it on myself and didn&#x27;t taste anything at all. I would NOT recommend Thum for anyone. It was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wish I read these reviews before I bought Thum at my local drugstore!  It did not work at all for my son, he was sucking his thumb within minutes without a single complaint about the taste!  My husband and I both tried it after that and found that it had very little taste at all and certainly did not stay on for very long.&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying Mevala next, hope it works better!</li>
            <li> 2 yr old said \\&quot;spicy!\\&quot; when she first tried it, but now just sucks her thumb anyways.  Need something stronger</li>
            <li> This stuff is useless! I bought this for my autistic son who bites his nails and fingers until they bleed and get infected. I noticed no difference in his nail biting whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I then put some on my own fingers and couldn&#x27;t even tell that it was there! Worthless!&lt;br /&gt;I would give it no stars if I could, but the minimum is one star.</li>
            <li> well my son started suckingf his thumb so i tried this.it took about three days an he was done an he liked not sucking it,so he asked for me to put it on him every night,ty guys.</li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed about this product. I was so excited to have found something b/c I am 27 years old and can&#x27;t seem to kick this disgusting habit of biting my nails. Maybe for thumb-sucking this product might be better b/c you have to keep your mouth on your finger for a long time in order to get any sense of spice. I don&#x27;t even like spicy stuff and I am able to stand this taste. There really isn&#x27;t much of a taste for me at all. I am also disappointed I spent $7 on this product at Walgreens b/c I didn&#x27;t want to wait for it to come in the mail. In a way I am happy I didn&#x27;t order it online b/c after the wait of it to get sent to me and then to get the disappointed of this product not working, I would have been angry. The reason I went with this product is because I was able to go to my local store and get it, but now I am going to have to spend more money on a product and order something over the internet. This product just does not work for me as an adult. I don&#x27;t know if it would work for children.</li>
            <li> After reading all the negative reviews of this product, I was very skeptical if this would work for my 4 years old daughter. But our pharmacy had only Thum, since it&#x27;s just $3 I gave it a try. It worked for my daughter right away, she stopped put her finger in the mouth on the first day, not even trying to do it again afterward.</li>
            <li> We purchased this at the pharmacy...it was a TOTAL waste of money, I can&#x27;t taste a THING and neither can my son...how is it even on the market?</li>
            <li> Bought this from local pharmacy to stop six year old daughter from biting nails. She didn&#x27;t mind the taste and actually said it reminded her of buffalo sauce :/ so much for that $6.99 down the drain. She commented that while it didn&#x27;t stop her from biting while she&#x27;s doing it, it did burn her throat later, I guess when she ate and washed the polished nails down.....</li>
            <li> Did not work at ALL!!! It&#x27;s as if I never even put anything on his thumb! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> At the time I bought this product, my grand daughter was about 4. She sucks all 4 of her fingers consistently. We&#x27;ve tried everything to prevent her from doing this. This product was our last resort. She still sucked her fingers after we drenched them with this product. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Is this stuff supposed to taste bad? I could drink a shot of it without flinching. My cat was licking it off of my fingers. Joke of a product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my thumb sucking 5 and 6 year olds. Perhaps it works better for babies and toddlers.</li>
            <li> put it on your tongue and it tastes bad.  Put it on your fingernail and you can barely taste a thing!  It goes away.  My 4 year old didn&#x27;t skip a beat...kept thumb suckung like nothing happened.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter so she&#x27;d quit sucking her thumbs and biting her nails. Didn&#x27;t work. Doesn&#x27;t matter how many coats I put on her fingers or how often I apply it, she will continue sucking her thumbs after she forgets that it&#x27;s on there. So I tasted it myself just to see what it was like...there&#x27;s not really a bad taste, it&#x27;s a very faint bitter taste, that&#x27;s it. Good thing it was only a few dollars or it might be upsetting.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local pharmacy to treat my 4 year olds nail biting habit.  I put it on his fingers and he immediately proceeded to lick his fingers to &#x27;see&#x27; what it tasted like.  He said it didn&#x27;t taste good, but he continued to bite.  Despite putting two coats on at once and putting it on multiple times throughout the day, it did not deter my son.  I am trying a Mavala Stop instead; too bad it takes so long to get here.  His nails are down to nothing.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product if you want your child to stop sucking their thumb, OR to stop nail biting.  I used it when I was 18 and it worked for me.  I bought it this time to use on my corner baseboards so my 2 puppies wouldn&#x27;t chew on the corners, and it worked!  Best priced deterent too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a pharmacy with the hopes my 2 year old would stop sucking his thumb.  Needless to say, it does not work.  In fact, he likes it and asks me to put it on his thumb.  I will look for something else.  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Seems to have a moderate effect.  My son is biting his nails less, but it wears off quickly and he&#x27;s back into it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local pharmacy to help my 2 year old stop sucking his thumb. It doesn&#x27;t work. He is very patient while I apply the nail polish to his finger, and he helps blow on it to dry it, but a few minutes later, the finger is back in the mouth. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t phase my 2 year old at all. She took her thumb out, looked at it, them stuck it right back in.</li>
            <li> This item is a total waste, I bought it for my 2yo daughter to encourage her to stop sucking her finger. I think she enjoyed the taste, it&#x27;s a scrappy product, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY........</li>
            <li> No bad taste not useful doesn&#x27;t help anyone stop biting.  Don&#x27;t buy this product it is a waste of money</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work, the child was biting their nails again as soon as it dried. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews.  Does not work at all.  Very mild taste and doesn&#x27;t stay very long.</li>
            <li> We tried this product for our determined nail biter and it had absolutely no effect.  He was putting it on, himself, and then commenting that it tasted good.  It was like peppermint candy nail biting or something.  Anyway, we are still looking for a solution and may try some of the better-reviewed nail-bite products sold on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add a footnote that for thumb sucking (while asleep) we found the ThumbGuard products sold here on Amazon to be the best and final solution.  After a substantial period of use, our daughter kicked the \\&quot;thumb sucking while asleep\\&quot; habit completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000UE10DC Thumb Sucking TGuard ThumbGuard Medium]]</li>
            <li> It did not work at all</li>
            <li> We applied a liberal amounts to my almost 3 year olds nails.  He&#x27;s taken up the recent habit of putting both hands in his mouth and sucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s still doing it, at first he said &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34; and 30 minutes later there he goes again with the finger sucking, all 10 fingers are back in his mouth.  $7 down the drain!  Don&#x27;t try this stuff!  Its not worth the time and money to go get it.</li>
            <li> easy to apply but it did not work at all! my daughter continued to bite her nails and toenails. would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It worked for a few hours, then the thumb-sucking resumed. My daughter said, &amp;#34;It was hot for only a while&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Didnt phase him.&lt;br /&gt;Hand kept going right in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;My son is special needs, so perhaps he is just too involved to notice.</li>
            <li> My 4 1/2 yr daughter is great at trying not to suck her thumb, but sucks it when she is fast asleep in the early am.  This product has no taste..  We even put a layer on her nail, let it dry and reapplied a few more layers and she still says there is no taste.  The awful taste is supposed to wake her up so she can choose to not suck her thumb... But there she is, fast asleep and sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> We purchased this through our local pharmacy to try on our 2 year old son.  We were able to put it on him, but it did not deter him in the least.  I tried some on my finger nail and I couldn&#x27;t detect any sort of pepper or off taste that would stop finger sucking.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help my 2 year old daughter stop chewing her nails. From the reviews I knew it had a more mild flavor than other polishes on the market, but my daughter old still eats 75% of her food with her hands and I didn&#x27;t want everything she ate to be tainted by the more powerful stuff so I tried this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t make a lick of difference whatsoever. In fact, one time I saw her licking it off her nails. I tried it on myself and I could only taste a very faint pepper flavor that wasn&#x27;t at all unpleasant, and I do NOT like spicy things. I even put 2 coats on my daughter. Unfortunately it&#x27;s just too weak.</li>
            <li> My daughter bites her nails and sucks on her fingers this did nothing to deter her at all. She actually seemed to like the spicy taste. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad to buy the good stuff at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much happy new year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bye~:)</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter who only sucked her fingers at night at bed quit sucking them after using this product every night for 1.5 weeks! I was skeptical, but after I have seen the result, I am impressed and now a believer.</li>
            <li> Just like many other reviewers reported. Our son is kind of wimpy with spicy stuff so thought I would give it a chance on our 5y old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No luck, was not spicy enough even for him to have an affect. He continued to suck his thumb with 2 coats of this on his thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the store it goes and continue our search for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the Mavala stop but that caused cancor sores in his mouth so we had to discontinue use of that one. But it definitly was strong enough he called it Mr Nasty Thumb (LOL) when he tasted his thumb with Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> This did not meet our expectations-it didn&#x27;t stop our girls from biting their nails-in fact it was just like nothing was on their nails at all</li>
            <li> Thankfully this product was not expensive because it did not work. My child sucked it right off her fingers! It was a mixture of lemons and pepper.</li>
            <li> As soon as this had dried on her nails... the thumb went in the mouth and she asked me to put it on all her fingers!</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken at the top &amp; some leaked out, but fortunately was able to use most of it. Tried reaching company &amp; no response back....</li>
