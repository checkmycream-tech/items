            <li>Nice neutral color.</li>
            <li>It takes about three coats to even show up, but is a nice break from havingg colored polish on.</li>
            <li>The gel was too watery and did not look nice on the nails at all.</li>
            <li>You kind of have to relay on the reviews.</li>
            <li>A nice warm nude color.</li>
            <li>This is a very light neutral shade that wears well, and looks nice no matter the occasion.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and this color (I just do one coat) compliments me very well.</li>

            <li>Love the color though.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite - too peachy.  </li>
            <li>I love this color and the gel lasts over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I will buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I already love gel</li>
            <li>Sometimes I like bold colors, but a nice neutral like this goes with everything and looks good for a professional environment.</li>
            <li>This is a very neutral nice color that still allows your nail line to show while making them appear really healthy.</li>
            <li>This color is a great neutral and works well for a french manicure.</li>
            <li>Makes your manicure look fantastic.</li>
            <li>so this just fit in my collection</li>
            <li>There are pretty peach undertones which I love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find good nude shellac colors that have good coverage on the nail.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorite OPI summer colors</li>
            <li>The color swatch shows it looking more peach than it really looks when applied.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone that needs a good neutral for daily wear.</li>
            <li>so if you google the (name of the color) + swatch , then pictures will come up to show you the true color since the color swatch on Amazon can be a bit decieving.</li>
            <li>Its classic and elegant.</li>
            <li>Once i ordered it, it came to my house quickly.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;perfect nude&amp;#34; as seen all over Pinterest is definitely a staple in my color-collection and perfect for all year long!!</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the color...looks a bit like yellowed nails.</li>
            <li>When your Gel mani if first done it looks good but as time goes on it looks like the color of dry wall.</li>
            <li>I wear it most days of the year outside of the holidays and special events.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, neutral color with a hint of salmon/peach, so not completely nude.</li>
            <li>It is so pretty on.</li>
            <li>OPI&#x27;s Samoan Sand color has always been a favorite of mine, and the gel color is no different!</li>
            <li>swatches on line pretty.</li>
            <li>Color is more peach than regular polish of this color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Opi gels are much easier to remove and slide right off after wrapping each nail in acetone cotton for 10min.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want just a super light pink.  </li>
            <li>so right on there are very natural look up</li>
            <li>This nude color goes very well with darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>I like the prompt and fast service.</li>
            <li>#34;Barbie hands&amp;#34; when wearing this because my whole hand is flesh-colored.</li>
            <li>Other nudes I had tried had more of a fall look to them.  </li>
            <li>Works great with the base and top coat I bought for the Gelcolor system.</li>
            <li>First of all it arrived and the product looked used, we purchased from Amazon marketplace and the vendor declined the return because they claimed it had not previously been used.  </li>
            <li>Also quick note, the line of OPI gelcolor is the same as their regular nail polish line</li>
            <li>The second time around it lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>I get compliments as to how natural it looks on my nails.</li>
            <li>With three coats, it completely covers everything.</li>
            <li>With 2 coats you can just barely see the natural nail.</li>
            <li>New growth area is not noticeable because it is such a neutral color.</li>
            <li>I like the Opi Gelcolor formula much better than Nailene&#x27;s because the Sensationail colors are so difficult to remove; your nail surface gets really damaged.</li>
            <li>With one coat, it barely covers the tips of my nails, so some white does peek through, but I like that.</li>
            <li>This is a slightly yellowish color, but very neutral.  </li>

            <li> The first time I used it the polish started chipping after a few days, but I think I put it on too thick.  </li>
            <li> though less pink than I expected.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have at least one neutral color nail polish and finally picked this one.  </li>
            <li> this is just slightly darker than nude and wears with anything.</li>
            <li> As close to nude as possible.. Need numerous coats and after about a week started to look dirty.</li>
            <li> I usually get bored about a week in and because it&#x27;s so neutral, I can put regular polish over it without issue for another week or so.</li>

            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite OPI summer colors and I was thrilled to see that it came in the gel formula.  It is so pretty on.</li>
            <li> This color is a great neutral and works well for a french manicure. The color swatch shows it looking more peach than it really looks when applied. You need 2 coats to even notice it.</li>
            <li> Love the color. I&#x27;m a C6 (MAC) and this color is a great nude for me. My only concern is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up as long as some of the other OPI gel colors I have. Seems to peel and crack around the edges quicker. Love the color though.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and is a beautiful brown nude color. Like all gels, lasts ~7 days when not salon applied.</li>
            <li> Nice neutral color. though less pink than I expected.</li>
            <li> Very light and neutral color, more on the beige side.  The first time I used it the polish started chipping after a few days, but I think I put it on too thick.  The second time around it lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I like bold colors, but a nice neutral like this goes with everything and looks good for a professional environment.</li>
            <li> OPI&#x27;s Samoan Sand color has always been a favorite of mine, and the gel color is no different! The &amp;#34;perfect nude&amp;#34; as seen all over Pinterest is definitely a staple in my color-collection and perfect for all year long!!</li>
            <li> When people say these are like mannequin hand color nails so right on there are very natural look up swatches on line pretty.</li>
            <li> This is a very neutral nice color that still allows your nail line to show while making them appear really healthy.</li>
            <li> I love love this color!! It&#x27;s hard to find good nude shellac colors that have good coverage on the nail.  It&#x27;s a beautiful light salmon/peachy color. I use three coasts to get the color I want and it comes out perfect! I will continue to buy this color and I would recommend it to anyone that needs a good neutral for daily wear.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite - too peachy.  I switched to Passion for a nude and it is gorgeous.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love the gel polishes!  This is a slightly yellowish color, but very neutral.  Makes your manicure look fantastic.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the color...looks a bit like yellowed nails.</li>
            <li> Perfect nude color for lighter skin tones. I love this color and the gel lasts over 2 weeks. Its classic and elegant. You won&#x27;t have to worry about nail color being inappropriate for work or school.</li>
            <li> This is my signature color. This nude color goes very well with darker skin tones. I&#x27;m African-American and a medium brown tone and everywhere I go I get compliments as to how natural it looks on my nails. I wear it most days of the year outside of the holidays and special events.</li>
            <li> Love the color! The perfect nude for my skin tone!!!</li>
            <li> This color is the best neutral I&#x27;ve found. I love it! I have the regular OPI polish, and decided to get the gelcolor to try in hopes of it staying on longer. It takes about three coats to even show up, but is a nice break from havingg colored polish on.</li>
            <li> As close to nude as possible.. Need numerous coats and after about a week started to look dirty.</li>
            <li> This color is the perfect nude! Not too peachy, not too beige and a tiny bit translucent.</li>
            <li> Works great with the base and top coat I bought for the Gelcolor system. Using the Nailene Sensationail LED lamp to cure and results are amazing.  No need to spend $40 bucks at the salon. Just spend the money up front, invest in a good LED lamp + the OPI Gelcolor system and you&#x27;ve got salon-worthy gel nails at home!  I like the Opi Gelcolor formula much better than Nailene&#x27;s because the Sensationail colors are so difficult to remove; your nail surface gets really damaged. Opi gels are much easier to remove and slide right off after wrapping each nail in acetone cotton for 10min.</li>
            <li> This is a very light neutral shade that wears well, and looks nice no matter the occasion.  New growth area is not noticeable because it is such a neutral color.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have at least one neutral color nail polish and finally picked this one.  I didn&#x27;t want just a super light pink.  I didn&#x27;t want a glitter or translucent color.  I wanted a neutral, almost nude cream.  I like this choice.  I usually get bored about a week in and because it&#x27;s so neutral, I can put regular polish over it without issue for another week or so.</li>
            <li> I have this in the regular polish and like it. When your Gel mani if first done it looks good but as time goes on it looks like the color of dry wall.For the length of time it takes to remove GEL polish I don&#x27;t use it often.</li>
            <li> Color is more peach than regular polish of this color.&lt;br /&gt; But gel polish is great for durability.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again in different color.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and it did not meet her expectations.  First of all it arrived and the product looked used, we purchased from Amazon marketplace and the vendor declined the return because they claimed it had not previously been used.  Then on to the product, which also did not meet the expectations.  The gel was too watery and did not look nice on the nails at all.</li>
            <li> With gel colors, you can;t just try it on. You kind of have to relay on the reviews. This is my second nude color and i love it. Once i ordered it, it came to my house quickly. I will buy more from this seller. I like the prompt and fast service.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and this color (I just do one coat) compliments me very well. With one coat, it barely covers the tips of my nails, so some white does peek through, but I like that. With three coats, it completely covers everything. I always joke that I have &amp;#34;Barbie hands&amp;#34; when wearing this because my whole hand is flesh-colored. It&#x27;s a nice, neutral color with a hint of salmon/peach, so not completely nude. The gel is good quality, too. I think I will only by OPI gel going forward.</li>
            <li> Its the most beautiful peachy-nude color. I love it. With 2 coats you can just barely see the natural nail. I usually use 3 coats when I want the color to be completely opaque. *****Also quick note, the line of OPI gelcolor is the same as their regular nail polish line so if you google the (name of the color) + swatch , then pictures will come up to show you the true color since the color swatch on Amazon can be a bit decieving. Hopefully this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Perfect nude color! I get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> A nice warm nude color. There are pretty peach undertones which I love. Other nudes I had tried had more of a fall look to them.  This color is perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> this is just slightly darker than nude and wears with anything. I already love gel so this just fit in my collection</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and even more gorgeous with a matte top coat!</li>
