            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian and used to wear Neautrogena&#x27;s foundation (in 40) and this stuff blends in a matches my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>It blends PERFECTLY into my face.</li>

            <li>the perfect coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is fair and the BB Cream does not look orange (yay!!)</li>

            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>Coverage is perfect  </li>
            <li>I was not too impressed at the beginning, because it just felt like tinted lotion from neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>and this is perfect for keeping the oil from shinning through.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of Korean BB creams and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>The added bonus of SPF was great too!</li>
            <li>Anyways It came on time and I had excellent service.</li>
            <li>The BB cream stays looking flawless all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Pakistani and this product is perfect for my skin color</li>
            <li>I researched reviews for the best Bb Cream for ouly/acne prone skin and based on reviews, chose this one to try.</li>
            <li>GOOD STUFF!!!</li>
            <li>If they took those away, this would be a perfect product.</li>
            <li>This is the best face cream I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so happy!</li>
            <li>So I wasn&#x27;t too happy when I woke up after about 3 days of use to find that I now have to battle acne on my forehead too!</li>
            <li>Its awesome!</li>
            <li>but after I rubbed it in it matched my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous!!!!!</li>
            <li>like I had perfect skin without makeup!!!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I guess we each have to find what works best for our skin type.</li>
            <li>They both are awesome and I will continue to use Skin79 BB creams.</li>
            <li>This works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>the best</li>

            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>Would be a very good product for me if it were not for the dryness and redness it caused.</li>
            <li>and it was a very good price.</li>

            <li>So unless you have the best skin ever that is not the slightest bit acne prone, you won&#x27;t be happy.</li>
            <li>It is ideal for winter because it gives you moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>Incredibly dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so happy that I found the best for my skin.</li>
            <li>,it is a good product~!</li>

            <li>I had no idea it was going to work this beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Depending on my mood, if I want the dewy look I will mix one pump of this bb cream with 1-2 drops of argan oil for a beautiful radiant glow...without the shimmer/glitter.  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t 100% perfect match, but it blends fairly well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read reviews from users with darker skin tones, and would agree that this product will look best on fair skin.</li>

            <li>It makes my skin look BEAUTIFUL.</li>

            <li>It blends very nicely and is perfect for my fair, freckled skin.  </li>

            <li>but I am still very pleased!</li>
            <li>Great coverage, doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li>, it covers great an feels great on skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for winter time because it&#x27;s so moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>But five stars for the shipping, the price is great if you have a lighter skin tone</li>
            <li>it smells great</li>
            <li>the dispense of it is also great</li>

            <li>I have been hearing all the rave about this stuff what great things it does for your skin.</li>
            <li>And the great thing about this is it&#x27;s not a foundation.  </li>

            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Its amazing!</li>
            <li>For most of year this color is perfect.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it feels light, it moisturizers and reduces the size of my pores, and it doesn&#x27;t cake on your face and lasts all day with finishing powder!    </li>
            <li>Feel so nice!</li>
            <li>Considering how affordable this is, an excellent deal.&lt;br /&gt;Light to medium coverage, okay as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and if I want more coverage I just need a drop of foundation, blends great!</li>
            <li>I kinda wished it was the orange vita plus sample :c )</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen improvements in my skin which is a nice plus!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about blotting until about mid-afternoon, and for the most part the cream stayed on my face and not on the blotting sheets.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product itself would be perfect for people who aren&#x27;t allergic to talc.</li>
            <li>I have used many products over the years and this has probably been the best one I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>It will blend in nicely!</li>
            <li>It has so many wonderful ingedients to help skin!  </li>
            <li>I love how it looks on my skin and the coverage is just wonderful!!  </li>
            <li>:) I am so happy with this product!</li>
            <li>And the nice packaging is a plus!</li>
            <li>It does a good job at fighting my oily skin which is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and it has a good coverage for those who don&#x27;t have a lot to cover (like me).</li>
            <li>This makes my skin look nice!</li>
            <li>So thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li>awesome* customer service. :)</li>
            <li>You and your skin will be very happy! :)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin looks smoother and more flawless.  </li>
            <li>Loving it!</li>
            <li>It smells very good and is very good for light skin.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, great wear, and amazing finish.</li>
            <li>but I find that it smells soapy and pleasant, not at all over powering.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent</li>
            <li>And the smell is pleasant as well.</li>
            <li>and I guess it could be pleasant</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the consistency of this product, it has great coverage and feels a bit tacky.</li>
            <li>It gives a beautiful finish and nice medium coverage.</li>
            <li>The product came to me in perfect condition, with great packaging and right on time service!</li>
            <li>They go on so easy and make my skin just look naturally flawless.</li>
            <li>This does give great coverage, my skin can still breathe, and I love the way it looks!  </li>
            <li>I use a bronzer to bright my skin up.  </li>
            <li>(This website is amazing and has all kinds of great information about all kinds of beauty products.)Anyway, I read about Skin79&#x27;s BB cream in this article:</li>
            <li>I bought the MIssha brand a while ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>After that, I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>Ive heard so much good things about bb cream.  </li>
            <li>However, I heard so much good reviews about this product and so, I decided to try it out myself.</li>
            <li>It makes good coverage, considering it covers up my blemishes and stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price for a good amount.</li>
            <li>I loved the way that it blended and smoothed out the look of my skin.  </li>
            <li>(fair to light-medium).</li>
            <li>Plus did I mention at the end of the day, it still looks good??</li>
            <li>It also did a good job of hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li>I am a Caucasian girl with a neutral skin tone, I&#x27;m EXTREMELY fair, and have crazy-oily skin.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d say if you are really fair skinned and have oil issues, don&#x27;t even hesitate to look for anything else.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage and natral color.</li>
            <li>coverage is quite good expecally for a BB cream.</li>
            <li>im good to go.</li>
            <li>The oil control is also good, it prevents my t-zone from getting too shiny.</li>
            <li>I used my sister&#x27;s and thought it had really good coverage.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s THAT good.</li>
            <li>I have freckly fair skin that gets quite oily during the day.</li>
            <li>* Good Coverage -</li>
            <li>No greasy feel and good for your skin --&gt;</li>
            <li>Best concealer, pore cleanser, whitens well while still looking like a light foundation.  </li>
            <li>It goes on well and provides good coverage</li>
            <li>This BB cream does a good job at controlling oil for me,</li>
            <li>have relatively fair Caucasian toned skin.</li>
            <li>But coverage wise, nothing beats this stuff.</li>
            <li>had done a fair amount of research on this product before I ever started purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I thought I had made a good choice with this seller.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a good deal since it&#x27;s cheaper than the one on the Skin79 website</li>
            <li>HAVE A FAIR SKIN TONE.  </li>
            <li>This looks good all day--it also has sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>+ in Tan and used it when outdoors--it even lasted all day at a beach party where I wanted to look good, be protected but still not look &#x27;made-up\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I also have a fair amount of freckles.</li>
            <li>So I thought it fair to update my review since there&#x27;s some issues that can change your mind.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin that tans well.  </li>
            <li>And the purpose of this was supposed to be good by itself.</li>
            <li>I am rather fair, and have not had any difficulty with the cream being too light.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gorgeous skins could wear it alone.</li>
            <li>Every time I order, I get free samples too (great for traveling!).  </li>
            <li>The smell is good as well.</li>
            <li>it feel good when I put it on my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good bb cream though.</li>
            <li>and I have rosacea and fair skin.</li>
            <li>It feels so light and wonderful!</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t look good...</li>
            <li>with its SPF provides good coverage</li>
            <li>but it works, My skin looks gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Lightly matted, perfectly matching my skin tone.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually good to go.</li>
            <li>I decided to get this product after reading all the good reviews but, was somewhat dissapointed after using it.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat in between fair and medium.</li>
            <li>, for me I have medium skin tone and it blends good, I look a bit lighter</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s a good thing that I don&#x27;t speak or read Korean</li>
            <li>Since it does make my skin look really good</li>
            <li>This is for fair skin.</li>
            <li>My skin loved it and did not cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li>but i do notice that it was good at moisturizing my skin</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>Good quality and price for the amount of cream received.</li>
            <li>Good price&lt;</li>
            <li>neutral fair ivory.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you are fair skin with any undertones as I&#x27;m ruddy</li>
            <li>it is not as good as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the skin- moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>It gives good coverage and an even tone without looking make-up-y.</li>
            <li>It has good coverage for a bb cream</li>
            <li>Thank you, Min for the good customer service.</li>
            <li>the coverage is actually good hides my redness</li>
            <li>/&gt;Missha - Good coverage.</li>
            <li>Good dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Skin79 - Good coverage.</li>
            <li>This product has good coverage.</li>
            <li>Probably not the best if you&#x27;re a light olive color or darker.</li>
            <li>BB cream is really good.</li>
            <li>and i loved the bb cream</li>
            <li>A lot of people said that this was a really good product</li>
            <li>It works well on my skin and sells at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research looking for a good BB cream that would also match me</li>
            <li>Another plus is that there&#x27;s a good amount of SPF</li>
            <li>I noticed that I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn nor a tan (which is a good thing for me</li>
            <li>This is good.</li>
            <li>Everything is so light feeling, my skin looks flawless and I&#x27;m getting complements</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find anything else this good for this price range.</li>

            <li>I am close to 40 and have fair combination skin.  </li>

            <li>I had gave it to my mom to try and she loved it .</li>
            <li>The coverage is so good that I didn&#x27;t need foundation either.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely delighted.  </li>
            <li>and my face looks almost as good as when I had it on.</li>
            <li>The color is a good match for my skin.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a good set up for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin is fair, and this adjusted well to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It has a good coverage without feeling stuffy.</li>

            <li>it is really good .</li>
            <li>This was all just a side note to skin observations.&lt;br /&gt;The product, to repeat myself, is good</li>
            <li>which is good.</li>
            <li>I have medium coverage and covers a pimple fairly well</li>
            <li>i wear the shade \\&quot;Fairly Light\\&quot; and this BB cream matches my skin</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s best for light skin tones.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>

            <li>I bought it because I heard that it is a great foundation that has built in sunscreen, helps with wrinkles and can blend with most any skin type.  </li>
            <li>After reading so many great reviews and watching videos praising this product I had to get</li>
            <li>I read so many great reviews on Korean BB Creams that I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>For a fair skin girl with more neutral undertones, this works amazing!</li>
            <li>It goes on my face nicely, and blends into a smooth and flawless finish with amazing coverage.  </li>
            <li>I chose SKIN79 because it had so many great reviews on internet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Beblesh Balm for about 2 weeks, and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>What is so great is that it is so much more than just a foundation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>i do not understand how so many great reviews are for the product,</li>
            <li>I covered my face, neck, chest, shoulders, and hands (just for good measure, this stuff does feel amazing on).</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy this after seeing so many great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you find a nice tinted moisturizer that is good and compatible with YOUR skin, you&#x27;ll save a lot of money without sacrificing reliability and quality.</li>
            <li>This provides really good coverage and makes your skin kind of glow but not in a shiny oily way that a lot of moisturizers tend to do.</li>
            <li>Impressive, right?</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell or feel cakey and it blends beautifully.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you my skin is much more even toned, for sure!!</li>
            <li>The coverage is also very nice, I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>seller is credible and really good!</li>
            <li>This product works great for fair to light medium skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I love the packaging even!</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product... except that I&#x27;m allergic to it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?!</li>
            <li>will for sure buy this again!</li>

            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m sure that by purchasing all of these products that the reviewer recommened you would be spending much more than the $10 you can purchase this superior product for!</li>

            <li>btw this was my first bb cream &lt;3</li>
            <li>I really love it!  </li>

            <li>I love this bb cream!  </li>
            <li>LOVE THAT!</li>
            <li>I bought mine from NEVERPRICE, and it is AUTHENTIC!  </li>
            <li>I do have to say it looked grayish going on but blended beautifully to match my light olive skin.</li>
            <li>Well it gets better!</li>
            <li>and so glad too!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So glad I went with this product!</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>The color is very light, so it&#x27;s most suitable for VERY fair skin and for those who desire \\&quot;whitened\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bummed it didn&#x27;t work out though, because it is really an easy all-in-one skin product and provides great coverage as a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it adjusts to your skin tone very quickly, has great coverage, and improves your skin.</li>
            <li>It looks great and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>In addition to leaving my skin flawless and beautiful while I&#x27;m wearing it, my skin is actually improving after I take it off!</li>
            <li>It goes on so nicely, and if you&#x27;re a pale-face like me it&#x27;ll match your skin tone pretty perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like your own skin, but better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed by the product not sticking in the large pores on my nose</li>
            <li>, it is very light, so it is great for me but does not work for darker skin, I tried it on a friend and it just leaves your face whiter but with a healthy glow as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The coverage on this BB Cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a couple weeks now and my skin looks amazing, even after the BB Cream comes off.</li>
            <li>It feels sooo light on my skin and the coverage is great.</li>
            <li>this seller is also amazing they sent me a sample of a primer and the product I ordered this way if it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing</li>
            <li>This BB cream is amazing</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>This BB cream is so amazing.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>one is just amazing as the others&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>Korean products are amazing.  </li>
            <li>the bb cream itself, is amazing.</li>
            <li>heard this SKIN79 BB Cream was amazing, and found it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I think its amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Works great with my light skin.</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t done anything amazing.</li>
            <li>It is quite amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been amazing.  </li>
            <li>I get amazing results with this.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen an amazing difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice; however, it&#x27;s one shade and not recommended for darker than NC-35.  </li>
            <li>I saved it for the winter when my complexion is more fair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Save your money, go to the store, and get a nice tinted moisturizer with spf that won&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>I am totally loving BB creams though.</li>
            <li>On days that I like a good coverage I applied a darker powder foundation on top to even out the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer with all the good benefits of sunscreen/whitening/even skin tone</li>
            <li>As another reviewer found, this product makes me look kind of gray.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; Authentic!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Effectively covers up skin imperfections - covers?</li>
            <li>Effectively?</li>
            <li>I am just thrilled with this and will continue to order it.</li>
            <li>The product arrived before estimated date and it was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I am really loving this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product.</li>
            <li>The consistency blends nicely after you let it set</li>
            <li>Initally I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review because there are already so many good reviews, but after reading each review posted on this product I had to add my two cents.  </li>
            <li>The container is nice and has a nice feel and heft.</li>
            <li>I like that it has SPF and has nice coverage.  </li>
            <li>each one has its own effect/texture/sheen..</li>
            <li>But I decided not to worry so much about it and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>this was a gift...to be honest</li>
            <li>and I have been thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was prompt, and product was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Works better for fair skin.</li>
            <li>Loving this BB cream.</li>
            <li>lol I would recommend that with this :) You will love this if you give it a try.</li>
            <li>I really liked this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because an all in one cream would have been so nice.</li>
            <li>It goes on well, and fades to a nice, evening, correcting color in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The SPF in it is nice..</li>
            <li>This has really nice coverage.</li>
            <li>Everything I say is my own opinion.</li>
            <li>I bought this a month ago and was very impressed for the fast shipping!they also included some VIP sample</li>
            <li>Nice price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Great application consistency, feels nice</li>
            <li>I got kind of nauseaous just from smelling it.</li>
            <li>Soooo, I gave in when my mom ordered me her kind</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone really nicely.</li>
            <li>It has a nice tint that gives coverage as well as SPF.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how they gave a thank</li>
            <li>and then kind of blend,</li>
            <li>I am looking for a product that BB cream claims to provides: nice coverage and even out skin tone and make skin looks radiant.  </li>
            <li>in all, a good product that covers %90 of most skin blemishes.</li>
            <li>Kind of looks muddy...</li>
            <li>My skin tone does even out nicely once the cream sets</li>
            <li>This was no surprise to me, and I thought I would liked it regardless.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>I honestly hope they never bring this to market in the US because it seems like whenever a cult product overseas comes to the US they have to change their formulas</li>
            <li>I honestly hope they never bring this to market in the US because it seems like whenever a cult product overseas comes to the US they have to change their formulas</li>
            <li>This gave me any and every kind of breakout imaginable in places on my face</li>
            <li>It has become softer and smoother without changing my own routine.</li>
            <li>The cream itself was quite nice, and I liked the consistency.</li>
            <li>However, after a two weeks I accidentally \\&quot;scratched\\&quot; the \\&quot;BB\\&quot; label and it kind of scratched off.</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m just kind of cautious and worried now.</li>
            <li>I really wish they made one a shade darker, and it would be a perfect product!</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave residue everywhere.</li>
            <li>(I hope to post a review/tutorial soon to my own website, so I&#x27;ll update this review when I do).</li>
            <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave residue everywhere.</li>
            <li>(I hope to post a review/tutorial soon to my own website, so I&#x27;ll update this review when I do).</li>
            <li>If you are beige, not so much.  :D</li>
            <li>and I will stick with my Lioele BB creams which provide better coverage and have superior packaging.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way this looked on my skin.  </li>
            <li>But i liked how it made my skin look so even-toned.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying my own.</li>
            <li>however I have lots of warm color as well from all of my freckles.</li>
            <li>The BB cream matched my skin tone perfectly, I can put it on just problem areas or over my whole face</li>
            <li>The price is unbeatable, the shipping was fast, and the product is awesome!</li>
            <li>It has no smell to it which is nice.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product and awesome service!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I liked the medium coverage and brightening effects on the the face.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful finish as well; very youthful and dewy.</li>
            <li>I did not ever where any kind of coverup or foundation in my life.</li>
            <li>It smells so nice.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day with a nice matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It takes something spectacular to make me write a review, and this product falls in that category.</li>
            <li>It will go on gray but blend in with your own skin tone.</li>
            <li>I just use this in the under eye and nose area and it gives nice coverage.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look so nice.</li>
            <li>looking forward to using this product to see what kind of improvements I will see in my skin.</li>
            <li>It matched my skin tone well, blended in nicely, and had a dewy, brightening finish.</li>
            <li>Excellent for very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>The packaging does work well, fits nice in the bathroom cabinet, &amp; doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>I have never been complimented as much as I have wearing this awesome bb cream.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it,</li>
            <li>It Is A very good product , the right shade and got to me in no time .</li>
            <li>I heard amazing things about this product and was excited to see it on amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li>days when I want a bit more coverage and to look more flawless on my face (say, for a special occasion)</li>
            <li>days when I want a bit more coverage and to look more flawless on my face (say, for a special occasion)</li>
            <li>and it covers my whole face very nicely!  </li>
            <li>The product is rich and does not require a great deal to cover well.  </li>
            <li>and i fell in love, easy application, perfect color for my skin, finish is amazing smooth, stays well on skin.</li>
            <li>This particular one is best for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Product works great, goes on skin smooth and easy and it&#x27;s wondeful!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, I have tried dozens of low-end and high-end creams, powders, treatments, masks, foundations, mousse, you name it, and this BB cream is the best thing that has ever happened to my face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect skincare product and I purchased this product in high hopes.</li>
            <li>I apply about a pea size amount using a kabuki brush and get great coverage (and i am a full coverage type of person)...</li>
            <li>Plus the coverage is great - medium to full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute. :)</li>
            <li>I will say it does feel very light on the my face, i did have to wear powder over it though and blush to kind of make everything blend in nicely.</li>
            <li>This is my new best friend!  </li>
            <li>This product is my new best friend!</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference in my face, my acne has greatly improved and my makeup has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I am blue-eyed/very fair and burn easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my skin (fair Asian).  </li>
            <li>and I think the result is great; it have a medium coverage that mildly cover up my acne scars and brighten up my face.</li>
            <li>my skin is very easy to get oily.</li>
            <li>Very easy and sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It os VERy strong.</li>
            <li>Love it love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love love this!</li>
            <li>It might works pretty good on my face too!  </li>
            <li>The result gets better and better and my skin keeps improving!</li>
            <li>this is my first time to put a cream that doesn&#x27;t make my face shine ... and it covers the spots in a good way!</li>
            <li>the more I used it, the more benefits I noticed!</li>
            <li>My face and arms got significantly darker after getting my driver&#x27;s license :P</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair, light ivory in most foundations and burns extremely easily.  </li>
            <li>The color matched my fair and  freckled skin fine when blended out.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle of Dr. Jart&#x27;s, and it is pretty great, but Skin79 is sooo sooo soooo much better!  </li>
            <li>The seller responds quickly and has been very nice to me.</li>
            <li>In the time I used the BB Cream I never noticed it improving the health of my skin (or any whitening or wrinkle reduction, though I&#x27;m very fair to begin with and don&#x27;t really have wrinkles</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, prone to breakouts and very combination-</li>
            <li>But to be honest, BB creams are nothing more than tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This product is AUTHENTIC and it works amazingly~</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with light freckles over my nose and no acne.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li>this one offers THE BEST coverage I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>Now I have fair, smooth oily skin, I don&#x27;t have any acne</li>
            <li>By far the best BB cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Beblesh Balm and so far am really impressed.</li>
            <li>I recently got married on the beach and this was the most wonderful stuff to put on to just get out an go and have great coverage!</li>
            <li>Color too light even for fair skin</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s by far the best BB cream on the market!</li>
            <li>This product offered good coverage, however it was light compared to the color shade illustrated in the listing.  </li>
            <li>This bb creme is the best that i have tried so far.</li>
            <li>The kind of bb cream was Charm Cell and it looked goofy</li>
            <li>both of those are amazing with Beyond the Solution being my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, but this one is really amazing.</li>
            <li>but after 3 months I can honestly say my skin looks better now at 33</li>
            <li>I am fortunate to have good skin</li>
            <li>but it was a good light coverage.</li>
            <li>Maybe for a naturally darker-complected person it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff did an excellent job evening out my skin tone while I was wearing it</li>
            <li>First let me start by saying the product feels great on my skin, and has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>At first I was so impressed by the way the BB Cream hides my pores, but other than that it honestly isn&#x27;t the greatest for me.</li>
            <li>The color eventually faded but you can easily tell that I&#x27;m wearing make-up by how my face is visibly lighter than my neck!  </li>
            <li>Very quick shipping also!</li>
            <li>if you have very fine skin this stuff will work with you.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love love love it!</li>
            <li>love love love it!</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>
            <li>love, love, love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It looks very light, natural, and gives a flawless appearance.</li>
            <li>have fair skin with more of a pinky undertone and this cream works just fine.</li>
            <li>This has made my skin so soft and so much more even!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product because of the good reviews it has.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned for those of you that are familiar with the BareMinerals foundation</li>
            <li>If a makeup looks good in direct sunlight AND the color matches, it&#x27;s great in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>this stuff gives my face a nice smooth finish and highlights it nicely.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anything better, but I honestly don&#x27;t see how it could get any better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because it has turned out to be the best foundation-type product I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li>You get a great price, free samples and the products that I have purchased have all been genuine and un-tampered with.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage, nice light feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It adds a soft focus look to my skin, and is a great shade on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Generally happy with it and makes my morning routine very fast.  </li>
            <li>It is a Great item  ~~~i like it very much.</li>
            <li>I heard about BB creams, and was willing to risk a breakout or rash to find a great product.  </li>
            <li>I got this cream because I saw good reviews and the website claimed that they were the top selling original BB Cream.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t so great first off.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased this product it was great.</li>
            <li>&lt;3 will buy again once i get close to running out :O</li>
            <li>It also has good staying power after a full day out.</li>
            <li>I should have known, the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>The coverage is very light</li>
            <li>It very light weight, goes on like a lotion rather than a foundation.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin</li>
            <li>This was very important in selecting what BB Cream I chose.</li>
            <li>It is very good package with very professional.</li>
            <li>This one blended my skin well, but was very light coverage.</li>
            <li>It has a very very light flowery powder smell that dissipates.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, very fair skin that&#x27;s oily in the T-zone and acne-prone.</li>
            <li>There was a floral scent that was very light and didn&#x27;t seem to bother me.</li>
            <li>After that the color blends in to my very fair skin and lets a very natural finish.</li>
            <li>very smooth and creamy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has very light coverage</li>
            <li>I use this, which gives very light coverage.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin looks, feels smoother and it&#x27;s very light, almost feeling like I&#x27;m not wearing it at all.</li>
            <li>I use almost one full pump of BB cream on my face to start with, and it does an amazing job of evening my skintone out and giving it a nice, dewy glow.  </li>
            <li>The makeup looks great on and definitely makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li>( I am super fair and had a ton of freckles and some acne scars).</li>
            <li>That sounded too good to be true. :)</li>
            <li>and I liked that it didn&#x27;t have a strong odor of perfume</li>
            <li>I love this product; it blends really easily, evens out my skin tone, and covers amazingly.</li>
            <li>What I love is the easy application and nice coverage.  </li>
            <li>When I went to put it on I noticed the texture was very smooth and felt more like a lotion than a make-up.</li>
            <li>My own mixture that I have been using for some time has reduced the darkness under my eyes and fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>This BB cream certainly does a great job of evening skin tone and hiding blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, lasts a long time, looks awesome, and doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;greasy&#x27; if you seal it with powder</li>
            <li>I want a fuller coverage for date nights or special occasions I like to mix this BB Cream with one of my normal foundations and it works great!</li>
            <li>The SPF is a huge plus too!</li>
            <li>This feels like a \\&quot;second skin\\&quot; and it oxidizes to perfectly match, blend, and \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; my skin tone.</li>
            <li>but it was still ok</li>
            <li>Also, buy from a reputable Ebay sellers.  </li>
            <li>But since we can&#x27;t get our hands on, we are paying a bit more.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this bb cream does not make it more oily</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s actually like, the perfect product for me since I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup anyways</li>
            <li>so it provides a bit more coverage than some.  </li>
            <li>I wish they had more colors.  </li>
            <li>I like the MIssha brand much better.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;hot pink&amp;#34; was my favorite out of that bunch.  </li>
            <li>I love this BB cream and wear it just about every day.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way to remove the top and scrape out the remaining BB cream.</li>
            <li>i bought this after seeing videos on youtube and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>but you might have to dab on a bit more concealer for the more prominent imperfections.</li>
            <li>it really did a GREAT job of covering blackheads and lightening your skin:</li>
            <li>but in the end i still like this product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love the texture and lightness of the feeling....</li>
            <li>It definitely gives me the best alternative for a liquid foundation....</li>
            <li>Ever since my favorite beauty gurus on YouTube started talking about these creams I&#x27;ve wanted one myself.</li>
            <li>but once you let it oxidize for about 2 minutes it matches your skin tone :)</li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds of make up, even the mineral make up and nothing has worked even close to how I would like it to.</li>
            <li>Love both.</li>
            <li>Will order some more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on my skin within weeks of using this, with folks saying my skin is healthy and glowy.</li>
            <li>My breakouts are milder and farther between, my scars have begun to fade, and the coverage and lasting wear for this BB cream are awesome.  </li>
            <li>i love the look of this bb cream and</li>
            <li>I like the gold one better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something of darker shades or more coverage, this would not be it, after all this is not a foundation.</li>
            <li>probably my last (for good reasons too)!!</li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it from this</li>
            <li>I love BB creams from Korea, not the newer ones coming into the US.</li>
            <li>I really love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>esp if I&#x27;m tanning) but the BEST thing I found to make this a bit darker without making it orange is to mix a bit of St Tropez Wash Off Instant Glow Face into the BB cream before you apply it to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love the effect</li>
            <li>Not quite sure how I survived without my BB Creams???</li>
            <li>Love Love Love :)</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing foundation</li>
            <li>Shields skin from premature aging with potent SPF</li>
            <li>- I haven&#x27;t notice any improvement and I don&#x27;t have many lines.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Overall impressed with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li>It starts out kind of ashy or grey in the beginning, but blends beautifully into your own skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and love it</li>
            <li>And I know this was authentic, so don&#x27;t listen to the reviews saying it wasnt.</li>
            <li>To be sure for yourself, go on youtube and search:</li>
            <li>Even better then just covering the u even skin</li>
            <li>it seems to magically blur the problems.</li>
            <li>I do still top with a powder, sometimes powder foundation if I need more coverage, just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and evens out my skin tone while also protecting my skin from the sun.</li>
            <li>I find that Dr Jart BB creams give much better coverage, but Dr Jart creams make my face break out.  </li>
            <li>To sum it up:  Pros:  Smooth texture and buildable consistency  Leaves skin smooth  Good oil control  </li>
            <li>I love the creaminess and the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that sometimes there are stickers to indicate the authentic</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>But I have to admit it&#x27;s not always a perfect match, since each product are slightly different tones.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this brand.</li>
            <li>One pumps does it, on the top of your hand, then dab away.</li>
            <li>One more word of advice,</li>
            <li>and you literally have at the bottom, alot more cream.</li>
            <li>and they did send me an authentic product.</li>
            <li>and we have both notice better feeling and looking skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many helpful reviews, so I just wanted to add that to build coverage and not get a \\&quot;cakey\\</li>
            <li>I love the way it works.</li>
            <li>It is better than makeup too me.</li>
            <li>MOST OF THEM I USED, THEY DON&#x27;T KEEP MY MAKE UP STAY</li>
            <li>I would say this is more of a medium coverage</li>
            <li>more now.will start using this one in earnest soon since it&#x27;s warming up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve referred this product to many friends and they are just as in love with it as I am.</li>
            <li>Love the look of my skin with this BB cream.</li>
            <li>This is mostly for evening the skin tone</li>
            <li>It has a shiny finish so make sure you set it with a mineral or setting powder.  </li>
            <li>I received mine promptly and I was happy to get it straight away.</li>
            <li>I will continue looking for a better match product for myself, though, I will recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li>love the product - no colors even close to my complextion.  </li>
            <li>love it though.</li>
            <li>I will give another week and update this review even more</li>
            <li>Hope to do more business with you.</li>
            <li>It had better coverage than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>As soon as I had finished applying this on my face, it seemed as though all my blemishes magically disappeared.</li>
            <li>Okay, okay,</li>
            <li>and I would gladly repurchase this in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>thats what i like most about it.</li>
            <li>and I hope it helps you decide if this BB cream is for you :)</li>
            <li>so I will not be able to help those looking for an in depth review</li>
            <li>However, BEWARE, there are sellers that say their products are authentic but are in fact, FAKE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The boxes and the tubes seemed to look authentic.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I squirted out the product that I noticed that the application button was more \\&quot;springy\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The product itself was more watery and had a pink/peach appearance instead of the gray color I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>It IS AUTHENTIC and I will purchase from them from now on.  </li>
            <li>It works better than foundation.</li>
            <li>I have tried many primers and BB creams.</li>
            <li>i am so in love with this.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this BB</li>
            <li>Because I love the BB Creams from Skin 79</li>
            <li>, with skin that&#x27;s never given me many issues either way.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really more of a \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li>This cream evens out the redness in my skin and gives me dewy, healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered from Emma&#x27;s Cosmetics &amp; Skincare, and the product appears to be authentic &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Im happy with this product, doesnt have as much coverage</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a bit darker than most \\&quot;pale\\&quot; Asians.</li>
            <li>I love this BB Cream because it does everything its suppose to.</li>
            <li>After trying that one, I was even more convinced that I wouldn&#x27;t find a BB Cream that would work for me.</li>
            <li>plus, it feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it:&lt;br /&gt;-I love that it reduces the redness on my face</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my skin tone took brighter like in</li>
            <li>everything is okay.</li>
            <li>It is packaged nicely and includes a free sample of another beauty product (in my case (time revolution night repair science activator serum by missha).</li>
            <li>/&gt;After all this, I am almost sure now that the product I got was an authentic skin79 product.</li>
            <li>These are the elaborate reasons why I think my product is legit.</li>
            <li>Since they are known branded, you can feel more safe using them.</li>
            <li>It is better than any BB cream I have ever use.</li>
            <li>OMG, I have been using this fabulous product for three days and am PRAYING that it will not make my skin break out!</li>

            <li>Wii order more.</li>
            <li>(it is now just before Christmas) and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I think it should be an even better match in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product -I always have one for reserve.</li>
            <li>I compared my product and I have an authentic Skin79 BB Cream.</li>
            <li>Love this BB cream..</li>
            <li>, SOMEBODY MAY BE ABLE TO HAVE IT AND USE IT.</li>
            <li>I love the sanitary pump.</li>
            <li>If I am going out for an event sometimes I wear Physician&#x27;s Formula Conceal RX underneath on my cheeks but for the most part I wear Skin79 BB Cream and get nice smooth, build-able coverage....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use something that has a greater shade range.</li>
            <li>and I simply love it.</li>
            <li>but the one I received was authentic and had the official sticker on it.</li>
            <li>Love this beauty balm.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream is definitely the best product for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of this BB cream, I like the smell of it and the color matches perfectly with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>LOVE this seller &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li>love this b b cream.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I wear this bb cream most when I&#x27;m inside because it makes me look like a ghost.  </li>
            <li>If you go to Skin79&#x27;s website, they&#x27;ll show you tips on how to spot an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but a word of caution to those who are more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had almost given up on foundation, since it clogs my pores, and I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found something so much better.</li>
            <li>I presume it is because of the SPF 25 - which i love.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite BB creams to date.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>All I can say is: will buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna try this together with neautragena healthy skin foundation as what I&#x27;ve seen on youtube\\&quot;frmheadtotoe&#x27;s channel..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think anything of it and just though I need to cleanse my face more.</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s a great product if you get the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, I ordered another bottle on Oct 16, 2013 from Letif Beauty with fulfillment by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the coverage</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better in the summer time.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t confirm that the product is expired or authentic</li>
            <li>Well after reading the reviews I was sure this would do wonders to my skin.</li>
            <li>Then I lightly applied my Tarte amazonian clay finishing powder and, voila!</li>
            <li>The more I use this product the more I love it.</li>
            <li>I really, really, love this product...</li>
            <li>for many, many reasons...</li>
            <li>&#x27;s why I love this cream:&lt;br /&gt;-Works</li>
            <li>My forehead needs this the most, so i&#x27;ll repost after i do it on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I read SO MANY REVIEWS before trying to decide on a BB cream.</li>
            <li>and I think way better in terms of coverage and making you look like the examples in the ads!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It turned out okay,</li>
            <li>so I was not looking for any skin healing effects, just to look better with makeup.</li>
            <li>I trusted the reviews of it being authentic and they also sent me 2 samples.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll want to make sure you&#x27;re treating your problem areas with something extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I DIDN&#x27;T break out, my skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there, but this is working for me.</li>
            <li>ever since I&#x27;ve used these 3 together my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I use a powder foundation over top of it</li>
            <li>I have heard that the VIP Gold BB cream has more skin-improving qualities, however.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a lovely, dewy finish, and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>
            <li>Just wish more colors would be availble.</li>
            <li>and I find works better for me.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>just LOVE this BB cream and will purchase it again as soon as I run out.  </li>
            <li>so do not like being able to feel what I have</li>
            <li>And it is safe for my walk with SPF25.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Between the Gold and the Red bottle, I believe the Gold bottle works best for my skin.</li>
            <li>Covers most imperfections.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>,it suits her skin tone better than it did mine ...</li>
            <li>people claimed it left a grayish cast, but I must have a grayish face, because it matched my skin color perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have acne and a peach tint to my skin, and instantly my skin tone looked even and flawless.</li>
            <li>people claimed it left a grayish cast, but I must have a grayish face, because it matched my skin color perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have acne and a peach tint to my skin, and instantly my skin tone looked even and flawless.</li>
            <li>It has more benefits than foundation.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I would love a better bottle.</li>
            <li>After trying it, I think that it creates a nice smooth coverage.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Love the dispensing of this product....</li>
            <li>This gives a nice light coverage on the skin with the added benefits of skin care.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it made my skin any smoother or clearer, but it was a nice light weight moisturizing formula.</li>
            <li>, MOST PRODUCTS DO.</li>
            <li>coverage is better than any drugstore foundation I&#x27;ve ever bought, without having the layers of creams, foundation, concealer, powder, etc.  </li>
            <li>I started to have more break-outs, but</li>
            <li>I really love this bb cream.</li>
            <li>Pay a couple more dollars and buy through a reputable seller.</li>
            <li>This stuff is perfect for my fair but uneven complexion and provides sun protection.</li>
            <li>Healthy skin.</li>
            <li>After watching a youtube video about getting more out of your BB cream</li>
            <li>BB cream itself is ok product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin feel better.</li>
            <li>for more whiter skin tones.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream...</li>
            <li>I found if I applied it by dotting on my face and patting it in like instructed on the box it works and covers much better than if I rub it in.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>but I thought I should since many people are questioning authenticity and whatnot.  </li>
            <li>I believe without a doubt that my bottle is 100% authentic.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and wish I could give it a better rating, but I guess it&#x27;s not just for my skin type.</li>
            <li>but I wish the coverage was better.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li>Lovely Girls and</li>
            <li>My best advise is to get samples; there are a lot of sellers that provide samples when you made a purchase so that you can try different brands before you commit to anything.</li>
            <li>most days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will purchase again once I run out.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it</li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t tried it without putting powder on top</li>
            <li>I love BB Creams and decided to try this out as this is the \\&quot;best\\&quot; they say.</li>
            <li>I attribute that to the whitening agent in this and the face that there are so many</li>
            <li>I bought 3 more products as gifts.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, so I wound up liking Holika Holika&#x27;s Petite Clearing BB Cream better.  </li>
            <li>The color evened out and &amp;#34;darkened&amp;#34; to better match my skin tone, but still had a brightening effect.</li>
            <li>Another great plus was this was matte and stayed matte the whole day.</li>
            <li>i think im in love</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am really happy with it and would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>but there was so many to choose from.</li>
            <li>I love it and</li>
            <li>I love the glow I get from it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to apply it more than once in a day.</li>
            <li>I felt much more confident in which formula to pick after doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt much more confident in which formula to pick after doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cute packaging.</li>
            <li>for a more finished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- my skin looks better and feels better since I&#x27;ve been using it - will look at the gold label to see what that&#x27;s about.  </li>
            <li>but I did feel like if I did it would be able to cover it well.</li>
            <li>I am in Love with it.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>love the product - no colors even close to my complextion.</li>
            <li>love it though.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE what this has done for me.</li>
            <li>I received a functional bottle of BB cream, and it appears perfectly authentic.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Works better than American-type BB creams just now hitting the market for my skin.</li>
            <li>Works well under most translucent finishing powders.</li>
            <li>I rrally love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>Love how this product gives a nice light coverage for my face.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>but  make sure you buy it from ebay, from seller ichitrading.</li>
            <li>Missha perfect cover is better but this is a close 2nd place for me.</li>
            <li>along with my oily skin, i have many acne blemishes and scarring.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s OK for me because it looks so natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better SPF level.</li>
            <li>My skin looked more matte after applying.</li>
            <li>Okay SPF.</li>
            <li>:) But if you want more details, read further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I opened it and it was sealed, and then I looked up online more information about the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this - this is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Will order more when its needed.</li>
            <li>The SKIN79 BB cream is just ok to me.  </li>
            <li>but there are better options out there.</li>
            <li>and I can say my acne has gotten better.</li>
            <li>I am trying to look for ingredients so my pharmacist can look at them to make sure.</li>
            <li>That is why it goes on better by dabbing rather then applying like a moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>I just wish it had more ounces in bottle.</li>
            <li>This is the second BB Cream that I tried and it is the best!</li>
            <li>I feel so confident and am blown away by what i see</li>
            <li>I do like that the product is authentic and has the authentic skin79 sticker on it</li>
            <li>This product has great coverage and is really mattifying.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for summer time use especially on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>i just received this in the mail 20 minutes ago and already I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>So once I was sure, I felt safe to put it on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to love BB creams.</li>
            <li>I also love it because it evens out my skin tone automatically.</li>
            <li>Please Try It Out &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>so I was even MORE scared.</li>
            <li>and the product was still authentic</li>
            <li>I think that my order is 100% authentic now, because everything else on the bottle is authentic, and on the packaging too.</li>
            <li>They also included free samples!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I give it four stars because I still haven&#x27;t tested the product, even though I have concluded it is authentic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i did.</li>
            <li>love AMAZON. :)</li>
            <li>love it and shipping</li>
            <li>Foundation is okay for me</li>
            <li>and I ended up just putting more makeup over it anyway.</li>
            <li>and im really glad I did.</li>
            <li>Nice light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, 5-star kind-of love.</li>
            <li>I used three pumps (more is always better</li>
            <li>If you still want some more coverage / correct color match, use a powder&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If anybody has a suggestion of a better BB Cream, please let me know.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all (and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months already!), and gives a good light-medium coverage that I&#x27;m extremely happy with.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover all blemishes and scars but it will cover mostly some of them.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts about the BB cream, but this is actually the best product.</li>
            <li>I notice on the packaging it has soo many signs</li>
            <li>Of course that opened my eyes to the dozens of different BB creams offered, and of course I wanted to choose the best one.</li>
            <li>seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So go ahead and purchase and jump on this BB bandwagon. :)</li>
            <li>:) WHOOP WHOOP</li>
            <li>One more note, my mom bought this as well, but she is a tan brunette and the color</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of their products..</li>
            <li>so most days can just use this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>nose and cheeks--and have a more finished look as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it, but its ways better than drugstore bb</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>One lighter color-changing foundation, one heavier foundation on top and then concealer on that if needed.  </li>
            <li>I am buying more now just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>I am totally in love with this BB cream</li>

            <li>I did not apply lotion on my skin for many years because it always made my face oily and then would break out.</li>
            <li>I tried many products out the for my pore problem and it just never work.</li>

            <li>I used bronzed on top to help my skin look more like me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Not cakey AT ALL unlike most foundations</li>
            <li>Smells cute</li>
            <li>I love the coverage and the way it goes on my skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on feeling more like a moisturizer than a foundation.</li>
            <li>Even my mother asked me to order it for her, so it works perfectly the same way for the skin over 40 as it does for the skin around 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am most satisfied.</li>
            <li>Im a more Yellowstone skin color.</li>

            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People have also commented on how my skin has improved and looks more radiant since I have been wearing this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>do wear a moisturizer and transparent powder on top to help with wear.</li>
            <li>My favorite product.</li>
            <li>, i tried so many BB cream, and this one ,skin79 is on my top list</li>
            <li>I like how the product applies, but I wish it was more pigmented</li>
            <li>This is it for me :)</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this cream doesn&#x27;t make your face look like made up.  </li>
            <li>not too many imperfections (this is not a concealer)&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>I agree with most 5 star reviews written here.</li>
            <li>I used it on top of Clinique moisture surge and it worked better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it how it blends with my skin and makes my face look whiter</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>you are concerned about wrinkles I have to say that I have had interesting results from the inside out.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this product, i will order it again.</li>
            <li>I want to be so in love with this product.</li>
            <li>This BB is much better than the U.S &amp;#34;brands&amp;#34; (which are just tinted moisturizers).</li>
            <li>I like this creme much more than the Missha M.</li>
            <li>I love that it covers so well without looking like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li>I tried both this and MISSHA M Perfect Cover (No 21), and I&#x27;ve been told by multiple people that this one looks better.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Waaaaaaaay better than any BB Creams or tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve seen at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I think every female needs to find the perfect BB cream for herself.</li>
            <li>just i love it</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>It controls the oils on my skin and gives me a matte yet healthy finish.</li>
            <li>I chose this bb cream because I was looking for a more affordable alternative to my $50 foundation for days when I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>my makeup on top and in a couple of hours my face was oily.</li>
            <li>I found this as a high-rated alternative &amp; am so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than foundation.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never felt better.  </li>
            <li>The 2 Korean BB creams were better in terms of texture, fragrance and end results.</li>
            <li>I love how it nourishes your skin and provides SPF 25.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth, non-greasy feel to it and it soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoother, softer, and more even.</li>
            <li>and I was impressed with the overall look to my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Also, I like the dispenser, not just because it looks nice in your medicine cabinet, but it also does a good job controlling how much product is dispensed.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit to oxidize to the right color, but once it does, it&#x27;s ok matching wise.</li>
            <li>the packaging of the bottle is very unique and i love it.</li>
            <li>I had previously really loved another BB Cream, which I still do love, but this BB cream is now my new favorite!</li>
            <li>75 minutes later, I am astonished to say that this product (mostly) stayed put!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to have it and recommend to those with skin imperfections</li>
            <li>My mom who is very fair, my sister who is toasty colored, my aunt who is sienna, and my very tan self all get full coverage from this product.</li>
            <li>If an area needs more coverage, you can dab more BB Cream on the area without the spot becoming cakey or sticky.</li>
            <li>Best part is that you don&#x27;t have to figure out what color will match your skin because it pretty much matches it for you.</li>
            <li>Got here pretty fast in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>You can still see my freckles (depending on whether you&#x27;re proud to don those or not, and if not, use a little of your foundation on top to cover them, this bb cream works great as a primer :))</li>
            <li>You can still see my freckles (depending on whether you&#x27;re proud to don those or not, and if not, use a little of your foundation on top to cover them, this bb cream works great as a primer :))</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s very easy to put on, the smell is fantastic, improves skin color immediately.</li>
            <li>so I have nothing to compare it to, but I love how easily it goes on and blends in, evens out my skin tone, and I love that it has SPF in it.  </li>
            <li>skin felt super soft and looked flawless!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing my best to get everyone I know to try Skin79 BB creams because they really do end up having a positive effect on your skin.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t advocate which I find more attractive, for I do believe that the majority of what we consider beautiful is relative and cultural; but, I will say that I advocate preserving my own skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li>The best thing about is that it makes my skin look really smooth and natural since the cream is really light</li>
            <li>I bought this one first and loved it</li>
            <li>I hydrate my skin first with a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin</li>
            <li>I loved this product from the first time I put it on.  </li>
            <li>It has pretty good coverage (covers hyper pigmentation and under eye circles)</li>
            <li>It provides a pretty good amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on how to tell fakes from real bottles, and this (to the best of my knowledge) is most definitely real.</li>
            <li>The coverage was pretty good.</li>
            <li>After using this BB cream twice, I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>but what I am pretty good about is putting on</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I will love Lioele Beyond the Solution as well but if not I&#x27;ll update this review!  :)</li>
            <li>But its definately worth it!!</li>
            <li>The longevity was the best part as I have oily skin and nothing lasts very long.</li>
            <li>This bb cream is great for when you don&#x27;t  want a heavy foundation, great for day wear, at the beach etc.</li>
            <li>It just works perfect with dry and oily skin</li>
            <li>but after I gave it a moment to dry it was perfect!  </li>
            <li>The customer service (Katie The Babe) was quick and so kind.</li>
            <li>I easily spread it evenly over my face and it comes off as a more luminous complexion.</li>
            <li>(try something with more moisturizer) as the oil-absorbing properties are quite strong.</li>
            <li>I luckily passed this product while researching and read nothing but amazing reviews.</li>
            <li>I would recommend setting it with a powder though, since it&#x27;s super creamy and has a tendency to kind of slide around.</li>
            <li>It just looks all-around healthy, matte, even, and bright.</li>
            <li>and i dont need that much coverge, so for what i wanted is perfect my face looks very even</li>
            <li>This had incredible coverage and left my skin looking healthy, moisturized, and glowing.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money, I really love this product!   </li>
            <li>As being someone who aspires to travel one day, it goes without saying that I am interested in just about every culture outside of the US&#x27;s borders (no offense to my own country :P) and have always loved Europe and Asia.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful BB cream for dry skin!</li>
            <li>I have light yellow/olive undertones, in the summer tan somewhat easy (on top of using self tanners), but keep a pretty fair complexion in winter months.</li>
            <li>I bought this bb cream mainly because I read so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>All in all:&lt;br /&gt;-light, but very full coverage</li>
            <li>Etude House Precious Mineral #13 is a bit light for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fabulous, just be sure to treat it like makeup and wash it off before you go to sleep. :</li>
            <li>Now it IS more of a light coverage</li>
            <li>I bought the variety pack containing a bunch of samples of BB Cream by SKIN79 and ended up liking the Pink Label best.</li>
            <li>Light on the skin and does not leave a \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; feel that most make up does.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control more now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light, I love the scent.</li>
            <li>to use, works great at covering up acne and redness near my chin and forehead.  </li>
            <li>but I rather pay more and have a piece of mind than be cheap and pay for it with my face.</li>
            <li>i love this foundation, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, but still looks natural.</li>
            <li>This cream has a lovely light floral scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but nothing fantastic.</li>
            <li>But it applied so smoothly and it matched my fair skin tone exactly.  </li>
            <li>have a couple of other BB creams coming for my experimentation (Boots Beautiful Skin &amp; Loreal Magic Skin Beautifier) before I settle on a winner!</li>
            <li>In many ways it is fantastic</li>
            <li>Also be sure to use a light moisterizer before hand, I use cetaphil.</li>
            <li>This was not my first BB cream and maybe if it was, I would have liked it more.</li>
            <li>but I will stick to my wonderful pink bottle.  </li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and moisturizes better than the diamond bb cream.</li>
            <li>Light weight, doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes or hand, Im so in love with Skin79 products,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything drastic as far as changes but it has great coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing makeup much more now since I have been wearing BB cream.</li>
            <li>I love that I can just smooth one pump on my face and go without spending forever on makeup.</li>
            <li>It arrived A LOT sooner than I expected, which was awesome.</li>
            <li>So I did a check one life for the best bb cream and pink came up.</li>
            <li>Pink is the best</li>
            <li>I have beginning wrinkles that are becoming invisible.</li>
            <li>However the pink is awesome too</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a superthick incredible cream for my face that makes me look 5 years younger.</li>
            <li>had ordered a sample pack of skin79&#x27;s bb creams (pink, gold, orange, snail) and wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with any of them.</li>
            <li>It really is quite mind boggling how good my skin looks wearing this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream seems to have a very neutral undertone, so would be a good balancer for people with pinkish undertones like myself.</li>
            <li>So if you want to buy a good knockoff then buy this one but realize it&#x27;s not the really thing.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin and the cream looked so dark, but it blended perfectly AND it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have clay on my face as my husband would put</li>
            <li>I loved the coverage on it though and it blended to my skin shade very well and was moisturizing and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>My skin looks really nice, no wrinkles, and I rarely break out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;probably those good reviews are paid to say that it works, because to real people&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought that this product sounded too good to be true and I was right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-- Light and airy and easy to apply and blend - I love he way</li>
            <li>, the Gold for dry (ideal for winter season, as many reviewers have said), and the Orange falls between the two.</li>
            <li>Out of the bottle it is slightly grey but blends nicely into skin and leaves a very nice finish.  </li>
            <li>I am 38 years old with very light fair skin</li>
            <li>But i am a true believer now!</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t even need a full pump!)</li>
            <li>I was excited about this product, and was able to use a pea-sized amount 3 times before the bottle stopped dispensing.</li>
            <li>(your face won&#x27;t have a perfect matte finish all day but you won&#x27;t be extremely shiny</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually not bad!  </li>
            <li>Product special and beautiful, and works well with the natural skin has no effect</li>
            <li>almost see-through so redness is not something I can really easily hide.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It provides great coverage when you dab it on, but I have to wear a lot of blush to get any color back in my face, and that just makes me look even more like a porcelain doll.</li>
            <li>The texture is not too watery or matte and it glides onto skin easily and blends well..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also made my skin break out easily.</li>
            <li>This bb cream is easy to apply, non sticky.</li>
            <li>The product was easy to use and the gray color will blend with the skin so don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li>Then, the bottle ran out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>Seller was very quick with my order.</li>
            <li>Despite needing to wait to find out if there is any actual change to the texture and tone of my skin, I am happy to use this product as a healthier replacement for my foundation and am looking forward to seeing more changes as I continue to wear Skin79.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this should be easily solved with some strategically applied moisturizer (I wasn&#x27;t using any at the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that the Pink Label&#x27;s more for those with oily skin (ideal for the summer)</li>
            <li>/&gt;• Spreads easily</li>
            <li>I suspect that it would be easy to think of this as a lotion and not bother washing it</li>
            <li>I suspect that it would be easy to think of this as a lotion and not bother washing it</li>
            <li>it glides on easily</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as foundation</li>
            <li>but this product makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get flaky or clumpy or rub off easily, yet it blends well.  </li>
            <li>The cream is mostly suited for light light medium.</li>
            <li>Easy to use container</li>
            <li>Ever since I got this I uses it every day, so easy to apply</li>
            <li>It does rub off easily, the up side to that</li>
            <li>is that is washes off easily too</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a sent.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>maybe like Vaseline intensive care, but STRONG, as I may have</li>
            <li>Great stuff but only for light to very light skin types.</li>
            <li>This product works great on people with fair skin, and if I do get a tan, it makes me look pale.</li>
            <li>I apply this product for special occasions and outings and it makes me feel so confident.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed right now that I am utterly speechless.</li>
            <li>but I felt it was important to point out that this product can and does work miracles for the right kind of skin type and tone.</li>
            <li>It smooths the texture of my skin especially my large pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that this helps it adjust to many other skin tones beyond those of us who are very fair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using this, I like it, nice color and easy to apply</li>
            <li>I purchased my amazing BB cream from Think Pretty and after research, figured out that the BB cream they sell is indeed legit.  </li>
            <li>no regrets LOL</li>
            <li>The BB cream is pretty nice, and this is for my wife.</li>
            <li>so this was my first dip into this kind of product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so flawless and smooth and it perfects to wear it as it is without to put any other make up on it.</li>
            <li>(I heard it was one of the first popular BB cream in Korea).</li>
            <li>and it has the SPF too, which is really nice ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m your average girl who tried this after a chance encounter and a lot of reading of reviews online, and I am telling you that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m your average girl who tried this after a chance encounter and a lot of reading of reviews online, and I am telling you that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>It looks a liittle gray at first, but blends nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it when temps were in the 80&#x27;s and humid and am delighted that my shiny break-through (normally happens within a couple of hours) never did occur.</li>
            <li>The packaging of this product is good and stays relatively clean and the pump is very convenient.</li>
            <li>For those of us who have tan skin, a BB cream may seem like an iffy makeup product, but this particular BB cream seems to oxidize to fit just about any ivory fair to caramel tan skin tone.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hands down the best BB Cream.</li>
            <li>This is the best BB cream I have tried, hands down.</li>
            <li>other than that, she loves it! :D</li>
            <li>I had better coverage, felt like the cover matched better and didn&#x27;t notice any fragrance unlike the Garnier, which had a pretty strong medicine-y odor.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I love the idea of BB creams and own many cult favorite asian BB creams.</li>
            <li>Laneige is a great skin care line with toners and lotions that I have recently become obsessed with and goes great with this BB cream to provide great skin all day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally fair skinned, but I live in the desert and have a bit of a tan.</li>
            <li>They all go on every smooth and easy to blend (I use stippling brush).  </li>
            <li>I have been testing this one out for a couple of weeks now and my skin is doing just fine.</li>
            <li>This brightens them up without settling in the fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It has light/medium coverage and does not highlight fine lines or dryness.  </li>
            <li>but I notice at times my fine lines/</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>I do not need shimmer or glitter settling into my fine lines.</li>
            <li>For spring this bbcream has been fine.</li>
            <li>but this will work fine for me during the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S FINE</li>
            <li>Easy to use    leaves skin smooth    </li>
            <li>Typically, I use &#x27;MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream No. 23&#x27; but decided to switch up my routine because I was breaking out.</li>
            <li>I brush on some powder after and it looks fine.</li>
            <li>Of course after a couple of pumps, it was fine again.</li>
            <li>I typically use BB Creams from The Face Shop, (example: HD Perfect BB Cream), and this works just as well as those.</li>
            <li>The best part is it doesn&#x27;t get oily even when it&#x27;s really hot outside</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and smooth out</li>
            <li>into fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>but it has made a difference in fading any spots and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>and it would&#x27;ve done just fine.</li>
            <li>you can just put a darker powder over it and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a bit lighter and sheerer than the Gold Label, though it goes on just as smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>color is probably best for those with neutral skin tones but works pretty well for yellow.</li>
            <li>I do a quick check in the mirror to make sure that I don&#x27;t have the mask effect going on before I step into the building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super!  </li>
            <li>Also, it shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>For those with more severe acne scarring or dark circles, I would recommend using a concealer over the top, but even without the product has great coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing (I&#x27;ve noticed better skin since I started using it!) and works very well as sunscreen too.</li>
            <li>but this is my very first, after hearing many of my friends rave and rave about it.</li>
            <li>First of all the shipper is SO fast, and the packages were perfect and this is 100% REAL, the comments that say \\&quot;fake,fake\\&quot; are probably people trying to get you to purchase their over priced BB creams, this has the seal of authenticity and Korean barcode&#x27;s,</li>
            <li>My skin is looking good now not shady.</li>
            <li>Some warned of scams, others that this one was great for their combination skin, or better for dry skin, etc.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product with smooth application and pretty good coverage.  </li>
            <li>It was a great color match but it filled in my \\&quot;dry skin micro cracks\\&quot; making it appear as though I had more wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The color does come a bit light, but it somewhat works out for me fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order some more very  soon !!</li>
            <li>I put a little finishing powder over it, and my skin looks awesome.</li>
            <li>On the skin79 website, there is this little test of sorts that you can take to see which of their products is the best for you.  </li>
            <li>So this is perfect with a little concealer.</li>
            <li>It looks a little muddy and gray going on but soon blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very fair with pink undertones.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin (basically not pale and not tan), so I figured this stuff would work well for me with it&#x27;s blending properties (or whatever), but eh not so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my pores look huge and let me tell you</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of BB cream.</li>
            <li>it leaves the face loking like porceline is really amazing; it givs a soft look to the face more glowing</li>
            <li>Plus I work in the sun all day and the sunscreen aspect is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>My skin look natural and smooth and bright up my face</li>
            <li>I have huge pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but still i was happy to have received it, for some reason the consistency was not the same as i had remembered</li>
            <li>For light coverage, Skin 79.  </li>
            <li>no wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, this product is definitely worth every penny :]</li>
            <li>Coverage is light to medium.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try its affordable compared to many foundations and lotions and the bottle lasts awhile.  </li>
            <li>used coconut oil for moisturizing, stippled the cream with a Sigma flat-top brush and finished with a light brushing of mineral powder and blush.  </li>
            <li>or if you enjoy trial and error shade matching attempts.</li>
            <li>One thing worth mention is that, I found out apply it with finger is better than using the brush.</li>
            <li>it was way too light, but I let it sit and hoped that it would adjust to my skin.</li>
            <li>The cream is a light tan with a gray tint</li>
            <li>It covers like a foundation but with light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>I bought this off of ebay since it was cheaper and free shipping.</li>
            <li>-It makes my face smooth after</li>
            <li>I do love the smooth, lotion-like texture of the cream, it has a nice scent and leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It oxidizes on the skin, so if you have really light skin on your face</li>
            <li>My color is like a light tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently decided to  jump on the BB Cream bandwagon and I am happy I did.</li>
            <li>But with such a great price I decided to give it a whirl</li>
            <li>its gives u great coverage withiout feeling cackey and at the same time mosturize!!</li>
            <li>Light fragrance (floral).&lt;br /&gt;BB Creams are NOT meant to replace sunscreen</li>
            <li>Now that I have told you everything about my skin that is important, lets get to the review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is extremely important.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control</li>
            <li>light to med skin Korean</li>
            <li>then a light foundation on every morning!SKIN 79 is the answer</li>
            <li>But overall, I am so happy with this product</li>
            <li>Just great stuff overall.</li>
            <li>It blends beautfifully, and is so easy to clean off...</li>
            <li>I have light, oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>But, at the risk of being redundant:  This product is great!!!  </li>
            <li>The soap is cheap but the toner is on the pricey side.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot if you&#x27;ve tried everything else &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I adore this product and the price was fantastic for me.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wrinkle Improvement\\&quot; instead of Wrinkle Free.</li>
            <li>Not so great for me personally because of the color.</li>
            <li>and it is light weight.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and covers the flaws.</li>
            <li>The color is fairly light though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just going to be too light.</li>
            <li>It is of light  consistency.....</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and covers any imperfections I may have.</li>
            <li>, the color was okay for my light beige skin (yellow undertone).&lt;br /&gt;It looks good just by itself, but sometimes I touch up with foundation if I am out on a date or at night.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I also go free Misha samples...</li>
            <li>It was smooth and didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Light coverage    </li>
            <li>(light yet</li>
            <li>The coverage is fantastic and I saw a noticeable difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase again because the color is too light.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Skin appears smooth and even&lt;</li>
            <li>I just blot with a tissue sometimes before applying a light layer of powder.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t really like it when I wear any kind of makeup</li>
            <li>I found out that product for Korean distributors say wrinkle improvement, while for US distributors it says wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping my skin will adjust because this product feels AMAZING on my skin</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t know it came with 2 free samples in the package which was a surprise to her and me but</li>
            <li>My complexion is caramel , the BB cream that I got was too light for my complexion .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>it felt like my skin was light and airy.</li>
            <li>it felt like my skin was light and airy.</li>
            <li>I like how it makes your skin so smooth and gives you a porcelain skin look.</li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY FACE SMOOTH</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that you pay attention to the color.  </li>
            <li>Overall GREAT product.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper than the MAC foundation I had been using, feels amazing and doesn&#x27;t look like you are wearing any makeup on your skin.</li>
            <li>They also give me free bb cream samples</li>
            <li>It truly does perfect and even the skin tone of your face and without being heavy or looking like a mask.  </li>
            <li>The product portion could literally fit 4 dimes.</li>
            <li>The color was way to light for me.</li>
            <li>but if you just give it a minute or 2, it blends smooth and will match to skin tone.</li>
            <li>Its great to me because it is just so simple</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to me to have my sellers located in the U.S. so that it doesn&#x27;t take forever for something to reach me from overseas</li>
            <li>I prefer make-up free look with sun protection.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an overall great product and 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li>I do not desire a tan, either, which is important to note if you want to use this product because it has whitening agents and spf 25.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a great deal, especially compared to the smashbox and sephora store ones.</li>
            <li>This BB cream goes on really smooth and seems to soak up oils.</li>
            <li>but I believed it was too light and that it looked that I used two shades lighter on my face and it was a bit  grey-ish</li>
            <li>so cheap- compared to Dr.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>a day on my face, a great improvement over my former 3-4 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels so amazing on skin and has not broken me out.</li>
            <li>I am a tan complextion and it was extremely light on me, I had to blend it with my foundation.  </li>
            <li>But it is so light.</li>
            <li>Great price, especially for the size of the product.</li>
            <li>Coverage is amazing and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Light weight</li>
            <li>However, if any of my traits sound like you, try this, try this, try this.</li>
            <li>However, if any of my traits sound like you, try this, try this, try this.</li>
            <li>I like light coverage</li>
            <li>It is light and keeps me almost oil free all day.</li>
            <li>Will be fabulous for the fall and winter.</li>
            <li>It feels light</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a great bb cream, you should definitely buy this one!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The next day wasn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li>It really looks like no makeup and feels nice on (even in 85% humidity weather).ation</li>
            <li>It really looks like no makeup and feels nice on (even in 85% humidity weather).</li>
            <li>dot this on my skin , then use a makeup sponge to lightly spread all over my face.</li>
            <li>I finished off the look with a light dusting of blush and was amazed.  </li>
            <li>As for now, thank you Skin79 and the sellers for making this product available to people not in Korea</li>
            <li>Light, even coverage.</li>
            <li>It helps smooth over imperfections and works to nourish/</li>
            <li>the best bb cream ever and its authentic!i sooo love this and will never go back to my old moisturizer!thanks pinkgelee</li>
            <li>It is truly a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>am Caucasian with a light tan/olive complexion that tends to be oily in my t-zone.</li>
            <li>And the product was genuine (which I know is a huge concern for us Amazon shoppers) trustworthy seller</li>
            <li>This is my second day using it and it feels so great and goes on creamy (i use my fingers).</li>
            <li>Such a great price to include shipping.</li>
            <li>Smooth texture on skin</li>
            <li>Coverage is not too light, not too heavy (Perfect for me because I have light acne scars)&lt;br</li>
            <li>(i make sure to not put any around my laugh</li>
            <li>The moment I got it, it covered my blemishes and made my skin feel really light.</li>
            <li>I saw such great reviews I had to try this BB cream.</li>
            <li>This product feels light on the skin, and manages to wear well through the work day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice bottle ,and very even, not oily</li>
            <li>Quite light weight for my oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t like it because I feel cheap wearing it</li>
            <li>but this is excellent for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I am fairly light</li>
            <li>There is no smell to it (something I prefer) and the coverage is light to medium, which is what BB&#x27;s should be.</li>
            <li>The product makes my skin look dewey, gives medium coverage, and feels really comfortable.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll probably stick with this seller if buying from Amazon (unless I see guarantees else where that it is genuine).</li>
            <li>It feels light and keep the makeup in place, even when I sweat.  </li>
            <li>Skin79 states this product is not oil free but is non-comedogenic (this is not mentioned on their website but a representative on their facebook page confirmed).</li>
            <li>Now its coverage is light to medium.</li>
            <li>It provides light coverage with a dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The foundation is gave me skin smooth and moisturizer all day</li>
            <li>To set it, I used the Skin79 Oriental Smooth Sun BB pact powder.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t praise this product enough, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my face!</li>
            <li>friend told me I looks young and my face skin looks so good ,I can&#x27;t help myself and told her what I used.</li>
            <li>At first the cream has a grey tint to it, but after blended (and patted) onto the skin, it matches perfectly!</li>
            <li>This product actually adjusts really well, covers blemishes, and moisturizes :D</li>
            <li>I loved this BB cream and used up my entire bottle, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I loved how it gave a matte effect, made my skin soft and had staying power</li>
            <li>and they disappear so far so good with this one.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t meant for full coverage, but most of the time I don&#x27;t need full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My skin type is &amp;#34;Angry&amp;#34; and oily -- most makeup / skin care products are vetoed via breakouts (good o&#x27;ll fashion zits + cystic), burning sensations, giant blackheads, redness, etc.</li>
            <li>complexion is fair with neutral undertones and my natural hair color is/was medium auburn.</li>
            <li>Garnier and Skin79 is, by far, a superior product.  </li>
            <li>but the product is good for people with sensitive skin, and it is most likely for people with really light fair skin.</li>
            <li>The gray ashiness that you first get right after application oxidizes within 15 minutes to a beautiful finish that matches my skin tone really well.  </li>
            <li>As of right now I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t use an oil mattifier for the first time in years!!</li>
            <li>, just go to their website and oredr a real one!!!</li>
            <li>I REALLY SUGGEST YOU TO GET THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>Forgot to note at the top that I have always had very large pores.  </li>
            <li>when the huge rave for BB creams began spreading around the US, of course I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but recently someone commented on how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>i loved this product very much it looks very natural&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>I started receiving compliments about how smooth and clean my skin was.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried the pink first and was really happy with it but wish I had tried the gold first because I liked it even better on my skin.</li>
            <li>When applied it matches my normal overall look perfectly.</li>
            <li>At first glance mines seem to be ok, but if you place it under the light it does look like the tampered image they show you.</li>
            <li>But SKIN79 (hot pink) has been so awesome for my skin.  </li>
            <li>No negative reactions etc... I need to purchase some more soon :-)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even need to use a full pump, and it covered my whole face nicely.</li>
            <li>(very fair with pink undertones) quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product has met and exceeded all of my expectations and is my new favorite make-up product!</li>
            <li>Make sure when you put it on dont use very much.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with freckles, this color was a bit too dark, even after blending&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>It came with 2-day shipping (well, I have Amazon prime), and best of all, the product was authentic, and the cream was taken from a new batch, due to expire in Nov 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with mild acne and have been looking for a good cover up.    </li>
            <li>This makeup is super creamy with fabulous coverage , light and airy texture.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about the bb cream movement</li>
            <li>BB cream significantly reduced the oiliness of my nose and even my forehead.</li>
            <li>I just got this in the mail today so excited to try the HYPE.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it only for people with light or fair skin color because it has a light tint.</li>
            <li>Missha was the first BB cream I tried, and I thought it was okay</li>
            <li>If you go to their website it will show you the difference between an original sticker and a tampered one.</li>
            <li>the orange one seems it might be better for her skin, as it has higher SPF and she has a lot of sun spots on her</li>
            <li>I was excited to get a package from korea</li>
            <li>I love it so much I even offer to buy their bottle from them if they don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li>I really love this product and feel pretty on my face.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a nice BB cream, most fit for BB cream newbies.</li>
            <li>the cream is thicker like the original one.</li>
            <li>When my product arrived I was so excited to tried it on.</li>
            <li>Not sure how well it would hold up in humid conditions or while sweating, but it&#x27;s perfect for cooler weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought from the seller PinkGelee&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in about a week or so, an authentic product, not a fake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one who was particularly excited for the BB creams in the US.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t exactly cover it that you can&#x27;t see it; it sort of evens out those areas to give my face a more even skin tone, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it on and immediately washed my face and squirted some BB cream onto my fingertips.</li>
            <li>The whitening feature did help my skin significantly.  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff when I first got it</li>
            <li>I rated it 3 stars because I bet this one is original.</li>
            <li>All the original signs are found in this product as Ive searched for the signs in youtube.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I bought this product.</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed with the coverage, and it was extremely buildable.</li>
            <li>The shipping was pretty okay, not forever.</li>
            <li>This product is best in SMALL amounts.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Has a color that is too light for me, has a sweet smell that I can not wear would not buy again</li>
            <li>I looked like, and felt like, Casper the friendly ghost and resolved to figure out what I was doing wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Glad I decided to go with this as my first choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Think Pretty sells authentic products and has *</li>
            <li>and I RARELY get pimples!  </li>
            <li>, I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have used it every day and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Now many months later, I still absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY, even better than my foundation.</li>
            <li>This cream helped to fade years worth of acne scars!</li>
            <li>but I apply a bit of loose mineral powder on top of it and it blend really good with my skin tone</li>
            <li>As previously mentioned, I&#x27;m very fair and my neck does match my face</li>
            <li>The coverage is light, so I do put concealer in certain areas that need more coverage.</li>
            <li>The coverage could be a little more, but I&#x27;ve found that putting some mineral makeup over this works great.</li>
            <li>So I was very excited to receive my first BB cream.  </li>
            <li>First pump it was very rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very excited as this is my first BB cream</li>
            <li>clean- not like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>and I see many young people use and love it as well.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and smooth and simply amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cheap, and the size is not small.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Would it match my super light skin well?</li>
            <li>The most amazing facial product I ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve given it five stars because it has a nice texture and does smooth the appearance of skin and makes it feel extremely soft</li>
            <li>a clean way.&lt;br /&gt;-It minimizes my pores.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is matte with a fresh dew though out the day and easy to wash off at night.</li>
            <li>yet it blends in perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leave a cakey finish like most others I have tired.</li>
            <li>it is cheaper than department store brands and the larger size makes it more cost effective than drug store brands.  </li>
            <li>Super light, I don&#x27;t feel cakey after I put it on.  </li>
            <li>Ordering from Pink Gellee was a good experience, and I&#x27;m hoping to be able to return the product for one without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin feels and looks fresh, with a beautiful matte finish all day long.</li>
            <li>Skin feels and looks fresh, with a beautiful matte finish all day long - Matte?</li>
            <li>It really does a good job with oil control for me, so I have not broken out since using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a good job with oil control and provides a nice coverage that isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li>After wearing Mary Kay&#x27;s Creme to Powder foundation for 14 years, I&#x27;ve switched to this because it&#x27;s much more natural looking, has a high SPF and is good for my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would not recommend this, however it seems many people have had positive experiences with it.  </li>
            <li>I suppose that might make me more sensitive to feeling \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; with any sort of product on, but I&#x27;m happy to say that Skin79 barely feels like anything at all.</li>
            <li>Like this better than most bb creams but would like a little more coverage but is better than foundation will buy again</li>
            <li>This thing stays matte the whole day and my skin is super oily!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, but covers very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pretty excited to try it out!</li>
            <li>Really happy with this BB cream i like it much better than the new drugstore ones that have recently come out like the ones by Maybelline and Loreal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at the age where they say less is more as far as foundation; this BB cream gives perfect, undetectable coverage.</li>
            <li>Like I&#x27;ve said, I have tried many other BB creams, even ones made for oily skin, but nothing has made my skin feel good like this one.</li>
            <li>It offers great, natural coverage; it&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and worried this would make me break out, but I have been using it for 4 weeks now and can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this.</li>
            <li>The coverage was ok, not as good as other products I have used</li>
            <li>skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am light to fair skinned, Caucasian, and I have always had mild to moderate acne with some days no breakouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just nothing too special.</li>
            <li>nothing really special.</li>
            <li>I wore it on a winter vacation to Hawaii instead of sunscreen most days with a large floppy hat without any problems.  </li>
            <li>I hope this works for me bec its a headache trying to find the right concealer/foundation for my oily skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hispanic and on the tan side and this bb cream blends right in!</li>
            <li>It has a great velvety thick texture that blends and covers very easily without looking caked on or flaked.  </li>
            <li>I used my fingertips to pat it on and had a pretty flawless finish after setting it with a little mineral powder.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is great for someone like me who uses minimal makeup.</li>
            <li>This cream makes my daily routine so much easier with beautiful results.</li>
            <li>And I have to say that the results so far are amazing.</li>
            <li>Honestly the american brands really can&#x27;t compete with the amazingness of the korean BB&#x27;s they are far superior:)</li>
            <li>Immediately, my skin felt soft &amp; silky AND looked amazing</li>
            <li>Too Face gives a dewy/sheer/natural look and good for yellow tone</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff...</li>
            <li>I love it so much after a week, I am ordering another because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for full coverage, check into another BB cream.</li>
            <li>when i got this bb cream,i really like the color of the bottle,so cute</li>
            <li>I used it as a primer for my foundation and loved it, making my foundation go on smoother and last longer.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s also true that they&#x27;ll eventually blend to match your skin color.  </li>
            <li>Me and my sister have been using this Bebliesh Balm for not even a full week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true it does have a grayish tint to it</li>
            <li>Cool product.</li>
            <li>I have a face full of freckles from all my burns.  </li>
            <li>so if you are looking for something with full coverage this is probably not for you.</li>
            <li>what better way to do so than to buy it straight from the source in Korea</li>
            <li>When I want to wear \\&quot;real make-up\\&quot;, I love Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Maestro--it is pricey, but with foundation I believe you get what you pay for.)</li>
            <li>as i tought, but still keeps me very haooy :)</li>
            <li>Bare Minimum Pressed Powder for a more skin-like natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Lioele Triple the Solution BB Cream out of curiosity, and after applying it on my skin I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful my skin looks!  </li>
            <li>I have decided to buy the BB cream straight from the Skin79 website just to be sure</li>
            <li>Being able to buy one product at a reasonable price will save me a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It provides good coverage, makes your skin tone look even, matches my skin tone, and it has even improved my overall skin tone.</li>
            <li>(wore it for full 8 hours for 4days) but the noticeable color difference bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>much as I would like to love this product, it just isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>There are many reviews on here saying it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>even I have a mixed complexion and it doesn&#x27;t look good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I am coming to buy more now, and you can see how much I like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the Red bottle is good for oily skin at all.  </li>
            <li>Full coverage.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold up well to sweet.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really a problem in the winter, but there is no way I would be able to wear this in the summer if I&#x27;m planning on spending time</li>
            <li>Okay, I really wanted this cream to work.</li>
            <li>It feels cool and moist on my skin and keeps me protected from UV rays.</li>
            <li>Nice matching color with my skin, and texture of the cream is far smoother than the one that I used.</li>
            <li>For good coverage, the amount of foundation you&#x27;ll need (and keep needing, if you need to keep applying it throughout the day to cover imperfections) can be massive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it does not lasts a full day&#x27;s work.</li>
            <li>Japanese products are good.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all good the next day.</li>
            <li>so i decided to get the full size.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Even after wearing it for a good portion of the day my face isn&#x27;t as oily as when I used to wear regular foundation.</li>
            <li>Plus, the BB felt like a nice, soft lotion, not at all like makeup or US brand</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have many blemishes, scars, or the like, so I don&#x27;t require too much coverage.</li>
            <li>My goal was to find a BB cream that was good for my skin but looks like an air brushed finish like I had as a model.</li>
            <li>I had read in a magazine that bb cream not only was good for pores but your over all skin care.</li>
            <li>U will need to use an oil absorbing powder on top of this.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it really does work to even skin tone and give your complexion a healthy, dewy look.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good BB cream.</li>
            <li>does have a gray tint to it as others have said and it was a bit of a turn off, but I read from others that you just have to blend it in which is true.</li>
            <li>I almost felt as if I didn&#x27;t even need additional foundation, but I do like full coverage for my acne scars</li>
            <li>It provides full coverage without feeling caked on.</li>
            <li>fair to medium complexion with yellow undertones&lt;</li>
            <li>It lasts for the whole day I have had it on for 12 hours or more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from seoul i think came in about 2 weeks not bad</li>
            <li>SURE YOU WASH THAT STUFF OFF COMPLETELY!!!</li>
            <li>the amount is pretty much easy to control because of the pump...</li>
            <li>BTW, I bought mine from Pink Gelee, it was the cheapest seller that sold to Canada and they were very courteous too</li>
            <li>The coverage is pretty good especially when I apply some power on top, it lasts all day even in a hot sweaty day.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love looking at your skin in your car vanity mirror with all the natural light- because for me that&#x27;s the true color match test.</li>
            <li>I heard alot of great reviews from other websites and I thought I go ahead and try it.</li>
            <li>Came in substandard packaging, but great considering it was shipped with other objects.</li>
            <li>Instead, it covered great, didn&#x27;t itch or make me breakout (which I think the other one may have -</li>
            <li>I have not tried any other BB creams so I cannot compare but this product is also great.</li>
            <li>That the bottle was pretty and that is was cheap are the only two good things I can say about this cream.</li>
            <li>My theory is if a little bit is good than mass quantities must better.  </li>
            <li>When I need more coverage, I prefer Missha M Perfect Cover, which doesn&#x27;t require quite as much building, but decent coverage can be achieved with this, with a little time.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference in the natural tone of my skin or wrinkles (then again I don&#x27;t really have many), but it works great as quick foundation.</li>
            <li>But seriously this is some great stuff!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for everyday because it feels super light.</li>
            <li>This cream has a light coverage but evens my skin tone and does not irritate or make my sensitive skin break out :)</li>
            <li>My skin is super oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li>also the shipping was super super</li>
            <li>I think this cream is great for young and old alike.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s why I love this particular BB</li>
            <li>but it does go away rather quickly.</li>
            <li>SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>my T-zone gets oily quick.</li>
            <li>My nose and around my nostrils have been super oily and are my number one problematic area and everything that I put doesn&#x27;t help, but not this BB</li>
            <li>, it is super creamy and</li>
            <li>and I set my BB cream with Maybelline Dream Matte Powder for a super matte finish or Sonia Kashuk</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re ok with using magical products, then definitely buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She recommend me to the Skin79 Super+.</li>
            <li>This product matched my tanned, Asian skin (I think I was a NW25) tone very well, and I don&#x27;t look like a geisha lol.</li>
            <li>I have only had this product for a couple days now, but I sure do love it.</li>
            <li>and my face gets super oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>received the product quickly.</li>
            <li>5000 mcg, Super Potency, 120 Softgels]], and</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I received the Skin77 Super+</li>
            <li>Probably shoulda had more realistic expectations, but I&#x27;ll still keep using this.</li>
            <li>I am also getting older and noticing I need more moisture.  </li>
            <li>I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>This is only the second BB cream I have ever tried, but this is one of the best things that has ever happened to my beauty routine!  </li>
            <li>Super seller, Super quality bb cream.</li>
            <li>it helps, I ordered from pinkgelee, and their products are legitimate (they ship pretty quickly, too!).</li>
            <li>I found that with dabbing motion, as opposed wiping motion, the color corrects quite quickly and matches my skin tone</li>
            <li>, it has help tremendously with my acne.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my quick and dirty:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>American bb creams are more like a tinted moisturizer, while Korean bb creams are a magical make up wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is light, and depending on how much sun I&#x27;ve gotten can range from an ivory to a light nude color.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll hopefully have a link up to my website with further information and before/after pictures for you to look at. :)and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I also have never had a problem getting pregnant and since using this product we have been trying for another child and regardless of what we do we can&#x27;t get pregnant.</li>
            <li>And if my cycles normalize and I get pregnant quickly then I will stop using this product.</li>
            <li>like quick effortless makeup</li>
            <li>LOVE this product and will buy more from the same seller once I run out.</li>
            <li>SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>It shipped quick, too.</li>
            <li>The coverage is awesome, it definitely minimizes pores which is especially noticeable in the creases of my nose.  </li>
            <li>But I was lucky with this one.</li>
            <li>Go check out the article listed above and take a look at all the different BB creams to find the best one for your skin type!</li>
            <li>I take it off at night with a mild cleanser</li>
            <li>was amazingly quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been super into make up.</li>
            <li>SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>no touching up.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the bargain hunters on babycenter for this amazing find! :)</li>
            <li>The texture of this product is pretty light, smooth on nicely, however, applying moisturizer prior to this product is recommended.</li>
            <li>im puerto rican and italian and am pretty light but have yellow undertones and this just matched my skin perfect</li>
            <li>After just two weeks I can already see that my old acne scars are disappearing right before my eyes and my skin is supple and clearer than its been since puberty!!!</li>
            <li>On a good skin day i can wear just this with a little blush and mascara for a flawless everyday look.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for the first time because I read so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>And the price for this is amazing, :O</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute, definitely icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>I do go ahead and put a light layer of moisturizer on my face first.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this product is awesome and may just replace my foundation routine completely.</li>
            <li>Since today is my first day of using this fantastic product I cannot vouch for that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light, and i had hoped it would darken to my skin color.</li>
            <li>I must add a foundation on top that is darker than my normal skin color to cover up this whiteness.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to purchase my very first BB cream.</li>
            <li>Shipping was VERY fast!</li>
            <li>There was also an almost pearly luminescent quality to the overall look of my skin, which made it look very healthy.</li>
            <li>There was also an almost pearly luminescent quality to the overall look of my skin, which made it look very healthy.</li>
            <li>First of all,I did enjoy the intial look it gave.</li>
            <li>It glides on so very smoothly and leaves my face feeling very, very soft.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a bit worried that it was going to be really light.</li>
            <li>I have had a normal cycle almost to the hour for many years now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the color may seem light at first, it does transition to your skin color quite a bit.</li>
            <li>It really didn’t fit my skin , although I was so excited to try it .</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s not a natural skin color for a caucasian woman, even with fair skin.  </li>
            <li>doesnt do a good coverage at all and also a bit grey on the skin.</li>
            <li>but after a few minutes it matches your skin beautifully.</li>
            <li>I have combination, medium toned asian skin, and this product is great at keeping my skin moisturized and even-toned without being too oily, plus it has a decent SPF.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I went down this route.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I went down this route.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one is great for keeping sebum production down.</li>
            <li>Overall, this BB cream comes with very cute packaging, very convenience and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>Since I have had more disappointing than good experiences with those products, I started wondering if I should have invested in something a bit more top of the line.</li>
            <li>I have the oiliest skin ever and would normally need to blot every 2 hours and if its hot every hour!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve honestly found most of the local BB creams to be nothing more than tinted moisturizers, with the exception of the Clinique version which is a little better.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for something that looks natural, not too heavy and that is actually good for your skin then this product is for you! :)</li>
            <li>the years I&#x27;ve accumulated a drawer full of foundations and tinted moisturizers in hopes of finding the right product for my face.</li>
            <li>The Maybeline one works great for half the price.</li>
            <li>But many of the reviews said that the one shade worked on pretty much any complexion shade.</li>
            <li>have fair skin, and tend to be on the dry side.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not sure how the pump is designed inside, but I&#x27;m guessing there will be a fair amount of product that won&#x27;t be able to be used at the end.</li>
            <li>and you can easily control how much you want to get out.</li>
            <li>While I was there, I realized that I could easily scratch off the lettering on the front, and that it wasn&#x27;t the REAL Skin79</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and blends easily.</li>
            <li>But this one is good for those dry winter months.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and blends so easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t use a moisturizer under it the first time and it was good all day, second</li>
            <li>This product is so great because it provides real skin protection that will make a difference in the long run for your skin.  </li>
            <li>this is the first time I try such a good foundation.</li>
            <li>im combination mostly oily and very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>: love the product so far!</li>
            <li>It is only for light skin, though, but my husband told me my complexion looked really nice the first day I had this on.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that it covered better than my Benefit Oxygen WoW!</li>
            <li>ok, maybe i expected more benefits or coverage but not bad</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>even my husband ( who NEVER notices anything) asked if I had done something different because I looked better!</li>
            <li>Worldbuy365 sells legit skin 79 products no fake order from them!</li>
            <li>My first impressions were: FUN PACKAGING!</li>
            <li>But overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li>My 24% zinc oxide facial sunscreen absorbs more easily than this</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and when I wear products more than 5 hours, I get a rash or break out :/&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does the exact same great job of hiding my big pores, while also having a thicker consistency that covers blemishes better.</li>
            <li>This one is fine but doesn&#x27;t seem to match my skin as much.</li>
            <li>light for certain skintones</li>
            <li>it covers more than I expected, but it feels very light on my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin 79 color isn&#x27;t that great, a little greyish.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t great coverage, but it does seem to help my makeup stay put a little longer.  </li>
            <li>It does go on a little gray, but after blending it I was amazed at how great it covered and matched my skin.</li>
            <li>The authentic product looks a little grayish when you put it on and oxidizes to a nice beige.</li>
            <li>The ONLY difference is that this is more apt to work on many different skin types because it is not tailored to a certain skin type, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Even when I have not used this for a few days, my skin still looks great.</li>
            <li>I compared this to a mixture of my own I created of my favorite sunblock, foundation (with acne control...Neutrogena), and a few drops of argan oil.</li>
            <li>It is light and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize as much as Skin79, but the finish makes my skin look like my skin</li>
            <li>That freaked me out, because some of the &#x27;Real&#x27; versions out there shows Wrinkle Free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;m very fair-skinned (Caucasian), and this product is made for light skin tones.</li>
            <li>And thanks for the free sample</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard nothing but amazing things about it, so I finally decided to give it a try myself.</li>
            <li>When I got my package, I instantly tried it on and it feels soooooo amazing.</li>
            <li>&quot; Then, on goes my Bare Minerals Matte Foundation, and although my skin looks great at this stage, I add on the Bare Minerals Mineral Veil after this to set my foundation for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>This BB cream is the best I&#x27;ve tried as far as texture and coverage without feeling heavy, and believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of BB creams.</li>
            <li>I now use it lightly and don&#x27;t really get the redness</li>
            <li>Few months ago, after all the hype about BB creams, I bought Missha Perfect BB Cream #23, Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream #13, and Skin 79 pink label BB Cream (Ebay seller in Korea).  </li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable, it feels light on the skin, and offers good coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is way more even already, and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>The tint comes out more natural looking as well.  </li>
            <li>Clearly should have read more into this.  </li>
            <li>This is far better for her skin than foundation</li>
            <li>have medium complexion with a golden undertone and acne scaring.</li>
            <li>Fresh?</li>
            <li>When I have a lot of pimples I do need to use concealer, but those occasions are rare.</li>
            <li>but I do have laugh lines and this cream does not improve them.</li>
            <li>I set the BB Cream with some light translucent powder (Loreal Translucide) just so I could blend my blush better and because it is a personal preference</li>
            <li>It looks like it is natural healthy skin.</li>
            <li>So I started to mix the two different types of BB Creams to create my own color.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to add any extra shine which is also nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked on this brand, and it&#x27;s worth the addiction.</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite day time bb cream.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture and how clear my skin has been.</li>
            <li>It only comes in one shade (which is nice for me-</li>
            <li>I have medium fair skin that although I am in my fifties, I have to be careful not to use any pore clogging products to avoid breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product but before it came, I picked up another BB cream in the drugstore (Maybelline Dream Fresh).</li>
            <li>, my skin looks natural but a lot better.</li>
            <li>After using this, my roommate and boyfriend have complimented on my more natural looking skin.</li>
            <li>absorbed by the body.&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li>so far i love this bb cream i been using since i got it</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin just looks natural and healthy with this BB cream on.</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion with pink undertones.</li>
            <li>My husband commented that my skin looks so much more natural when I wear this instead of foundation.  </li>
            <li>I liked it enough to use it all.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and nearly every day for more than a year.</li>
            <li>product is definitely worth the hype.  </li>
            <li>so thanks pink gelee!!I&#x27;ve been using tinted moisturizer before i got this bb cream, and now I am happy to found this one.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it a 1 star rating, is because whatever product this was laid really nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li>But it looks more natural than foundation.</li>
            <li>I rarely used any makeup and rarely got any pimples.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbed &amp; leaves skin looking even &amp; fresh.  </li>
            <li>The cream is nice, maybe for younger age 20-25</li>
            <li>it worth to try for this price.</li>
            <li>I ordered Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Fresh BB Cream, but I found out after lots of research that it was just another moisturizer, not a \\&quot;true\\&quot; BB cream.</li>
            <li>Patting instead of rubbing gives it a more natural look.</li>
            <li>The seller Pink Gelee is a reputable seller and my Skin79 was authentic.</li>
            <li>Covers up some of my red tone in my skin (which is good) and matches very well.</li>
            <li>So far this cream has not made me break out and it keeps my skin somewhat matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait</li>
            <li>(my friends make fun of me because it just looks like I&#x27;m slapping myself in the mirror).</li>
            <li>would recommend buying a sample kit of BB Creams, the Skin79 mini set of 4 for example, is worth it.</li>
            <li>My complextion is smoother, clearer and appears fresh and dewy as opposed bumpy, blotchy and oily.  </li>
            <li>The price makes it definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still there and looks FAR better than it used to around 9-10pm)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The cream has a different texture which I don&#x27;t have words to describe, kind of like lotion without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Korres Golden Beige.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t need any heavy coverage foundation, this bb cream is just perfect for my skin, it gives me a glowy natural look.</li>
            <li>Even my Mom has noticed enough of a difference in my skin to jump out of her comfort zone and order some of her own in hopes of achieving similiar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is kind of a generic lotion fragrance...</li>
            <li>I love this bb cream so far.</li>
            <li>it is worth to buy.</li>
            <li>It did not whiten skin and does not look like a fresh look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as grey, either, so it wasn&#x27;t as surprising when I first used it.</li>
            <li>just love this product..leaves skin soft...</li>
            <li>Blends in wonderfully with my pale half-Asian skin, evening out my skin tone while looking incredibly natural.</li>
            <li>have a fair skin with not that many problems, i mean acne.</li>
            <li>Since it is my first BB Cream, I can&#x27;t say if its better than the rest or even better than some, but I&#x27;ve always had oily, yet dry skin on my face, not to mention..</li>
            <li>It goes on very nourishing and moisturizing at first, gives great coverage, and blends easily to match my pale skin.</li>
            <li>Great for normal skin types but would not recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li>On those rare occasions where I am a bit darker, I easily just add some color from another foundation and apply like normal.</li>
            <li>it helps, I ordered from pinkgelee, and their products are legitimate (they ship pretty quickly, too!).BB Creams, the Skin79 mini set of 4 for example, is worth it.</li>
            <li>i brought it its tooo strong for my sensitive skin cool</li>
            <li>I love the packaging, shipping was super fast took only 2 days to arrive (via free super saver).</li>
            <li>one\\&quot; but I haven&#x27;t been this pleased with any cosmetic product in a long time, and I really wanted to share my experience with the gals that are still \\&quot;considering\\&quot; to get it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I was most worried about was the fact that I didn&#x27;t know if it was going to look weird on me because I&#x27;m very fair, but it works fantastic!</li>
            <li>It might be worth it, but if you start to break out, stop using it right away....</li>
            <li>There is a very light fragrant smell, the pink version feels more light than the gold, gold will probably be better for the dry winter time.</li>
            <li>I started using the gold version, which I equally love, for when I want a more dewy natural look since it&#x27;s more moisturizing than the hot pink version.  </li>
            <li>I had watched and read many other reviews about this product, and just like everyone else,and I am highly satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Having super oily skin already, when I applied this product over my Cerave moisturizer, it was looking pretty shiny.</li>
            <li>I got lucky in that this was the first BB I ordered</li>
            <li>At first appearance it may appear to have a gray-ish cast, but that quickly dissipates after being blended into skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed that when I don&#x27;t, I seem to get shiny pretty quickly, but the primer stops that from happening.  </li>
            <li>Yes, that has gotten me into tons of trouble many times but will I learn!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light foundation if your a person who loves full coverage because of acne and or scars I don&#x27;t recommend using this product because it doesn&#x27;t hide any of those.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product if your wanting a natural look  or a foundation that&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li>The pink looks beautiful on my skin (I am fair skinned w/ blonde hair &amp; blue eyes)</li>
            <li>I found that by very lightly pressing it into my skin with my hands or a fine, dry makeup sponge it melted right into my skin.</li>
            <li>The 2 Skin79 BB Creams (Pink &amp; VIP) are great but the main difference to me seems to be coverage.</li>
            <li>It does look sort of gray and ashy when you first apply it, but it blends in perfectly within a few minutes and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It has cut my time getting ready in the morning significantly.</li>
            <li>First, and most importantly, my skin didn&#x27;t react by turning all red, blotchy, and flaky - hurray!</li>
            <li>The other one is good.</li>
            <li>Other BB creams don&#x27;t work as good.</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s a good chance that some of your makeup will transfer to your hands and other things.</li>
            <li>originally set out to buy the Smashbox BB cream after hearing so much hype on it.</li>
            <li>the color was lighter, the consistency of the cream was runnier than the original and it didn&#x27;t smell anything like the real bb cream.</li>
            <li>Although I have not used the product very much as of yet, I would just like to say that if you are considering purchasing this from this seller to be very assured that this is genuine.</li>
            <li>it creates healthy looking skin, covers the blemishes in a natural way, the seller is very thoughtful, I love the little card you sent me.</li>
            <li>Now I will only be using my air brush makeup on special occasions or mabey not at all. :)</li>
            <li>you will find a right products.</li>
            <li>right not</li>
            <li>it just has the right amount of dewyness and matte-ness.</li>
            <li>I guess this is just not the right brand for me.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a BB cream that pops out noticeably then this one isn&#x27;t the right one for you.</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>It went right in the trash for me</li>
            <li>As soon as you put it on, you feel as though your skin absorbs it right away</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s results over a period of time as I dived into a pool right after.</li>
            <li>right now(I&#x27;m a nc25).</li>
            <li>I received my BB cream right before I was headed out for vacation.</li>
            <li>Just the right size to put on your purse.</li>
            <li>just the right amount.</li>
            <li>It looks gray when I squeeze it out of the container, but when I put it on, it blends right in and takes away the blotchy redness, and masks my pores.  </li>
            <li>My family gave me compliments right away and could not tell I had any \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; on.</li>
            <li>I wish I had done that before buying this since I feel like this was not the right product for</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just not quite right for</li>
            <li>If you have olive or tan skin, or plan to use tanning beds/go out in the sun/spray tan, this is not the right thing for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had issues with trying to find the right color foundation for my skin PLUS something that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>cream had the right holographic letters, the manufacturing date on the bottom, and the sticker of authenticity.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away when I started using it.</li>
            <li>I apply, I leave time for it to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; on my face so that it doesn&#x27;t rub off right away when I put blush on.  </li>
            <li>, right?)</li>
            <li>Plus, the price is just right.</li>
            <li>I just apply all over with a brush and it blends right into my skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine how the smell would be if it was right on my face.</li>
            <li>(I mix mine with Lancôme 24hr foundation to get the right</li>
            <li>It just blends right in and does its thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main issue I have with it is that I started reading the ingredients list when I got it, and by being so excited I saw so many natural extracts, I just went ahead and tried it.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to buy this product after I&#x27;ve read all the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>Definitely an important factor since UV rays can be so damaging for the skin and is the main cause of skin</li>
            <li>i think can be better with more color options maybe ligth,medium and dark skin color .</li>
            <li>My skin has finally cleared up and while I don&#x27;t need a full coverage foundation anymore, I need a lot more than a tinted moisturizer can provide to help cover the freckles and some scarring.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty fair with pink undertones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color match is perfect, and is starting to remove dark patches.</li>
            <li>It really is a cosmetic and needs to be applied to clean skin in the morning and removed at night.</li>
            <li>It really is a cosmetic and needs to be applied to clean skin in the morning and removed at night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unlike regular bb creams you find in the drugstores because it has more of a medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li>I have a medium/dark skin tone since im Peruvian and when I first put on this product I was kind of scared since it made me look really white and ashy.</li>
            <li>I am now the owner of a large drawer full of foundations, tinted moisturizers, and a couple of BB creams that didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.</li>
            <li>do like how it evens out my skin tone in a very natural way, however, and its creaminess makes it really easy to apply and spread.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first BB cream, but I have been very pleased with it and am planning to order more of the same and from the same seller.</li>
            <li>The cream blends amazingly and have just the right amount of coverage to buff away any minor imperfections like pimple scars and blemishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
            <li>I recieved two samples with it as well that also went on great and actually matched my skin a little better.</li>
            <li>This BB cream can be intimidating to some people, but this particular one is great for anyone, especially for new BB cream users.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product with great results over the past 3 days.</li>
            <li>Between the two products, my freckles and flaws disappeared with an airbrushed appearance and between the 25 SPF of the BB and the 15 SPF of Bare Minerals, I should be OK for the upcoming summer sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this product and would buy it again especially with this affordable price in comparison to many other brands.</li>
            <li>I have tried several American BB creams and this is by far the best I have used</li>
            <li>Also, I read that the Beyond the Solution has a more natural coloring since there&#x27;s no SPF (no white ashiness like most BB cream</li>
            <li>Worth a try ;)&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with Skin79 BB cream (pink label).</li>
            <li>Did not work for me, my skin is normally controlled acne free till I use this product.</li>
            <li>Barely any scent at all either, which I love.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is that it barely (if at all) looks like you are wearing anything.</li>
            <li>So if you need more than just a general evening of your skin tone, I would recommend using the Gold Label as I felt like it was heavier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned (but with olive tone) with auburn hair, dark brown eyes and brows.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s nice and matte, seems to control my oil even after a long day at work</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad although i paid a higher price for my authentic bottle.</li>
            <li>It looks a little yellow or grayish right out of the bottle, but once I rub it in it blends in perfectly with my alabaster skin tone.</li>
            <li>The first day using it was fine, actually good coverage, but starting from the second day breakout came!</li>
            <li>I love this product so much this is the second time I have purchase it , it makes my skin look so clean and look fresh.</li>
            <li>It is designed for Asian skin, and in most eastern cultures having fair, untanned skin is highly desirable, unlike western cultures where everyone spray tans to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend you buy a few different ones to try on and compare in order to find the right one that works best for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, I almost laughed!</li>
            <li>This one I use in the summer when my skin is more oilier and use the Gold VIP in the winter when I need a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I read another reviewer said that it made the skin texture show more, like little bumps appear more instead of disappearing</li>
            <li>You can layer on more if  you need more coverage but a little pump of it is plenty for me</li>
            <li>My friend has this brand and told me to try it because I wanted one to give me a little better coverage and to feel better on my face.</li>
            <li>If your kind of close to this colour, but it&#x27;s still a little too light (like me)</li>
            <li>Upon informing the seller, Think Pretty, of the problem, they offered to replace the product and did so right away.</li>
            <li>Super fast.</li>
            <li>sure i will be using this almost everyday but with better moisturizer</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and no fakes.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not a fan of the matte look and this made my skin look dry and kind of flaky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The creamy formula effectively covers up skin imperfections, creating a perfect base for makeup and foundation.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it looks kind of grey</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and have had acne all of my teenage and adult life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gray when it pumps out, but it oxidizes to a more natural color.</li>
            <li>Of that 1-inch container, the only makeup that could fit would be what could fit around the inserted pump.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR THE QUICK SHIP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Defenatly recomended for people for light skin( since they only have light skin shades)</li>
            <li>I am pretty lazy about applying SPF, so it&#x27;s great that I get some protection with the BB</li>
            <li>I have a feeling I will be using the entire bottle, which rarely happens with most make up products.</li>
            <li>a side note, I have fair, slightly acne-prone skin).</li>
            <li>I am darker in the summer since I tan easily and this blended into my naturally oily skintone  </li>
            <li>It was delivered super fast and there were some samples.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural looking, good coverage, and actually I have had NO breakouts at ALL since switching to the Skin 79 BB&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>this actually feels good to wear and makes skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I work outdoors, and I like simplicity, so I was looking for a single face product that has good spf, decent coverage, and would not wear off from sweat or rain.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen severely burns my face, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to the majority of foundations that are available.</li>
            <li>daily moisturizer/spf. BB cream is a great way for me to neutralize my skin tone without going the full blown make up route especially as I get older.</li>
            <li>I top it off with some matting loose powder and my skin looks very natural and healthy.</li>
            <li>this has stopped that and made my skin smooth and almost completely clear!  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too great but its okay, usually i set this with pressed powder and lasts till the next day.</li>
            <li>the whole \\&quot;it makes you look more professional and naturally pretty instead of</li>
            <li>the whole \\&quot;it makes you look more professional and naturally pretty instead of</li>
            <li>but i was not going to deal with shipping it back and not be sure of getting a refund since they couldn&#x27;t even send me the right</li>
            <li>The shipping was also super fast and arrived exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>It is a little grey so is not as great as could be, but it does make skin feel soft and is ok for a light coverage.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It actually feels very light and breathable.</li>
            <li>Also you do not need to use very much of it for it to cover all of your face.</li>
            <li>I had been using Boots no 7 creams which I like very much but saw an ad for the Loreal BB cream and thought to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;Although I like the effect of the Loreal</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very light and at the same time it covers my blemish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only reason it gets 2 stars is because I like the way it feels on my skin, very light and also shipping</li>
            <li>It blends with my skin perfectly and helps protect it and take away some of my super dark dark circles.</li>
            <li>Overall great cream, texture and coverage, just slightly too light, but</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old of Scandinavian ancestry and found that the tone was just fine.</li>
            <li>how can they, and so many other sellers, sell this product at a price so cheap?  </li>
            <li>must give this product a good review based on not only the feel of the product, the packaging, but also the care of the vendor in their quick shipment and extra bonus of samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this stuff is easy and good, and it&#x27;s not that much for how long the bottle will last you!</li>
            <li>so pink!&lt;br /&gt;the bb cream&#x27;s color is a little bit dull,but after i use it, it looks really good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to buy this Skin 79 BB Cream because I didn&#x27;t know how it would match up with my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping thanks!!~</li>
            <li>It goes on a little grey, but once you rub it in and let it sit, it matches light/fair toned skin perfectly!</li>
            <li>I will also mention that is of far better quality than drugstore brands, but does not have the high department store</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money on designer brands, just trying to find &#x27;the one&#x27; that works for me... and this stuff simply is just great and very affordable!!</li>
            <li>The little pink packaging so cute and its great to bring on travel.</li>
            <li>but I decided to try it alone with more of a patting motion and it gave me a really good coverage I added just a little concealer to my red areas and some powder</li>
            <li>B/c of popularity of Missha, I used it first.  </li>
            <li>The first day I wore it, I went to spinning class -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried samples of American BB creams from Sephora, and this one is better than all of them.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>And take note, an application in the morning would last the whole day! :-)</li>
            <li>This BB cream was the first one I ever bought.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>After hearing the beauty gurus rave about BB creams and learning more about how big of a hit they are in Korea, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>My skin has NEVER been this clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a spectrum of higher priced (as well as lower end) foundations, tinted moisturizer, and bb creams</li>
            <li>This is the first BB cream that I have ever used</li>
            <li>This was my first BB cream and</li>
            <li>fast~!</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and this has NOT broken me out!</li>
            <li>This really for people that from a lighter or whiter skintone and its foundation which I also misread!</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li>This seems to be the most universal.</li>
            <li>There were no harm done to the box or my product, and it was NOT a fake.</li>
            <li>First of all, it would not adjust my skin tone.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried that the one shade that it comes in would not work for my tone.</li>
            <li>I first put the product on my face</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a BB cream</li>
            <li>When I first went to use it in mid-February, and I saw the color of the cream, I did not think there would be any way it would blend with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>finish is at first sticky but once it sets it sets.</li>
            <li>pretty even skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dunno how it&#x27;d work for darker tones which is sad because bb cream is excellent besides this one thing.</li>
            <li>application  -The container is pretty.</li>
            <li>It whitens pretty well</li>
            <li>Most effects are only temporary, it&#x27;s almost like a tinted moisturizer  </li>
            <li>First off I have oily skin</li>
            <li>Most likely not going to buy again.</li>
            <li>It really helped to even out my skin tone and cover all of the redness!</li>
            <li>This BB cream was definitely better than 2 others I have tried by different companies.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff, I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I TRIED MANY DIFFERENT BRAND OF BB CREAMS.</li>
            <li>So, first I&#x27;m going to say that I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s caucasian with combination skin.  </li>
            <li>ordered this product about a month ago and have waited to write my review because I wanted to make sure the results were going to last and give the product time to work.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first BB cream I have tried</li>
            <li>I decided to give an Asian brand a try to see if it would match my skin tone better.</li>
            <li>When I first heard about BB cream I knew I had to try it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you after first use,</li>
            <li>I think skin79 hot pink stands on its own.</li>
            <li>but after a few minutes it looks really natural and beautiful</li>
            <li>FIRST, Review of the PRODUCT--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>she sells the Authentic product and this is simply a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is your skin, only better.  </li>
            <li>I was scared at first cause</li>
            <li>I first bought this on a whim almost three years ago and I still use this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more as soon as my first supply runs out.</li>
            <li>used on top of my mosturizer or sunscreen if i feel i need extra protection!!!</li>
            <li>only muchmuch better.  </li>
            <li>I am asian so this matched my skin color better than Revlon Colorstay which I used before this.</li>
            <li>To be sure I went to the Skin79 website where they only provide you with one sure way of verifying authenticity which is to check the silver sticker on the back of your bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Little bit about me: Never used bb creams before, this is my first time ordering.</li>
            <li>I received a reply promptly the next day, guaranteeing that their products are 100% guaranteed authentic.</li>
            <li>On the bottle itself there was also a sticker of authenticity, the gold version wasn&#x27;t as nicely placed as the pink bottle..</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t exactly holding my breath for a miracle or anything the first time I put it on, but within 3 minutes of massaging this in, I literally looked at myself in the mirror and said \\&quot;woah\\&quot; and had to do an inspection.</li>
            <li>Sadly, not for darker skin</li>
            <li>I can tell it really moisturizes my skin as well!</li>
            <li>Overall, am pleased with product, purchase, and delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying BB cream</li>
            <li>I do not have any allergies that I am aware of, but something in this cream did not agree with my skin.</li>
            <li>I did the research on BB cream, and decided to go with this one for my first try.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely keep buying this product!</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I have used this brand of makeup, but I knew something was off from the moment I first put it on.</li>
            <li>Let me first start by saying my skin color is tan and the bb cream doesn&#x27;t match my color</li>
            <li>The only logical conclusion is that it&#x27;s Korean magic.  </li>
            <li>So this is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li>It also seemed to come off throughout the day and made my skin look oily unlike the first bottle.</li>
            <li>This one seems just like the first bottle I had and</li>
            <li>This is the exact product I needed.</li>
            <li>Today is my first day wearing it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so I went to their website and was able to confirm that is the same as the bottle I got.</li>
            <li>After using it for only 1 week, my skin is softer and more even toned.</li>
            <li>One metered squirt is more than I need for my entire face</li>
            <li>My wife asked me to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;She told me that  it is done for her exactly what is written in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>The BB cream works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have so many regular foundations and theres&#x27;no need to use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which this is most definitely not.</li>
            <li>It gives ok coverage but at only about the level of a tinted moisturizer so you can still see some pores and bumps on your skin.</li>
            <li>though with just one layer it doesn&#x27;t fully disguise my acne, it came pretty</li>
            <li>I wish I would have looked at the ingredients first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is the first time I tried out BB cream .</li>
            <li>The higher SPF is also a plus.</li>
            <li>I have tried several BB creams and this is one of my favorite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am pretty unsure about it.</li>
            <li>At first after reading all the reviews on this website and a few others, I thought this would be good for me.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a prompt refund through amazon for the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bottle is also really pretty.</li>
            <li>The color looks like it won&#x27;t match at first, but when its blended in your skin</li>
            <li>but I was wrong because this stuff covers amazingly!!!!!</li>
            <li>my current supply runs out, I&#x27;m going to try another cream within the skin79 line that is supposed to be more suited towards my skin type.  </li>
            <li>It covers pretty well for a BB cream.  </li>
            <li>So much better than american brand stuff.  </li>
            <li>pretty well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first BB cream, and I adored it from the get-go.</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone, and makes my combo skin feel soft, smooth, and non greasy.</li>
            <li>, my freckles still peek through :), but the tiny capillaries and imperfections just seem to fade.</li>
            <li>It is SO lightweight that I can see myself wearing this cream to the beach or on a hot day out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the color at first.  </li>
            <li>It goes onto my skin like butter and stays on the whole day!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looked exactly like the one I purchased before.</li>
            <li>It had all the authentic symbols (box with the proferated edges, Red dot on box).&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face color is different with my neck color at first, but it will be better soon.</li>
            <li>it has light coverage and its not heavy</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product and buy it again :)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It feels like I have nothing on my face, which is exactly the feel</li>
            <li>So when I first heard about BB Creams, they sounded exactly like what I needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably break it open to make sure I can use the rest of it.</li>
            <li>I have gotten several comments from different people about how great my skin looks and that is all I really want.</li>
            <li>I love BB cream, but only skin79 brand.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>She told me everyone in South Korea loves bb cream (authentic Korean, not American, bb cream) and swears by it.</li>
            <li>I tried it out for the next weekand fell in love.</li>
            <li>my make up breathes better and isn&#x27;t completely obvious that I&#x27;m wearing it on my face (you know,</li>
            <li>lot of people mention a greyish tone when it first goes on, but I don&#x27;t find this with mine.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>my make up breathes better and isn&#x27;t completely obvious that I&#x27;m wearing it on my face (you know,</li>
            <li>lot of people mention a greyish tone when it first goes on, but I don&#x27;t find this with mine.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll hopefully have a link up to my website with further information and before/after pictures for you to look at. :)</li>
            <li>Love it and def coming back for it!</li>
            <li>The first two are Lioele&#x27;s Triple the Solution and Beyond the Solution...</li>
            <li>Coverage is similar to that of a tinted moisturizer, but with slightly more coverage.  </li>
            <li>Also, while the package is pretty and the pump is convenient (when it works) it is too bulky.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>This is the first BB cream I have tried and it does what it says.</li>
            <li>I have used it for exactly two months now</li>
            <li>When you first put it on</li>
            <li>But if I were to find another BB cream with a better skintone match but similar finish, which I can, since there are dozens, I will liekly not buy this again.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and even and looks &amp; feels so natural.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much seoulglamour!</li>
            <li>This was my first BB cream, it glides on like sunscreen/lotion.</li>
            <li>but I am willing to give it another</li>
            <li>I have some left over redness and scarring from acne and with this product my skin tone looks more even.  </li>
            <li>I was very nervous to purchase this from Amazon but decided it was worth the gamble.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I&#x27;m going to use every last drop of this stuff :)</li>
            <li>first day I tried this product my husband was in the room</li>
            <li>It does match pretty close.</li>
            <li>This is the first BB cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>started noticing that I do not get sun spots anymore and feel my face is more protected overall.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the coloration of my face, when I don&#x27;t use it, my face seems more blotchy and red in places than it did before using the product.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, a product worked in fighting this.</li>
            <li>The BB cream was kinda greasy at first</li>
            <li>I must say, after days of researching different BB creams and watching every video review on the planet, I am pleased that I picked this one.</li>
            <li>I tried this cream on a section of my face first</li>
            <li>At first it has a gray tint to it, but if you let it sit for 5 minutes it will adjust to your skin tone.</li>
            <li>If it looks a bit greyish when you first apply, don&#x27;t worry - it will change color to match your skin in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>I also use coconut oil underneath it and at first my face is shiny, but within 30 minutes or so, the coconut oil soaks in and the makeup turns matte on me.  </li>
            <li>It stays put without powder, and yet is still pliable enough that I could blend more in, if I accidentally wiped some off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bb cream was exactly what i expected...light weight and medium coverage.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and feels light on my skin.</li>
            <li>Let me start by say this is the first time I ever used a bb cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first time that i&#x27;ve ever purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I used BB cream from Clinique because I love their facial products.</li>
            <li>even, it also seems to help smooth and even out your natural skin during the day while you wear it.  </li>
            <li>also love that I do not have to use a gross amount of the product in application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li>also thought it was creamy, soft and light.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t melt away in the southern humidity.</li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone pretty well, although whitens my face.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I bought from Tokyo Japanese outlet.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I used it avidly for a month</li>
            <li>this so much!</li>
            <li>After hearing about how much better Korean BB Creams were than Western ones, I decided I needed a Skin79 BB.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I am head over heels in love with this BB Cream and will absolutely be back here to repurchase when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very white though, and I think that it would have been a better match if it were just a bit lighter.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t match every one all the time ;)</li>
            <li>Saw some reviews and had much higher hopes for this.  </li>
            <li>Thought maybe the ones more expensive has better ratings and better works.</li>
            <li>Though I wasn&#x27;t looking for a liquid foundation type of moisturizer it actually feels more like a moisturizer/base than a foundation.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not really a big deal since most people use powders over their foundations anyways.</li>
            <li>I still love it and will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li>If your coloring isn&#x27;t in line with asian skin, it will be more noticeable though.</li>
            <li>First let me tell you the type of skin</li>
            <li>I had my last bottle for two months or more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>The Pink Bebesh creams gives you more sheer coverage if you want the more natural look while The VIP seems to be thicker coverage, perhaps more foundation in the components?</li>
            <li>I love this BB Cream, and I can never go back to just using foundation!</li>
            <li>Coverage is good, not cakey, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>it has a VOID sticker that the skin79 site said to avoid but I did more research into it and turns out the VOID sticker is on the real skin79 and also based on the seller&#x27;s money back guarantee, I&#x27;ll take their word that it&#x27;s a true beauty ;] I&#x27;ve tried Missha Signature Real</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a foundation that was not too heavy and would look good all day on combination oily/dry skin.</li>
            <li>CA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a base with Baremineral, the combination gives a flawless natural look on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>It is also slightly thicker and has a bit better coverage, so if you&#x27;re on the fence between pink and gold, and are looking for something a bit more heavy-duty, maybe this is better for you than the gold.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest it to anyone with acne prone skin because it has even helped me tremendously in that aspect.</li>
            <li>(The super high SPF means I also don&#x27;t need to worry about a sun screen).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely fair skin, and have super sensitive skin and this product was not too dark nor did it cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair redhead with pale skin &amp; pinkish undertones</li>
            <li>when I know I&#x27;m going to have my picture taken since SPF reflects light particles, making your face super white and glowy in photographs.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super oily with big pores in the t-zone and this is fantastic in covering those imperfections and in keeping the shine at bay.</li>
            <li>triple function blemish balm cream, Skin79&#x27;s Super Plus BB Cream (Pink Label) shields skin from premature aging with potent SPF 25, while whitening skin and reducing existing lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is clear, never dries out, and has a very natural, healthy look with this BB cream on.</li>
            <li>and I wish I could give away my almost new and full bottle of Skin 79 as I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li>Like most other BB creams, brightens my skin very nicely although it does darken a little over time (oxidizes).</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a pump bottle, less than $20, really fast and easy to apply without the need of a brush, and has SPF in it.</li>
            <li>It comes with SPF 25 and the shade is more true to your skin color unlike other bb creams that look greyish.</li>
            <li>This BB not only gives you great coverage but makes your skin almost glow, it helps to keep my oily face nice and dry and my other makeup just falls into place and stays there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mineral powder foundation for many years but at age 60 wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t settle in my fine lines and creases after a few hours.</li>
            <li>for the cream, it&#x27;s pretty decent stuff, but the ordeal to get to it has not been much fun.</li>
            <li>My blush, bronzer, everything stays on which is amazing because I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li>The design of the bottle is very cute too and convenient because it prevents from mess.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and got a little too excited to find such a cheap, nice cream.</li>
            <li>The container has a pump and it looks nice, unlike other products in tubes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need any of the concealer I normally use!!</li>
            <li>I did not have much faith this this product would help... and while it does not prevent 100% of my break-outs, it definitely has made a HUGE difference!  </li>
            <li>Natural, slightly dewy look that I really like - great for a no-makeup look</li>
            <li>Purchased this since it gets such amazing reviews, it was cheap, and I&#x27;d been wanting to dry out these oh-so-amazing BB Creams from Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty quick, only a few days, and it was packaged in a pretty generic shipping bag INSIDE a box, which was slightly impressive, I must say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the gold-label BB Cream, but found that the pink-label (this one) left me less shiny and was better for my oily</li>
            <li>Love the cream because it&#x27;s soft and looks natural on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this company decided that &amp;#34;olive&amp;#34; was a pretty good default skin tone</li>
            <li>So I read good reviews about this bb cream, but the only problem I was coming across was people saying it won&#x27;t work on a non white skin tone.</li>
            <li>At the time I was looking, it was more than double the price, now it&#x27;s very inexpensive</li>
            <li>My expectation was higher then usual having seen really good reviews on Amazon for this product.</li>
            <li>I love how well this BB Cream covers my uneven skin tone and leaves my oily skin shine free all day.</li>
            <li>when i bought this item i thought i might have been a good match because i&#x27;m asian and the product was made in asian (</li>
            <li>I have a good amount of hyperpigmentation that is pink from old acne that I had</li>
            <li>Skin79 Super Beblesh Balm BB Cream Triple Funtion (Pink Label) with SPS 25 is good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m in Canada, it was good enough shipping time though I wish sellers would remove or lower the shipping fee for international transactions.</li>
            <li>Definitely for fair skin only.</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase this product again, do not have to use much at all!</li>
            <li>I also have a mild case of rosacea and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this BB was not as moisturizing as some of my previous ones, but was still really good, highly protective and lasted longer then</li>
            <li>Other than that, this bb cream along with a little bit of concealer makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>I mean that in the best possible way ever</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right coverage without feeling too heavy &amp; makes my skin look nice when I don&#x27;t want to wear tons of makeup.</li>
            <li>Also, the vendor (Pink Gelee) was very nice; product came earlier than estimated and they included a couple of samples.</li>
            <li>I may purchase the Gold one as well, if the Pink Label isn&#x27;t suitable for Winter.</li>
            <li>I have used quite a few different brands over the years and this is the BEST so far.</li>
            <li>I first tried with a real techniques expert face brush</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product I was very iffy.  </li>
            <li>But whatever the case, it did exactly what it advertises -- evened out my skin tone and brightened my complexion while still looking really</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful, came two weeks earlier than I expected and was relieved that it worked out that way because I actually moved to campus</li>
            <li>The product came very promptly, first day of the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>the coverage is light to barely non-existent (fades within an hour or so)if anything I feel like it doesn&#x27;t even cover, it just leaves an white/grey cast on the face.</li>
            <li>This is my first BB Cream and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Goes on really grey-ish at first.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for this product!  </li>
            <li>Thanks much!</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too long for you, just know that I LOVE it</li>
            <li>On first application I could tell it wouldn&#x27;t provide as much coverage as the Lioele ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals Light.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this, I noticed that the coverage was medium/light depending on how you apply and how much you apply.</li>
            <li>First of all, the package came in really on time, and it was packed securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all this product came really</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t creamy like the bottles I received in the past, and the makeup didn&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li>Just note that BB creams are good for making skin tone even or hiding pores and small blemishes</li>
            <li>It has lots of nice benefits that drugstore bb creams don&#x27;t have like whitening agents that fade dark spots.</li>
            <li>When I rinse it off with warm water at night, I notice my skin is moisturized and dark spots have lightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even used on my full coverage powder just to get some natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really worked well with my fair complexion, and overall my appearance is brighter, more youthful, more moisturized and less irritated with less breakouts.</li>
            <li>The smell is barely noticeable, it&#x27;s a very light flowery fragrance that completely goes away after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>to mention that these above BB creams lasts all day and stays pretty matte on my super oily skin!  </li>
            <li>quick spreading with my fingers and with Sun Protection Factor, I feel I&#x27;m accomplishing more with less.  </li>
            <li>This evens my skin tone out perfectly, although I do need to use a little concealer under my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it really whitened my skin, but it was always super nice to apply and to wear every day.</li>
            <li>I had tried a previous BB cream by Boscia and really like this one a lot better!</li>
            <li>After applying it with a foundation brush, I use a very small amount of my bareminerals in golden medium, just to get it to a shade that matches my skintone better; because just the bb cream is too light for me.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s any drier than about normal, this isn&#x27;t the right BB cream for you</li>
            <li>I am a huge beauty product junkie and this is definitely not the first time I&#x27;ve used BB cream.</li>
            <li>The text printed in the front and back easily gets scratched off.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a cute pretty pink.</li>
            <li>And much sooner when I&#x27;m bare faced)&lt;br /&gt;- light feel, but</li>
            <li>so I started using Skin79 hot pink BB cream, which I fell in love with.  </li>
            <li>The finish is satin and only within an hour my t-zone is more oilier than normal.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting a full-coverage \\&quot;foundation\\&quot;, but the idea of seeing smaller pores and (apparently) scars healing made me jump at the purchase.  </li>
            <li>, it doesnot dry out my skin and gives more coverage.</li>
            <li>so I lightly depress the top button.</li>
            <li>As I am getting older, my skin feels drier and I do not like mineral powder as much anymore because it seems to make my pores more obvious.</li>
            <li>I have extraordinarily oily, blemish-prone, sensitive skin, and this BB cream does not break me out one bit.  </li>
            <li>you tend to have dry skin, i recommend the gold label. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I have to say that my skin is BETTER than it ever has been before after using Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink bb cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I have to say that my skin is BETTER than it ever has been before after using Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink bb cream.</li>
            <li>I would say for oily skin this might be and OK product, but for dry or combination skin, forget it.</li>
            <li>And I like the softer look on my aging skin better than the dry look I got from mineral</li>
            <li>It makes your skin super soft and just melts in with your skin.</li>
            <li>It has good coverage, pretty thick.</li>
            <li>I like it and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong personally</li>
            <li>After one week of using it I saw four large bumps on my jawline.</li>
            <li>, I certainly did not notice any oxidation to match my skin color.</li>
            <li>: don&#x27;t just pump a large amount into your hand and rub your face.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a certain technique to putting it on that you can read about online</li>

            <li>There&#x27;s a certain technique to putting it on that you can read about online</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that this product will match my skin in the winter as well.</li>
            <li>Just for comparison for those who are curious about this product reacting with their own skin-types, I&#x27;m mixed race (basically everything except Asian) with a medium skin tone that tans very easily.</li>
            <li>[...] and took a good look at all the different BB creams out there and decided to try the hot pink one.    </li>
            <li>I even tried many of the new American bb creams but it was like</li>
            <li>I have pretty light skin, but its pretty much an all over pinkish tone with more red in certain areas due to acne and scarring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got the yellow undertones (NC20/25) light/medium skin that gets oily on the t-zone but is fairly normal/sometimes dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li>When I buy a new product, I test it--at a mirror, in the daylight--and then I see how good it looks several hours later without retouching.  </li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge changes in my skins natural appearance, but when it&#x27;s on your skin you look luminous!</li>
            <li>One day I pump it and it&#x27;s fine, the next day it&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li>those other reviews about the BB creams being too light or gray are true.  </li>
            <li>When it finally arrived I was pretty excited to try it.</li>
            <li>My skin, fine wrinkles, breakouts, acne scars and all, basically looked similar to how it does without any makeup.</li>
            <li>I smoked for 12 years before quitting 2 years ago and have tiny fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>both my daughters who have opposite skin tones can wear it just fine.</li>
            <li>Overall, it hydrates fine</li>
            <li>This product is obviously no regulated and that is fine, but know what you&#x27;re putting on your body people.</li>
            <li>The product definitely is gray, but once it is blended into your skin, it&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
            <li>The bottle size is pretty decent</li>
            <li>generally pale (mostly Anglo-Irish descent, with a small amount of Native American thrown in), and was worried when I read reviews that said it was grayish, but this product suits me perfectly!</li>
            <li>I should note though that I did not set this with a powder, as I have very dry skin and wasn&#x27;t sure if you were supposed to do that anyway!&lt;br</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s amazing too, you should check it out) and just apply a little bit around my under eye circles and around my mouth and jawline.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s amazing too, you should check it out) and just apply a little bit around my under eye circles and around my mouth and jawline.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s lasted me almost a year and still going strong, full, weightless coverage, and you use less of it.</li>
            <li>It IS good, but I realized after using it for about a month and on a whim going back to my old foundation one morning that... my old foundation is better, for less money.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash it off before bed to reduce any breakouts, I haven&#x27;t had a single one since using it!</li>
            <li>SPF protecting is pretty high</li>
            <li>far, SKIN79 Super+ appeared way too light when first applying it to my face; however, it blended into my skin well and looks more natural on my face than my usual foundation.  </li>
            <li>, now my skin regime in the morning is,  a makeup sponge to apply BB cream, its none greasy and stays on all day!Which proves  an old dog can learn new tricks!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The BB Cream I purchased had the perforated box, tamper-evident sticker, large pink circle on top of box and 4 diff languages inside, manufacture and expiration dates and just about everything I&#x27;ve read the real package and box should have.</li>
            <li>Coverage is great, it goes on a little grey at first, but then it blends to your skin.</li>
            <li>It is moderate sized and a bright pink.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t cause any extra acne and that is a huge plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went through this brand of BB cream fast.</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair/light and acne prone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This doesn&#x27;t really influence my purchasing decision, but I really like the package.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was acne, but the spots are coming in places where I don&#x27;t normally breakout.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for this product even after all the rave reviews via youtube.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really cover up scars or some redness....</li>
            <li>Everything was in a fast orderly manner meaning the purchasing process to the shipping.  </li>
            <li>Turns out the product I received was the real deal.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>( I treasure sleep), but this fabulous product makes it so simple.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>This covers all my blemishes, hides my freckles, and wears very well.</li>
            <li>I love this Pink Skin79 BB cream.</li>
            <li>The finished look is very natural/airbrush finish and it doesn&#x27;t make your face oily</li>
            <li>I have acne scars too and very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product as it keeps my oil at bay.</li>
            <li>moQ7K7XI35291Q]]I really wanted to do a video review</li>
            <li>This cream is really just all the stuff you used to use put together.</li>
            <li>They both work very well.</li>
            <li>They match my NC25 Asain skin color very well.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and the shipping is so fast</li>
            <li>Shipping fast , And I received samples .</li>
            <li>I really, really like it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to shield it very well though.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Absolutely not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has gotten much clearer and a lot of the redness on my face disappeared.</li>
            <li>When I heard about BB cream I really wanted to try it out because of all its benefits</li>
            <li>-I didn&#x27;t get much coverage.</li>
            <li>This is probably because of this BB cream because my face doesn&#x27;t oil up that much when I don&#x27;t put anything on my face.  </li>
            <li>but I really did not need to.</li>
            <li>The product is genuine and I will be ordering a second tube for my mom.</li>
            <li>In fact, I wanted to order two units, but the shipping cost  doubled, which didn&#x27;t make much sense me.</li>
            <li>AND MY FACE WILL TURN VERY OILY THEN</li>
            <li>At this price, really, everyone should try it.</li>
            <li>One whole pump covers my neck and throat area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely lightweight.</li>
            <li>This is also been really great on my acne prone skin - I haven&#x27;t broken out once since I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>It looked like the real thing.</li>
            <li>It feels like a face mask when you put it on, and it really adjusts well to your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>but after it settles, your face is ready for all day photo shoot.</li>
            <li>Keep your prices reasonable and your honesty so even if there will be cheaper stuff, you&#x27;ll have our loyalty.</li>
            <li>After researching BB creams, I really wanted to try one that was affordable.</li>
            <li>I had been researching for a while about the whole \\&quot;BB cream\\&quot; phenomena, and decided to take a chance and check it out for myself.</li>
            <li>and I really like the effect it gives me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not that much</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but I really wanted to share the whole experience</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>When I rubbed it on my skin, it had a very watery feel and had virtually no coverage effect.  </li>
            <li>This is more matte than I expected, so I might try experimenting with using a moisturizer before I apply in the morning.  </li>
            <li>What this means is the BB cream feels light and doesn&#x27;t turn out cakey later on.</li>
            <li>It was something I really wanted to try</li>
            <li>It looks really natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I have really oily skin.</li>
            <li>I will report again as the only concern I have is that the packaging of the bottle, which looks quite nice, is deceiving about actually how much product you are getting.</li>
            <li>I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to ask bluntly if they were real or not, and then I&#x27;d check it when the package came in.</li>
            <li>overview on the authenticity: So it came in the mail today and I readily checked all thebookmarked links of how to tell if it&#x27;s real or not.</li>
            <li>So I think I&#x27;m going to skip that test, haha</li>
            <li>It came out finely mixed, in one unison color and was lightly fragrant.</li>
            <li>really well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>what I&#x27;ve read, this pink version is better for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li>But since im so into it and really wanted it, i tried it on my skin.</li>
            <li>It covers really well</li>
            <li>the box and the container look real</li>
            <li>Hides my acne scars and redness very well.</li>
            <li>really appreciate all the reviews, which helped me make the decision to try</li>
            <li>It sets really well on the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or like there&#x27;s a film on my face.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I am allergic/sensitive to so much and foundation sometimes makes my face burn.  </li>
            <li>This product is the real deal by the way.</li>
            <li>This product really blends well on my skin.</li>
            <li>My face looks fresh and natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely too light for my skin complexion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve researched BB creams for along time, and i&#x27;ve bought real ones..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but this one has a triple functions which i really like..</li>
            <li>This one seems like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Non greasy, and I really like using this product.</li>
            <li>It controls oil really well</li>
            <li>Looks like me but airbrushed, and it really does keep the shine away for much longer.</li>
            <li>I was really wanting a bb cream to even out my skin tone</li>
            <li>The only difference was that it says wrinkle improvement, while the one in the picture on Amazon said wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard PinkGelee, Seoulglamour, &amp;neverprice all sell real product, I got mine from Emmas.</li>
            <li>, I have to say I really like it.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>My skin really does not like silicones, and this BB Cream started to irritate my skin after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>and I really just want nothing to do with hydroquinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>It matched my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in my troublesome skin years, so it covers up acne scars very well and</li>
            <li>The concealer I used prior to using this BB cream even made my face burn from the light spf 15</li>
            <li>It was supposed to tighten the skin to eliminate wrinkles, smooth the appearance of the skin over all, and whiten the skin (which made me think of bleach initially</li>
            <li>It will make you break out if you don&#x27;t, so don&#x27;t go straight to bed even if you&#x27;re just rolling in at 1 a.m</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all to create the desired effect, and too much will make it seem like it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
            <li>It will make you break out if you don&#x27;t, so don&#x27;t go straight to bed even if you&#x27;re just rolling in at 1 a.m</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all to create the desired effect, and too much will make it seem like it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this product.</li>
            <li>Covers redness very well&lt;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very oily skin, but I do breakout</li>
            <li>I really like the SPF 25 as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really helps get rid of sun spots</li>
            <li>Should have returned it, but it was cheap enough for me to write it off as a loss.</li>
            <li>Got the Pink because it&#x27;s my favorite color.</li>
            <li>For oilier skin, an oil absorbing primer is helpful, or you will need to powder a bit as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>it covers really well and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>it is very hydrating and makes my skin look dewy, which i like.  </li>
            <li>I believe the company is located in California and I received my package fairly fast.  </li>
            <li>I broke out and it made my face really oily.</li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li>It really feels like I am not wearing any makeup at all.</li>
            <li>Why would I want to use that much if another BB cream can do what I need in just one layer?</li>
            <li>nor my skin need too much coverage.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much just to try something</li>
            <li>It doesnt cover much and it doesnt make my skin smoother as promised.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and acne prone.  </li>
            <li>Skin 79 offers different formulas that are designed for different skin types; you can check their website for more detailed information.</li>
            <li>I just really didn&#x27;t want to be among them.</li>
            <li>So, after much reviews, I decided to try this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I only used this light water get based one.</li>
            <li>I have to put press powder very this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it is much softer ...</li>
            <li>I guess i was justing expecting too much from this item.</li>
            <li>others have said before, you really should \\&quot;pat\\&quot; this product on rather than rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>Having used U.S. BB creams that are really just tinted moisturizers, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I like the pink label a lot more than the diamond one.</li>
            <li>and this didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of primers, nothing really worked as well as I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the frugal in me hates throwing it away without checking to make sure its empty.</li>
            <li>in all, I really like using a *real* BB Cream.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still really lightweight.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to even out my tone and cover blemishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never actually worn make up that I believe improves my complexion, allows me to have my *natural* skin but still covers blemishes, and feels light weight and fresh.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has evened (not as much of a drastic difference between a face with no make up vs. a face with make up).</li>
            <li>It LASTS for almost the whole day and looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apply two to three applications depending on how much coverage you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never actually worn make up that I believe improves my complexion, allows me to have my *natural* skin but still covers blemishes, and feels light weight and fresh.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has evened (not as much of a drastic difference between a face with no make up vs. a face with make up).</li>

            <li>Apply two to three applications depending on how much coverage you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>baby hahahaha</li>
            <li>, my skin just looks much healthier and even toned.</li>
            <li>Minimum needed, if too much is applied color will not match your skin color and will have a grayish tone.</li>
            <li>So thank ya&#x27;ll so much</li>
            <li>They are really just tinted moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>It really does seem to brighten my complexion too.  </li>
            <li>that can make you look very washed out.</li>
            <li>I really think my pores seem tighter</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It actually blends quite well and is really light and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bug me too much.</li>
            <li>and it is the real product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone I meet!</li>
            <li>This seller really does prioritize customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>doens&#x27;t provide as much coverage</li>
            <li>This BB cream has really exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I really have to agree.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be giving it that much use.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It does not leave a very cakey look that foundations do.</li>
            <li>it was all real.</li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream for the summer months.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I will buy again and recommend to anyone who has oily skin or just wants makeup to stay on during summer months.</li>
            <li>I bought it here in Amazon since it has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>She loves it and thanks me for getting it for her.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the product was so well packaged that it was probably bullet-proof.</li>
            <li>So, after hearing about BB cream from a friend, I found this cute pink bottle on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the real BB cream from Skin 79.</li>
            <li>This covers and smooths very well and the added moisture helps keep my skin condition under control.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t matter it just blends really well.  </li>
            <li>, this looks like the real deal.  </li>
            <li>And it ships so fast like no joke.</li>
            <li>However, it blends very well with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blends really well with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>but the cost was not so much</li>
            <li>This stuff has really transformed my skin.</li>
            <li>I am Native American and this stuff evens my skin tone and makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>light coverage (but can be used with concealer for extra coverage)</li>
            <li>It covers my acne scars and pores making my skin look smooth and air brushed.</li>
            <li>but I feel that I really need to brag about this one.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Controls oil..for a while (Coming from a person with really oily skin by the end of the day!)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>(I start oiling after 2 hours or so... which is reasonable...</li>
            <li>Not only is the cream itself smooth and</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>my very oily skin under control (I used to blot my face every 20 minutes, no joke</li>
            <li>Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about which products I put on my skin and do a lot of research before buying any product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a make up artist and work for a very well known cosmetics company which also has a beauty balm of sorts.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Blends very well, has 3 products in one.</li>
            <li>It is really convenient</li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s really girly</li>
            <li>(doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference i.m.o).</li>
            <li>I hope that I will never RUN out haha</li>
            <li>I have light to medium color skin with yellow under tones.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re reading these reviews because you&#x27;re looking for the real deal, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(in fact it did very well)</li>
            <li>This product really does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much product is in the package.</li>
            <li>is much</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the real stuff</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very matted</li>
            <li>I actually really like the cream itself, but the container?  </li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li>for the Seller SeoulGlamour, 5-star for fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It does look grey when you first apply it but with the addition of your own personal face powder it evens out well.  </li>
            <li>I have light combination skin that needs moisture and oil control at the same time.</li>
            <li>the packaging was identical to the real skin 79 bb cream though.&lt;br /&gt;Btw</li>
            <li>I didnt really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin</li>
            <li>I received this within a week, thanks amazon.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d have to really pack it on.</li>
            <li>but since I wasn&#x27;t sure of the color, I ordered skin79 pink label on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>like this so much, I ordered the travel size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and it has pretty much replaced my normal foundation (Lancome Teint Miracle).</li>
            <li>My skin has such a healthy glow throughout the day and it&#x27;s so amazingly natural looking.</li>
            <li>i cant wait to have my clear skin back :)</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d leave a review detailing my own personal experience with this bb cream, since it seems like the effectiveness of different brands and types varies a lot from person to person.</li>
            <li>As far as the color of this particular bb cream goes, I may have gotten lucky, because it&#x27;s a spot-on match with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>definitely see the \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot; effect that&#x27;s popular with Asian brands, but not to an unnatural extent.</li>
            <li>The product has nice coverage, without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>I mix this product with my regular moisturizer before applying my foundation and it makes my skin so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Sure it goes on weird, but then it oxidizes nicely.</li>
            <li>I understand that a lot of Asian skincare products contain arbutin (whitening agent), and that it&#x27;s more natural than hydroquinone, but there&#x27;s that study out there that shows intestinal bacteria transforms arbutin into hydroquinone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure US BB creams have some of the same attributes, but just because of the cultural beauty differences I decided to go with this Korean one first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned caucasian with both pink and yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>I set it with my mineralize skinfinish natural (light) and mineralize skinfinish&lt;br /&gt;(light &amp; natural) and finish with fix+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t discontinue the use of this product, it has definitely replaced my old foundations.</li>
            <li>but it still conceals uneven tones nicely.</li>
            <li>but it still conceals uneven tones nicely.</li>
            <li>but in just a few minutes it blends nicely.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally oily face and this product doesn&#x27;t make it more oily and actually controls some of it.  </li>
            <li>Bronzing powder in &amp;#34;sun kissed&amp;#34; and got my yellow tones back (along with a really nice glow)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives good thick coverage without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>Plus of Missha BB cream, high SPF (maybe that why it seems more oily).&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for medium coverage Missha (if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrant), Etude House (if you don&#x27;t have dry skin).  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged and truly like the product very much, this is my second order and won&#x27;t be my last.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>no strong ingredients, no smell at all and its perfect especially for Asian skin</li>
            <li>Got to me in under a week from Korea, WOW!!!</li>
            <li>This one advertises a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; agent which is popular amongst pale skinned Asians.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream did exactly what I was wanting to avoid, it made my skin itch, especially in hot and humid conditions, and the color was just slightly off and didn&#x27;t adapt to my skin color.</li>
            <li>It quickly turned slick and oily, within 2 hours of wear, even when having powder on top.</li>
            <li>Good for lazy people!</li>
            <li>granted I live in hot and humid Florida.</li>
            <li>All positive that had been written above is true for my skin.</li>
            <li>it seems that is one kind of so-so foundation but not easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The coverage is pretty good, I usually only need a little concealer under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I bought the same exact BB cream from another site that sells authentic asian cosmetics, and I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between that one and this one I got from Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does start out gray when I first put it on, but after a while the color changes and looks very natural on me.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the seller sent me other BB Cream samples. :)</li>
            <li>However, after purchasing this, I did more research and spoke to friends who recommended other brands over Skin 79.     </li>
            <li>Then i do the rest of my makeup routine as normal!</li>
            <li>Also came with two samples of their other products Love the orange one I think</li>
            <li>People tend to stick with what works for them, so maybe people are okay with how it feels because it&#x27;s the first few BB creams that they&#x27;ve tried or it really just works for their skin.</li>
            <li>Some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried that I love are Holika Holika Luminous Silk BB cream and Elishacoy Noblesse Naturalism</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I truly love this product and can&#x27;t wait to explore other Skin 79 products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I truly love this product and can&#x27;t wait to explore other Skin 79 products.</li>
            <li>&quot; although if I don&#x27;t need to, I skip this step (because that stuff is wonderful but expensive!).</li>
            <li>other than that, I&#x27;m really satisfied.</li>
            <li>While I like the color of this BB cream (it&#x27;s a bit darker than most of the other BB creams I&#x27;ve used, so</li>
            <li>and it controls the oil better than any other BB cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>first thing, i received it 2 days early!</li>
            <li>If you order it from here make sure you get it from pink galee!</li>
            <li>But I was expecting a better product by reading other comments about it on the internet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been experimenting around with BB creams this past summer, but SKIN79&#x27;s Pink Label is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little hesitant about ordering this product since I&#x27;m pretty tanned, and most of my friends use BB cream to maintain a pale-white skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am sure am going to purchase other pieces of this product ...</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed, I will be buying again and will not be using a different type of cream.</li>
            <li>I do think that it does a better job of not settling into lines and wrinkles like other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I have tried other BB creams, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply since you pretty much just rub it in, and it&#x27;s hard to leave streaks on your face.</li>
            <li>I have had trouble skin for YEARS and after several weeks of using this cream as a foundation I have noticed remarkable results.</li>
            <li>Skin79 Hot pink bb cream is supposed to adjust to your skin color but the color is still too light for my complexion.</li>
            <li>My pores also seem to be less noticeable and my skin seems overall more smooth and even in tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t even need a full pump for my whole face, I&#x27;m guessing it will last a while, and the lost bit at the end will just be a part of the deal, though a bit of a bummer.</li>
            <li>I put a light film of it all over my complexion and allow to dry a moment, then add a light finish of my regular foundation.</li>
            <li>Prior to discovering this product, I was wearing L&#x27;oreal Bare Naturale mineral foundation, because liquid foundation always made my skin more oily and acne-prone.</li>
            <li>Also after the few minutes of the cream oxidizing or whatever it does :) it really set in my skin and once I felt my face, it didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing anything!</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I was shocked at how gray it appeared, but after I rubbed it in, it took away any redness and discoloration and provided a perfect palette for bronzer and blush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 23 years old, have a ton of freckles with pretty oily skin that is also very break-out prone.</li>
            <li>I got very scared at first when I opened it, because on the authenticity label, there wasn&#x27;t a clear VOID printed across, but a rather holographic one.</li>
            <li>Tis BB creme is not bad, at least better than my ex Garnier BB creme.</li>
            <li>This is the REAL BB cream, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps, done a little research to see which brand of BB creams come out with the most positive reviews.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of startling because it&#x27;s so gray, but somehow it quickly changes color and blends right it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Some things to consider: I&#x27;m not incredibly pale, but I am pale enough that this BB cream matched perfectly with my skin, so someone that&#x27;s darker complected or has an olive tone might want to try some of the others that are tinted differently.</li>

            <li>It was a good purchase, I look fine after I put on a little blush or bronzer, which I usually put on anyway when I wear foundation, but I can&#x27;t certainly leave the house just with it on.</li>
            <li>Considering the reviews I saw, Skin79 was (and is still) one of the most highly sought BB creams due to its &#x27;effectiveness&#x27; and price.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast (2 weeks earlier arrival than the earliest predicted arrival date).</li>
            <li>I leaves my skin super soft so far.</li>
            <li>I ordered my BB cream on June 9 and received it about a week and a half later, which was such a good surprise!</li>
            <li>All in all I am very satisfied with this product and will be trying other Skin79 items in the future!</li>
            <li>I could tell how much was left and also be sure I got every last bit out of it.</li>
            <li>I have full bangs that fall across my forehead, so an oily forehead is inevitable.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that I have sensitive skin with a skin tone that is medium with neutral undertones.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using this product and I received it in early January</li>
            <li>The gold felt more moisturizing but also felt too thick and the coverage was more sheer.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin the SPF protection it needs when I&#x27;m occasionally in the sun, and has such a light feel that I rarely notice it is there.</li>
            <li>Even though my skin is dark, I love this product and I use a powder to match my skin over it.</li>
            <li>your skin is dark or light , it will turn to the gray !</li>
            <li>In my opinion, they are so much better than your average</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and prone to acne.  </li>
            <li>But if I only use it here and there, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I do feel my skin looks more uniform and some of the blotchiness I had has calmed down.</li>
            <li>Ver very good product,  if its the original ones be careful of getting fake ones.</li>
            <li>When you receive your product for Pink Gelee they send you a little thank you card, which I thought was great.</li>
            <li>Skin color: Very fair (NC 15 is still a shade too dark for me :/ ),</li>
            <li>I had recently seen a documentary talking about what&#x27;s perceived as beautiful in different cultures, especially the ones that were particularly contrasting.</li>
            <li>This is the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down, and I&#x27;ve tried close to 20, mostly Asian but some European and American brands too.</li>
            <li>The product felt extremely light on my face and smooth to the touch, I was not left with a sticky residue on my finger like other foundations.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even want to think about how much money I have thrown away trying new foundations..</li>
            <li>I have oily/combination skin and live in a very humid place which just exacerbates my acne.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much since using it and it is my new go to product.</li>
            <li>I love the color, it isn&#x27;t too light like other BB Creams but actually blends into my skin really nicely (and I am not a light skinned Asian).</li>
            <li>It looked amazing, and even without powder, it dried to a natural matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>color matched mostly matched my skin tone, although it made me look slightly paler.</li>
            <li>It provides some coverage (more than a tinted moisturizer, less than a foundation).</li>
            <li>After using this, I&#x27;m relatively sure I&#x27;ll never go back to using regular foundation again.</li>
            <li>The product shipped quickly and the seller also provided some extra samples.</li>
            <li>The bb cream looks decent and have a natral smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent BB cream, but I have yet to benefit from all of the \\&quot;triple</li>
            <li>I have started on laser treatment recently and am getting good results, and I didn&#x27;t want to jeopardize that by continuing w/ my heavy make-ups</li>
            <li>It covers blemishes decently well, but a concealer may be required.</li>
            <li>I left a star out just because I would rather be able to see the inside of the container to see how much is left over</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know what this particular product is meant for?</li>
            <li>There are many websites/blogs/videos devoted to educating us on the differences between the fake products and the authentic ones.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is the actual product looks and feels totally different from the authentic product.  </li>
            <li>I think this particular BB cream is part of a conspiracy.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave this four stars was mainly because it broke me out.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks of using this daily and going to see family, my mother was quick to comment on my even skin tone.</li>
            <li>feels so soft and clean and you only need one or two pumps to cover your whole face (less is more)</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a steady medium skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been decent with oil control, better than anything I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li>This one looks particularly gray, but like every BB cream, it will adjust.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll be lucky with a different Skin79 line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for everyday low maintenance look.  </li>
            <li>Decent size</li>
            <li>Thinking maybe foundations were the issue, I switched to BB Creams, and have tried several, but SKIN79 has been the first to do what it says it does---for the first time, I have NO ACNE.</li>
            <li>I love this product and this is my 2nd time ordering from the same seller.</li>
            <li>The expression lines on my forehead are actually noticeably diminished, my pores appear tighter, and my skin is baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>I am a fair skin tone white but not ghost not light tan either...  </li>
            <li>It does feel different on my skin, kind of wet, not oily.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I feel like this BB cream in particular</li>
            <li>in all I am really satisfied with this BB cream and definitely recommend it, especially to those who have problematic skin.</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone, and it moisturizes decently.</li>
            <li>(This is one main reason why I like it</li>
            <li>Now that I feel like I have it reasonably under control, I set out to find an alternative to foundation, as I felt sure use of heavy make-ups (no matter the brand) was contributing to my skin issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I took off one star is that I do find that by the end of the day it definitely needs some touching up</li>
            <li>This particular BB Cream is supposed to have sebum control and help minimize the look of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It comes off a little grayish and is meant or someone with a very light complexion.  </li>
            <li>I finish my nose area with a little mineral foundation and very light powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Korean, so I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned too, but it was a little lighter than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Very even and very natural.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a single skin reaction, and I believe it to be genuine product.</li>
            <li>I really cannot believe how well this product works to keep my skin looking clear!  </li>
            <li>seller was Blue Queen and the Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t mess up my skin but didn&#x27;t do anything to make it better either.</li>
            <li>Got three different ones past half a year or so, this one is the best of them all - adjusts to skin tone, is not heavy, looks natural, really cool.</li>
            <li>Then, I use some concealer under my eyes and finish up with MAC loose powder in light.  </li>
            <li>I set it with Maybelline Shine Free loose powder and have noticed a substantial decrease in the oiliness and shine of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it better than the Misha BB cream I have, This one has a very settle essence, not strong compared to the Misha.</li>
            <li>me, this is like a tinted moisturizer with high spf....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the seller of this product, seoulglamour.</li>
            <li>but I highly disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this product with high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Evens out skin tone, covers blemishes and controls oil</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and have told all my friends about it.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i highly recomend that you use it</li>
            <li>But maybe I had too high of an expectation.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>After carefully reviewing several youtube videos and the SKIN79 website I am confident that Pink Gellee sells authentic products</li>
            <li>Because I have oily skin, I have a high chance of breaking out when using make-up.</li>
            <li>OR, if you want to try Skin79&#x27;s brand (which I highly recommend) they have a chart here:</li>
            <li>I bought this in high hopes.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because of the high reviews.</li>
            <li>since I&#x27;m such a product junkie, I have tried other BB creams from Missha signature, Holika Holika, the face shop, and they are all goon in their own way..</li>
            <li>Anywho, I picked the pink one first because it contained a few more interesting ingredients than the orange and gold versions (in my personal opinion).</li>
            <li>This one does not come in multiple shades as other brands do, but it does blend-in nicely.</li>
            <li>, obviously, I was not expecting an all natural, vegan friendly, packaged in 100% recycled plastic product.</li>
            <li>I am very young however, so I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, and it&#x27;s possible it was simply a placebo effect.</li>
            <li>I am very young however, so I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, and it&#x27;s possible it was simply a placebo effect.</li>
            <li>The colour is a little dark for my skin (I&#x27;m super pale) but the application of it is perfect and it covers up what I need to cover up.</li>
            <li>They even sent  a little thank you card :)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a little more</li>
            <li>I need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>and i think it works a little better than this one</li>
            <li>, he says it looks like clay, no matter how little I put on, so I was pleased to hear that this blends into the skin and boy does it.</li>
            <li>I just dabbed a little more on those spots and they disappeared.</li>
            <li>this coloring is a little better than the gold label so i can wear it without adding any foundation.  </li>
            <li>It is a little thicker and provides better coverage.</li>
            <li>but after i let it sit a little it adapts to my skin mostly.</li>
            <li>I just wish it&#x27;d be a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I will apply a translucent or lighter powder over it to finish and to try to match my skin tone a little better.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing the orange label yesterday hoping it might match my skin tone a little better.</li>
            <li>However, it kinda makes your skin look ever so slighty grayish, but it&#x27;s nothing a little bronzer or setting powder can&#x27;t fix :)  </li>
            <li>I apply one layer all over my face with my fingers and then i will take a little bit more and tap it onto places i need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>Just wish what was inside was a little better.</li>
            <li>I apply the BB cream with my finger tips, putting a little more on my under eye circles and acne scars.</li>
            <li>Although it felt a bit oily when first applied, after it completely dried it was fine.</li>
            <li>Not as thick in feel and in coverage as others (particularly Dr. Jart+) which translates to not as nice of coverage.</li>
            <li>With the patting it will easily cover acne, or any other issue you may be using this product for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a little light at first</li>
            <li>, so this was a little light when i first applied it</li>
            <li>The kind where you squeeze your nose and a white/clear hard thing comes out.</li>
            <li>The only issue i ran initially was the greying of the skin, but I think once you use the right quantity which is very less you are good.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t holding out high hopes, as my skin has become a source of stress and irritation lately, but I&#x27;m loving this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally though, I do believe that the \\&quot;silver label\\&quot; Beblesh Balm offers more coverage overall and prefer it to this particular one.</li>
            <li>But, really, here&#x27;s the complete description</li>
            <li>so I was actually surprised that one pump does do the whole face.</li>
            <li>Definitely buy this product if you are looking for a great everyday make up, the American BB creams have nothing on this!</li>
            <li>Pink Label fit the bill and matched my need for an acne-friendly version.</li>
            <li>It made my skin look really matte and natural-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a thick coverage -</li>
            <li>Regardless, the product felt great on my angry skin</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think this BB cream does much for oil control, but then again I was not expecting it to miraculously halt my skin&#x27;s natural processes.</li>
            <li>and wow it does really work with my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like that this has \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; benefits because i have lots of old acne marks.</li>
            <li>no one will be able to tell I&#x27;m using any &#x27;make up&#x27; because it will match your skin tone after a few minutes of putting it on</li>
            <li>As a person who doesn&#x27;t normally wear makeup, I heard of BB cream from a friend and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>I have to use my normal foundation and powder over it.     </li>
            <li>I purchased this one for my 11 year old daughter, it goes on so smoothly, there is a grey cast as you&#x27;re blending it in</li>
            <li>So when I use this I probably have the equivelent of normal skin.</li>
            <li>I have always suffered acne proplems and my skin is usually very oily in my T-zone, especially during the hot, humid summer months.  </li>
            <li>This will work nicely on normal skin</li>
            <li>Keep in mind though that it doesn&#x27;t cover as much as a normal foundation, for example it doesn&#x27;t cover my freckles..</li>
            <li>Sure you&#x27;re saving a few bucks</li>
            <li>, there were a few others which looked like they could be better than skin79&#x27;s, but the bottle shape and color won me over HAHA)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The redness on my cheeks was totally evened out, and the minor fading blemishes I had on my cheek somehow looked more like freckles than healing acne</li>
            <li>I may want to try the golden one with lighter color next time.</li>
            <li>A few more bucks, but</li>
            <li>If your skin isn&#x27;t acne-prone like mine, you may be able to use this without trouble.</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li>even I was a bit more heavy handed with it - they say it builds up</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally like to leave reviews, but I felt this deserves one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that&#x27;s completely normal for some people</li>
            <li>It was more like a heavy foundation that did not match my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li>It was a bit thicker than what I&#x27;m used to putting on my face, but it applied smoothly when I warmed it between my fingers for a few seconds first.</li>
            <li>so I continued with my normal routine.</li>
            <li>But I just go with my normal cleanser routine</li>
            <li>But then, i stumbled upon this website and they say that a holographic VOID is normal on the sticker.</li>
            <li>There are a few okay ones, but this one blows them all away.</li>
            <li>I used two pumps of the BB and got a face full of shinny grey.</li>
            <li>watching too many YouTube videos I figured out a few tricks:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>and normally I can&#x27;t wear BB creams or even foundation without breaking out.</li>
            <li>It feels too oily at first (and if you slap on too much before running out the door you will feel gross for a couple of hours)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write review</li>
            <li>I even tried to cover it up with my normal foundation and it was still gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I found that the cream seemed kind of thick</li>
            <li>I used to moisturize and then add foundation and powder, now I just use this right out of the shower, no makeup sponge necessary, and brush a little powder on top.</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to apply and a little seems to go a long way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better than any other BB Creams I have used!</li>
            <li>My favorite was probably bare escentuals but the cost was too high after adding up the foundation, concealer, mineral veil, and other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it looks natural, feels great, improved my skins look and feel, and provides a good sunblock (I&#x27;ve been out in the sun a lot these past few weeks...and am very pale...</li>
            <li>And of course in the winter when my skin is more pale, I think there will be no difference at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start by saying I am going to copy and paste this review onto the GOLD version because I alternate between the two, the GOLD is more moisturizing for when I dry out.</li>
            <li>own 12 different BB creams - half of them which are samples.</li>
            <li>For those of you who don&#x27;t, foundation easily covers up my freckles, and the second you put your hand on your face and touch a doorknob or keyboard later in the day</li>
            <li>I am Asian and I just know the color is right for me</li>
            <li>The pimples are now going away after switching back, so that makes me think maybe this SKIN79 BB cream isn&#x27;t right for my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin79 and Asian BB creams knows how to do it right.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my skin besides the break outs, but I can say I still find it worth using daily, and works as a great base for a full make up application.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t really have great buildable coverage like typical foundations and other BB creams - it&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re wearing a gray mask if you attempt a second application.</li>
            <li>the short time I used it like others said, it went on slightly grey but after a few minutes matched into my skin and looked nice- smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>It came out of the bottle a bit gray-ish, but that was normal, and it oxidized to a very natural looking shade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little light for my skin at the moment, but not so much to be noticeable to anyone</li>
            <li>, i really like the real skin 79 hot pink bb cream that i bought on the skin79nothamerica website</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also left my skin feeling a little oily, which I kind of understand since it has SPF.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of BB creams at first and did a ton of research before actually buying one and found that the REAL BB creams (originally from Korea) were the way to go and man, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, so it gets up to 100 degrees.</li>
            <li>(They are based in LA, and I live 30 minutes from there</li>
            <li>All ladies have their beauty products they can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>and I was kinda scared to try a new BB cream.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new bottle from BB Cosmetic when my ran out.</li>
            <li>I used this new bottle for a couple weeks when I started breaking out.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve been reading that the new bottles manufactured in 2013 will no longer have the sticker.</li>
            <li>Also, I have acne prone skin &amp; when trying new products, 9 times out of 10, I break out.  </li>
            <li>The store bought BB creams are just tinted moisturizers under new labels.</li>
            <li>New skin.</li>
            <li>and thought how it would live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Bought this after trying the new Garnier BB and liking it.  </li>
            <li>(I live in Florida).</li>
            <li>and my face looks way better than before and less breakouts, other things that I observed is that my pores are less noticeable, and my face looks flawless and and more radiant even than before, and also I observed that my dark circles are less noticeable than before, I only apply this BB cream, and no concealer</li>
            <li>It creates a nice, natural look with hardly any effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t very dark so most of the time I just put it on and leave it but putting some powder on after applying the BB cream will help it to blend into your natural skin color a lot</li>
            <li>My complexion isn&#x27;t really that light or dark for a Mexican, but the cream blends in really nicely and gets rid of the small blemishes I have from sun exposure, acne, etc.</li>
            <li>I used wayyy too much the first time, because A lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and you definitely have to follow the instructions and pat the product into your skin after the initial application.</li>
            <li>The skin79 hot pink bb bottle was my FIRST foray into BB creams and</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I used the Skin79 chart (on their website) to choose if I wanted this item (pink) versus the gold version, and that chart led me to believe this would better suit my skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re afraid of the gray tone or find this BB cream too light even after waiting for it to adjust, mix in a dab of foundation or concealer that is a shade or two darker than your own.</li>
            <li>light or white for my asian skin</li>
            <li>After a few days it rose to the surface of my skin- really gross.</li>
            <li>and it still hasn&#x27;t broken me out, which is surprising because my skin is so sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li>But overall I am extremely pleased, this went above and beyond my already high expectations, and I would definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it gives me a very natural look</li>
            <li>Looks very natural on my skin (light-medium olive/yellow undertones)</li>
            <li>but I am very sensitive to this problem.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>but I have been very busy.</li>
            <li>Granted, I do have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This cream gives me the coverage I love with using very little.</li>
            <li>watched a you-tube video, but the first time I used a bit too much and didn&#x27;t let it dry between layers.</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with this product, as an Asian with a slightly darker skin tone on my face in comparison to the rest of my body due to sun tan, this works quite well in evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference with my skin tone - it covered up my dark spots and blemish scars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to keep my skin clear!  </li>
            <li>) ingredients help clear up my skin!</li>
            <li>Also bought Smash Box BB cream and tried many other American brands BB creams (Dior, Boscia, Too Face, Tarte).  </li>
            <li>It does look a bit white when you first put it on</li>
            <li>They are the EXACT same thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it for over 12 hours, and it still looks the same when I take it off, as it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>Its better to buy expensive ones frm the original website.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this daily since I first ordered it in August 2013.  </li>
            <li>This is actually the first time I have ever applied foundation of any sort.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that my forehead wasn&#x27;t that oily, and I have oily roots!</li>
            <li>If I can still see a blemish after my first application, a tiny bit more cream applied to the spot usually does the trick.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the real product has had both descriptions but it raised my suspicions.</li>
            <li>Even when applying it, I didn&#x27;t notice that gray cast that others have commented on (maybe that means my skin is naturally gray?!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty white</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve kept up with me so far, hooray!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I am a brunnete with beige - ginger type of skin - (not asia), at first when I put in my face looks very white, but then blends in.</li>
            <li>After my first and only use of it I broke out in a rash on my face.</li>
            <li>Just beware if you have a darker skintone because the BB cream is pretty white and may not match your skin color.</li>
            <li>but the product seems different from first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It made me way more oily than usual.</li>
            <li>but it blends with anyone&#x27;s skintone perfectly, light or dark.</li>
            <li>I have asian skin, so the color matches pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have heard that SKIN79&#x27;s other product, the VIP Gold one, is a bit better for somewhat tan skin, but I can&#x27;t personally vouch for that.&lt;br /&gt;(On</li>
            <li>In other words, I still look like me, only better.</li>
            <li>I use my rosacea cream first, then my daily spf, then an oil-free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The ones on the American market are pretty sub-par compared to the ones over there (per users that have tried both).</li>
            <li>I stopped using this during my last menstrual period and sure enough my period is back on track.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been very pleased, and for the price everyone should at least try this!</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping was actually quite fast!</li>
            <li>The Skin79 BB cream is a third of the price of the Smashbox, and it works better than more expensive foundations I have used over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my skin is extremely soft, never gets sunburned, and never gets acne- EVER!</li>
            <li>My face has been so soft since I started using it!</li>
            <li>I love using this product other than buying the american ones coz the ingredients of it</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter and most of all my pores are getting small.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I have oily/acne prone skin and still suffer from breakouts in my mid 20s</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it had a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>After I blended it, I found that it matched my skin pretty well actually.</li>
            <li>For being oily when it goes on, it actually controls oil pretty well</li>
            <li>I noticed I occasionally get pimples on hot days</li>
            <li>Because I tried all of the western and most of the Korean more expensive BB creams and this one does its job</li>
            <li>and it just look so natural!</li>
            <li>I notice some show up with pretty deep groves in which now I know there is a health issue going on.</li>
            <li>Drugstore products do the same without the higher price tag.</li>
            <li>did make sure to scrub my face every night because I think the thickness of the cream could cause breakouts if you get lazy and don&#x27;t remove</li>
            <li>Most of the other products I tried wouldn&#x27;t cover enough</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not sure if people with darker skin tones will be able to use this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so that might be a factor to consider when ordering) Inside included a card saying thank you  and a sample of the Pink and Gold versions, which was sweet</li>
            <li>I ordered from Pink Gelee, and got a sample as well as a sweet note.</li>
            <li>If you have fair skin, and have trouble finding a makeup to accentuate your skin, you need to get this... and it doesn&#x27;t smell like other makeups either.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding the right face makeup because it&#x27;s either too warm or too pink.</li>
            <li>He said he couldn&#x27;t tell (which was a very nice white lie I think), but added that the right-side (BB side) was less red than the left -- score!</li>
            <li>Love the concealing effect - it really whitens my olive skin (I&#x27;m Asian) but doesn&#x27;t make me look too pale.</li>
            <li>I also love how the BB Cream isn&#x27;t too sheer nor too thick, but gives the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent although it fades pretty fast so if it bothers you, I&#x27;m not sure if it would matter so much</li>
            <li>Even though, you can build for more coverage, but I&#x27;d not recommended b/c it will look very heavy.  </li>
            <li>It was much more popular than I expected, so I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m probably very behind on discovering this product.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in the rest of my routine, I finish off my very natural look with Bare Minerals foundation in Fairly-Medium all over and add some Bare Minerals Warmth in the summer.</li>
            <li>The cream is very thick, and at first I was concerned that I would not be able to blend it evenly.</li>
            <li>I am unfortunately not sure how well of a matte though it acts because I live in a desert so its very easy to have oily skin in no time, but in normal conditions such as staying indoors all day, this BB cream does stay on for quite some time.   </li>
            <li>I love that there is SPF, just can&#x27;t really figure out how SPF derived since no real ingredient list since it&#x27;s foreign product.</li>
            <li>(I found out that I don&#x27;t live that far from the seller&#x27;s city).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was just slightly too light for her as an all-over foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m acne prone, scar easily, and have uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Dior BB creams are more of yellow tone and dark.  </li>
            <li>This cream is exactly what I have always needed for my skin, and at 27 years old, I have finally found it.  </li>
            <li>the SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream (Pink Label).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 28, 2013 Update&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>First of all, Pink Gelee has some FAST shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought this from Pink Gelee, came SUPER fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try the pink label Super+</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think this is the real skin 79 hot pink bb cream.</li>
            <li>Pretty much gave up on them and continued filling a drawer with drugstore make up that was too pink, oily, drying, or over oxidizing.</li>
            <li>It does actually settle more into your skintone as time passes, but if you are yellow toned and darker, it will read like a pale greyish pink on your skin if you do not use something on top.  </li>
            <li>I am 35 yrs old but look very young.</li>
            <li>It feels very light and offers a light to medium coverage, whereas usually BB creams offer medium to heavy coverage.</li>
            <li>I noted the large number of positive reviews for Skin 79 Pink Label and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Beblesh Balm BB Cream VIP Gold (Gold Label) 40g (Autheticity label &amp; perforations with Free Hot Pink Sample!!!)]]) has what is termed as \\&quot;skin nourishment\\&quot; or just extra skin moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The color seemed spot on, which is the only positive statement I can make.</li>
            <li>I may use it for special occasions where I wont be doing anything active, like dancing.</li>
            <li>: Caused a slight breakout along my chin and unfortunately didn&#x27;t match my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>It always looks so amazing when you first put it on, but wait a few hours, do a few things, and you&#x27;ll notice considerable deterioration of the look of your make up.</li>
            <li>I use it daily for the most part, but I am admittedly lazy about it -- even not remembering to use it everyday, the results are STILL stunning.</li>
            <li>I had several dark spots from old acne breakouts that have completely disappeared and my skin tone looks much more even.</li>
            <li>This product is the very first BB cream that actually matches my skin tone... and not only that</li>
            <li>it also has more of a yellow under tone, so it matches my skin more than the American make-ups that usually has peach or pink tone bases.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly might worry someone with different toned skin.</li>
            <li>Discourage anyone else darker to purchase this unless you want to use as a primer/sunscreen under your regular makeup which you can certainly do.  </li>
            <li>all the \\&quot;traditional korean ingredients\\&quot; are pure</li>
            <li>do have pretty dry skin and am in my 40&#x27;s (plus live in the desert)</li>
            <li>and I tend to prefer my makeup a little bit light as it seems like it illuminates your skin from beneath.  </li>
            <li>I followed with a light dusting of finishing powder and then a little blush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It is a little to light for my skin</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, after some research I found a lady who bought it full price from a local authorized retailer, and the real product also has this typo, which made me extremely</li>
            <li>Applying a little will keep the face hydrated and feeling light as air without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applying a little will keep the face hydrated and feeling light as air without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so its just a light application, over my problem areas just for a little added coverage.</li>
            <li>I use a light dusting of powder over it or it would be a little shiny for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little light for my skin tone</li>
            <li>I would definitely repurchase Skin79 Pink Label from Pink Gelee since I know they sell authentic products!</li>
            <li>I have only started using it for a few days, and it is very lightweight and smooth and feels very natural on the skin.</li>
            <li>I will continue to order for years to come, although I don&#x27;t anticipate having to do it often since you get such a generous amount in this lovely little package!ou.</li>
            <li>use this over most of my face, especially the T zone where I tend to be a little redder.</li>
            <li>, I noticed that the pores on my nose which is where I have a lot of black heads shrunk significantly.</li>
            <li>I do a bit of both every day but always on top of moisturizer because this tends to be hard to massage/blend in by itself.</li>
            <li>Like other reviews it does appear to go on with a grayish tinge, but quickly fades.</li>
            <li>in conclusion, I highly recommend these BB Creams: Skin79 Hot Pink, Skin79 Gold,</li>
            <li>I am asian and it is lighter than my skin a little bit (I also applied a darker one on top of it to make my skin look natural).</li>
            <li>previously purchased a Sigma flat top makeup brush, and just now retried this BB cream using the brush.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, it is pretty light and not grossly thick, so sometimes, it requires some extra dabbing for those hard to cover spots.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I do get eczema occasionally on my body.</li>
            <li>Under Primer (clear)</li>
            <li>Literally just got it out of the mail, only blended it on my hand, will update this when I start using it like tomorrow, but so far blends very well;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the Cetaphil cream under this to see if that helps me go the whole day, as that seems to be the gold standard for those with sensitive skin, but who also require a lot of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The listing didn&#x27;t have a clear description on what skin color / complexion this would work on.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and I can thank this product for contributing to that.</li>
            <li>I was surprised recently when I noticed that my pores were much reduced and my skin was clearer.  </li>
            <li>Clear skin?</li>
            <li>Well so far I&#x27;ve had the product for about a week</li>
            <li>Professional makeup artist and skin care specialist.</li>
            <li>I have had acne roseacea since i was eight years old (I&#x27;m 33).</li>
            <li>and it looks so natural, protects her skin from the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li>Skin 79 BB cream is for the all natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for my holy grail product for my oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin one bit.  </li>
            <li>color is grey which can be offsetting at first but once its blended into the skin</li>
            <li>I know people are saying this is target for Asian market, but I really do like it</li>
            <li>Under fluorescent lighting and in flash photos the cream gives my face a ghastly, grayish cast, despite it looking semi-normal in natural lighting.</li>
            <li>Again, even though it doen&#x27;t have complete coverage, it evens out my skin that it doesn&#x27;t look blotchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I wanted natural, which I got with this.</li>
            <li>The color may appear slightly grey at first, keep blending and don&#x27;t freak out.</li>
            <li>Skin will look airbrushed and natural.</li>
            <li>If you look at the ingredients for this product they are all natural (which can not be said for the foundation, sunscreen, acne treatment and</li>
            <li>My face looks so soft and glowing because of this product.</li>
            <li>old with combo skin.  </li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s not my skin tone, once you rub it in it looks natural.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and as far as I can tell (using the internet as a reference)</li>
            <li>This cream offers medium coverage.</li>
            <li>And WOW.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the hue and undertones were NOT pinkish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the sellers/manufacturers out there that want to sell the fake stuff will fix that difference soon as they have many of the others differences that distinguish between the authentic and fake products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Wondering why the long gap between the time I first found it and used it to the now review?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Two stars because as far as I can tell it isn&#x27;t lying about the SPF25 part.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give off the natural matte look that I prefer for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I got this from Blue Queen and I received the real thing.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any way to tell how much product is left though, as the packaging is too opaque.</li>
            <li>Even the Neutrogena sensitive skin lotion did not play well with my face, and this has caused no issues (except a bit of dryness)</li>
            <li>I have a tan, brown skin and this product really makes my face look white alone.</li>
            <li>The cream feels soft on the skin, no complaints there.  </li>
            <li>However, I have to say this is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>(it is not heavy or oil).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any complaints and so far 3 of my friends have switched.</li>
            <li>I found it left my skin very oily and shiny.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cover much at all, if anything, yet it left a gray cast on my face.</li>
            <li>It covers to make a noticeable but natural difference.</li>
            <li>I use a kabuki brush to get an even and complete coverage.</li>
            <li>how ever i rated this 4 because sometimes it doesn&#x27;t look natural under fluorescent lighting and in flash photos..</li>
            <li>well with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>I feel it really makes my eyes look bigger by evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I tend to keep my face natural</li>
            <li>But that can always be fixed with some concealer.</li>
            <li>It also brightened up my face, which I was really surprised to see.</li>
            <li>And wow, it does wonders</li>
            <li>I would give this product 10 stars for all that it offers.</li>
            <li>I suspect it&#x27;s not as natural as I would prefer.</li>
            <li>The fact that it feels greasy if I use too much makes me think that it might be so I wont use this product daily.</li>
            <li>If you have any skin tone but completely fair/ivory, don&#x27;t buy this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nearly $5/bottle.  </li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t look natural on me.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to have a considerable amount of time of using this before I wrote a review on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I smoked for 5 years and completely quit since Sept. 2011 when I found out</li>
            <li>Additionally, the coverage is sheer, but still evens out my tone really well.</li>
            <li>but they do not cover pimples completely.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t look obvious or cakey at all but covers really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, no skin issues as a result.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t irritated it.</li>
            <li>I tend towards having sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I outlined all of that for you is because it is important to take note that this product WILL NOT fit every skin type and tone, and it is not intended to.</li>
            <li>being said, this product applies like a dream: creamy, balmy, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The drying time is pretty long.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any change in my complexion in terms of acne (no different than my skin was before using this product) and have been very</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this BB cream</li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I am 15 years old and a guy by the way.</li>
            <li>I also should add that my skin is naturally</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great, natural looking makeup?</li>
            <li>So far no breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds, from expensive Clinique to cheap E.L.F. For those of you who know my tale of woe, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li>I feel like if you put on just enough and not too much, you won&#x27;t run into that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I COMPLETELY recommend this.</li>
            <li>I feel like if you put on just enough and not too much, you won&#x27;t run into that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I COMPLETELY recommend this.</li>
            <li>and this one feels soft and silky,</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes my skin look natural and</li>
            <li>I still powder over it with a powder that matches my face to help it just blend seamlessly, so I can&#x27;t wear it alone.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but it does eventually even out to your natural skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin that is also sensitive</li>
            <li>bought this product because I have really acne-prone skin and regular foundation</li>
            <li>but it loses the greasiness as you spread it out even more.</li>
            <li>and then you can see the difference between my natural skin color near my scalp</li>
            <li>The BB cream I received came earlier than predicted AND is a real SKIN79 product.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen SPF30 Sensitive Ski(Love it-</li>
            <li>Wow-</li>
            <li>Then use the VIP Gold BB for forehead, surrounding eye area and cheeks to add hydration and natural coverage of imperfections where I dont break out...</li>
            <li>After a few minutes the whiteness went away and I ended up with perfectly smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Everyone tells me my face looks so soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I am completely head over heels with this BB cream.</li>
            <li>As I hit my early 30s</li>
            <li>; it looks completely natural, never cakey.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a day or 2 of stopping use the bumps went away completely.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m Hispanic, 24 yr old,</li>
            <li>When you first apply it has a grey tinge to it</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how much I have left because the container isn&#x27;t clear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love BB cream, because it replaces foundation and concealer (at least for me)...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and STILL get acne breakouts, to say I have combination skin is a cop out.</li>
            <li>I tried some on my 77 year old Mother and after just wearing it one day, she begged me to order some for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To apply I pat on and let it sit, it seems like it takes a few minutes to absorb, and then I smooth with a cosmetic sponge.</li>
            <li>I also use a brush that is a combo of natural and synthetic hairs.</li>
            <li>I have given up liquid foundation completely.</li>
            <li>for I am of a naturally tan skin tone.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t give me any problems.  </li>
            <li>Actually blends to match your tone within reasonable limits</li>
            <li>It has 15 natural ingredients!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a considerable improvement in my skin</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and this BB cream hasn&#x27;t caused any blemishes.</li>
            <li>We have a real one bought from the company&#x27;s website and they are different as is the packaging.</li>
            <li>It does not have complete coverage</li>
            <li>it leaves my face feeling soft and it is not heavy at all on my face</li>
            <li>I still have to use quite a bit of bronzer to look natural.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they were really old samples, I will never know.</li>
            <li>Only have been using it a few weeks, but love it so</li>
            <li>Provides light natural looking coverage, does not feel heavy on the face</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s more likely because I&#x27;m don&#x27;t apply heavy make-up</li>
            <li>, if I need to conceal any really dark spots, I use MAKE UP FOREVER \\&quot;Professional Full Cover.\\</li>
            <li>I used it only a few times and bought more.  </li>
            <li>It also does not have the extent of coverage that Face Shop brands have, so I was forced to use more of it.</li>
            <li>I do have two bottles of expensive and good coverage foundations</li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s not too thick and mask-like like some foundations.</li>
            <li>Most days I only use this product on my face, not a super heavy amount (not even a full pump).  </li>
            <li>only complaint I have is that the container/dispenser doesn&#x27;t help keeping my makeup bag clean, the liquid kind of leaks out a little even if I wipe it off after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>The SKIN79 cream is good, it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t understand why they have to make it a grey color that is hard to blend!  </li>
            <li>I kept my old bottle and compared with this new one and the new one does not have an authenticity sticker like my old one and the text spacing is different.</li>
            <li>This was a very good fake with no other obvious \\&quot;tells\\&quot; outside of the sticker.</li>
            <li>The only other warning I have is to be sure you are buying the actual product as there are some fakes on the market!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend it to my other olive-toned friends.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a problem finding the right colored makeup, as my skin tone is between pink and beige.</li>
            <li>The cream arrived much earlier than expected, that was a plus since I was majorly excited to get it.</li>
            <li>Further, included in the package were free samples of other types of BB Cream which I look forward to trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn’t want to try it longer because I usually don’t break out with foundations easily ,  </li>
            <li>The Korean BB creams also seemed to moisturize and smoother application, the Garnier &amp; Loreal seemed to dry out as the day went on so my face would look pretty shiny end of day.</li>
            <li>and I exfoliate a few times a week with a polishing brush, but I have never noticed this kind of effect with any other cosmetic product.</li>
            <li>The coverage is good enough to reduce the appearance of minor imperfections such as old acne scars and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The packaging is great; it looks mid-end (as in, not cheap but not super expensive IMO), and the little pump works great.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a lot little bit goes a long way especially if you buy one of those nice tear</li>
            <li>When I first apply the produce my face would be a very light pale color, but it will all blend after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an average product and definitely can’t replace foundation for those who prefer more and longer lasting coverage, oil control, and natural products.</li>
            <li>I will continue to order for years to come, although I don&#x27;t anticipate having to do it often since you get such a generous amount in this lovely little package!</li>
            <li>So when I first tried this product, it didn&#x27;t really do much for me accept that it made my face a little whiter.</li>
            <li>However, I feel like the color is a little bit more on the grey side which is the reason I gave it a four star.</li>
            <li>Was introduced to the Asian BBs from a makeup forum discussion, and after doing much research, I wanted to try the Skin79 Hot Pink.</li>
            <li>I used up the bottle and purchased again through amazon through another seller because it was not available through the original seller.</li>
            <li>so it was definitely worth trying, maybe I&#x27;ll explore their other products to see if they have anything to specifically target my oily skin.</li>
            <li>good enough coverage that I wear it alone on normal days (it doesn&#x27;t cover dark spots, so when I go out, I just spot cover with a little of my regular</li>
            <li>The documentary briefly brought up the desire for pale preserved skin in most Asian countries as opposed to the desired golden goddess tan desired in the North American countries.</li>
            <li>guess I should have known that since one of the claims of this product is that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;whitening,&amp;#34; that it&#x27;s mainly for Asian women who want to look paler (which, why??</li>
            <li>But this product works for me pretty much all year round.</li>
            <li>I wear this over a light moisturizer, and it instantly improves my complexion (dark spots, blemishes).  </li>
            <li>I have slightly combination skin with a mildly oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty big, it looks likes it will last for awhile.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was to make sure it wasn&#x27;t fake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure if you are supposed to be able to see the inside container through the outside...</li>
            <li>The shipper had a really long estimated time of shipment but then had it ready early and sent it to me within a couple weeks of ordering.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;m never going back to liquid foundation, liquid concealer or tinted moisturizer again!</li>
            <li>I have found that since I gotten a little older that less is more, as far as make up goes, and this reaaly works for me.</li>
            <li>When you wear this without makeup, it does not look very natural because 1) its gray tint and 2) not easy to spread on the skin without adequate moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is not a bad product at all; it does work a little bit</li>
            <li>The only negative is that it gives a shiny look, but it can be easily corrected with bloat powder!</li>
            <li>I tried a few washed-down American BB creams and liked the moisturizer and sunscreen, but the coverage was just not enough for daily wear.</li>
            <li>But so far, I LOVE this product, and I hardly ever say that about beauty stuff!</li>
            <li>The only thing is the color is slightly too light for my skin.  </li>
            <li>next time I used slightly less than a pea-sized amount, dotted it on &amp; lightly spread it.</li>
            <li>I did notice a few dry patches, so now I make sure I exfoliate and am well moisturized before hand.</li>
            <li>When i got this product, the box was a little open, but everything else was fine.</li>
            <li>only drawback is the color, although it provides good coverage, it makes my skin look a little pale...</li>
            <li>Everyone keeps saying it&#x27;s like lotion and that it&#x27;s smooth, but all I have noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as my usual foundation.</li>
            <li>This covers up redness and acne and minor imperfections very well.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very please with this product so far (only been using for two weeks).  </li>
            <li>and I usually wear medium- medium beige foundation and was worried that this would be too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>all the time.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle lasts a really long time because you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>And I use bare minerals powder foundation over it and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I have combination, normal to oil skin, thus, make-up only lasts about 4 hours, even though I work indoor</li>
            <li>Overall, I like this cream only during the first few hours of application (short-term) as it made my face smoother though it didn&#x27;t really give much of a coverage.</li>
            <li>I normally use two different primers then my foundation</li>
            <li>I might not be the palest, but I&#x27;m Irish, German, and most likely any other Nordic orientation that results in severe sunburn, so the preserved look is a safer option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pimples were still evident, however, but I had expected this.</li>
            <li>The pimples were still evident, however, but I had expected this.</li>
            <li>When I use my normal foundation without any BB Cream, my makeup rubs off in the next 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>The hot pink was also a sample</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not dark skinned at all.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of people complimenting my skin, which is normally rather patchy with red marks from acne scars.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this product is exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I did my research (battling between Skin 79 Hot Pink and Missha&#x27;s) before purchasing this.</li>
            <li>Once I get my face back to normal</li>
            <li>i bought a hot pink bb cream from skin79northamerica</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure it would work on fair skin (my skin is light/medium with yellow undertones but not as dark as my Korean husband)</li>
            <li>When completely dry, I could see it evened out my color and covered large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>give you a little background on how I came across this product, I&#x27;ll tell you a quick story.</li>
            <li>but what little smell it did have faded quickly.</li>
            <li>and I can see that a little bit will go along way and that even though I spent more than I would normally for makeup it is going to last awhile!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little light for my skin in the summer, as I am finally getting a tan...</li>
            <li>My skin is tone is cool toned and pale.</li>
            <li>: I have no idea how other reviewers are going through their bottles so quickly, unless perhaps they&#x27;re piling this cream onto their skin multiple times a day.</li>
            <li>In an excited frenzy I quickly checked to see if it was fake and looked for the sticker, the hashed perferated design on the box and etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to BB cream but this has definitely improved the texture of my skin compared to just using moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Curious as I am, I open the bottle (not an easy feat) only to find that there is definitely NOT 40 g in the container.</li>
            <li>It would dry out my skin even after i moisturize my skin very well already.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; coverage (I used Laura Bare Mineral and Mercier tinted moisturizure for a long time).  </li>
            <li>only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pump container means you have know idea how much product is left.</li>
            <li>This foundation only lasts for 4 hours before I begin to to get really shiny on my face, but i feel that it&#x27;s the same with all foundations I have bought in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now im sure the product is fake, also I found out it was expired which really pissed me off.</li>
            <li>I usually wear the shade Light for Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing by itself; so much so that after a few hours you have a sheen on your face.</li>
            <li>I initially bought the garnier BB cream since I had found it at my local Target, but after one use I already felt like it wasn&#x27;t going to go very well.</li>
            <li>so far today, 8 hours in, I am nowhere near as oily as I would be with my regular foundation,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair now because it is winter, but I get pretty dark in the summer and would be disappointed if the tint doesn&#x27;t blend as well with my natural skin tone in the summer.</li>
            <li>As far as concealment goes, the coverage is build able but does not hide my tired eyes and acne all too well.</li>
            <li>and I have combination skin that freaks out during that time of the month, leaving me with red scars and faint spots on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>It kept me from getting burnt the last time I was outside for a few hours (not SUPER sunny but fairly sunny all day</li>
            <li>A single pump will cover the whole face.</li>
            <li>I also found comments of a person who talked to a representative of cute and pretty, who sells authentic skin79 products, who even said that the label can scratch off, real or fake, if it&#x27;s been let out in the sun or in different conditions long enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much for reviews but because of all of the positive reviews I saw here</li>
            <li>May be people who left reviews have light pale skin?</li>
            <li>It was sorta gray when I first put it on, which I was expecting based on other reviews, but it adjusted to my skin tone after about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>but I felt like I had no other options.</li>
            <li>Ive heard other reviews make note about the &#x27;gray&#x27; tint when they first apply, I would suggest that you continue patting it around your face to redistribute.</li>
            <li>I break out occasionally, but not excessively.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m never going back to my old foundation ever again!</li>
            <li>The tint and thickness was also a little different than the original product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually I just put the BB cream on by itself with no other make up.</li>
            <li>I paid total of $13.87, bought it from seoulglamour, shipped from Korea, it look exactly the same as the smaller one I bought in the Korean store in</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been looking for a good bb cream for the past few weeks, and totally forgot about this brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping this will change around the wintertime when I have a little less color in my face, but I am fairly light skinned.</li>
            <li>I use NC25 in MAC, Bisque in Laura Mercier (tinted moisturizer), Golden Medium in Bare Escentuals, and L3 in Smashbox, I40 in Shiseido, and Ivory in Hourglass (tinted moisturizer) and this BB cream is slightly lighter for me during the summer.</li>
            <li>I used a full pump (if you want lesser coverage, half a pump should do) and patted it on my face as instructed.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t use a brush to apply it either, for me, clean fingers work just as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because it does dry out my skin if I wear it multiple days in a row (which I rarely do).  </li>
            <li>My black friend tried this just for fun since we were curious how much it would blend to her skin color.</li>
            <li>and I find it sets better with the BB cream acting as a primer as well (assuming you give the bb cream a few minutes to dry before you apply the foundation).</li>
            <li>and I find it sets better with the BB cream acting as a primer as well (assuming you give the bb cream a few minutes to dry before you apply the foundation).</li>
            <li>So, if your skin has a grey undertone, I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>The product appears to be authentic, and if its not its still amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very thick.</li>
            <li>I have huge pores and they are often hard to conceal even when I use primer, but once this settles on my face my pores become</li>
            <li>It also feels light, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little whiter, and eventually evens out and looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, just watch the video to be sure you&#x27;re not applying a fake to your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gray color and if your not pale white you will be after using this.</li>
            <li>It only comes in one color and may be too light if you are very dark skinned or for some if you are using facial self-tanners in the summer</li>
            <li>I have been breaking out really bad along my jaw line and it gives these pimples great coverage before I add my foundation.</li>
            <li>The shipping is free and of it comes late just send them an email to find out what&#x27;s up.</li>
            <li>This one is my general go-to BB Cream for every day use.</li>
            <li>Let my preface this by saying I have light skin, I usually wear the third lightest shade when choosing powders and foundations.  </li>
            <li>I paid $14.50 for a product that barely lasted for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I was very critical when I bought this, thinking it probably wouldn&#x27;t work as well as everyone else claims it does, but I was surprised to found out</li>
            <li>It hides my red blemishes, doesn&#x27;t cover up completely some spots</li>
            <li>In fact, I ran out of Skin79 last week and had to use my old Olay cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such natural looking coverage.</li>
            <li>Not only is this product all natural</li>
            <li>If possible, buy it from the direct website because the sellers on Amazon are not required to have legit products.</li>
            <li>ordered a second BB Cream directly from the Skin79 site to compare this product to that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural looking with enough coverage for hiding redness.</li>
            <li>now I use my BB cream, under eye concealer, and Bare Minerals powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still apply my bare minerals powder for color as well as a bronzer.</li>
            <li>I can barely tell there is anything on my face, it doesnt feel oily at all.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin, but if you&#x27;re acne-prone</li>
            <li>This product clears my skin up and looks so natural, last all day, and covers imperfections.</li>
            <li>not much so it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am white and I have sensitive skin and acne here and there.</li>
            <li>I never expected it to CURE my acne, because it is not acne fighting.  </li>
            <li>Having tried dozens, if not hundreds of foundations, tinted moisturizers, concealers, etc over the years, I can finally at 30 years old stop the search, because I have found my holy grail of skin cosmetics in Skin 79 Beblesh Balm.</li>
            <li>the title says, I use this BB Cream under my bare minerals matte foundation.</li>
            <li>I can barely see my pores or blackheads</li>
            <li>I have slightly yellow undertones to my skin, even though I&#x27;m caucasian, and this looks natural once its blended.</li>
            <li>I got it today, immediately put it on bare skin</li>
            <li>I will get occasional tiny clusters of white heads, so I think this product may be a bit pore clogging, however, I regularily use gentle exfoliation and can keep that under control.</li>
            <li>I even stopped buying my bare minerals and just use this.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have slightly sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, but my breakouts are hormonal and only happen along my jawline.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, it only comes in one shade.</li>
            <li>I am 99% sure this is a fake but a good fake,</li>
            <li>So glad I know about this ancient secret.</li>
            <li>Consistency may be thick at first, but it spreads on very lightly&lt;br</li>
            <li>The look was ok, not great.  </li>
            <li>Will see how long this bottle will last, granted my last bottle lasted me nearly 10 months!!!!</li>
            <li>If you are on the cool/pinked toned side or VERY PALE yellow and range 25 and under on the MAC shade range you can use this fine.  </li>
            <li>I have hyperpigmentation and random other little flaws and it covers them perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have light/olive skin tone and with a high oil volume in the tzone with dry cheeks.</li>
            <li>Chiffon BB mousse, which are newer, has thinner textures, and sheer to light coverage that actually makes my blemishes less obvious.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that after I apply my skin feels a bit dry, not sure why, perhaps I need to use more moisturizer</li>
            <li>It covered large pores and gave a glowy finish even without the other illuminators.  </li>
            <li>The only con I can really see is that if you have dry skin or some of your skin is dry/combination, you may want to moisturize before applying this.</li>
            <li>yes it&#x27;s true that there is a slight grey tone to it</li>
            <li>Other than that, my skin seems to look clear and smooth after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li>but only if I use a bronzer, or other sheertoned illuminator like Armani fluid sheers in golden beige or bronze or the YSL touche eclat pen in 4.5 (peach).  </li>
            <li>The ones I bought seem to be ok, however the BB on one of them has completely rubbed off and the other one is slowly fading.</li>
            <li>but even a few weeks later and with a clean face, I ended up with the same result.</li>
            <li>I am in my 60&#x27;s have combination skin, normal to dry cheeks with an oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>Unlike normal foundation that will dry my skin out and feel funky.</li>
            <li>After that major improvement, I was a little bummed to see that the hyper-pigmentation along my jawline was still pretty noticeable, but with a bit of concealer, those were just a faded memory (har har).</li>
            <li>It came in a neat little package on time with a little envelope and a cute card thanking me for ordering from the seller.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t end up wanting to spend 70 dollars for a small tube, so I researched other top brands, and Skin79 was one of them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t end up wanting to spend 70 dollars for a small tube, so I researched other top brands, and Skin79 was one of them.</li>
            <li>After an hour or so, I did notice that the product had settled a tiny bit into the wrinkle on my forehead (I have this weird single vertical wrinkle between my eyebrows that is pretty deep for my age), but with just a light hand, I massaged it away; I didn&#x27;t notice any settling in other fine lines that are starting to form on my face, like around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li>Light and sheer, but with that said, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It did make my face white in strange way, i didn&#x27;t particularly like it.</li>
            <li>I have almost completely done away with foundation altogether thanks to this little miracle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do agree with other reviewers who say it has too much of a &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have a few sun spots, small amount of wrinkles and this makes my face look like a blank canvas, but not in a clown face kind of way.</li>
            <li>When using Skin79 BB cream it covers up the unevenness in my skin color, although, it is true that when you put it on the skin is a little grey.</li>
            <li>I have really pale skin and was a bit wary that it only came in one color but it matched my skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I just dot a little more after it has lost it&#x27;s grey cast to cover up any other areas that may need it.</li>
            <li>I guess I will be trying out other brands of BB creams as well after having such a positive experience with this one.</li>
            <li>When it got low I took a tip I learned from another reviewer and popped the pump open and used a q-tip to scoop out the inner tube while I waited for my new one to arrive.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t wear makeup to work since my makeup routine takes way too long to fit into my schedule</li>
            <li>this was the real thing and not an imitation or fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Makes ur skin baby soft, been using only for last week or so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely switched over from foundation to BB creams (Korean brands only since US BB creams are basically just tinted moisturizers which does not have the same consistency, coverage, or benefits of Korean BB creams).  </li>
            <li>I had pimples all over my forehead, so I recently switched back to my old BB cream (Holika Holika--</li>
            <li>I wear make up almost every day that I have to socially interact with the world</li>
            <li>So, I mixed it with my face lotion (Oil of Olay: Complete Daily Defense</li>
            <li>Not only did it cover my flaws, self-adjust to my deep olive skin tone, hide my sags and bags, but it completely controlled my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Then on days you need more you can apply two thin layers to get that extra coverage.</li>
            <li>I have such a hard time finding a foundation to match me coloring because it is very light with pink undertones.</li>
            <li>A major plus is that it shipped all the way from Korea in only about 10 days.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I didn&#x27;t know 40g would be so little.</li>
            <li>First of all I would like to tell a little bit about my face.</li>
            <li>It broke me out a little at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;The coverage is very light, which is not good for me since I have a bit of acne and a bunch of dark spots where my old zits used to be.  </li>
            <li>It can get very dry without proper care but also very oily in the T zone without proper care.</li>
            <li>Use it daily impact on the clean and purify the skin very noticeable, Purify the face of signs and dark circles and covers small drill and covers defects in the same moment..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not so bad, but it&#x27;s still a few bucks more than my trusty old Maybelline Mousse that I can pick up at the store easily.</li>
            <li>You only need about half a pump to completely cover your face (mine, at least) and using any more than</li>
            <li>I was so disappointed after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li>It really brightens up the eye area, as well, and covered veins and dark circles.</li>
            <li>Make up Forever foundation, Bare Minerals powder, and two different concealers (one for my eyes and one for my acne scars...</li>
            <li>ive only tried it a few times but so far it blends in really well with my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s initially not as grey as everyone makes it out to be, but it fades to match your skin tone (for lighter skinned individuals) in no time.</li>
            <li>the problem is that when i first put it on it felt heavy.</li>
            <li>and so I wasted some the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>My first bottle which I used everyday lasted me 9 months.</li>
            <li>And i&#x27;ve been using a different cream which has not impressed me enough to buy it again (to be honest</li>
            <li>I was using it pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about the color (I&#x27;m pretty fair, and it was relatively dark)</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and still suffer from a certain amount of makeup slippage after a few hours, this didn&#x27;t take care of that, but it did hold well in comparison to other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I still have about half of my original bottle left, but I want to have another on reserve before my other one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe a little powder on top but no more hardcore foundation for me.</li>
            <li>It still isn&#x27;t 100% my color, but with a little mineral powder touch up and blush, it actually looks pretty</li>
            <li>i usually wear this on the weekend and not during the week as i need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>I was worried the first two days because of how pale it looked after application and even after it oxidized it still looked somewhat pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had purchased sample bb creams before to choose the right bb cream for me, when i got this i saw that it was a small size</li>
            <li>It takes less than one pump to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>have since purchased my SKIN 79 HOT PINK BB CREAM from PINK GELEE.  </li>
            <li>First of all, just a warning that this review will be lengthy, but it comes from the heart and speaks the truth on my part, and this is the kind of review I was looking for before purchasing this product because I hate purchasing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick enough to provide full coverage</li>
            <li>It also works really well with other products such as several different under eye concealers and some powder bronzers and cream blushes.</li>
            <li>If you want bb cream, this is the real deal, hands down, look no further.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Skin 79 products before and had no problem with skin sensitivity, but this particular one gave me what I can only describe as a chemical burn on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m middle eastern but pretty pale</li>
            <li>and I would normally have been pink afterwards!)</li>
            <li>: Dry, Sensitive, Recently Acne-Prone&lt;br /&gt;Color:</li>
            <li>I really like the pump on the bottle as well as the fact that you don&#x27;t even need to use and entire pump to cover your face, maybe about half.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is I was unaware that when I push the button down how much was going to come out of the pump</li>
            <li>so it does make my skin little dry through out the day and also i purchased this right after summer over</li>
            <li>I still have the same amount of acne [possibly less, but as it comes in cycles its hard to tell], but I defiantly feel better about the way my face looks and will continue to use Skin79 BB creams.</li>
            <li>I like to use this on days that I like to go natural because it hides my uneven skin tone which is light yellowish with pink undertone, freckles/pimple scars and dark spots.</li>
            <li>My face can get really oily and at the same time have a few flaky dry spots so when I use regular foundation my face gets oily really fast and the foundation also seeps into the dry spots.</li>
            <li>so i do got a little tan, its little too light for my skin</li>
            <li>But my skin is overly sensitive, so after applying &amp; removing later on, it would become red and slightly dry.</li>
            <li>Only half a pump is enough to cover the whole face + neck.</li>
            <li>am 37 and have 20+ years of acne scars and also wrinkles and fine lines from all the caustic products I have used.</li>
            <li>I am close to 60, spent from 15 to 42 as a model while going to school to get multiple degrees, raising kids as a single parent, and hiding the very oily skin that I had to work with all the time to manage breakouts.</li>
            <li>More or less, I would describe this BB cream to be more of a tinted moisturizer except with the added benefits of acting in as foundation, base, whitening and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I was a little uncertain about the color matching correctly or that it would really work as well as everyone said it did...</li>
            <li>You really just have to use a little bit...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little much in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I am caucasian and find the Garnier a MUCH nicer color, although it is a little stickier than this one</li>
            <li>The pigment seems a little too &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; to cover really fully.</li>
            <li>Maybe not so much in summertime when I get a little darker, but the rest of the year.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Skin79 hot pink BB cream on my other Amazon account and have been using it for several months now.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly dry skin and normal foundations tend to dry me out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised that after a little while there were a few areas on my face that began to peel a little bit, as the BB cream is more drying than I realized.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little greasy but absorbs fast enough to a matte-ish finish covering EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>skin had been breakingout before (stress, hormones) and so far the blemishes haven&#x27;t been popping up, the old ones are shrinking away, and the dark spots/scars are fading!</li>
            <li>so this is a wonderful product if you hate wearing foundation like me, but you feel like you need a little something to brighten your face, and make you skin feel oh-so-soft.</li>
            <li>In fact, after switching to my regular foundation for new Driver license photos the other day I found myself wishing I has stuck with the BB instead.  </li>
            <li>A little product goes a long way and at first when you put it on, it seems too white</li>
            <li>One problem that I have with foundation is that it is SO thick and it easily transfers to other things.</li>
            <li>had high hopes for this bb cream based on the reviews but was let down quite a bit.</li>
            <li>The tint has a grey hue, which makes my skin tone dull looking, overall it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing and pink gelee sells the real stuff only bad thing is it took forever to get to me like 2weeks</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so this is perfect and it has SPF!</li>
            <li> the perfect coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face is fair and the BB Cream does not look orange (yay!!)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do an excellent job covering the darkness under my eyes or the redness around my nose.</li>
            <li> After it oxidized a bit the color adjusted to match my skintone perfectly!</li>
            <li> Best of all, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> My skin glowed and looked almost flawless.</li>
            <li> but this has worked great for me!</li>
            <li> All in all, a really great product!</li>

            <li> great product!</li>
            <li> Coverage is perfect  </li>
            <li> I was not too impressed at the beginning, because it just felt like tinted lotion from neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> and this is perfect for keeping the oil from shinning through.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of Korean BB creams and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> The added bonus of SPF was great too!</li>
            <li> Anyways It came on time and I had excellent service.</li>

            <li> Its awesome!</li>

            <li> So unless you have the best skin ever that is not the slightest bit acne prone, you won&#x27;t be happy.</li>
            <li> It is ideal for winter because it gives you moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> Incredibly dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so happy that I found the best for my skin.</li>

            <li> Good schtuff!</li>
            <li> so i was happy when i thought i bought the legit bb cream at very good price.</li>
            <li> I had no idea it was going to work this beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Depending on my mood, if I want the dewy look I will mix one pump of this bb cream with 1-2 drops of argan oil for a beautiful radiant glow...without the shimmer/glitter.  </li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t 100% perfect match, but it blends fairly well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews from users with darker skin tones, and would agree that this product will look best on fair skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and sturdy packaging.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and the color corrects perfectly to my tone.</li>
            <li> It blends very nicely and is perfect for my fair, freckled skin.  </li>
            <li> i am very pleased with both the shipping speed and the product itself!</li>
            <li> but I am still very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great coverage, doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> , it covers great an feels great on skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for winter time because it&#x27;s so moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> But five stars for the shipping, the price is great if you have a lighter skin tone</li>
            <li> it smells great</li>
            <li> the dispense of it is also great</li>
            <li> but that seller has been great.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin but still works great.</li>
            <li> Looks great after you set it with powder.</li>
            <li> I wear it even if I&#x27;m just staying in the house because I have not found a lotion this great.  </li>
            <li> The service was great, and you get a lot of product for the price.</li>
            <li> All and all great service and product</li>

            <li> which is great for evening</li>
            <li> and I did set it with a sebum catching powder and it still looks great!</li>
            <li> The price is great for the amount of product that you receive</li>
            <li> Honestly the texture of my skin looked flawless.</li>
            <li> It provides great coverage, it has cleared my complexion, and the color is buildable.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I read the reviews and decided to try this...</li>
            <li> Great order.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing all the rave about this stuff what great things it does for your skin.</li>
            <li> And the great thing about this is it&#x27;s not a foundation.  </li>
            <li> great oil control</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> The color stayed nice throughout the day and my skin feels great, as if I&#x27;m not wearing anything!</li>
            <li> great product</li>
            <li> but it made my face look too gray and ashy, and the coverage wasn&#x27;t great either.  </li>
            <li> the coloring is great.  </li>
            <li> It works great, doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily.</li>
            <li> It works great at evening out my skin tone</li>
            <li> then this product does a really great job balancing your skin and giving you a great even tone.</li>
            <li> Goes great with my skin tone (beige/medium)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Dior Hydra BB Cream instead, which is 3-4 times the cost but gives me a warmer glow and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> The packaging is great; it has a pump</li>
            <li> Texture is great.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Its amazing!</li>
            <li> For most of year this color is perfect.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it feels light, it moisturizers and reduces the size of my pores, and it doesn&#x27;t cake on your face and lasts all day with finishing powder!    </li>
            <li> Feel so nice!</li>
            <li> Considering how affordable this is, an excellent deal.&lt;br /&gt;Light to medium coverage, okay as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and if I want more coverage I just need a drop of foundation, blends great!</li>
            <li> I kinda wished it was the orange vita plus sample :c )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen improvements in my skin which is a nice plus!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about blotting until about mid-afternoon, and for the most part the cream stayed on my face and not on the blotting sheets.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product itself would be perfect for people who aren&#x27;t allergic to talc.</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years and this has probably been the best one I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> It will blend in nicely!</li>
            <li> It has so many wonderful ingedients to help skin!  </li>
            <li> I love how it looks on my skin and the coverage is just wonderful!!  </li>
            <li> :) I am so happy with this product!</li>
            <li> And the nice packaging is a plus!</li>
            <li> It does a good job at fighting my oily skin which is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and it has a good coverage for those who don&#x27;t have a lot to cover (like me).</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look nice!</li>
            <li> So thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li> awesome* customer service. :)</li>
            <li> You and your skin will be very happy! :)</li>

            <li> Loving it!</li>
            <li> It smells very good and is very good for light skin.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, great wear, and amazing finish.</li>
            <li> but I find that it smells soapy and pleasant, not at all over powering.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent</li>
            <li> And the smell is pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> and I guess it could be pleasant</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the consistency of this product, it has great coverage and feels a bit tacky.</li>
            <li> It gives a beautiful finish and nice medium coverage.</li>
            <li> The product came to me in perfect condition, with great packaging and right on time service!</li>
            <li> They go on so easy and make my skin just look naturally flawless.</li>
            <li> This does give great coverage, my skin can still breathe, and I love the way it looks!  </li>
            <li> I use a bronzer to bright my skin up.  </li>
            <li> (This website is amazing and has all kinds of great information about all kinds of beauty products.)Anyway, I read about Skin79&#x27;s BB cream in this article:</li>
            <li> I bought the MIssha brand a while ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> After that, I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> Ive heard so much good things about bb cream.  </li>
            <li> However, I heard so much good reviews about this product and so, I decided to try it out myself.</li>
            <li> It makes good coverage, considering it covers up my blemishes and stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for a good amount.</li>
            <li> I loved the way that it blended and smoothed out the look of my skin.  </li>
            <li> (fair to light-medium).</li>
            <li> Plus did I mention at the end of the day, it still looks good??</li>
            <li> It also did a good job of hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian girl with a neutral skin tone, I&#x27;m EXTREMELY fair, and have crazy-oily skin.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d say if you are really fair skinned and have oil issues, don&#x27;t even hesitate to look for anything else.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> Good coverage and natral color.</li>
            <li> coverage is quite good expecally for a BB cream.</li>
            <li> im good to go.</li>
            <li> The oil control is also good, it prevents my t-zone from getting too shiny.</li>
            <li> I used my sister&#x27;s and thought it had really good coverage.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s THAT good.</li>
            <li> I have freckly fair skin that gets quite oily during the day.</li>
            <li> * Good Coverage -</li>
            <li> No greasy feel and good for your skin --&gt;</li>
            <li> Best concealer, pore cleanser, whitens well while still looking like a light foundation.  </li>
            <li> It goes on well and provides good coverage</li>
            <li> This BB cream does a good job at controlling oil for me,</li>
            <li> have relatively fair Caucasian toned skin.</li>
            <li> But coverage wise, nothing beats this stuff.</li>
            <li> had done a fair amount of research on this product before I ever started purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I thought I had made a good choice with this seller.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good deal since it&#x27;s cheaper than the one on the Skin79 website</li>
            <li> HAVE A FAIR SKIN TONE.  </li>
            <li> This looks good all day--it also has sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> + in Tan and used it when outdoors--it even lasted all day at a beach party where I wanted to look good, be protected but still not look &#x27;made-up\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I also have a fair amount of freckles.</li>
            <li> So I thought it fair to update my review since there&#x27;s some issues that can change your mind.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that tans well.  </li>
            <li> And the purpose of this was supposed to be good by itself.</li>
            <li> I am rather fair, and have not had any difficulty with the cream being too light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gorgeous skins could wear it alone.</li>
            <li> Every time I order, I get free samples too (great for traveling!).  </li>
            <li> The smell is good as well.</li>
            <li> it feel good when I put it on my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good bb cream though.</li>
            <li> and I have rosacea and fair skin.</li>
            <li> It feels so light and wonderful!</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t look good...</li>
            <li> with its SPF provides good coverage</li>
            <li> but it works, My skin looks gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> Lightly matted, perfectly matching my skin tone.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually good to go.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this product after reading all the good reviews but, was somewhat dissapointed after using it.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat in between fair and medium.</li>
            <li> , for me I have medium skin tone and it blends good, I look a bit lighter</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a good thing that I don&#x27;t speak or read Korean</li>
            <li> Since it does make my skin look really good</li>
            <li> This is for fair skin.</li>
            <li> My skin loved it and did not cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> but i do notice that it was good at moisturizing my skin</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> Good quality and price for the amount of cream received.</li>
            <li> Good price&lt;</li>
            <li> neutral fair ivory.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I recommend it if you are fair skin with any undertones as I&#x27;m ruddy</li>
            <li> it is not as good as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin- moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It gives good coverage and an even tone without looking make-up-y.</li>
            <li> It has good coverage for a bb cream</li>
            <li> Thank you, Min for the good customer service.</li>
            <li> the coverage is actually good hides my redness</li>
            <li> /&gt;Missha - Good coverage.</li>
            <li> Good dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skin79 - Good coverage.</li>
            <li> This product has good coverage.</li>
            <li> Probably not the best if you&#x27;re a light olive color or darker.</li>
            <li> BB cream is really good.</li>
            <li> and i loved the bb cream</li>
            <li> A lot of people said that this was a really good product</li>
            <li> It works well on my skin and sells at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research looking for a good BB cream that would also match me</li>
            <li> Another plus is that there&#x27;s a good amount of SPF</li>
            <li> I noticed that I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn nor a tan (which is a good thing for me</li>
            <li> This is good.</li>
            <li> Everything is so light feeling, my skin looks flawless and I&#x27;m getting complements</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find anything else this good for this price range.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skin woman 60 year sold .This</li>
            <li> I am close to 40 and have fair combination skin.  </li>
            <li> but it looks fantastic as if I have perfect skin!</li>
            <li> I had gave it to my mom to try and she loved it .</li>
            <li> The coverage is so good that I didn&#x27;t need foundation either.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely delighted.  </li>
            <li> and my face looks almost as good as when I had it on.</li>
            <li> The color is a good match for my skin.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a good set up for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is fair, and this adjusted well to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It has a good coverage without feeling stuffy.</li>
            <li> Well since I am a light latina this BB cream blends in perfectly with my skin</li>
            <li> it is really good .</li>
            <li> This was all just a side note to skin observations.&lt;br /&gt;The product, to repeat myself, is good</li>
            <li> which is good.</li>
            <li> I have medium coverage and covers a pimple fairly well</li>
            <li> i wear the shade \\&quot;Fairly Light\\&quot; and this BB cream matches my skin</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s best for light skin tones.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible and covers so much better than maybelline BB cream I had used.</li>
            <li> It provides good coverage -</li>
            <li> good coverage...</li>
            <li> good to use alone during the spring and summer...</li>
            <li> It has a great scent, as well as nice pigment and good coverage.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to try out this bb cream, it is one of the best one out there</li>
            <li> They are wonderful and sell the original one, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seller (seoulglamour) is excellent, the packaging was very cute and they even put in a free sample.</li>
            <li> very pleasant smell, blends so beutifull, color just vanishes leaving your skin smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li> just perfect, I apply before my full foundation (mac).</li>
            <li> The coverage is flawless and it&#x27;s improved my skin, which is really cool.</li>
            <li> This seller prices are very good and the shipment was fast and packaging was very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type of person to wear a lot of make up, if at all, but this Super BB cream by Skin 79 is magnificent!</li>
            <li> This is the face protectant I use which is super awesome.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, perfect light coverage.</li>
            <li> The price was excellent and it shipped fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It perfectly blends into your skin and feels so smooth and nice</li>
            <li> After my first use I was impressed by how amazing it feels when you put it on!</li>
            <li> Super blendable &amp; color matches perfectly.</li>
            <li> love love love!!!</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used by far!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this, I happened to find reviews for it while researching BB creams to decide which one to try, and I&#x27;m so happy I picked this one.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I heard that it is a great foundation that has built in sunscreen, helps with wrinkles and can blend with most any skin type.  </li>
            <li> After reading so many great reviews and watching videos praising this product I had to get</li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews on Korean BB Creams that I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> For a fair skin girl with more neutral undertones, this works amazing!</li>
            <li> It goes on my face nicely, and blends into a smooth and flawless finish with amazing coverage.  </li>
            <li> I chose SKIN79 because it had so many great reviews on internet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Beblesh Balm for about 2 weeks, and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> What is so great is that it is so much more than just a foundation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> i do not understand how so many great reviews are for the product,</li>
            <li> I covered my face, neck, chest, shoulders, and hands (just for good measure, this stuff does feel amazing on).</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy this after seeing so many great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you find a nice tinted moisturizer that is good and compatible with YOUR skin, you&#x27;ll save a lot of money without sacrificing reliability and quality.</li>
            <li> This provides really good coverage and makes your skin kind of glow but not in a shiny oily way that a lot of moisturizers tend to do.</li>
            <li> Impressive, right?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell or feel cakey and it blends beautifully.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you my skin is much more even toned, for sure!!</li>
            <li> The coverage is also very nice, I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> seller is credible and really good!</li>
            <li> This product works great for fair to light medium skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I love the packaging even!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product... except that I&#x27;m allergic to it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?!</li>
            <li> will for sure buy this again!</li>
            <li> more than 2 weeks before i am supposed to receive it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m sure that by purchasing all of these products that the reviewer recommened you would be spending much more than the $10 you can purchase this superior product for!</li>
            <li> Today I used it and it is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream!</li>
            <li> But you can&#x27;t tell after you apply this magic cream!</li>

            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> and I am already in love with it!</li>

            <li> btw this was my first bb cream &lt;3</li>
            <li> I really love it!  </li>
            <li> we are more than 4 girls, and we didn&#x27;t like it all !</li>
            <li> When I first got this I thought it was awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> for the product - love it!  </li>
            <li> Plus I don&#x27;t want to cover my freckles because, well, I love them!</li>

            <li> I love this bb cream!  </li>
            <li> LOVE THAT!</li>
            <li> I bought mine from NEVERPRICE, and it is AUTHENTIC!  </li>
            <li> I do have to say it looked grayish going on but blended beautifully to match my light olive skin.</li>
            <li> Well it gets better!</li>
            <li> and so glad too!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> So glad I went with this product!</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> The color is very light, so it&#x27;s most suitable for VERY fair skin and for those who desire \\&quot;whitened\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bummed it didn&#x27;t work out though, because it is really an easy all-in-one skin product and provides great coverage as a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it adjusts to your skin tone very quickly, has great coverage, and improves your skin.</li>
            <li> It looks great and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> In addition to leaving my skin flawless and beautiful while I&#x27;m wearing it, my skin is actually improving after I take it off!</li>
            <li> It goes on so nicely, and if you&#x27;re a pale-face like me it&#x27;ll match your skin tone pretty perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like your own skin, but better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by the product not sticking in the large pores on my nose</li>
            <li> , it is very light, so it is great for me but does not work for darker skin, I tried it on a friend and it just leaves your face whiter but with a healthy glow as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The coverage on this BB Cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple weeks now and my skin looks amazing, even after the BB Cream comes off.</li>
            <li> It feels sooo light on my skin and the coverage is great.</li>
            <li> this seller is also amazing they sent me a sample of a primer and the product I ordered this way if it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> This BB cream is so amazing.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> one is just amazing as the others&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> Korean products are amazing.  </li>
            <li> the bb cream itself, is amazing.</li>
            <li> heard this SKIN79 BB Cream was amazing, and found it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I think its amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Works great with my light skin.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t done anything amazing.</li>
            <li> It is quite amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been amazing.  </li>
            <li> I get amazing results with this.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen an amazing difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice; however, it&#x27;s one shade and not recommended for darker than NC-35.  </li>
            <li> I saved it for the winter when my complexion is more fair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Save your money, go to the store, and get a nice tinted moisturizer with spf that won&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I am totally loving BB creams though.</li>
            <li> On days that I like a good coverage I applied a darker powder foundation on top to even out the color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer with all the good benefits of sunscreen/whitening/even skin tone</li>
            <li> As another reviewer found, this product makes me look kind of gray.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; Authentic!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Effectively covers up skin imperfections - covers?</li>
            <li> Effectively?</li>
            <li> I am just thrilled with this and will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived before estimated date and it was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I am really loving this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product.</li>
            <li> The consistency blends nicely after you let it set</li>
            <li> Initally I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review because there are already so many good reviews, but after reading each review posted on this product I had to add my two cents.  </li>
            <li> The container is nice and has a nice feel and heft.</li>
            <li> I like that it has SPF and has nice coverage.  </li>
            <li> each one has its own effect/texture/sheen..</li>
            <li> But I decided not to worry so much about it and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> this was a gift...to be honest</li>
            <li> and I have been thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was prompt, and product was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Works better for fair skin.</li>
            <li> Loving this BB cream.</li>
            <li> lol I would recommend that with this :) You will love this if you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I really liked this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because an all in one cream would have been so nice.</li>
            <li> It goes on well, and fades to a nice, evening, correcting color in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The SPF in it is nice..</li>
            <li> This has really nice coverage.</li>
            <li> Everything I say is my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month ago and was very impressed for the fast shipping!they also included some VIP sample</li>
            <li> Nice price</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Great application consistency, feels nice</li>
            <li> I got kind of nauseaous just from smelling it.</li>
            <li> Soooo, I gave in when my mom ordered me her kind</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone really nicely.</li>
            <li> It has a nice tint that gives coverage as well as SPF.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how they gave a thank</li>
            <li> and then kind of blend,</li>
            <li> I am looking for a product that BB cream claims to provides: nice coverage and even out skin tone and make skin looks radiant.  </li>
            <li> in all, a good product that covers %90 of most skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> Kind of looks muddy...</li>
            <li> My skin tone does even out nicely once the cream sets</li>
            <li> This was no surprise to me, and I thought I would liked it regardless.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I honestly hope they never bring this to market in the US because it seems like whenever a cult product overseas comes to the US they have to change their formulas</li>
            <li> I honestly hope they never bring this to market in the US because it seems like whenever a cult product overseas comes to the US they have to change their formulas</li>
            <li> This gave me any and every kind of breakout imaginable in places on my face</li>
            <li> It has become softer and smoother without changing my own routine.</li>
            <li> The cream itself was quite nice, and I liked the consistency.</li>
            <li> However, after a two weeks I accidentally \\&quot;scratched\\&quot; the \\&quot;BB\\&quot; label and it kind of scratched off.</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m just kind of cautious and worried now.</li>
            <li> I really wish they made one a shade darker, and it would be a perfect product!</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave residue everywhere.</li>
            <li> (I hope to post a review/tutorial soon to my own website, so I&#x27;ll update this review when I do).</li>
            <li> It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave residue everywhere.</li>

            <li> If you are beige, not so much.  :D</li>
            <li> and I will stick with my Lioele BB creams which provide better coverage and have superior packaging.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this looked on my skin.  </li>
            <li> But i liked how it made my skin look so even-toned.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying my own.</li>
            <li> however I have lots of warm color as well from all of my freckles.</li>
            <li> The BB cream matched my skin tone perfectly, I can put it on just problem areas or over my whole face</li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable, the shipping was fast, and the product is awesome!</li>
            <li> It has no smell to it which is nice.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product and awesome service!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I liked the medium coverage and brightening effects on the the face.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful finish as well; very youthful and dewy.</li>
            <li> I did not ever where any kind of coverup or foundation in my life.</li>
            <li> It smells so nice.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day with a nice matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It takes something spectacular to make me write a review, and this product falls in that category.</li>
            <li> It will go on gray but blend in with your own skin tone.</li>
            <li> I just use this in the under eye and nose area and it gives nice coverage.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin look so nice.</li>
            <li> looking forward to using this product to see what kind of improvements I will see in my skin.</li>
            <li> It matched my skin tone well, blended in nicely, and had a dewy, brightening finish.</li>
            <li> Excellent for very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> The packaging does work well, fits nice in the bathroom cabinet, &amp; doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> I have never been complimented as much as I have wearing this awesome bb cream.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it,</li>
            <li> It Is A very good product , the right shade and got to me in no time .</li>
            <li> I heard amazing things about this product and was excited to see it on amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> days when I want a bit more coverage and to look more flawless on my face (say, for a special occasion)</li>
            <li> days when I want a bit more coverage and to look more flawless on my face (say, for a special occasion)</li>
            <li> and it covers my whole face very nicely!  </li>
            <li> The product is rich and does not require a great deal to cover well.  </li>
            <li> and i fell in love, easy application, perfect color for my skin, finish is amazing smooth, stays well on skin.</li>
            <li> This particular one is best for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Product works great, goes on skin smooth and easy and it&#x27;s wondeful!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, I have tried dozens of low-end and high-end creams, powders, treatments, masks, foundations, mousse, you name it, and this BB cream is the best thing that has ever happened to my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect skincare product and I purchased this product in high hopes.</li>
            <li> I apply about a pea size amount using a kabuki brush and get great coverage (and i am a full coverage type of person)...</li>
            <li> Plus the coverage is great - medium to full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute. :)</li>
            <li> I will say it does feel very light on the my face, i did have to wear powder over it though and blush to kind of make everything blend in nicely.</li>
            <li> This is my new best friend!  </li>
            <li> This product is my new best friend!</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference in my face, my acne has greatly improved and my makeup has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I am blue-eyed/very fair and burn easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my skin (fair Asian).  </li>
            <li> and I think the result is great; it have a medium coverage that mildly cover up my acne scars and brighten up my face.</li>
            <li> my skin is very easy to get oily.</li>
            <li> Very easy and sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It os VERy strong.</li>
            <li> Love it love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love this!</li>
            <li> It might works pretty good on my face too!  </li>
            <li> The result gets better and better and my skin keeps improving!</li>
            <li> this is my first time to put a cream that doesn&#x27;t make my face shine ... and it covers the spots in a good way!</li>
            <li> the more I used it, the more benefits I noticed!</li>
            <li> My face and arms got significantly darker after getting my driver&#x27;s license :P</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair, light ivory in most foundations and burns extremely easily.  </li>
            <li> The color matched my fair and  freckled skin fine when blended out.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of Dr. Jart&#x27;s, and it is pretty great, but Skin79 is sooo sooo soooo much better!  </li>
            <li> The seller responds quickly and has been very nice to me.</li>
            <li> In the time I used the BB Cream I never noticed it improving the health of my skin (or any whitening or wrinkle reduction, though I&#x27;m very fair to begin with and don&#x27;t really have wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, prone to breakouts and very combination-</li>
            <li> But to be honest, BB creams are nothing more than tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This product is AUTHENTIC and it works amazingly~</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with light freckles over my nose and no acne.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> this one offers THE BEST coverage I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Now I have fair, smooth oily skin, I don&#x27;t have any acne</li>
            <li> By far the best BB cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Beblesh Balm and so far am really impressed.</li>
            <li> I recently got married on the beach and this was the most wonderful stuff to put on to just get out an go and have great coverage!</li>
            <li> Color too light even for fair skin</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s by far the best BB cream on the market!</li>
            <li> This product offered good coverage, however it was light compared to the color shade illustrated in the listing.  </li>
            <li> This bb creme is the best that i have tried so far.</li>
            <li> The kind of bb cream was Charm Cell and it looked goofy</li>
            <li> both of those are amazing with Beyond the Solution being my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, but this one is really amazing.</li>
            <li> but after 3 months I can honestly say my skin looks better now at 33</li>
            <li> I am fortunate to have good skin</li>
            <li> but it was a good light coverage.</li>
            <li> Maybe for a naturally darker-complected person it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff did an excellent job evening out my skin tone while I was wearing it</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying the product feels great on my skin, and has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> At first I was so impressed by the way the BB Cream hides my pores, but other than that it honestly isn&#x27;t the greatest for me.</li>
            <li> The color eventually faded but you can easily tell that I&#x27;m wearing make-up by how my face is visibly lighter than my neck!  </li>
            <li> Very quick shipping also!</li>
            <li> if you have very fine skin this stuff will work with you.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love love love it!</li>
            <li> love love love it!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> love, love, love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It looks very light, natural, and gives a flawless appearance.</li>
            <li> have fair skin with more of a pinky undertone and this cream works just fine.</li>
            <li> This has made my skin so soft and so much more even!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product because of the good reviews it has.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned for those of you that are familiar with the BareMinerals foundation</li>
            <li> If a makeup looks good in direct sunlight AND the color matches, it&#x27;s great in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> this stuff gives my face a nice smooth finish and highlights it nicely.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anything better, but I honestly don&#x27;t see how it could get any better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because it has turned out to be the best foundation-type product I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> You get a great price, free samples and the products that I have purchased have all been genuine and un-tampered with.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage, nice light feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It adds a soft focus look to my skin, and is a great shade on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> Generally happy with it and makes my morning routine very fast.  </li>
            <li> It is a Great item  ~~~i like it very much.</li>
            <li> I heard about BB creams, and was willing to risk a breakout or rash to find a great product.  </li>
            <li> I got this cream because I saw good reviews and the website claimed that they were the top selling original BB Cream.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t so great first off.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this product it was great.</li>
            <li> &lt;3 will buy again once i get close to running out :O</li>
            <li> It also has good staying power after a full day out.</li>
            <li> I should have known, the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> The coverage is very light</li>
            <li> It very light weight, goes on like a lotion rather than a foundation.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin</li>
            <li> This was very important in selecting what BB Cream I chose.</li>
            <li> It is very good package with very professional.</li>
            <li> This one blended my skin well, but was very light coverage.</li>
            <li> It has a very very light flowery powder smell that dissipates.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, very fair skin that&#x27;s oily in the T-zone and acne-prone.</li>
            <li> There was a floral scent that was very light and didn&#x27;t seem to bother me.</li>
            <li> After that the color blends in to my very fair skin and lets a very natural finish.</li>
            <li> very smooth and creamy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has very light coverage</li>
            <li> I use this, which gives very light coverage.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin looks, feels smoother and it&#x27;s very light, almost feeling like I&#x27;m not wearing it at all.</li>
            <li> I use almost one full pump of BB cream on my face to start with, and it does an amazing job of evening my skintone out and giving it a nice, dewy glow.  </li>
            <li> The makeup looks great on and definitely makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> ( I am super fair and had a ton of freckles and some acne scars).</li>
            <li> That sounded too good to be true. :)</li>
            <li> and I liked that it didn&#x27;t have a strong odor of perfume</li>
            <li> I love this product; it blends really easily, evens out my skin tone, and covers amazingly.</li>
            <li> What I love is the easy application and nice coverage.  </li>
            <li> When I went to put it on I noticed the texture was very smooth and felt more like a lotion than a make-up.</li>
            <li> My own mixture that I have been using for some time has reduced the darkness under my eyes and fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> This BB cream certainly does a great job of evening skin tone and hiding blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, lasts a long time, looks awesome, and doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;greasy&#x27; if you seal it with powder</li>
            <li> I want a fuller coverage for date nights or special occasions I like to mix this BB Cream with one of my normal foundations and it works great!</li>
            <li> The SPF is a huge plus too!</li>
            <li> This feels like a \\&quot;second skin\\&quot; and it oxidizes to perfectly match, blend, and \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; my skin tone.</li>
            <li> but it was still ok</li>
            <li> Also, buy from a reputable Ebay sellers.  </li>
            <li> But since we can&#x27;t get our hands on, we are paying a bit more.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this bb cream does not make it more oily</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s actually like, the perfect product for me since I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup anyways</li>
            <li> so it provides a bit more coverage than some.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had more colors.  </li>
            <li> I like the MIssha brand much better.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hot pink&amp;#34; was my favorite out of that bunch.  </li>
            <li> I love this BB cream and wear it just about every day.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to remove the top and scrape out the remaining BB cream.</li>
            <li> i bought this after seeing videos on youtube and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> but you might have to dab on a bit more concealer for the more prominent imperfections.</li>
            <li> it really did a GREAT job of covering blackheads and lightening your skin:</li>
            <li> but in the end i still like this product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love the texture and lightness of the feeling....</li>
            <li> It definitely gives me the best alternative for a liquid foundation....</li>
            <li> Ever since my favorite beauty gurus on YouTube started talking about these creams I&#x27;ve wanted one myself.</li>
            <li> but once you let it oxidize for about 2 minutes it matches your skin tone :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds of make up, even the mineral make up and nothing has worked even close to how I would like it to.</li>
            <li> Love both.</li>
            <li> Will order some more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on my skin within weeks of using this, with folks saying my skin is healthy and glowy.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are milder and farther between, my scars have begun to fade, and the coverage and lasting wear for this BB cream are awesome.  </li>
            <li> i love the look of this bb cream and</li>
            <li> I like the gold one better.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something of darker shades or more coverage, this would not be it, after all this is not a foundation.</li>
            <li> probably my last (for good reasons too)!!</li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it from this</li>
            <li> I love BB creams from Korea, not the newer ones coming into the US.</li>
            <li> I really love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> esp if I&#x27;m tanning) but the BEST thing I found to make this a bit darker without making it orange is to mix a bit of St Tropez Wash Off Instant Glow Face into the BB cream before you apply it to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just love the effect</li>
            <li> Not quite sure how I survived without my BB Creams???</li>
            <li> Love Love Love :)</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing foundation</li>
            <li> Shields skin from premature aging with potent SPF</li>
            <li> - I haven&#x27;t notice any improvement and I don&#x27;t have many lines.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Overall impressed with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> It starts out kind of ashy or grey in the beginning, but blends beautifully into your own skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and love it</li>
            <li> And I know this was authentic, so don&#x27;t listen to the reviews saying it wasnt.</li>
            <li> To be sure for yourself, go on youtube and search:</li>
            <li> Even better then just covering the u even skin</li>
            <li> it seems to magically blur the problems.</li>
            <li> I do still top with a powder, sometimes powder foundation if I need more coverage, just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent and evens out my skin tone while also protecting my skin from the sun.</li>
            <li> I find that Dr Jart BB creams give much better coverage, but Dr Jart creams make my face break out.  </li>
            <li> To sum it up:  Pros:  Smooth texture and buildable consistency  Leaves skin smooth  Good oil control  </li>
            <li> I love the creaminess and the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that sometimes there are stickers to indicate the authentic</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> But I have to admit it&#x27;s not always a perfect match, since each product are slightly different tones.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this brand.</li>
            <li> One pumps does it, on the top of your hand, then dab away.</li>
            <li> One more word of advice,</li>
            <li> and you literally have at the bottom, alot more cream.</li>
            <li> and they did send me an authentic product.</li>
            <li> and we have both notice better feeling and looking skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are so many helpful reviews, so I just wanted to add that to build coverage and not get a \\&quot;cakey\\</li>
            <li> I love the way it works.</li>
            <li> It is better than makeup too me.</li>
            <li> MOST OF THEM I USED, THEY DON&#x27;T KEEP MY MAKE UP STAY</li>
            <li> I would say this is more of a medium coverage</li>
            <li> more now.will start using this one in earnest soon since it&#x27;s warming up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve referred this product to many friends and they are just as in love with it as I am.</li>
            <li> Love the look of my skin with this BB cream.</li>
            <li> This is mostly for evening the skin tone</li>
            <li> It has a shiny finish so make sure you set it with a mineral or setting powder.  </li>
            <li> I received mine promptly and I was happy to get it straight away.</li>
            <li> I will continue looking for a better match product for myself, though, I will recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> love the product - no colors even close to my complextion.  </li>
            <li> love it though.</li>
            <li> I will give another week and update this review even more</li>
            <li> Hope to do more business with you.</li>
            <li> It had better coverage than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> As soon as I had finished applying this on my face, it seemed as though all my blemishes magically disappeared.</li>
            <li> Okay, okay,</li>
            <li> and I would gladly repurchase this in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> thats what i like most about it.</li>
            <li> and I hope it helps you decide if this BB cream is for you :)</li>
            <li> so I will not be able to help those looking for an in depth review</li>
            <li> However, BEWARE, there are sellers that say their products are authentic but are in fact, FAKE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The boxes and the tubes seemed to look authentic.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I squirted out the product that I noticed that the application button was more \\&quot;springy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The product itself was more watery and had a pink/peach appearance instead of the gray color I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> It IS AUTHENTIC and I will purchase from them from now on.  </li>
            <li> It works better than foundation.</li>
            <li> I have tried many primers and BB creams.</li>
            <li> i am so in love with this.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this BB</li>
            <li> Because I love the BB Creams from Skin 79</li>
            <li> , with skin that&#x27;s never given me many issues either way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really more of a \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li> This cream evens out the redness in my skin and gives me dewy, healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Emma&#x27;s Cosmetics &amp; Skincare, and the product appears to be authentic &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Im happy with this product, doesnt have as much coverage</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a bit darker than most \\&quot;pale\\&quot; Asians.</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream because it does everything its suppose to.</li>
            <li> After trying that one, I was even more convinced that I wouldn&#x27;t find a BB Cream that would work for me.</li>
            <li> plus, it feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love it:&lt;br /&gt;-I love that it reduces the redness on my face</li>
            <li> and I love how it makes my skin tone took brighter like in</li>
            <li> everything is okay.</li>
            <li> It is packaged nicely and includes a free sample of another beauty product (in my case (time revolution night repair science activator serum by missha).</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all this, I am almost sure now that the product I got was an authentic skin79 product.</li>
            <li> These are the elaborate reasons why I think my product is legit.</li>
            <li> Since they are known branded, you can feel more safe using them.</li>
            <li> It is better than any BB cream I have ever use.</li>
            <li> OMG, I have been using this fabulous product for three days and am PRAYING that it will not make my skin break out!</li>
            <li> been using this product for over a month, and love it.</li>
            <li> ; I am convinced the discounted product is authentic.</li>
            <li> Wii order more.</li>
            <li> (it is now just before Christmas) and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I think it should be an even better match in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product -I always have one for reserve.</li>
            <li> I compared my product and I have an authentic Skin79 BB Cream.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream..</li>
            <li> , SOMEBODY MAY BE ABLE TO HAVE IT AND USE IT.</li>
            <li> I love the sanitary pump.</li>
            <li> If I am going out for an event sometimes I wear Physician&#x27;s Formula Conceal RX underneath on my cheeks but for the most part I wear Skin79 BB Cream and get nice smooth, build-able coverage....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use something that has a greater shade range.</li>
            <li> and I simply love it.</li>
            <li> but the one I received was authentic and had the official sticker on it.</li>
            <li> Love this beauty balm.  </li>
            <li> This BB cream is definitely the best product for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this BB cream, I like the smell of it and the color matches perfectly with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> LOVE this seller &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> love this b b cream.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I wear this bb cream most when I&#x27;m inside because it makes me look like a ghost.  </li>
            <li> If you go to Skin79&#x27;s website, they&#x27;ll show you tips on how to spot an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but a word of caution to those who are more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had almost given up on foundation, since it clogs my pores, and I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found something so much better.</li>
            <li> I presume it is because of the SPF 25 - which i love.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite BB creams to date.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> All I can say is: will buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try this together with neautragena healthy skin foundation as what I&#x27;ve seen on youtube\\&quot;frmheadtotoe&#x27;s channel..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything of it and just though I need to cleanse my face more.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s a great product if you get the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, I ordered another bottle on Oct 16, 2013 from Letif Beauty with fulfillment by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work better in the summer time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t confirm that the product is expired or authentic</li>
            <li> Well after reading the reviews I was sure this would do wonders to my skin.</li>
            <li> Then I lightly applied my Tarte amazonian clay finishing powder and, voila!</li>
            <li> The more I use this product the more I love it.</li>
            <li> I really, really, love this product...</li>
            <li> for many, many reasons...</li>
            <li> &#x27;s why I love this cream:&lt;br /&gt;-Works</li>
            <li> My forehead needs this the most, so i&#x27;ll repost after i do it on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I read SO MANY REVIEWS before trying to decide on a BB cream.</li>
            <li> and I think way better in terms of coverage and making you look like the examples in the ads!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It turned out okay,</li>
            <li> so I was not looking for any skin healing effects, just to look better with makeup.</li>
            <li> I trusted the reviews of it being authentic and they also sent me 2 samples.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll want to make sure you&#x27;re treating your problem areas with something extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T break out, my skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there, but this is working for me.</li>
            <li> ever since I&#x27;ve used these 3 together my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I use a powder foundation over top of it</li>
            <li> I have heard that the VIP Gold BB cream has more skin-improving qualities, however.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a lovely, dewy finish, and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>
            <li> Just wish more colors would be availble.</li>
            <li> and I find works better for me.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> just LOVE this BB cream and will purchase it again as soon as I run out.  </li>
            <li> so do not like being able to feel what I have</li>
            <li> And it is safe for my walk with SPF25.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Between the Gold and the Red bottle, I believe the Gold bottle works best for my skin.</li>
            <li> Covers most imperfections.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> ,it suits her skin tone better than it did mine ...</li>
            <li> people claimed it left a grayish cast, but I must have a grayish face, because it matched my skin color perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have acne and a peach tint to my skin, and instantly my skin tone looked even and flawless.</li>
            <li> people claimed it left a grayish cast, but I must have a grayish face, because it matched my skin color perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have acne and a peach tint to my skin, and instantly my skin tone looked even and flawless.</li>
            <li> It has more benefits than foundation.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I would love a better bottle.</li>
            <li> After trying it, I think that it creates a nice smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> Love the dispensing of this product....</li>
            <li> This gives a nice light coverage on the skin with the added benefits of skin care.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it made my skin any smoother or clearer, but it was a nice light weight moisturizing formula.</li>
            <li> , MOST PRODUCTS DO.</li>
            <li> coverage is better than any drugstore foundation I&#x27;ve ever bought, without having the layers of creams, foundation, concealer, powder, etc.  </li>
            <li> I started to have more break-outs, but</li>
            <li> I really love this bb cream.</li>
            <li> Pay a couple more dollars and buy through a reputable seller.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for my fair but uneven complexion and provides sun protection.</li>
            <li> Healthy skin.</li>
            <li> After watching a youtube video about getting more out of your BB cream</li>
            <li> BB cream itself is ok product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> for more whiter skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream...</li>
            <li> I found if I applied it by dotting on my face and patting it in like instructed on the box it works and covers much better than if I rub it in.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> but I thought I should since many people are questioning authenticity and whatnot.  </li>
            <li> I believe without a doubt that my bottle is 100% authentic.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and wish I could give it a better rating, but I guess it&#x27;s not just for my skin type.</li>
            <li> but I wish the coverage was better.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Lovely Girls and</li>
            <li> My best advise is to get samples; there are a lot of sellers that provide samples when you made a purchase so that you can try different brands before you commit to anything.</li>
            <li> most days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will purchase again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t tried it without putting powder on top</li>
            <li> I love BB Creams and decided to try this out as this is the \\&quot;best\\&quot; they say.</li>
            <li> I attribute that to the whitening agent in this and the face that there are so many</li>
            <li> I bought 3 more products as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, so I wound up liking Holika Holika&#x27;s Petite Clearing BB Cream better.  </li>
            <li> The color evened out and &amp;#34;darkened&amp;#34; to better match my skin tone, but still had a brightening effect.</li>
            <li> Another great plus was this was matte and stayed matte the whole day.</li>
            <li> i think im in love</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am really happy with it and would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> but there was so many to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love it and</li>
            <li> I love the glow I get from it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to apply it more than once in a day.</li>
            <li> I felt much more confident in which formula to pick after doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt much more confident in which formula to pick after doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cute packaging.</li>
            <li> for a more finished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - my skin looks better and feels better since I&#x27;ve been using it - will look at the gold label to see what that&#x27;s about.  </li>
            <li> but I did feel like if I did it would be able to cover it well.</li>
            <li> I am in Love with it.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> love the product - no colors even close to my complextion.</li>

            <li> and I LOVE what this has done for me.</li>
            <li> I received a functional bottle of BB cream, and it appears perfectly authentic.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Works better than American-type BB creams just now hitting the market for my skin.</li>
            <li> Works well under most translucent finishing powders.</li>
            <li> I rrally love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> Love how this product gives a nice light coverage for my face.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> but  make sure you buy it from ebay, from seller ichitrading.</li>
            <li> Missha perfect cover is better but this is a close 2nd place for me.</li>
            <li> along with my oily skin, i have many acne blemishes and scarring.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s OK for me because it looks so natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better SPF level.</li>
            <li> My skin looked more matte after applying.</li>
            <li> Okay SPF.</li>
            <li> :) But if you want more details, read further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I opened it and it was sealed, and then I looked up online more information about the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this - this is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Will order more when its needed.</li>
            <li> The SKIN79 BB cream is just ok to me.  </li>
            <li> but there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> and I can say my acne has gotten better.</li>
            <li> I am trying to look for ingredients so my pharmacist can look at them to make sure.</li>
            <li> That is why it goes on better by dabbing rather then applying like a moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> I just wish it had more ounces in bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the second BB Cream that I tried and it is the best!</li>
            <li> I feel so confident and am blown away by what i see</li>
            <li> I do like that the product is authentic and has the authentic skin79 sticker on it</li>
            <li> This product has great coverage and is really mattifying.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for summer time use especially on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> i just received this in the mail 20 minutes ago and already I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> So once I was sure, I felt safe to put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to love BB creams.</li>
            <li> I also love it because it evens out my skin tone automatically.</li>
            <li> Please Try It Out &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> so I was even MORE scared.</li>
            <li> and the product was still authentic</li>
            <li> I think that my order is 100% authentic now, because everything else on the bottle is authentic, and on the packaging too.</li>
            <li> They also included free samples!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I give it four stars because I still haven&#x27;t tested the product, even though I have concluded it is authentic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad i did.</li>
            <li> love AMAZON. :)</li>
            <li> love it and shipping</li>
            <li> Foundation is okay for me</li>
            <li> and I ended up just putting more makeup over it anyway.</li>
            <li> and im really glad I did.</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, 5-star kind-of love.</li>
            <li> I used three pumps (more is always better</li>
            <li> If you still want some more coverage / correct color match, use a powder&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> If anybody has a suggestion of a better BB Cream, please let me know.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all (and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months already!), and gives a good light-medium coverage that I&#x27;m extremely happy with.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover all blemishes and scars but it will cover mostly some of them.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about the BB cream, but this is actually the best product.</li>
            <li> I notice on the packaging it has soo many signs</li>
            <li> Of course that opened my eyes to the dozens of different BB creams offered, and of course I wanted to choose the best one.</li>
            <li> seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So go ahead and purchase and jump on this BB bandwagon. :)</li>
            <li> :) WHOOP WHOOP</li>
            <li> One more note, my mom bought this as well, but she is a tan brunette and the color</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of their products..</li>
            <li> so most days can just use this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> nose and cheeks--and have a more finished look as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but its ways better than drugstore bb</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> One lighter color-changing foundation, one heavier foundation on top and then concealer on that if needed.  </li>
            <li> I am buying more now just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this BB cream</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> and like i love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I brush on powder foundation lightly and went it lasted all day!</li>
            <li> I love the bb creams from skin79...</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It does all I wanted and so much more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> love it . :)</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I did not apply lotion on my skin for many years because it always made my face oily and then would break out.</li>
            <li> I tried many products out the for my pore problem and it just never work.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered tis product .</li>
            <li> /&gt;WIll not use anything else from now on :)</li>
            <li> I love this BB</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I used bronzed on top to help my skin look more like me.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Not cakey AT ALL unlike most foundations</li>
            <li> Smells cute</li>
            <li> I love the coverage and the way it goes on my skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on feeling more like a moisturizer than a foundation.</li>
            <li> Even my mother asked me to order it for her, so it works perfectly the same way for the skin over 40 as it does for the skin around 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am most satisfied.</li>
            <li> Im a more Yellowstone skin color.</li>
            <li> Thamks:)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People have also commented on how my skin has improved and looks more radiant since I have been wearing this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> do wear a moisturizer and transparent powder on top to help with wear.</li>
            <li> My favorite product.</li>
            <li> , i tried so many BB cream, and this one ,skin79 is on my top list</li>
            <li> I like how the product applies, but I wish it was more pigmented</li>
            <li> This is it for me :)</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this cream doesn&#x27;t make your face look like made up.  </li>
            <li> not too many imperfections (this is not a concealer)&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> I agree with most 5 star reviews written here.</li>
            <li> I used it on top of Clinique moisture surge and it worked better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it how it blends with my skin and makes my face look whiter</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> you are concerned about wrinkles I have to say that I have had interesting results from the inside out.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this product, i will order it again.</li>
            <li> I want to be so in love with this product.</li>
            <li> This BB is much better than the U.S &amp;#34;brands&amp;#34; (which are just tinted moisturizers).</li>
            <li> I like this creme much more than the Missha M.</li>
            <li> I love that it covers so well without looking like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li> I tried both this and MISSHA M Perfect Cover (No 21), and I&#x27;ve been told by multiple people that this one looks better.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Waaaaaaaay better than any BB Creams or tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve seen at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I think every female needs to find the perfect BB cream for herself.</li>
            <li> just i love it</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> It controls the oils on my skin and gives me a matte yet healthy finish.</li>
            <li> I chose this bb cream because I was looking for a more affordable alternative to my $50 foundation for days when I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> my makeup on top and in a couple of hours my face was oily.</li>
            <li> I found this as a high-rated alternative &amp; am so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than foundation.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better.  </li>
            <li> The 2 Korean BB creams were better in terms of texture, fragrance and end results.</li>
            <li> I love how it nourishes your skin and provides SPF 25.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth, non-greasy feel to it and it soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother, softer, and more even.</li>
            <li> and I was impressed with the overall look to my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Also, I like the dispenser, not just because it looks nice in your medicine cabinet, but it also does a good job controlling how much product is dispensed.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit to oxidize to the right color, but once it does, it&#x27;s ok matching wise.</li>
            <li> the packaging of the bottle is very unique and i love it.</li>
            <li> I had previously really loved another BB Cream, which I still do love, but this BB cream is now my new favorite!</li>
            <li> 75 minutes later, I am astonished to say that this product (mostly) stayed put!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to have it and recommend to those with skin imperfections</li>
            <li> My mom who is very fair, my sister who is toasty colored, my aunt who is sienna, and my very tan self all get full coverage from this product.</li>
            <li> If an area needs more coverage, you can dab more BB Cream on the area without the spot becoming cakey or sticky.</li>
            <li> Best part is that you don&#x27;t have to figure out what color will match your skin because it pretty much matches it for you.</li>
            <li> Got here pretty fast in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> You can still see my freckles (depending on whether you&#x27;re proud to don those or not, and if not, use a little of your foundation on top to cover them, this bb cream works great as a primer :))</li>
            <li> You can still see my freckles (depending on whether you&#x27;re proud to don those or not, and if not, use a little of your foundation on top to cover them, this bb cream works great as a primer :))</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s very easy to put on, the smell is fantastic, improves skin color immediately.</li>
            <li> so I have nothing to compare it to, but I love how easily it goes on and blends in, evens out my skin tone, and I love that it has SPF in it.  </li>
            <li> skin felt super soft and looked flawless!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing my best to get everyone I know to try Skin79 BB creams because they really do end up having a positive effect on your skin.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t advocate which I find more attractive, for I do believe that the majority of what we consider beautiful is relative and cultural; but, I will say that I advocate preserving my own skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li> The best thing about is that it makes my skin look really smooth and natural since the cream is really light</li>
            <li> I bought this one first and loved it</li>
            <li> I hydrate my skin first with a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin</li>
            <li> I loved this product from the first time I put it on.  </li>
            <li> It has pretty good coverage (covers hyper pigmentation and under eye circles)</li>
            <li> It provides a pretty good amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on how to tell fakes from real bottles, and this (to the best of my knowledge) is most definitely real.</li>
            <li> The coverage was pretty good.</li>
            <li> After using this BB cream twice, I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> but what I am pretty good about is putting on</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I will love Lioele Beyond the Solution as well but if not I&#x27;ll update this review!  :)</li>
            <li> But its definately worth it!!</li>
            <li> The longevity was the best part as I have oily skin and nothing lasts very long.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is great for when you don&#x27;t  want a heavy foundation, great for day wear, at the beach etc.</li>
            <li> It just works perfect with dry and oily skin</li>
            <li> but after I gave it a moment to dry it was perfect!  </li>
            <li> The customer service (Katie The Babe) was quick and so kind.</li>
            <li> I easily spread it evenly over my face and it comes off as a more luminous complexion.</li>
            <li> (try something with more moisturizer) as the oil-absorbing properties are quite strong.</li>
            <li> I luckily passed this product while researching and read nothing but amazing reviews.</li>
            <li> I would recommend setting it with a powder though, since it&#x27;s super creamy and has a tendency to kind of slide around.</li>
            <li> It just looks all-around healthy, matte, even, and bright.</li>
            <li> and i dont need that much coverge, so for what i wanted is perfect my face looks very even</li>
            <li> This had incredible coverage and left my skin looking healthy, moisturized, and glowing.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money, I really love this product!   </li>
            <li> As being someone who aspires to travel one day, it goes without saying that I am interested in just about every culture outside of the US&#x27;s borders (no offense to my own country :P) and have always loved Europe and Asia.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful BB cream for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have light yellow/olive undertones, in the summer tan somewhat easy (on top of using self tanners), but keep a pretty fair complexion in winter months.</li>
            <li> I bought this bb cream mainly because I read so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> All in all:&lt;br /&gt;-light, but very full coverage</li>
            <li> Etude House Precious Mineral #13 is a bit light for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fabulous, just be sure to treat it like makeup and wash it off before you go to sleep. :</li>
            <li> Now it IS more of a light coverage</li>
            <li> I bought the variety pack containing a bunch of samples of BB Cream by SKIN79 and ended up liking the Pink Label best.</li>
            <li> Light on the skin and does not leave a \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; feel that most make up does.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control more now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light, I love the scent.</li>
            <li> to use, works great at covering up acne and redness near my chin and forehead.  </li>
            <li> but I rather pay more and have a piece of mind than be cheap and pay for it with my face.</li>
            <li> i love this foundation, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, but still looks natural.</li>
            <li> This cream has a lovely light floral scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but nothing fantastic.</li>
            <li> But it applied so smoothly and it matched my fair skin tone exactly.  </li>
            <li> have a couple of other BB creams coming for my experimentation (Boots Beautiful Skin &amp; Loreal Magic Skin Beautifier) before I settle on a winner!</li>
            <li> In many ways it is fantastic</li>
            <li> Also be sure to use a light moisterizer before hand, I use cetaphil.</li>
            <li> This was not my first BB cream and maybe if it was, I would have liked it more.</li>
            <li> but I will stick to my wonderful pink bottle.  </li>
            <li> It goes on really smooth and moisturizes better than the diamond bb cream.</li>
            <li> Light weight, doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes or hand, Im so in love with Skin79 products,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything drastic as far as changes but it has great coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing makeup much more now since I have been wearing BB cream.</li>
            <li> I love that I can just smooth one pump on my face and go without spending forever on makeup.</li>
            <li> It arrived A LOT sooner than I expected, which was awesome.</li>
            <li> So I did a check one life for the best bb cream and pink came up.</li>
            <li> Pink is the best</li>
            <li> I have beginning wrinkles that are becoming invisible.</li>
            <li> However the pink is awesome too</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a superthick incredible cream for my face that makes me look 5 years younger.</li>
            <li> had ordered a sample pack of skin79&#x27;s bb creams (pink, gold, orange, snail) and wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with any of them.</li>
            <li> It really is quite mind boggling how good my skin looks wearing this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream seems to have a very neutral undertone, so would be a good balancer for people with pinkish undertones like myself.</li>
            <li> So if you want to buy a good knockoff then buy this one but realize it&#x27;s not the really thing.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin and the cream looked so dark, but it blended perfectly AND it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have clay on my face as my husband would put</li>
            <li> I loved the coverage on it though and it blended to my skin shade very well and was moisturizing and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> My skin looks really nice, no wrinkles, and I rarely break out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;probably those good reviews are paid to say that it works, because to real people&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought that this product sounded too good to be true and I was right.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-- Light and airy and easy to apply and blend - I love he way</li>
            <li> , the Gold for dry (ideal for winter season, as many reviewers have said), and the Orange falls between the two.</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle it is slightly grey but blends nicely into skin and leaves a very nice finish.  </li>
            <li> I am 38 years old with very light fair skin</li>
            <li> But i am a true believer now!</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t even need a full pump!)</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product, and was able to use a pea-sized amount 3 times before the bottle stopped dispensing.</li>
            <li> (your face won&#x27;t have a perfect matte finish all day but you won&#x27;t be extremely shiny</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually not bad!  </li>
            <li> Product special and beautiful, and works well with the natural skin has no effect</li>
            <li> almost see-through so redness is not something I can really easily hide.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It provides great coverage when you dab it on, but I have to wear a lot of blush to get any color back in my face, and that just makes me look even more like a porcelain doll.</li>
            <li> The texture is not too watery or matte and it glides onto skin easily and blends well..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also made my skin break out easily.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is easy to apply, non sticky.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use and the gray color will blend with the skin so don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li> Then, the bottle ran out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> Seller was very quick with my order.</li>
            <li> Despite needing to wait to find out if there is any actual change to the texture and tone of my skin, I am happy to use this product as a healthier replacement for my foundation and am looking forward to seeing more changes as I continue to wear Skin79.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this should be easily solved with some strategically applied moisturizer (I wasn&#x27;t using any at the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that the Pink Label&#x27;s more for those with oily skin (ideal for the summer)</li>
            <li> /&gt;• Spreads easily</li>
            <li> I suspect that it would be easy to think of this as a lotion and not bother washing it</li>
            <li> I suspect that it would be easy to think of this as a lotion and not bother washing it</li>
            <li> it glides on easily</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as foundation</li>
            <li> but this product makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get flaky or clumpy or rub off easily, yet it blends well.  </li>
            <li> The cream is mostly suited for light light medium.</li>
            <li> Easy to use container</li>
            <li> Ever since I got this I uses it every day, so easy to apply</li>
            <li> It does rub off easily, the up side to that</li>
            <li> is that is washes off easily too</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a sent.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> maybe like Vaseline intensive care, but STRONG, as I may have</li>
            <li> Great stuff but only for light to very light skin types.</li>
            <li> This product works great on people with fair skin, and if I do get a tan, it makes me look pale.</li>
            <li> I apply this product for special occasions and outings and it makes me feel so confident.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed right now that I am utterly speechless.</li>
            <li> but I felt it was important to point out that this product can and does work miracles for the right kind of skin type and tone.</li>
            <li> It smooths the texture of my skin especially my large pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that this helps it adjust to many other skin tones beyond those of us who are very fair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this, I like it, nice color and easy to apply</li>
            <li> I purchased my amazing BB cream from Think Pretty and after research, figured out that the BB cream they sell is indeed legit.  </li>
            <li> no regrets LOL</li>
            <li> The BB cream is pretty nice, and this is for my wife.</li>
            <li> so this was my first dip into this kind of product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so flawless and smooth and it perfects to wear it as it is without to put any other make up on it.</li>
            <li> (I heard it was one of the first popular BB cream in Korea).</li>
            <li> and it has the SPF too, which is really nice ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m your average girl who tried this after a chance encounter and a lot of reading of reviews online, and I am telling you that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m your average girl who tried this after a chance encounter and a lot of reading of reviews online, and I am telling you that I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> It looks a liittle gray at first, but blends nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it when temps were in the 80&#x27;s and humid and am delighted that my shiny break-through (normally happens within a couple of hours) never did occur.</li>
            <li> The packaging of this product is good and stays relatively clean and the pump is very convenient.</li>
            <li> For those of us who have tan skin, a BB cream may seem like an iffy makeup product, but this particular BB cream seems to oxidize to fit just about any ivory fair to caramel tan skin tone.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hands down the best BB Cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream I have tried, hands down.</li>
            <li> other than that, she loves it! :D</li>
            <li> I had better coverage, felt like the cover matched better and didn&#x27;t notice any fragrance unlike the Garnier, which had a pretty strong medicine-y odor.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I love the idea of BB creams and own many cult favorite asian BB creams.</li>
            <li> Laneige is a great skin care line with toners and lotions that I have recently become obsessed with and goes great with this BB cream to provide great skin all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally fair skinned, but I live in the desert and have a bit of a tan.</li>
            <li> They all go on every smooth and easy to blend (I use stippling brush).  </li>
            <li> I have been testing this one out for a couple of weeks now and my skin is doing just fine.</li>
            <li> This brightens them up without settling in the fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It has light/medium coverage and does not highlight fine lines or dryness.  </li>
            <li> but I notice at times my fine lines/</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> I do not need shimmer or glitter settling into my fine lines.</li>
            <li> For spring this bbcream has been fine.</li>
            <li> but this will work fine for me during the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FINE</li>
            <li> Easy to use    leaves skin smooth    </li>
            <li> Typically, I use &#x27;MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream No. 23&#x27; but decided to switch up my routine because I was breaking out.</li>
            <li> I brush on some powder after and it looks fine.</li>
            <li> Of course after a couple of pumps, it was fine again.</li>
            <li> I typically use BB Creams from The Face Shop, (example: HD Perfect BB Cream), and this works just as well as those.</li>
            <li> The best part is it doesn&#x27;t get oily even when it&#x27;s really hot outside</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and smooth out</li>
            <li> into fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> but it has made a difference in fading any spots and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> and it would&#x27;ve done just fine.</li>
            <li> you can just put a darker powder over it and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a bit lighter and sheerer than the Gold Label, though it goes on just as smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li> color is probably best for those with neutral skin tones but works pretty well for yellow.</li>
            <li> I do a quick check in the mirror to make sure that I don&#x27;t have the mask effect going on before I step into the building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super!  </li>
            <li> Also, it shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> For those with more severe acne scarring or dark circles, I would recommend using a concealer over the top, but even without the product has great coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing (I&#x27;ve noticed better skin since I started using it!) and works very well as sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> but this is my very first, after hearing many of my friends rave and rave about it.</li>
            <li> First of all the shipper is SO fast, and the packages were perfect and this is 100% REAL, the comments that say \\&quot;fake,fake\\&quot; are probably people trying to get you to purchase their over priced BB creams, this has the seal of authenticity and Korean barcode&#x27;s,</li>
            <li> My skin is looking good now not shady.</li>
            <li> Some warned of scams, others that this one was great for their combination skin, or better for dry skin, etc.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good product with smooth application and pretty good coverage.  </li>
            <li> It was a great color match but it filled in my \\&quot;dry skin micro cracks\\&quot; making it appear as though I had more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The color does come a bit light, but it somewhat works out for me fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order some more very  soon !!</li>
            <li> I put a little finishing powder over it, and my skin looks awesome.</li>
            <li> On the skin79 website, there is this little test of sorts that you can take to see which of their products is the best for you.  </li>
            <li> So this is perfect with a little concealer.</li>
            <li> It looks a little muddy and gray going on but soon blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very fair with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin (basically not pale and not tan), so I figured this stuff would work well for me with it&#x27;s blending properties (or whatever), but eh not so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my pores look huge and let me tell you</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of BB cream.</li>
            <li> it leaves the face loking like porceline is really amazing; it givs a soft look to the face more glowing</li>
            <li> Plus I work in the sun all day and the sunscreen aspect is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> My skin look natural and smooth and bright up my face</li>
            <li> I have huge pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but still i was happy to have received it, for some reason the consistency was not the same as i had remembered</li>
            <li> For light coverage, Skin 79.  </li>
            <li> no wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, this product is definitely worth every penny :]</li>
            <li> Coverage is light to medium.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try its affordable compared to many foundations and lotions and the bottle lasts awhile.  </li>
            <li> used coconut oil for moisturizing, stippled the cream with a Sigma flat-top brush and finished with a light brushing of mineral powder and blush.  </li>
            <li> or if you enjoy trial and error shade matching attempts.</li>
            <li> One thing worth mention is that, I found out apply it with finger is better than using the brush.</li>
            <li> it was way too light, but I let it sit and hoped that it would adjust to my skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is a light tan with a gray tint</li>
            <li> It covers like a foundation but with light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I bought this off of ebay since it was cheaper and free shipping.</li>
            <li> -It makes my face smooth after</li>
            <li> I do love the smooth, lotion-like texture of the cream, it has a nice scent and leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It oxidizes on the skin, so if you have really light skin on your face</li>
            <li> My color is like a light tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently decided to  jump on the BB Cream bandwagon and I am happy I did.</li>
            <li> But with such a great price I decided to give it a whirl</li>
            <li> its gives u great coverage withiout feeling cackey and at the same time mosturize!!</li>
            <li> Light fragrance (floral).&lt;br /&gt;BB Creams are NOT meant to replace sunscreen</li>
            <li> Now that I have told you everything about my skin that is important, lets get to the review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is extremely important.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control</li>
            <li> light to med skin Korean</li>
            <li> then a light foundation on every morning!SKIN 79 is the answer</li>
            <li> But overall, I am so happy with this product</li>
            <li> Just great stuff overall.</li>
            <li> It blends beautfifully, and is so easy to clean off...</li>
            <li> I have light, oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> But, at the risk of being redundant:  This product is great!!!  </li>
            <li> The soap is cheap but the toner is on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> Worth a shot if you&#x27;ve tried everything else &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I adore this product and the price was fantastic for me.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wrinkle Improvement\\&quot; instead of Wrinkle Free.</li>
            <li> Not so great for me personally because of the color.</li>
            <li> and it is light weight.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and covers the flaws.</li>
            <li> The color is fairly light though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just going to be too light.</li>
            <li> It is of light  consistency.....</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and covers any imperfections I may have.</li>
            <li> , the color was okay for my light beige skin (yellow undertone).&lt;br /&gt;It looks good just by itself, but sometimes I touch up with foundation if I am out on a date or at night.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I also go free Misha samples...</li>
            <li> It was smooth and didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Light coverage    </li>
            <li> (light yet</li>
            <li> The coverage is fantastic and I saw a noticeable difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase again because the color is too light.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Skin appears smooth and even&lt;</li>
            <li> I just blot with a tissue sometimes before applying a light layer of powder.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t really like it when I wear any kind of makeup</li>
            <li> I found out that product for Korean distributors say wrinkle improvement, while for US distributors it says wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping my skin will adjust because this product feels AMAZING on my skin</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t know it came with 2 free samples in the package which was a surprise to her and me but</li>
            <li> My complexion is caramel , the BB cream that I got was too light for my complexion .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> it felt like my skin was light and airy.</li>
            <li> it felt like my skin was light and airy.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes your skin so smooth and gives you a porcelain skin look.</li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY FACE SMOOTH</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important that you pay attention to the color.  </li>
            <li> Overall GREAT product.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper than the MAC foundation I had been using, feels amazing and doesn&#x27;t look like you are wearing any makeup on your skin.</li>
            <li> They also give me free bb cream samples</li>
            <li> It truly does perfect and even the skin tone of your face and without being heavy or looking like a mask.  </li>
            <li> The product portion could literally fit 4 dimes.</li>
            <li> The color was way to light for me.</li>
            <li> but if you just give it a minute or 2, it blends smooth and will match to skin tone.</li>
            <li> Its great to me because it is just so simple</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to me to have my sellers located in the U.S. so that it doesn&#x27;t take forever for something to reach me from overseas</li>
            <li> I prefer make-up free look with sun protection.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s an overall great product and 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> I do not desire a tan, either, which is important to note if you want to use this product because it has whitening agents and spf 25.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a great deal, especially compared to the smashbox and sephora store ones.</li>
            <li> This BB cream goes on really smooth and seems to soak up oils.</li>
            <li> but I believed it was too light and that it looked that I used two shades lighter on my face and it was a bit  grey-ish</li>
            <li> so cheap- compared to Dr.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> a day on my face, a great improvement over my former 3-4 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels so amazing on skin and has not broken me out.</li>
            <li> I am a tan complextion and it was extremely light on me, I had to blend it with my foundation.  </li>
            <li> But it is so light.</li>
            <li> Great price, especially for the size of the product.</li>
            <li> Coverage is amazing and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Light weight</li>
            <li> However, if any of my traits sound like you, try this, try this, try this.</li>
            <li> However, if any of my traits sound like you, try this, try this, try this.</li>
            <li> I like light coverage</li>
            <li> It is light and keeps me almost oil free all day.</li>
            <li> Will be fabulous for the fall and winter.</li>
            <li> It feels light</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a great bb cream, you should definitely buy this one!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The next day wasn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li> It really looks like no makeup and feels nice on (even in 85% humidity weather).ation</li>
            <li> It really looks like no makeup and feels nice on (even in 85% humidity weather).</li>
            <li> dot this on my skin , then use a makeup sponge to lightly spread all over my face.</li>
            <li> I finished off the look with a light dusting of blush and was amazed.  </li>
            <li> As for now, thank you Skin79 and the sellers for making this product available to people not in Korea</li>
            <li> Light, even coverage.</li>
            <li> It helps smooth over imperfections and works to nourish/</li>
            <li> the best bb cream ever and its authentic!i sooo love this and will never go back to my old moisturizer!thanks pinkgelee</li>
            <li> It is truly a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> am Caucasian with a light tan/olive complexion that tends to be oily in my t-zone.</li>
            <li> And the product was genuine (which I know is a huge concern for us Amazon shoppers) trustworthy seller</li>
            <li> This is my second day using it and it feels so great and goes on creamy (i use my fingers).</li>
            <li> Such a great price to include shipping.</li>
            <li> Smooth texture on skin</li>
            <li> Coverage is not too light, not too heavy (Perfect for me because I have light acne scars)&lt;br</li>
            <li> (i make sure to not put any around my laugh</li>
            <li> The moment I got it, it covered my blemishes and made my skin feel really light.</li>
            <li> I saw such great reviews I had to try this BB cream.</li>
            <li> This product feels light on the skin, and manages to wear well through the work day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice bottle ,and very even, not oily</li>
            <li> Quite light weight for my oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t like it because I feel cheap wearing it</li>
            <li> but this is excellent for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I am fairly light</li>
            <li> There is no smell to it (something I prefer) and the coverage is light to medium, which is what BB&#x27;s should be.</li>
            <li> The product makes my skin look dewey, gives medium coverage, and feels really comfortable.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll probably stick with this seller if buying from Amazon (unless I see guarantees else where that it is genuine).</li>
            <li> It feels light and keep the makeup in place, even when I sweat.  </li>
            <li> Skin79 states this product is not oil free but is non-comedogenic (this is not mentioned on their website but a representative on their facebook page confirmed).</li>
            <li> Now its coverage is light to medium.</li>
            <li> It provides light coverage with a dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foundation is gave me skin smooth and moisturizer all day</li>
            <li> To set it, I used the Skin79 Oriental Smooth Sun BB pact powder.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t praise this product enough, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my face!</li>
            <li> friend told me I looks young and my face skin looks so good ,I can&#x27;t help myself and told her what I used.</li>
            <li> At first the cream has a grey tint to it, but after blended (and patted) onto the skin, it matches perfectly!</li>
            <li> This product actually adjusts really well, covers blemishes, and moisturizes :D</li>
            <li> I loved this BB cream and used up my entire bottle, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I loved how it gave a matte effect, made my skin soft and had staying power</li>
            <li> and they disappear so far so good with this one.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t meant for full coverage, but most of the time I don&#x27;t need full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My skin type is &amp;#34;Angry&amp;#34; and oily -- most makeup / skin care products are vetoed via breakouts (good o&#x27;ll fashion zits + cystic), burning sensations, giant blackheads, redness, etc.</li>
            <li> complexion is fair with neutral undertones and my natural hair color is/was medium auburn.</li>
            <li> Garnier and Skin79 is, by far, a superior product.  </li>
            <li> but the product is good for people with sensitive skin, and it is most likely for people with really light fair skin.</li>
            <li> The gray ashiness that you first get right after application oxidizes within 15 minutes to a beautiful finish that matches my skin tone really well.  </li>
            <li> As of right now I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t use an oil mattifier for the first time in years!!</li>
            <li> , just go to their website and oredr a real one!!!</li>
            <li> I REALLY SUGGEST YOU TO GET THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Forgot to note at the top that I have always had very large pores.  </li>
            <li> when the huge rave for BB creams began spreading around the US, of course I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but recently someone commented on how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> i loved this product very much it looks very natural&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> I started receiving compliments about how smooth and clean my skin was.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried the pink first and was really happy with it but wish I had tried the gold first because I liked it even better on my skin.</li>
            <li> When applied it matches my normal overall look perfectly.</li>
            <li> At first glance mines seem to be ok, but if you place it under the light it does look like the tampered image they show you.</li>
            <li> But SKIN79 (hot pink) has been so awesome for my skin.  </li>
            <li> No negative reactions etc... I need to purchase some more soon :-)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to use a full pump, and it covered my whole face nicely.</li>
            <li> (very fair with pink undertones) quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> This product has met and exceeded all of my expectations and is my new favorite make-up product!</li>
            <li> Make sure when you put it on dont use very much.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with freckles, this color was a bit too dark, even after blending&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> It came with 2-day shipping (well, I have Amazon prime), and best of all, the product was authentic, and the cream was taken from a new batch, due to expire in Nov 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with mild acne and have been looking for a good cover up.    </li>
            <li> This makeup is super creamy with fabulous coverage , light and airy texture.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about the bb cream movement</li>
            <li> BB cream significantly reduced the oiliness of my nose and even my forehead.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today so excited to try the HYPE.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it only for people with light or fair skin color because it has a light tint.</li>
            <li> Missha was the first BB cream I tried, and I thought it was okay</li>
            <li> If you go to their website it will show you the difference between an original sticker and a tampered one.</li>
            <li> the orange one seems it might be better for her skin, as it has higher SPF and she has a lot of sun spots on her</li>
            <li> I was excited to get a package from korea</li>
            <li> I love it so much I even offer to buy their bottle from them if they don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> I really love this product and feel pretty on my face.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a nice BB cream, most fit for BB cream newbies.</li>
            <li> the cream is thicker like the original one.</li>
            <li> When my product arrived I was so excited to tried it on.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it would hold up in humid conditions or while sweating, but it&#x27;s perfect for cooler weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought from the seller PinkGelee&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in about a week or so, an authentic product, not a fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one who was particularly excited for the BB creams in the US.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly cover it that you can&#x27;t see it; it sort of evens out those areas to give my face a more even skin tone, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it on and immediately washed my face and squirted some BB cream onto my fingertips.</li>
            <li> The whitening feature did help my skin significantly.  </li>
            <li> I really love this stuff when I first got it</li>
            <li> I rated it 3 stars because I bet this one is original.</li>
            <li> All the original signs are found in this product as Ive searched for the signs in youtube.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with the coverage, and it was extremely buildable.</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty okay, not forever.</li>
            <li> This product is best in SMALL amounts.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Has a color that is too light for me, has a sweet smell that I can not wear would not buy again</li>
            <li> I looked like, and felt like, Casper the friendly ghost and resolved to figure out what I was doing wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Glad I decided to go with this as my first choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Think Pretty sells authentic products and has *</li>
            <li> and I RARELY get pimples!  </li>
            <li> , I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used it every day and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Now many months later, I still absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY, even better than my foundation.</li>
            <li> This cream helped to fade years worth of acne scars!</li>
            <li> but I apply a bit of loose mineral powder on top of it and it blend really good with my skin tone</li>
            <li> As previously mentioned, I&#x27;m very fair and my neck does match my face</li>
            <li> The coverage is light, so I do put concealer in certain areas that need more coverage.</li>
            <li> The coverage could be a little more, but I&#x27;ve found that putting some mineral makeup over this works great.</li>
            <li> So I was very excited to receive my first BB cream.  </li>
            <li> First pump it was very rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited as this is my first BB cream</li>
            <li> clean- not like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> and I see many young people use and love it as well.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and smooth and simply amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cheap, and the size is not small.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Would it match my super light skin well?</li>
            <li> The most amazing facial product I ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve given it five stars because it has a nice texture and does smooth the appearance of skin and makes it feel extremely soft</li>
            <li> a clean way.&lt;br /&gt;-It minimizes my pores.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is matte with a fresh dew though out the day and easy to wash off at night.</li>
            <li> yet it blends in perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leave a cakey finish like most others I have tired.</li>
            <li> it is cheaper than department store brands and the larger size makes it more cost effective than drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> Super light, I don&#x27;t feel cakey after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> Ordering from Pink Gellee was a good experience, and I&#x27;m hoping to be able to return the product for one without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin feels and looks fresh, with a beautiful matte finish all day long.</li>
            <li> Skin feels and looks fresh, with a beautiful matte finish all day long - Matte?</li>
            <li> It really does a good job with oil control for me, so I have not broken out since using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a good job with oil control and provides a nice coverage that isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li> After wearing Mary Kay&#x27;s Creme to Powder foundation for 14 years, I&#x27;ve switched to this because it&#x27;s much more natural looking, has a high SPF and is good for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would not recommend this, however it seems many people have had positive experiences with it.  </li>
            <li> I suppose that might make me more sensitive to feeling \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; with any sort of product on, but I&#x27;m happy to say that Skin79 barely feels like anything at all.</li>
            <li> Like this better than most bb creams but would like a little more coverage but is better than foundation will buy again</li>
            <li> This thing stays matte the whole day and my skin is super oily!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, but covers very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pretty excited to try it out!</li>
            <li> Really happy with this BB cream i like it much better than the new drugstore ones that have recently come out like the ones by Maybelline and Loreal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the age where they say less is more as far as foundation; this BB cream gives perfect, undetectable coverage.</li>
            <li> Like I&#x27;ve said, I have tried many other BB creams, even ones made for oily skin, but nothing has made my skin feel good like this one.</li>
            <li> It offers great, natural coverage; it&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and worried this would make me break out, but I have been using it for 4 weeks now and can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this.</li>
            <li> The coverage was ok, not as good as other products I have used</li>
            <li> skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am light to fair skinned, Caucasian, and I have always had mild to moderate acne with some days no breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just nothing too special.</li>
            <li> nothing really special.</li>
            <li> I wore it on a winter vacation to Hawaii instead of sunscreen most days with a large floppy hat without any problems.  </li>
            <li> I hope this works for me bec its a headache trying to find the right concealer/foundation for my oily skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hispanic and on the tan side and this bb cream blends right in!</li>
            <li> It has a great velvety thick texture that blends and covers very easily without looking caked on or flaked.  </li>
            <li> I used my fingertips to pat it on and had a pretty flawless finish after setting it with a little mineral powder.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is great for someone like me who uses minimal makeup.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my daily routine so much easier with beautiful results.</li>
            <li> And I have to say that the results so far are amazing.</li>
            <li> Honestly the american brands really can&#x27;t compete with the amazingness of the korean BB&#x27;s they are far superior:)</li>
            <li> Immediately, my skin felt soft &amp; silky AND looked amazing</li>
            <li> Too Face gives a dewy/sheer/natural look and good for yellow tone</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff...</li>
            <li> I love it so much after a week, I am ordering another because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for full coverage, check into another BB cream.</li>
            <li> when i got this bb cream,i really like the color of the bottle,so cute</li>
            <li> I used it as a primer for my foundation and loved it, making my foundation go on smoother and last longer.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s also true that they&#x27;ll eventually blend to match your skin color.  </li>
            <li> Me and my sister have been using this Bebliesh Balm for not even a full week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true it does have a grayish tint to it</li>
            <li> Cool product.</li>
            <li> I have a face full of freckles from all my burns.  </li>
            <li> so if you are looking for something with full coverage this is probably not for you.</li>
            <li> what better way to do so than to buy it straight from the source in Korea</li>
            <li> When I want to wear \\&quot;real make-up\\&quot;, I love Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Maestro--it is pricey, but with foundation I believe you get what you pay for.)</li>
            <li> as i tought, but still keeps me very haooy :)</li>
            <li> Bare Minimum Pressed Powder for a more skin-like natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Lioele Triple the Solution BB Cream out of curiosity, and after applying it on my skin I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful my skin looks!  </li>
            <li> I have decided to buy the BB cream straight from the Skin79 website just to be sure</li>
            <li> Being able to buy one product at a reasonable price will save me a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It provides good coverage, makes your skin tone look even, matches my skin tone, and it has even improved my overall skin tone.</li>
            <li> (wore it for full 8 hours for 4days) but the noticeable color difference bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> much as I would like to love this product, it just isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> There are many reviews on here saying it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> even I have a mixed complexion and it doesn&#x27;t look good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I am coming to buy more now, and you can see how much I like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the Red bottle is good for oily skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Full coverage.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold up well to sweet.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really a problem in the winter, but there is no way I would be able to wear this in the summer if I&#x27;m planning on spending time</li>
            <li> Okay, I really wanted this cream to work.</li>
            <li> It feels cool and moist on my skin and keeps me protected from UV rays.</li>
            <li> Nice matching color with my skin, and texture of the cream is far smoother than the one that I used.</li>
            <li> For good coverage, the amount of foundation you&#x27;ll need (and keep needing, if you need to keep applying it throughout the day to cover imperfections) can be massive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it does not lasts a full day&#x27;s work.</li>
            <li> Japanese products are good.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all good the next day.</li>
            <li> so i decided to get the full size.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Even after wearing it for a good portion of the day my face isn&#x27;t as oily as when I used to wear regular foundation.</li>
            <li> Plus, the BB felt like a nice, soft lotion, not at all like makeup or US brand</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have many blemishes, scars, or the like, so I don&#x27;t require too much coverage.</li>
            <li> My goal was to find a BB cream that was good for my skin but looks like an air brushed finish like I had as a model.</li>
            <li> I had read in a magazine that bb cream not only was good for pores but your over all skin care.</li>
            <li> U will need to use an oil absorbing powder on top of this.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it really does work to even skin tone and give your complexion a healthy, dewy look.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good BB cream.</li>
            <li> does have a gray tint to it as others have said and it was a bit of a turn off, but I read from others that you just have to blend it in which is true.</li>
            <li> I almost felt as if I didn&#x27;t even need additional foundation, but I do like full coverage for my acne scars</li>
            <li> It provides full coverage without feeling caked on.</li>
            <li> fair to medium complexion with yellow undertones&lt;</li>
            <li> It lasts for the whole day I have had it on for 12 hours or more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from seoul i think came in about 2 weeks not bad</li>
            <li> SURE YOU WASH THAT STUFF OFF COMPLETELY!!!</li>
            <li> the amount is pretty much easy to control because of the pump...</li>
            <li> BTW, I bought mine from Pink Gelee, it was the cheapest seller that sold to Canada and they were very courteous too</li>
            <li> The coverage is pretty good especially when I apply some power on top, it lasts all day even in a hot sweaty day.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love looking at your skin in your car vanity mirror with all the natural light- because for me that&#x27;s the true color match test.</li>
            <li> I heard alot of great reviews from other websites and I thought I go ahead and try it.</li>
            <li> Came in substandard packaging, but great considering it was shipped with other objects.</li>
            <li> Instead, it covered great, didn&#x27;t itch or make me breakout (which I think the other one may have -</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other BB creams so I cannot compare but this product is also great.</li>
            <li> That the bottle was pretty and that is was cheap are the only two good things I can say about this cream.</li>
            <li> My theory is if a little bit is good than mass quantities must better.  </li>
            <li> When I need more coverage, I prefer Missha M Perfect Cover, which doesn&#x27;t require quite as much building, but decent coverage can be achieved with this, with a little time.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference in the natural tone of my skin or wrinkles (then again I don&#x27;t really have many), but it works great as quick foundation.</li>
            <li> But seriously this is some great stuff!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for everyday because it feels super light.</li>
            <li> This cream has a light coverage but evens my skin tone and does not irritate or make my sensitive skin break out :)</li>
            <li> My skin is super oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li> also the shipping was super super</li>
            <li> I think this cream is great for young and old alike.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s why I love this particular BB</li>
            <li> but it does go away rather quickly.</li>
            <li> SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> my T-zone gets oily quick.</li>
            <li> My nose and around my nostrils have been super oily and are my number one problematic area and everything that I put doesn&#x27;t help, but not this BB</li>
            <li> , it is super creamy and</li>
            <li> and I set my BB cream with Maybelline Dream Matte Powder for a super matte finish or Sonia Kashuk</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re ok with using magical products, then definitely buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She recommend me to the Skin79 Super+.</li>
            <li> This product matched my tanned, Asian skin (I think I was a NW25) tone very well, and I don&#x27;t look like a geisha lol.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a couple days now, but I sure do love it.</li>
            <li> and my face gets super oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> received the product quickly.</li>
            <li> 5000 mcg, Super Potency, 120 Softgels]], and</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I received the Skin77 Super+</li>
            <li> Probably shoulda had more realistic expectations, but I&#x27;ll still keep using this.</li>
            <li> I am also getting older and noticing I need more moisture.  </li>
            <li> I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> This is only the second BB cream I have ever tried, but this is one of the best things that has ever happened to my beauty routine!  </li>
            <li> Super seller, Super quality bb cream.</li>
            <li> it helps, I ordered from pinkgelee, and their products are legitimate (they ship pretty quickly, too!).</li>
            <li> I found that with dabbing motion, as opposed wiping motion, the color corrects quite quickly and matches my skin tone</li>
            <li> , it has help tremendously with my acne.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my quick and dirty:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> American bb creams are more like a tinted moisturizer, while Korean bb creams are a magical make up wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is light, and depending on how much sun I&#x27;ve gotten can range from an ivory to a light nude color.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll hopefully have a link up to my website with further information and before/after pictures for you to look at. :)and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I also have never had a problem getting pregnant and since using this product we have been trying for another child and regardless of what we do we can&#x27;t get pregnant.</li>
            <li> And if my cycles normalize and I get pregnant quickly then I will stop using this product.</li>
            <li> like quick effortless makeup</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and will buy more from the same seller once I run out.</li>
            <li> SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> It shipped quick, too.</li>
            <li> The coverage is awesome, it definitely minimizes pores which is especially noticeable in the creases of my nose.  </li>
            <li> But I was lucky with this one.</li>

            <li> I take it off at night with a mild cleanser</li>
            <li> was amazingly quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been super into make up.</li>
            <li> SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> no touching up.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the bargain hunters on babycenter for this amazing find! :)</li>
            <li> The texture of this product is pretty light, smooth on nicely, however, applying moisturizer prior to this product is recommended.</li>
            <li> im puerto rican and italian and am pretty light but have yellow undertones and this just matched my skin perfect</li>
            <li> After just two weeks I can already see that my old acne scars are disappearing right before my eyes and my skin is supple and clearer than its been since puberty!!!</li>
            <li> On a good skin day i can wear just this with a little blush and mascara for a flawless everyday look.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time because I read so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> And the price for this is amazing, :O</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute, definitely icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> I do go ahead and put a light layer of moisturizer on my face first.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product is awesome and may just replace my foundation routine completely.</li>
            <li> Since today is my first day of using this fantastic product I cannot vouch for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light, and i had hoped it would darken to my skin color.</li>
            <li> I must add a foundation on top that is darker than my normal skin color to cover up this whiteness.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to purchase my very first BB cream.</li>
            <li> Shipping was VERY fast!</li>
            <li> There was also an almost pearly luminescent quality to the overall look of my skin, which made it look very healthy.</li>
            <li> There was also an almost pearly luminescent quality to the overall look of my skin, which made it look very healthy.</li>
            <li> First of all,I did enjoy the intial look it gave.</li>
            <li> It glides on so very smoothly and leaves my face feeling very, very soft.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a bit worried that it was going to be really light.</li>
            <li> I have had a normal cycle almost to the hour for many years now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the color may seem light at first, it does transition to your skin color quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It really didn’t fit my skin , although I was so excited to try it .</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s not a natural skin color for a caucasian woman, even with fair skin.  </li>
            <li> doesnt do a good coverage at all and also a bit grey on the skin.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes it matches your skin beautifully.</li>
            <li> I have combination, medium toned asian skin, and this product is great at keeping my skin moisturized and even-toned without being too oily, plus it has a decent SPF.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I went down this route.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I went down this route.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one is great for keeping sebum production down.</li>
            <li> Overall, this BB cream comes with very cute packaging, very convenience and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> Since I have had more disappointing than good experiences with those products, I started wondering if I should have invested in something a bit more top of the line.</li>
            <li> I have the oiliest skin ever and would normally need to blot every 2 hours and if its hot every hour!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly found most of the local BB creams to be nothing more than tinted moisturizers, with the exception of the Clinique version which is a little better.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for something that looks natural, not too heavy and that is actually good for your skin then this product is for you! :)</li>
            <li> the years I&#x27;ve accumulated a drawer full of foundations and tinted moisturizers in hopes of finding the right product for my face.</li>
            <li> The Maybeline one works great for half the price.</li>
            <li> But many of the reviews said that the one shade worked on pretty much any complexion shade.</li>
            <li> have fair skin, and tend to be on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not sure how the pump is designed inside, but I&#x27;m guessing there will be a fair amount of product that won&#x27;t be able to be used at the end.</li>
            <li> and you can easily control how much you want to get out.</li>
            <li> While I was there, I realized that I could easily scratch off the lettering on the front, and that it wasn&#x27;t the REAL Skin79</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and blends easily.</li>
            <li> But this one is good for those dry winter months.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and blends so easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t use a moisturizer under it the first time and it was good all day, second</li>
            <li> This product is so great because it provides real skin protection that will make a difference in the long run for your skin.  </li>
            <li> this is the first time I try such a good foundation.</li>
            <li> im combination mostly oily and very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li> : love the product so far!</li>
            <li> It is only for light skin, though, but my husband told me my complexion looked really nice the first day I had this on.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that it covered better than my Benefit Oxygen WoW!</li>
            <li> ok, maybe i expected more benefits or coverage but not bad</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> even my husband ( who NEVER notices anything) asked if I had done something different because I looked better!</li>
            <li> Worldbuy365 sells legit skin 79 products no fake order from them!</li>
            <li> My first impressions were: FUN PACKAGING!</li>
            <li> But overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li> My 24% zinc oxide facial sunscreen absorbs more easily than this</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and when I wear products more than 5 hours, I get a rash or break out :/&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does the exact same great job of hiding my big pores, while also having a thicker consistency that covers blemishes better.</li>
            <li> This one is fine but doesn&#x27;t seem to match my skin as much.</li>
            <li> light for certain skintones</li>
            <li> it covers more than I expected, but it feels very light on my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin 79 color isn&#x27;t that great, a little greyish.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t great coverage, but it does seem to help my makeup stay put a little longer.  </li>
            <li> It does go on a little gray, but after blending it I was amazed at how great it covered and matched my skin.</li>
            <li> The authentic product looks a little grayish when you put it on and oxidizes to a nice beige.</li>
            <li> The ONLY difference is that this is more apt to work on many different skin types because it is not tailored to a certain skin type, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Even when I have not used this for a few days, my skin still looks great.</li>
            <li> I compared this to a mixture of my own I created of my favorite sunblock, foundation (with acne control...Neutrogena), and a few drops of argan oil.</li>
            <li> It is light and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize as much as Skin79, but the finish makes my skin look like my skin</li>
            <li> That freaked me out, because some of the &#x27;Real&#x27; versions out there shows Wrinkle Free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;m very fair-skinned (Caucasian), and this product is made for light skin tones.</li>
            <li> And thanks for the free sample</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but amazing things about it, so I finally decided to give it a try myself.</li>
            <li> When I got my package, I instantly tried it on and it feels soooooo amazing.</li>
            <li> &quot; Then, on goes my Bare Minerals Matte Foundation, and although my skin looks great at this stage, I add on the Bare Minerals Mineral Veil after this to set my foundation for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> This BB cream is the best I&#x27;ve tried as far as texture and coverage without feeling heavy, and believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of BB creams.</li>
            <li> I now use it lightly and don&#x27;t really get the redness</li>
            <li> Few months ago, after all the hype about BB creams, I bought Missha Perfect BB Cream #23, Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream #13, and Skin 79 pink label BB Cream (Ebay seller in Korea).  </li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable, it feels light on the skin, and offers good coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is way more even already, and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> The tint comes out more natural looking as well.  </li>
            <li> Clearly should have read more into this.  </li>
            <li> This is far better for her skin than foundation</li>
            <li> have medium complexion with a golden undertone and acne scaring.</li>
            <li> Fresh?</li>
            <li> When I have a lot of pimples I do need to use concealer, but those occasions are rare.</li>
            <li> but I do have laugh lines and this cream does not improve them.</li>
            <li> I set the BB Cream with some light translucent powder (Loreal Translucide) just so I could blend my blush better and because it is a personal preference</li>
            <li> It looks like it is natural healthy skin.</li>
            <li> So I started to mix the two different types of BB Creams to create my own color.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to add any extra shine which is also nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this brand, and it&#x27;s worth the addiction.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite day time bb cream.  </li>
            <li> I love the texture and how clear my skin has been.</li>
            <li> It only comes in one shade (which is nice for me-</li>
            <li> I have medium fair skin that although I am in my fifties, I have to be careful not to use any pore clogging products to avoid breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product but before it came, I picked up another BB cream in the drugstore (Maybelline Dream Fresh).</li>
            <li> , my skin looks natural but a lot better.</li>
            <li> After using this, my roommate and boyfriend have complimented on my more natural looking skin.</li>
            <li> absorbed by the body.&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> so far i love this bb cream i been using since i got it</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin just looks natural and healthy with this BB cream on.</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> My husband commented that my skin looks so much more natural when I wear this instead of foundation.  </li>
            <li> I liked it enough to use it all.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and nearly every day for more than a year.</li>
            <li> product is definitely worth the hype.  </li>
            <li> so thanks pink gelee!!I&#x27;ve been using tinted moisturizer before i got this bb cream, and now I am happy to found this one.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it a 1 star rating, is because whatever product this was laid really nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li> But it looks more natural than foundation.</li>
            <li> I rarely used any makeup and rarely got any pimples.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absorbed &amp; leaves skin looking even &amp; fresh.  </li>
            <li> The cream is nice, maybe for younger age 20-25</li>
            <li> it worth to try for this price.</li>
            <li> I ordered Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Fresh BB Cream, but I found out after lots of research that it was just another moisturizer, not a \\&quot;true\\&quot; BB cream.</li>
            <li> Patting instead of rubbing gives it a more natural look.</li>
            <li> The seller Pink Gelee is a reputable seller and my Skin79 was authentic.</li>
            <li> Covers up some of my red tone in my skin (which is good) and matches very well.</li>
            <li> So far this cream has not made me break out and it keeps my skin somewhat matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait</li>
            <li> (my friends make fun of me because it just looks like I&#x27;m slapping myself in the mirror).</li>
            <li> would recommend buying a sample kit of BB Creams, the Skin79 mini set of 4 for example, is worth it.</li>
            <li> My complextion is smoother, clearer and appears fresh and dewy as opposed bumpy, blotchy and oily.  </li>
            <li> The price makes it definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still there and looks FAR better than it used to around 9-10pm)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The cream has a different texture which I don&#x27;t have words to describe, kind of like lotion without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Korres Golden Beige.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t need any heavy coverage foundation, this bb cream is just perfect for my skin, it gives me a glowy natural look.</li>
            <li> Even my Mom has noticed enough of a difference in my skin to jump out of her comfort zone and order some of her own in hopes of achieving similiar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is kind of a generic lotion fragrance...</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream so far.</li>
            <li> it is worth to buy.</li>
            <li> It did not whiten skin and does not look like a fresh look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as grey, either, so it wasn&#x27;t as surprising when I first used it.</li>
            <li> just love this product..leaves skin soft...</li>
            <li> Blends in wonderfully with my pale half-Asian skin, evening out my skin tone while looking incredibly natural.</li>
            <li> have a fair skin with not that many problems, i mean acne.</li>
            <li> Since it is my first BB Cream, I can&#x27;t say if its better than the rest or even better than some, but I&#x27;ve always had oily, yet dry skin on my face, not to mention..</li>
            <li> It goes on very nourishing and moisturizing at first, gives great coverage, and blends easily to match my pale skin.</li>
            <li> Great for normal skin types but would not recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li> On those rare occasions where I am a bit darker, I easily just add some color from another foundation and apply like normal.</li>
            <li> it helps, I ordered from pinkgelee, and their products are legitimate (they ship pretty quickly, too!).BB Creams, the Skin79 mini set of 4 for example, is worth it.</li>
            <li> i brought it its tooo strong for my sensitive skin cool</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, shipping was super fast took only 2 days to arrive (via free super saver).</li>
            <li> one\\&quot; but I haven&#x27;t been this pleased with any cosmetic product in a long time, and I really wanted to share my experience with the gals that are still \\&quot;considering\\&quot; to get it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I was most worried about was the fact that I didn&#x27;t know if it was going to look weird on me because I&#x27;m very fair, but it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> It might be worth it, but if you start to break out, stop using it right away....</li>
            <li> There is a very light fragrant smell, the pink version feels more light than the gold, gold will probably be better for the dry winter time.</li>
            <li> I started using the gold version, which I equally love, for when I want a more dewy natural look since it&#x27;s more moisturizing than the hot pink version.  </li>
            <li> I had watched and read many other reviews about this product, and just like everyone else,and I am highly satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Having super oily skin already, when I applied this product over my Cerave moisturizer, it was looking pretty shiny.</li>
            <li> I got lucky in that this was the first BB I ordered</li>
            <li> At first appearance it may appear to have a gray-ish cast, but that quickly dissipates after being blended into skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed that when I don&#x27;t, I seem to get shiny pretty quickly, but the primer stops that from happening.  </li>
            <li> Yes, that has gotten me into tons of trouble many times but will I learn!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light foundation if your a person who loves full coverage because of acne and or scars I don&#x27;t recommend using this product because it doesn&#x27;t hide any of those.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product if your wanting a natural look  or a foundation that&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> The pink looks beautiful on my skin (I am fair skinned w/ blonde hair &amp; blue eyes)</li>
            <li> I found that by very lightly pressing it into my skin with my hands or a fine, dry makeup sponge it melted right into my skin.</li>
            <li> The 2 Skin79 BB Creams (Pink &amp; VIP) are great but the main difference to me seems to be coverage.</li>
            <li> It does look sort of gray and ashy when you first apply it, but it blends in perfectly within a few minutes and looks natural.</li>
            <li> It has cut my time getting ready in the morning significantly.</li>
            <li> First, and most importantly, my skin didn&#x27;t react by turning all red, blotchy, and flaky - hurray!</li>
            <li> The other one is good.</li>
            <li> Other BB creams don&#x27;t work as good.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a good chance that some of your makeup will transfer to your hands and other things.</li>
            <li> originally set out to buy the Smashbox BB cream after hearing so much hype on it.</li>
            <li> the color was lighter, the consistency of the cream was runnier than the original and it didn&#x27;t smell anything like the real bb cream.</li>
            <li> Although I have not used the product very much as of yet, I would just like to say that if you are considering purchasing this from this seller to be very assured that this is genuine.</li>
            <li> it creates healthy looking skin, covers the blemishes in a natural way, the seller is very thoughtful, I love the little card you sent me.</li>
            <li> Now I will only be using my air brush makeup on special occasions or mabey not at all. :)</li>
            <li> you will find a right products.</li>
            <li> right not</li>
            <li> it just has the right amount of dewyness and matte-ness.</li>
            <li> I guess this is just not the right brand for me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a BB cream that pops out noticeably then this one isn&#x27;t the right one for you.</li>
            <li> The price is right.  </li>
            <li> It went right in the trash for me</li>
            <li> As soon as you put it on, you feel as though your skin absorbs it right away</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s results over a period of time as I dived into a pool right after.</li>
            <li> right now(I&#x27;m a nc25).</li>
            <li> I received my BB cream right before I was headed out for vacation.</li>
            <li> Just the right size to put on your purse.</li>
            <li> just the right amount.</li>
            <li> It looks gray when I squeeze it out of the container, but when I put it on, it blends right in and takes away the blotchy redness, and masks my pores.  </li>
            <li> My family gave me compliments right away and could not tell I had any \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; on.</li>
            <li> I wish I had done that before buying this since I feel like this was not the right product for</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just not quite right for</li>
            <li> If you have olive or tan skin, or plan to use tanning beds/go out in the sun/spray tan, this is not the right thing for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with trying to find the right color foundation for my skin PLUS something that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> cream had the right holographic letters, the manufacturing date on the bottom, and the sticker of authenticity.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away when I started using it.</li>
            <li> I apply, I leave time for it to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; on my face so that it doesn&#x27;t rub off right away when I put blush on.  </li>
            <li> , right?)</li>
            <li> Plus, the price is just right.</li>
            <li> I just apply all over with a brush and it blends right into my skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine how the smell would be if it was right on my face.</li>
            <li> (I mix mine with Lancôme 24hr foundation to get the right</li>
            <li> It just blends right in and does its thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main issue I have with it is that I started reading the ingredients list when I got it, and by being so excited I saw so many natural extracts, I just went ahead and tried it.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to buy this product after I&#x27;ve read all the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> Definitely an important factor since UV rays can be so damaging for the skin and is the main cause of skin</li>
            <li> i think can be better with more color options maybe ligth,medium and dark skin color .</li>
            <li> My skin has finally cleared up and while I don&#x27;t need a full coverage foundation anymore, I need a lot more than a tinted moisturizer can provide to help cover the freckles and some scarring.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty fair with pink undertones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Color match is perfect, and is starting to remove dark patches.</li>
            <li> It really is a cosmetic and needs to be applied to clean skin in the morning and removed at night.</li>
            <li> It really is a cosmetic and needs to be applied to clean skin in the morning and removed at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unlike regular bb creams you find in the drugstores because it has more of a medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li> I have a medium/dark skin tone since im Peruvian and when I first put on this product I was kind of scared since it made me look really white and ashy.</li>
            <li> I am now the owner of a large drawer full of foundations, tinted moisturizers, and a couple of BB creams that didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.</li>
            <li> do like how it evens out my skin tone in a very natural way, however, and its creaminess makes it really easy to apply and spread.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first BB cream, but I have been very pleased with it and am planning to order more of the same and from the same seller.</li>
            <li> The cream blends amazingly and have just the right amount of coverage to buff away any minor imperfections like pimple scars and blemishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
            <li> I recieved two samples with it as well that also went on great and actually matched my skin a little better.</li>
            <li> This BB cream can be intimidating to some people, but this particular one is great for anyone, especially for new BB cream users.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product with great results over the past 3 days.</li>
            <li> Between the two products, my freckles and flaws disappeared with an airbrushed appearance and between the 25 SPF of the BB and the 15 SPF of Bare Minerals, I should be OK for the upcoming summer sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this product and would buy it again especially with this affordable price in comparison to many other brands.</li>
            <li> I have tried several American BB creams and this is by far the best I have used</li>
            <li> Also, I read that the Beyond the Solution has a more natural coloring since there&#x27;s no SPF (no white ashiness like most BB cream</li>
            <li> Worth a try ;)&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Skin79 BB cream (pink label).</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, my skin is normally controlled acne free till I use this product.</li>
            <li> Barely any scent at all either, which I love.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is that it barely (if at all) looks like you are wearing anything.</li>
            <li> So if you need more than just a general evening of your skin tone, I would recommend using the Gold Label as I felt like it was heavier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned (but with olive tone) with auburn hair, dark brown eyes and brows.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s nice and matte, seems to control my oil even after a long day at work</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad although i paid a higher price for my authentic bottle.</li>
            <li> It looks a little yellow or grayish right out of the bottle, but once I rub it in it blends in perfectly with my alabaster skin tone.</li>
            <li> The first day using it was fine, actually good coverage, but starting from the second day breakout came!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much this is the second time I have purchase it , it makes my skin look so clean and look fresh.</li>
            <li> It is designed for Asian skin, and in most eastern cultures having fair, untanned skin is highly desirable, unlike western cultures where everyone spray tans to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend you buy a few different ones to try on and compare in order to find the right one that works best for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I almost laughed!</li>
            <li> This one I use in the summer when my skin is more oilier and use the Gold VIP in the winter when I need a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I read another reviewer said that it made the skin texture show more, like little bumps appear more instead of disappearing</li>
            <li> You can layer on more if  you need more coverage but a little pump of it is plenty for me</li>
            <li> My friend has this brand and told me to try it because I wanted one to give me a little better coverage and to feel better on my face.</li>
            <li> If your kind of close to this colour, but it&#x27;s still a little too light (like me)</li>
            <li> Upon informing the seller, Think Pretty, of the problem, they offered to replace the product and did so right away.</li>
            <li> Super fast.</li>
            <li> sure i will be using this almost everyday but with better moisturizer</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and no fakes.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not a fan of the matte look and this made my skin look dry and kind of flaky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The creamy formula effectively covers up skin imperfections, creating a perfect base for makeup and foundation.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it looks kind of grey</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and have had acne all of my teenage and adult life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gray when it pumps out, but it oxidizes to a more natural color.</li>
            <li> Of that 1-inch container, the only makeup that could fit would be what could fit around the inserted pump.</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR THE QUICK SHIP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Defenatly recomended for people for light skin( since they only have light skin shades)</li>
            <li> I am pretty lazy about applying SPF, so it&#x27;s great that I get some protection with the BB</li>
            <li> I have a feeling I will be using the entire bottle, which rarely happens with most make up products.</li>
            <li> a side note, I have fair, slightly acne-prone skin).</li>
            <li> I am darker in the summer since I tan easily and this blended into my naturally oily skintone  </li>
            <li> It was delivered super fast and there were some samples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural looking, good coverage, and actually I have had NO breakouts at ALL since switching to the Skin 79 BB&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> this actually feels good to wear and makes skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I work outdoors, and I like simplicity, so I was looking for a single face product that has good spf, decent coverage, and would not wear off from sweat or rain.  </li>
            <li> Sunscreen severely burns my face, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to the majority of foundations that are available.</li>
            <li> daily moisturizer/spf. BB cream is a great way for me to neutralize my skin tone without going the full blown make up route especially as I get older.</li>
            <li> I top it off with some matting loose powder and my skin looks very natural and healthy.</li>
            <li> this has stopped that and made my skin smooth and almost completely clear!  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too great but its okay, usually i set this with pressed powder and lasts till the next day.</li>
            <li> the whole \\&quot;it makes you look more professional and naturally pretty instead of</li>
            <li> the whole \\&quot;it makes you look more professional and naturally pretty instead of</li>
            <li> but i was not going to deal with shipping it back and not be sure of getting a refund since they couldn&#x27;t even send me the right</li>
            <li> The shipping was also super fast and arrived exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> It is a little grey so is not as great as could be, but it does make skin feel soft and is ok for a light coverage.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It actually feels very light and breathable.</li>
            <li> Also you do not need to use very much of it for it to cover all of your face.</li>
            <li> I had been using Boots no 7 creams which I like very much but saw an ad for the Loreal BB cream and thought to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;Although I like the effect of the Loreal</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very light and at the same time it covers my blemish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only reason it gets 2 stars is because I like the way it feels on my skin, very light and also shipping</li>
            <li> It blends with my skin perfectly and helps protect it and take away some of my super dark dark circles.</li>
            <li> Overall great cream, texture and coverage, just slightly too light, but</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old of Scandinavian ancestry and found that the tone was just fine.</li>
            <li> how can they, and so many other sellers, sell this product at a price so cheap?  </li>
            <li> must give this product a good review based on not only the feel of the product, the packaging, but also the care of the vendor in their quick shipment and extra bonus of samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this stuff is easy and good, and it&#x27;s not that much for how long the bottle will last you!</li>
            <li> so pink!&lt;br /&gt;the bb cream&#x27;s color is a little bit dull,but after i use it, it looks really good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this Skin 79 BB Cream because I didn&#x27;t know how it would match up with my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping thanks!!~</li>
            <li> It goes on a little grey, but once you rub it in and let it sit, it matches light/fair toned skin perfectly!</li>
            <li> I will also mention that is of far better quality than drugstore brands, but does not have the high department store</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on designer brands, just trying to find &#x27;the one&#x27; that works for me... and this stuff simply is just great and very affordable!!</li>
            <li> The little pink packaging so cute and its great to bring on travel.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try it alone with more of a patting motion and it gave me a really good coverage I added just a little concealer to my red areas and some powder</li>
            <li> B/c of popularity of Missha, I used it first.  </li>
            <li> The first day I wore it, I went to spinning class -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried samples of American BB creams from Sephora, and this one is better than all of them.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> And take note, an application in the morning would last the whole day! :-)</li>
            <li> This BB cream was the first one I ever bought.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> After hearing the beauty gurus rave about BB creams and learning more about how big of a hit they are in Korea, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER been this clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a spectrum of higher priced (as well as lower end) foundations, tinted moisturizer, and bb creams</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream that I have ever used</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream and</li>
            <li> fast~!</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and this has NOT broken me out!</li>
            <li> This really for people that from a lighter or whiter skintone and its foundation which I also misread!</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li> This seems to be the most universal.</li>
            <li> There were no harm done to the box or my product, and it was NOT a fake.</li>
            <li> First of all, it would not adjust my skin tone.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried that the one shade that it comes in would not work for my tone.</li>
            <li> I first put the product on my face</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a BB cream</li>
            <li> When I first went to use it in mid-February, and I saw the color of the cream, I did not think there would be any way it would blend with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> finish is at first sticky but once it sets it sets.</li>
            <li> pretty even skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dunno how it&#x27;d work for darker tones which is sad because bb cream is excellent besides this one thing.</li>
            <li> application  -The container is pretty.</li>
            <li> It whitens pretty well</li>
            <li> Most effects are only temporary, it&#x27;s almost like a tinted moisturizer  </li>
            <li> First off I have oily skin</li>
            <li> Most likely not going to buy again.</li>
            <li> It really helped to even out my skin tone and cover all of the redness!</li>
            <li> This BB cream was definitely better than 2 others I have tried by different companies.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff, I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I TRIED MANY DIFFERENT BRAND OF BB CREAMS.</li>
            <li> So, first I&#x27;m going to say that I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s caucasian with combination skin.  </li>
            <li> ordered this product about a month ago and have waited to write my review because I wanted to make sure the results were going to last and give the product time to work.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first BB cream I have tried</li>
            <li> I decided to give an Asian brand a try to see if it would match my skin tone better.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about BB cream I knew I had to try it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you after first use,</li>
            <li> I think skin79 hot pink stands on its own.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes it looks really natural and beautiful</li>
            <li> FIRST, Review of the PRODUCT--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she sells the Authentic product and this is simply a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is your skin, only better.  </li>
            <li> I was scared at first cause</li>
            <li> I first bought this on a whim almost three years ago and I still use this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more as soon as my first supply runs out.</li>
            <li> used on top of my mosturizer or sunscreen if i feel i need extra protection!!!</li>
            <li> only muchmuch better.  </li>
            <li> I am asian so this matched my skin color better than Revlon Colorstay which I used before this.</li>
            <li> To be sure I went to the Skin79 website where they only provide you with one sure way of verifying authenticity which is to check the silver sticker on the back of your bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Little bit about me: Never used bb creams before, this is my first time ordering.</li>
            <li> I received a reply promptly the next day, guaranteeing that their products are 100% guaranteed authentic.</li>
            <li> On the bottle itself there was also a sticker of authenticity, the gold version wasn&#x27;t as nicely placed as the pink bottle..</li>
            <li> However, I wasn&#x27;t exactly holding my breath for a miracle or anything the first time I put it on, but within 3 minutes of massaging this in, I literally looked at myself in the mirror and said \\&quot;woah\\&quot; and had to do an inspection.</li>
            <li> Sadly, not for darker skin</li>
            <li> I can tell it really moisturizes my skin as well!</li>
            <li> Overall, am pleased with product, purchase, and delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying BB cream</li>
            <li> I do not have any allergies that I am aware of, but something in this cream did not agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> I did the research on BB cream, and decided to go with this one for my first try.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely keep buying this product!</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I have used this brand of makeup, but I knew something was off from the moment I first put it on.</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying my skin color is tan and the bb cream doesn&#x27;t match my color</li>
            <li> The only logical conclusion is that it&#x27;s Korean magic.  </li>
            <li> So this is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li> It also seemed to come off throughout the day and made my skin look oily unlike the first bottle.</li>
            <li> This one seems just like the first bottle I had and</li>
            <li> This is the exact product I needed.</li>
            <li> Today is my first day wearing it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so I went to their website and was able to confirm that is the same as the bottle I got.</li>
            <li> After using it for only 1 week, my skin is softer and more even toned.</li>
            <li> One metered squirt is more than I need for my entire face</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;She told me that  it is done for her exactly what is written in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> The BB cream works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have so many regular foundations and theres&#x27;no need to use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which this is most definitely not.</li>
            <li> It gives ok coverage but at only about the level of a tinted moisturizer so you can still see some pores and bumps on your skin.</li>
            <li> though with just one layer it doesn&#x27;t fully disguise my acne, it came pretty</li>
            <li> I wish I would have looked at the ingredients first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is the first time I tried out BB cream .</li>
            <li> The higher SPF is also a plus.</li>
            <li> I have tried several BB creams and this is one of my favorite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am pretty unsure about it.</li>
            <li> At first after reading all the reviews on this website and a few others, I thought this would be good for me.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a prompt refund through amazon for the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bottle is also really pretty.</li>
            <li> The color looks like it won&#x27;t match at first, but when its blended in your skin</li>
            <li> but I was wrong because this stuff covers amazingly!!!!!</li>
            <li> my current supply runs out, I&#x27;m going to try another cream within the skin79 line that is supposed to be more suited towards my skin type.  </li>
            <li> It covers pretty well for a BB cream.  </li>
            <li> So much better than american brand stuff.  </li>
            <li> pretty well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first BB cream, and I adored it from the get-go.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone, and makes my combo skin feel soft, smooth, and non greasy.</li>
            <li> , my freckles still peek through :), but the tiny capillaries and imperfections just seem to fade.</li>
            <li> It is SO lightweight that I can see myself wearing this cream to the beach or on a hot day out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the color at first.  </li>
            <li> It goes onto my skin like butter and stays on the whole day!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looked exactly like the one I purchased before.</li>
            <li> It had all the authentic symbols (box with the proferated edges, Red dot on box).&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face color is different with my neck color at first, but it will be better soon.</li>
            <li> it has light coverage and its not heavy</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and buy it again :)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It feels like I have nothing on my face, which is exactly the feel</li>
            <li> So when I first heard about BB Creams, they sounded exactly like what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably break it open to make sure I can use the rest of it.</li>
            <li> I have gotten several comments from different people about how great my skin looks and that is all I really want.</li>
            <li> I love BB cream, but only skin79 brand.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> She told me everyone in South Korea loves bb cream (authentic Korean, not American, bb cream) and swears by it.</li>
            <li> I tried it out for the next weekand fell in love.</li>
            <li> my make up breathes better and isn&#x27;t completely obvious that I&#x27;m wearing it on my face (you know,</li>
            <li> lot of people mention a greyish tone when it first goes on, but I don&#x27;t find this with mine.</li>

            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll hopefully have a link up to my website with further information and before/after pictures for you to look at. :)</li>
            <li> Love it and def coming back for it!</li>
            <li> The first two are Lioele&#x27;s Triple the Solution and Beyond the Solution...</li>
            <li> Coverage is similar to that of a tinted moisturizer, but with slightly more coverage.  </li>
            <li> Also, while the package is pretty and the pump is convenient (when it works) it is too bulky.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I have tried and it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I have used it for exactly two months now</li>
            <li> When you first put it on</li>
            <li> But if I were to find another BB cream with a better skintone match but similar finish, which I can, since there are dozens, I will liekly not buy this again.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and even and looks &amp; feels so natural.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much seoulglamour!</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream, it glides on like sunscreen/lotion.</li>
            <li> but I am willing to give it another</li>
            <li> I have some left over redness and scarring from acne and with this product my skin tone looks more even.  </li>
            <li> I was very nervous to purchase this from Amazon but decided it was worth the gamble.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, I&#x27;m going to use every last drop of this stuff :)</li>
            <li> first day I tried this product my husband was in the room</li>
            <li> It does match pretty close.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> started noticing that I do not get sun spots anymore and feel my face is more protected overall.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the coloration of my face, when I don&#x27;t use it, my face seems more blotchy and red in places than it did before using the product.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, a product worked in fighting this.</li>
            <li> The BB cream was kinda greasy at first</li>
            <li> I must say, after days of researching different BB creams and watching every video review on the planet, I am pleased that I picked this one.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream on a section of my face first</li>
            <li> At first it has a gray tint to it, but if you let it sit for 5 minutes it will adjust to your skin tone.</li>
            <li> If it looks a bit greyish when you first apply, don&#x27;t worry - it will change color to match your skin in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> I also use coconut oil underneath it and at first my face is shiny, but within 30 minutes or so, the coconut oil soaks in and the makeup turns matte on me.  </li>
            <li> It stays put without powder, and yet is still pliable enough that I could blend more in, if I accidentally wiped some off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bb cream was exactly what i expected...light weight and medium coverage.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and feels light on my skin.</li>
            <li> Let me start by say this is the first time I ever used a bb cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first time that i&#x27;ve ever purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I used BB cream from Clinique because I love their facial products.</li>
            <li> even, it also seems to help smooth and even out your natural skin during the day while you wear it.  </li>
            <li> also love that I do not have to use a gross amount of the product in application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li> also thought it was creamy, soft and light.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t melt away in the southern humidity.</li>
            <li> It matches my skin tone pretty well, although whitens my face.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I bought from Tokyo Japanese outlet.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I used it avidly for a month</li>
            <li> this so much!</li>
            <li> After hearing about how much better Korean BB Creams were than Western ones, I decided I needed a Skin79 BB.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: I am head over heels in love with this BB Cream and will absolutely be back here to repurchase when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very white though, and I think that it would have been a better match if it were just a bit lighter.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t match every one all the time ;)</li>
            <li> Saw some reviews and had much higher hopes for this.  </li>
            <li> Thought maybe the ones more expensive has better ratings and better works.</li>
            <li> Though I wasn&#x27;t looking for a liquid foundation type of moisturizer it actually feels more like a moisturizer/base than a foundation.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not really a big deal since most people use powders over their foundations anyways.</li>
            <li> I still love it and will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> If your coloring isn&#x27;t in line with asian skin, it will be more noticeable though.</li>
            <li> First let me tell you the type of skin</li>
            <li> I had my last bottle for two months or more.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> The Pink Bebesh creams gives you more sheer coverage if you want the more natural look while The VIP seems to be thicker coverage, perhaps more foundation in the components?</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream, and I can never go back to just using foundation!</li>
            <li> Coverage is good, not cakey, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> it has a VOID sticker that the skin79 site said to avoid but I did more research into it and turns out the VOID sticker is on the real skin79 and also based on the seller&#x27;s money back guarantee, I&#x27;ll take their word that it&#x27;s a true beauty ;] I&#x27;ve tried Missha Signature Real</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a foundation that was not too heavy and would look good all day on combination oily/dry skin.</li>
            <li> CA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a base with Baremineral, the combination gives a flawless natural look on my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> It is also slightly thicker and has a bit better coverage, so if you&#x27;re on the fence between pink and gold, and are looking for something a bit more heavy-duty, maybe this is better for you than the gold.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest it to anyone with acne prone skin because it has even helped me tremendously in that aspect.</li>
            <li> (The super high SPF means I also don&#x27;t need to worry about a sun screen).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair skin, and have super sensitive skin and this product was not too dark nor did it cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair redhead with pale skin &amp; pinkish undertones</li>
            <li> when I know I&#x27;m going to have my picture taken since SPF reflects light particles, making your face super white and glowy in photographs.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super oily with big pores in the t-zone and this is fantastic in covering those imperfections and in keeping the shine at bay.</li>
            <li> triple function blemish balm cream, Skin79&#x27;s Super Plus BB Cream (Pink Label) shields skin from premature aging with potent SPF 25, while whitening skin and reducing existing lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is clear, never dries out, and has a very natural, healthy look with this BB cream on.</li>
            <li> and I wish I could give away my almost new and full bottle of Skin 79 as I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> Like most other BB creams, brightens my skin very nicely although it does darken a little over time (oxidizes).</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a pump bottle, less than $20, really fast and easy to apply without the need of a brush, and has SPF in it.</li>
            <li> It comes with SPF 25 and the shade is more true to your skin color unlike other bb creams that look greyish.</li>
            <li> This BB not only gives you great coverage but makes your skin almost glow, it helps to keep my oily face nice and dry and my other makeup just falls into place and stays there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mineral powder foundation for many years but at age 60 wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t settle in my fine lines and creases after a few hours.</li>
            <li> for the cream, it&#x27;s pretty decent stuff, but the ordeal to get to it has not been much fun.</li>
            <li> My blush, bronzer, everything stays on which is amazing because I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> The design of the bottle is very cute too and convenient because it prevents from mess.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and got a little too excited to find such a cheap, nice cream.</li>
            <li> The container has a pump and it looks nice, unlike other products in tubes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need any of the concealer I normally use!!</li>
            <li> I did not have much faith this this product would help... and while it does not prevent 100% of my break-outs, it definitely has made a HUGE difference!  </li>
            <li> Natural, slightly dewy look that I really like - great for a no-makeup look</li>
            <li> Purchased this since it gets such amazing reviews, it was cheap, and I&#x27;d been wanting to dry out these oh-so-amazing BB Creams from Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty quick, only a few days, and it was packaged in a pretty generic shipping bag INSIDE a box, which was slightly impressive, I must say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the gold-label BB Cream, but found that the pink-label (this one) left me less shiny and was better for my oily</li>
            <li> Love the cream because it&#x27;s soft and looks natural on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this company decided that &amp;#34;olive&amp;#34; was a pretty good default skin tone</li>
            <li> So I read good reviews about this bb cream, but the only problem I was coming across was people saying it won&#x27;t work on a non white skin tone.</li>
            <li> At the time I was looking, it was more than double the price, now it&#x27;s very inexpensive</li>
            <li> My expectation was higher then usual having seen really good reviews on Amazon for this product.</li>
            <li> I love how well this BB Cream covers my uneven skin tone and leaves my oily skin shine free all day.</li>
            <li> when i bought this item i thought i might have been a good match because i&#x27;m asian and the product was made in asian (</li>
            <li> I have a good amount of hyperpigmentation that is pink from old acne that I had</li>
            <li> Skin79 Super Beblesh Balm BB Cream Triple Funtion (Pink Label) with SPS 25 is good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m in Canada, it was good enough shipping time though I wish sellers would remove or lower the shipping fee for international transactions.</li>
            <li> Definitely for fair skin only.</li>
            <li> Will certainly purchase this product again, do not have to use much at all!</li>
            <li> I also have a mild case of rosacea and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this BB was not as moisturizing as some of my previous ones, but was still really good, highly protective and lasted longer then</li>
            <li> Other than that, this bb cream along with a little bit of concealer makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> I mean that in the best possible way ever</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right coverage without feeling too heavy &amp; makes my skin look nice when I don&#x27;t want to wear tons of makeup.</li>
            <li> Also, the vendor (Pink Gelee) was very nice; product came earlier than estimated and they included a couple of samples.</li>
            <li> I may purchase the Gold one as well, if the Pink Label isn&#x27;t suitable for Winter.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few different brands over the years and this is the BEST so far.</li>
            <li> I first tried with a real techniques expert face brush</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I was very iffy.  </li>
            <li> But whatever the case, it did exactly what it advertises -- evened out my skin tone and brightened my complexion while still looking really</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, came two weeks earlier than I expected and was relieved that it worked out that way because I actually moved to campus</li>
            <li> The product came very promptly, first day of the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> the coverage is light to barely non-existent (fades within an hour or so)if anything I feel like it doesn&#x27;t even cover, it just leaves an white/grey cast on the face.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB Cream and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Goes on really grey-ish at first.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for this product!  </li>
            <li> Thanks much!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too long for you, just know that I LOVE it</li>
            <li> On first application I could tell it wouldn&#x27;t provide as much coverage as the Lioele ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Bare Minerals Light.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this, I noticed that the coverage was medium/light depending on how you apply and how much you apply.</li>
            <li> First of all, the package came in really on time, and it was packed securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all this product came really</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t creamy like the bottles I received in the past, and the makeup didn&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li> Just note that BB creams are good for making skin tone even or hiding pores and small blemishes</li>
            <li> It has lots of nice benefits that drugstore bb creams don&#x27;t have like whitening agents that fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> When I rinse it off with warm water at night, I notice my skin is moisturized and dark spots have lightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even used on my full coverage powder just to get some natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really worked well with my fair complexion, and overall my appearance is brighter, more youthful, more moisturized and less irritated with less breakouts.</li>
            <li> The smell is barely noticeable, it&#x27;s a very light flowery fragrance that completely goes away after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> to mention that these above BB creams lasts all day and stays pretty matte on my super oily skin!  </li>
            <li> quick spreading with my fingers and with Sun Protection Factor, I feel I&#x27;m accomplishing more with less.  </li>
            <li> This evens my skin tone out perfectly, although I do need to use a little concealer under my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really whitened my skin, but it was always super nice to apply and to wear every day.</li>
            <li> I had tried a previous BB cream by Boscia and really like this one a lot better!</li>
            <li> After applying it with a foundation brush, I use a very small amount of my bareminerals in golden medium, just to get it to a shade that matches my skintone better; because just the bb cream is too light for me.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s any drier than about normal, this isn&#x27;t the right BB cream for you</li>
            <li> I am a huge beauty product junkie and this is definitely not the first time I&#x27;ve used BB cream.</li>
            <li> The text printed in the front and back easily gets scratched off.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a cute pretty pink.</li>
            <li> And much sooner when I&#x27;m bare faced)&lt;br /&gt;- light feel, but</li>
            <li> so I started using Skin79 hot pink BB cream, which I fell in love with.  </li>
            <li> The finish is satin and only within an hour my t-zone is more oilier than normal.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting a full-coverage \\&quot;foundation\\&quot;, but the idea of seeing smaller pores and (apparently) scars healing made me jump at the purchase.  </li>
            <li> , it doesnot dry out my skin and gives more coverage.</li>
            <li> so I lightly depress the top button.</li>
            <li> As I am getting older, my skin feels drier and I do not like mineral powder as much anymore because it seems to make my pores more obvious.</li>
            <li> I have extraordinarily oily, blemish-prone, sensitive skin, and this BB cream does not break me out one bit.  </li>
            <li> you tend to have dry skin, i recommend the gold label. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I have to say that my skin is BETTER than it ever has been before after using Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink bb cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I have to say that my skin is BETTER than it ever has been before after using Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink bb cream.</li>
            <li> I would say for oily skin this might be and OK product, but for dry or combination skin, forget it.</li>
            <li> And I like the softer look on my aging skin better than the dry look I got from mineral</li>
            <li> It makes your skin super soft and just melts in with your skin.</li>
            <li> It has good coverage, pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I like it and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong personally</li>
            <li> After one week of using it I saw four large bumps on my jawline.</li>
            <li> , I certainly did not notice any oxidation to match my skin color.</li>
            <li> : don&#x27;t just pump a large amount into your hand and rub your face.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a certain technique to putting it on that you can read about online</li>
            <li> : don&#x27;t just pump a large amount into your hand and rub your face.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a certain technique to putting it on that you can read about online</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that this product will match my skin in the winter as well.</li>
            <li> Just for comparison for those who are curious about this product reacting with their own skin-types, I&#x27;m mixed race (basically everything except Asian) with a medium skin tone that tans very easily.</li>
            <li> [...] and took a good look at all the different BB creams out there and decided to try the hot pink one.    </li>
            <li> I even tried many of the new American bb creams but it was like</li>
            <li> I have pretty light skin, but its pretty much an all over pinkish tone with more red in certain areas due to acne and scarring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the yellow undertones (NC20/25) light/medium skin that gets oily on the t-zone but is fairly normal/sometimes dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li> When I buy a new product, I test it--at a mirror, in the daylight--and then I see how good it looks several hours later without retouching.  </li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge changes in my skins natural appearance, but when it&#x27;s on your skin you look luminous!</li>
            <li> One day I pump it and it&#x27;s fine, the next day it&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li> those other reviews about the BB creams being too light or gray are true.  </li>
            <li> When it finally arrived I was pretty excited to try it.</li>
            <li> My skin, fine wrinkles, breakouts, acne scars and all, basically looked similar to how it does without any makeup.</li>
            <li> I smoked for 12 years before quitting 2 years ago and have tiny fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> both my daughters who have opposite skin tones can wear it just fine.</li>
            <li> Overall, it hydrates fine</li>
            <li> This product is obviously no regulated and that is fine, but know what you&#x27;re putting on your body people.</li>
            <li> The product definitely is gray, but once it is blended into your skin, it&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
            <li> The bottle size is pretty decent</li>
            <li> generally pale (mostly Anglo-Irish descent, with a small amount of Native American thrown in), and was worried when I read reviews that said it was grayish, but this product suits me perfectly!</li>
            <li> I should note though that I did not set this with a powder, as I have very dry skin and wasn&#x27;t sure if you were supposed to do that anyway!&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s amazing too, you should check it out) and just apply a little bit around my under eye circles and around my mouth and jawline.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s amazing too, you should check it out) and just apply a little bit around my under eye circles and around my mouth and jawline.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s lasted me almost a year and still going strong, full, weightless coverage, and you use less of it.</li>
            <li> It IS good, but I realized after using it for about a month and on a whim going back to my old foundation one morning that... my old foundation is better, for less money.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash it off before bed to reduce any breakouts, I haven&#x27;t had a single one since using it!</li>
            <li> SPF protecting is pretty high</li>
            <li> far, SKIN79 Super+ appeared way too light when first applying it to my face; however, it blended into my skin well and looks more natural on my face than my usual foundation.  </li>
            <li> , now my skin regime in the morning is,  a makeup sponge to apply BB cream, its none greasy and stays on all day!Which proves  an old dog can learn new tricks!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The BB Cream I purchased had the perforated box, tamper-evident sticker, large pink circle on top of box and 4 diff languages inside, manufacture and expiration dates and just about everything I&#x27;ve read the real package and box should have.</li>
            <li> Coverage is great, it goes on a little grey at first, but then it blends to your skin.</li>
            <li> It is moderate sized and a bright pink.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t cause any extra acne and that is a huge plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went through this brand of BB cream fast.</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair/light and acne prone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t really influence my purchasing decision, but I really like the package.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was acne, but the spots are coming in places where I don&#x27;t normally breakout.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for this product even after all the rave reviews via youtube.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really cover up scars or some redness....</li>
            <li> Everything was in a fast orderly manner meaning the purchasing process to the shipping.  </li>
            <li> Turns out the product I received was the real deal.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> ( I treasure sleep), but this fabulous product makes it so simple.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> This covers all my blemishes, hides my freckles, and wears very well.</li>
            <li> I love this Pink Skin79 BB cream.</li>
            <li> The finished look is very natural/airbrush finish and it doesn&#x27;t make your face oily</li>
            <li> I have acne scars too and very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product as it keeps my oil at bay.</li>
            <li> moQ7K7XI35291Q]]I really wanted to do a video review</li>
            <li> This cream is really just all the stuff you used to use put together.</li>
            <li> They both work very well.</li>
            <li> They match my NC25 Asain skin color very well.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and the shipping is so fast</li>
            <li> Shipping fast , And I received samples .</li>
            <li> I really, really like it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to shield it very well though.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has gotten much clearer and a lot of the redness on my face disappeared.</li>
            <li> When I heard about BB cream I really wanted to try it out because of all its benefits</li>
            <li> -I didn&#x27;t get much coverage.</li>
            <li> This is probably because of this BB cream because my face doesn&#x27;t oil up that much when I don&#x27;t put anything on my face.  </li>
            <li> but I really did not need to.</li>
            <li> The product is genuine and I will be ordering a second tube for my mom.</li>
            <li> In fact, I wanted to order two units, but the shipping cost  doubled, which didn&#x27;t make much sense me.</li>
            <li> AND MY FACE WILL TURN VERY OILY THEN</li>
            <li> At this price, really, everyone should try it.</li>
            <li> One whole pump covers my neck and throat area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely lightweight.</li>
            <li> This is also been really great on my acne prone skin - I haven&#x27;t broken out once since I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> It looked like the real thing.</li>
            <li> It feels like a face mask when you put it on, and it really adjusts well to your skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> but after it settles, your face is ready for all day photo shoot.</li>
            <li> Keep your prices reasonable and your honesty so even if there will be cheaper stuff, you&#x27;ll have our loyalty.</li>
            <li> After researching BB creams, I really wanted to try one that was affordable.</li>
            <li> I had been researching for a while about the whole \\&quot;BB cream\\&quot; phenomena, and decided to take a chance and check it out for myself.</li>
            <li> and I really like the effect it gives me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that much</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> but I really wanted to share the whole experience</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> When I rubbed it on my skin, it had a very watery feel and had virtually no coverage effect.  </li>
            <li> This is more matte than I expected, so I might try experimenting with using a moisturizer before I apply in the morning.  </li>
            <li> What this means is the BB cream feels light and doesn&#x27;t turn out cakey later on.</li>
            <li> It was something I really wanted to try</li>
            <li> It looks really natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have really oily skin.</li>
            <li> I will report again as the only concern I have is that the packaging of the bottle, which looks quite nice, is deceiving about actually how much product you are getting.</li>
            <li> I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to ask bluntly if they were real or not, and then I&#x27;d check it when the package came in.</li>
            <li> overview on the authenticity: So it came in the mail today and I readily checked all thebookmarked links of how to tell if it&#x27;s real or not.</li>
            <li> So I think I&#x27;m going to skip that test, haha</li>
            <li> It came out finely mixed, in one unison color and was lightly fragrant.</li>
            <li> really well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> what I&#x27;ve read, this pink version is better for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> But since im so into it and really wanted it, i tried it on my skin.</li>
            <li> It covers really well</li>
            <li> the box and the container look real</li>
            <li> Hides my acne scars and redness very well.</li>
            <li> really appreciate all the reviews, which helped me make the decision to try</li>
            <li> It sets really well on the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or like there&#x27;s a film on my face.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I am allergic/sensitive to so much and foundation sometimes makes my face burn.  </li>
            <li> This product is the real deal by the way.</li>
            <li> This product really blends well on my skin.</li>
            <li> My face looks fresh and natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely too light for my skin complexion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve researched BB creams for along time, and i&#x27;ve bought real ones..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but this one has a triple functions which i really like..</li>
            <li> This one seems like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, and I really like using this product.</li>
            <li> It controls oil really well</li>
            <li> Looks like me but airbrushed, and it really does keep the shine away for much longer.</li>
            <li> I was really wanting a bb cream to even out my skin tone</li>
            <li> The only difference was that it says wrinkle improvement, while the one in the picture on Amazon said wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard PinkGelee, Seoulglamour, &amp;neverprice all sell real product, I got mine from Emmas.</li>
            <li> , I have to say I really like it.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> My skin really does not like silicones, and this BB Cream started to irritate my skin after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> and I really just want nothing to do with hydroquinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> It matched my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in my troublesome skin years, so it covers up acne scars very well and</li>
            <li> The concealer I used prior to using this BB cream even made my face burn from the light spf 15</li>
            <li> It was supposed to tighten the skin to eliminate wrinkles, smooth the appearance of the skin over all, and whiten the skin (which made me think of bleach initially</li>
            <li> It will make you break out if you don&#x27;t, so don&#x27;t go straight to bed even if you&#x27;re just rolling in at 1 a.m</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at all to create the desired effect, and too much will make it seem like it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
            <li> It will make you break out if you don&#x27;t, so don&#x27;t go straight to bed even if you&#x27;re just rolling in at 1 a.m</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at all to create the desired effect, and too much will make it seem like it&#x27;s too oily.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product.</li>
            <li> Covers redness very well&lt;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very oily skin, but I do breakout</li>
            <li> I really like the SPF 25 as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps get rid of sun spots</li>
            <li> Should have returned it, but it was cheap enough for me to write it off as a loss.</li>
            <li> Got the Pink because it&#x27;s my favorite color.</li>
            <li> For oilier skin, an oil absorbing primer is helpful, or you will need to powder a bit as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> it covers really well and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> it is very hydrating and makes my skin look dewy, which i like.  </li>
            <li> I believe the company is located in California and I received my package fairly fast.  </li>
            <li> I broke out and it made my face really oily.</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li> It really feels like I am not wearing any makeup at all.</li>
            <li> Why would I want to use that much if another BB cream can do what I need in just one layer?</li>
            <li> nor my skin need too much coverage.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much just to try something</li>
            <li> It doesnt cover much and it doesnt make my skin smoother as promised.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and acne prone.  </li>
            <li> Skin 79 offers different formulas that are designed for different skin types; you can check their website for more detailed information.</li>
            <li> I just really didn&#x27;t want to be among them.</li>
            <li> So, after much reviews, I decided to try this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I only used this light water get based one.</li>
            <li> I have to put press powder very this stuff.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it is much softer ...</li>
            <li> I guess i was justing expecting too much from this item.</li>
            <li> others have said before, you really should \\&quot;pat\\&quot; this product on rather than rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> Having used U.S. BB creams that are really just tinted moisturizers, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I like the pink label a lot more than the diamond one.</li>
            <li> and this didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of primers, nothing really worked as well as I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the frugal in me hates throwing it away without checking to make sure its empty.</li>
            <li> in all, I really like using a *real* BB Cream.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still really lightweight.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to even out my tone and cover blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually worn make up that I believe improves my complexion, allows me to have my *natural* skin but still covers blemishes, and feels light weight and fresh.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has evened (not as much of a drastic difference between a face with no make up vs. a face with make up).</li>
            <li> It LASTS for almost the whole day and looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply two to three applications depending on how much coverage you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually worn make up that I believe improves my complexion, allows me to have my *natural* skin but still covers blemishes, and feels light weight and fresh.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has evened (not as much of a drastic difference between a face with no make up vs. a face with make up).</li>
            <li> It LASTS for almost the whole day and looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply two to three applications depending on how much coverage you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> baby hahahaha</li>
            <li> , my skin just looks much healthier and even toned.</li>
            <li> Minimum needed, if too much is applied color will not match your skin color and will have a grayish tone.</li>
            <li> So thank ya&#x27;ll so much</li>
            <li> They are really just tinted moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> It really does seem to brighten my complexion too.  </li>
            <li> that can make you look very washed out.</li>
            <li> I really think my pores seem tighter</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> It actually blends quite well and is really light and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bug me too much.</li>
            <li> and it is the real product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone I meet!</li>
            <li> This seller really does prioritize customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> doens&#x27;t provide as much coverage</li>
            <li> This BB cream has really exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and I really have to agree.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be giving it that much use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a very cakey look that foundations do.</li>
            <li> it was all real.</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream for the summer months.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I will buy again and recommend to anyone who has oily skin or just wants makeup to stay on during summer months.</li>
            <li> I bought it here in Amazon since it has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> She loves it and thanks me for getting it for her.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product was so well packaged that it was probably bullet-proof.</li>
            <li> So, after hearing about BB cream from a friend, I found this cute pink bottle on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the real BB cream from Skin 79.</li>
            <li> This covers and smooths very well and the added moisture helps keep my skin condition under control.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t matter it just blends really well.  </li>
            <li> , this looks like the real deal.  </li>
            <li> And it ships so fast like no joke.</li>
            <li> However, it blends very well with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blends really well with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> but the cost was not so much</li>
            <li> This stuff has really transformed my skin.</li>
            <li> I am Native American and this stuff evens my skin tone and makes my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> light coverage (but can be used with concealer for extra coverage)</li>
            <li> It covers my acne scars and pores making my skin look smooth and air brushed.</li>
            <li> but I feel that I really need to brag about this one.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Controls oil..for a while (Coming from a person with really oily skin by the end of the day!)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> (I start oiling after 2 hours or so... which is reasonable...</li>
            <li> Not only is the cream itself smooth and</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> my very oily skin under control (I used to blot my face every 20 minutes, no joke</li>
            <li> Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about which products I put on my skin and do a lot of research before buying any product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a make up artist and work for a very well known cosmetics company which also has a beauty balm of sorts.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Blends very well, has 3 products in one.</li>
            <li> It is really convenient</li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s really girly</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference i.m.o).</li>
            <li> I hope that I will never RUN out haha</li>
            <li> I have light to medium color skin with yellow under tones.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading these reviews because you&#x27;re looking for the real deal, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (in fact it did very well)</li>
            <li> This product really does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much product is in the package.</li>
            <li> is much</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the real stuff</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very matted</li>
            <li> I actually really like the cream itself, but the container?  </li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li> for the Seller SeoulGlamour, 5-star for fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It does look grey when you first apply it but with the addition of your own personal face powder it evens out well.  </li>
            <li> I have light combination skin that needs moisture and oil control at the same time.</li>
            <li> the packaging was identical to the real skin 79 bb cream though.&lt;br /&gt;Btw</li>
            <li> I didnt really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY oily skin</li>
            <li> I received this within a week, thanks amazon.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d have to really pack it on.</li>
            <li> but since I wasn&#x27;t sure of the color, I ordered skin79 pink label on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like this so much, I ordered the travel size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and it has pretty much replaced my normal foundation (Lancome Teint Miracle).</li>
            <li> My skin has such a healthy glow throughout the day and it&#x27;s so amazingly natural looking.</li>
            <li> i cant wait to have my clear skin back :)</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d leave a review detailing my own personal experience with this bb cream, since it seems like the effectiveness of different brands and types varies a lot from person to person.</li>
            <li> As far as the color of this particular bb cream goes, I may have gotten lucky, because it&#x27;s a spot-on match with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> definitely see the \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot; effect that&#x27;s popular with Asian brands, but not to an unnatural extent.</li>
            <li> The product has nice coverage, without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I mix this product with my regular moisturizer before applying my foundation and it makes my skin so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Sure it goes on weird, but then it oxidizes nicely.</li>
            <li> I understand that a lot of Asian skincare products contain arbutin (whitening agent), and that it&#x27;s more natural than hydroquinone, but there&#x27;s that study out there that shows intestinal bacteria transforms arbutin into hydroquinone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure US BB creams have some of the same attributes, but just because of the cultural beauty differences I decided to go with this Korean one first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned caucasian with both pink and yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> I set it with my mineralize skinfinish natural (light) and mineralize skinfinish&lt;br /&gt;(light &amp; natural) and finish with fix+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t discontinue the use of this product, it has definitely replaced my old foundations.</li>
            <li> but it still conceals uneven tones nicely.</li>
            <li> but it still conceals uneven tones nicely.</li>
            <li> but in just a few minutes it blends nicely.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally oily face and this product doesn&#x27;t make it more oily and actually controls some of it.  </li>
            <li> Bronzing powder in &amp;#34;sun kissed&amp;#34; and got my yellow tones back (along with a really nice glow)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives good thick coverage without looking cakey.</li>
            <li> Plus of Missha BB cream, high SPF (maybe that why it seems more oily).&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for medium coverage Missha (if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrant), Etude House (if you don&#x27;t have dry skin).  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged and truly like the product very much, this is my second order and won&#x27;t be my last.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> no strong ingredients, no smell at all and its perfect especially for Asian skin</li>
            <li> Got to me in under a week from Korea, WOW!!!</li>
            <li> This one advertises a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; agent which is popular amongst pale skinned Asians.  </li>
            <li> This BB cream did exactly what I was wanting to avoid, it made my skin itch, especially in hot and humid conditions, and the color was just slightly off and didn&#x27;t adapt to my skin color.</li>
            <li> It quickly turned slick and oily, within 2 hours of wear, even when having powder on top.</li>
            <li> Good for lazy people!</li>
            <li> granted I live in hot and humid Florida.</li>
            <li> All positive that had been written above is true for my skin.</li>
            <li> it seems that is one kind of so-so foundation but not easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The coverage is pretty good, I usually only need a little concealer under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought the same exact BB cream from another site that sells authentic asian cosmetics, and I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between that one and this one I got from Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does start out gray when I first put it on, but after a while the color changes and looks very natural on me.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the seller sent me other BB Cream samples. :)</li>
            <li> However, after purchasing this, I did more research and spoke to friends who recommended other brands over Skin 79.     </li>
            <li> Then i do the rest of my makeup routine as normal!</li>
            <li> Also came with two samples of their other products Love the orange one I think</li>
            <li> People tend to stick with what works for them, so maybe people are okay with how it feels because it&#x27;s the first few BB creams that they&#x27;ve tried or it really just works for their skin.</li>
            <li> Some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried that I love are Holika Holika Luminous Silk BB cream and Elishacoy Noblesse Naturalism</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I truly love this product and can&#x27;t wait to explore other Skin 79 products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I truly love this product and can&#x27;t wait to explore other Skin 79 products.</li>
            <li> &quot; although if I don&#x27;t need to, I skip this step (because that stuff is wonderful but expensive!).</li>
            <li> other than that, I&#x27;m really satisfied.</li>
            <li> While I like the color of this BB cream (it&#x27;s a bit darker than most of the other BB creams I&#x27;ve used, so</li>
            <li> and it controls the oil better than any other BB cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> first thing, i received it 2 days early!</li>
            <li> If you order it from here make sure you get it from pink galee!</li>
            <li> But I was expecting a better product by reading other comments about it on the internet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting around with BB creams this past summer, but SKIN79&#x27;s Pink Label is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little hesitant about ordering this product since I&#x27;m pretty tanned, and most of my friends use BB cream to maintain a pale-white skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am sure am going to purchase other pieces of this product ...</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed, I will be buying again and will not be using a different type of cream.</li>
            <li> I do think that it does a better job of not settling into lines and wrinkles like other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I have tried other BB creams, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply since you pretty much just rub it in, and it&#x27;s hard to leave streaks on your face.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble skin for YEARS and after several weeks of using this cream as a foundation I have noticed remarkable results.</li>
            <li> Skin79 Hot pink bb cream is supposed to adjust to your skin color but the color is still too light for my complexion.</li>
            <li> My pores also seem to be less noticeable and my skin seems overall more smooth and even in tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t even need a full pump for my whole face, I&#x27;m guessing it will last a while, and the lost bit at the end will just be a part of the deal, though a bit of a bummer.</li>
            <li> I put a light film of it all over my complexion and allow to dry a moment, then add a light finish of my regular foundation.</li>
            <li> Prior to discovering this product, I was wearing L&#x27;oreal Bare Naturale mineral foundation, because liquid foundation always made my skin more oily and acne-prone.</li>
            <li> Also after the few minutes of the cream oxidizing or whatever it does :) it really set in my skin and once I felt my face, it didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing anything!</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I was shocked at how gray it appeared, but after I rubbed it in, it took away any redness and discoloration and provided a perfect palette for bronzer and blush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old, have a ton of freckles with pretty oily skin that is also very break-out prone.</li>
            <li> I got very scared at first when I opened it, because on the authenticity label, there wasn&#x27;t a clear VOID printed across, but a rather holographic one.</li>
            <li> Tis BB creme is not bad, at least better than my ex Garnier BB creme.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL BB cream, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps, done a little research to see which brand of BB creams come out with the most positive reviews.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of startling because it&#x27;s so gray, but somehow it quickly changes color and blends right it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Some things to consider: I&#x27;m not incredibly pale, but I am pale enough that this BB cream matched perfectly with my skin, so someone that&#x27;s darker complected or has an olive tone might want to try some of the others that are tinted differently.</li>

            <li> It was a good purchase, I look fine after I put on a little blush or bronzer, which I usually put on anyway when I wear foundation, but I can&#x27;t certainly leave the house just with it on.</li>
            <li> Considering the reviews I saw, Skin79 was (and is still) one of the most highly sought BB creams due to its &#x27;effectiveness&#x27; and price.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast (2 weeks earlier arrival than the earliest predicted arrival date).</li>
            <li> I leaves my skin super soft so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered my BB cream on June 9 and received it about a week and a half later, which was such a good surprise!</li>
            <li> All in all I am very satisfied with this product and will be trying other Skin79 items in the future!</li>
            <li> I could tell how much was left and also be sure I got every last bit out of it.</li>
            <li> I have full bangs that fall across my forehead, so an oily forehead is inevitable.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I have sensitive skin with a skin tone that is medium with neutral undertones.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using this product and I received it in early January</li>
            <li> The gold felt more moisturizing but also felt too thick and the coverage was more sheer.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin the SPF protection it needs when I&#x27;m occasionally in the sun, and has such a light feel that I rarely notice it is there.</li>
            <li> Even though my skin is dark, I love this product and I use a powder to match my skin over it.</li>
            <li> your skin is dark or light , it will turn to the gray !</li>
            <li> In my opinion, they are so much better than your average</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and prone to acne.  </li>
            <li> But if I only use it here and there, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I do feel my skin looks more uniform and some of the blotchiness I had has calmed down.</li>
            <li> Ver very good product,  if its the original ones be careful of getting fake ones.</li>
            <li> When you receive your product for Pink Gelee they send you a little thank you card, which I thought was great.</li>
            <li> Skin color: Very fair (NC 15 is still a shade too dark for me :/ ),</li>
            <li> I had recently seen a documentary talking about what&#x27;s perceived as beautiful in different cultures, especially the ones that were particularly contrasting.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down, and I&#x27;ve tried close to 20, mostly Asian but some European and American brands too.</li>
            <li> The product felt extremely light on my face and smooth to the touch, I was not left with a sticky residue on my finger like other foundations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to think about how much money I have thrown away trying new foundations..</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin and live in a very humid place which just exacerbates my acne.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much since using it and it is my new go to product.</li>
            <li> I love the color, it isn&#x27;t too light like other BB Creams but actually blends into my skin really nicely (and I am not a light skinned Asian).</li>
            <li> It looked amazing, and even without powder, it dried to a natural matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> color matched mostly matched my skin tone, although it made me look slightly paler.</li>
            <li> It provides some coverage (more than a tinted moisturizer, less than a foundation).</li>
            <li> After using this, I&#x27;m relatively sure I&#x27;ll never go back to using regular foundation again.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly and the seller also provided some extra samples.</li>
            <li> The bb cream looks decent and have a natral smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent BB cream, but I have yet to benefit from all of the \\&quot;triple</li>
            <li> I have started on laser treatment recently and am getting good results, and I didn&#x27;t want to jeopardize that by continuing w/ my heavy make-ups</li>
            <li> It covers blemishes decently well, but a concealer may be required.</li>
            <li> I left a star out just because I would rather be able to see the inside of the container to see how much is left over</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what this particular product is meant for?</li>
            <li> There are many websites/blogs/videos devoted to educating us on the differences between the fake products and the authentic ones.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is the actual product looks and feels totally different from the authentic product.  </li>
            <li> I think this particular BB cream is part of a conspiracy.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this four stars was mainly because it broke me out.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks of using this daily and going to see family, my mother was quick to comment on my even skin tone.</li>
            <li> feels so soft and clean and you only need one or two pumps to cover your whole face (less is more)</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a steady medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been decent with oil control, better than anything I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> This one looks particularly gray, but like every BB cream, it will adjust.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll be lucky with a different Skin79 line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for everyday low maintenance look.  </li>
            <li> Decent size</li>
            <li> Thinking maybe foundations were the issue, I switched to BB Creams, and have tried several, but SKIN79 has been the first to do what it says it does---for the first time, I have NO ACNE.</li>
            <li> I love this product and this is my 2nd time ordering from the same seller.</li>
            <li> The expression lines on my forehead are actually noticeably diminished, my pores appear tighter, and my skin is baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skin tone white but not ghost not light tan either...  </li>
            <li> It does feel different on my skin, kind of wet, not oily.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I feel like this BB cream in particular</li>
            <li> in all I am really satisfied with this BB cream and definitely recommend it, especially to those who have problematic skin.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone, and it moisturizes decently.</li>
            <li> (This is one main reason why I like it</li>
            <li> Now that I feel like I have it reasonably under control, I set out to find an alternative to foundation, as I felt sure use of heavy make-ups (no matter the brand) was contributing to my skin issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I took off one star is that I do find that by the end of the day it definitely needs some touching up</li>
            <li> This particular BB Cream is supposed to have sebum control and help minimize the look of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It comes off a little grayish and is meant or someone with a very light complexion.  </li>
            <li> I finish my nose area with a little mineral foundation and very light powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Korean, so I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned too, but it was a little lighter than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Very even and very natural.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single skin reaction, and I believe it to be genuine product.</li>
            <li> I really cannot believe how well this product works to keep my skin looking clear!  </li>
            <li> seller was Blue Queen and the Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t mess up my skin but didn&#x27;t do anything to make it better either.</li>
            <li> Got three different ones past half a year or so, this one is the best of them all - adjusts to skin tone, is not heavy, looks natural, really cool.</li>
            <li> Then, I use some concealer under my eyes and finish up with MAC loose powder in light.  </li>
            <li> I set it with Maybelline Shine Free loose powder and have noticed a substantial decrease in the oiliness and shine of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it better than the Misha BB cream I have, This one has a very settle essence, not strong compared to the Misha.</li>
            <li> me, this is like a tinted moisturizer with high spf....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the seller of this product, seoulglamour.</li>
            <li> but I highly disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Evens out skin tone, covers blemishes and controls oil</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and have told all my friends about it.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i highly recomend that you use it</li>
            <li> But maybe I had too high of an expectation.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After carefully reviewing several youtube videos and the SKIN79 website I am confident that Pink Gellee sells authentic products</li>
            <li> Because I have oily skin, I have a high chance of breaking out when using make-up.</li>
            <li> OR, if you want to try Skin79&#x27;s brand (which I highly recommend) they have a chart here:</li>
            <li> I bought this in high hopes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the high reviews.</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;m such a product junkie, I have tried other BB creams from Missha signature, Holika Holika, the face shop, and they are all goon in their own way..</li>
            <li> Anywho, I picked the pink one first because it contained a few more interesting ingredients than the orange and gold versions (in my personal opinion).</li>
            <li> This one does not come in multiple shades as other brands do, but it does blend-in nicely.</li>
            <li> , obviously, I was not expecting an all natural, vegan friendly, packaged in 100% recycled plastic product.</li>
            <li> I am very young however, so I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, and it&#x27;s possible it was simply a placebo effect.</li>
            <li> I am very young however, so I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, and it&#x27;s possible it was simply a placebo effect.</li>
            <li> The colour is a little dark for my skin (I&#x27;m super pale) but the application of it is perfect and it covers up what I need to cover up.</li>
            <li> They even sent  a little thank you card :)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little more</li>
            <li> I need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> and i think it works a little better than this one</li>
            <li> , he says it looks like clay, no matter how little I put on, so I was pleased to hear that this blends into the skin and boy does it.</li>
            <li> I just dabbed a little more on those spots and they disappeared.</li>
            <li> this coloring is a little better than the gold label so i can wear it without adding any foundation.  </li>
            <li> It is a little thicker and provides better coverage.</li>
            <li> but after i let it sit a little it adapts to my skin mostly.</li>
            <li> I just wish it&#x27;d be a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I will apply a translucent or lighter powder over it to finish and to try to match my skin tone a little better.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing the orange label yesterday hoping it might match my skin tone a little better.</li>
            <li> However, it kinda makes your skin look ever so slighty grayish, but it&#x27;s nothing a little bronzer or setting powder can&#x27;t fix :)  </li>
            <li> I apply one layer all over my face with my fingers and then i will take a little bit more and tap it onto places i need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> Just wish what was inside was a little better.</li>
            <li> I apply the BB cream with my finger tips, putting a little more on my under eye circles and acne scars.</li>
            <li> Although it felt a bit oily when first applied, after it completely dried it was fine.</li>
            <li> Not as thick in feel and in coverage as others (particularly Dr. Jart+) which translates to not as nice of coverage.</li>
            <li> With the patting it will easily cover acne, or any other issue you may be using this product for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a little light at first</li>
            <li> , so this was a little light when i first applied it</li>
            <li> The kind where you squeeze your nose and a white/clear hard thing comes out.</li>
            <li> The only issue i ran initially was the greying of the skin, but I think once you use the right quantity which is very less you are good.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t holding out high hopes, as my skin has become a source of stress and irritation lately, but I&#x27;m loving this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally though, I do believe that the \\&quot;silver label\\&quot; Beblesh Balm offers more coverage overall and prefer it to this particular one.</li>
            <li> But, really, here&#x27;s the complete description</li>
            <li> so I was actually surprised that one pump does do the whole face.</li>
            <li> Definitely buy this product if you are looking for a great everyday make up, the American BB creams have nothing on this!</li>
            <li> Pink Label fit the bill and matched my need for an acne-friendly version.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look really matte and natural-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a thick coverage -</li>
            <li> Regardless, the product felt great on my angry skin</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this BB cream does much for oil control, but then again I was not expecting it to miraculously halt my skin&#x27;s natural processes.</li>
            <li> and wow it does really work with my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like that this has \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; benefits because i have lots of old acne marks.</li>
            <li> no one will be able to tell I&#x27;m using any &#x27;make up&#x27; because it will match your skin tone after a few minutes of putting it on</li>
            <li> As a person who doesn&#x27;t normally wear makeup, I heard of BB cream from a friend and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have to use my normal foundation and powder over it.     </li>
            <li> I purchased this one for my 11 year old daughter, it goes on so smoothly, there is a grey cast as you&#x27;re blending it in</li>
            <li> So when I use this I probably have the equivelent of normal skin.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered acne proplems and my skin is usually very oily in my T-zone, especially during the hot, humid summer months.  </li>
            <li> This will work nicely on normal skin</li>
            <li> Keep in mind though that it doesn&#x27;t cover as much as a normal foundation, for example it doesn&#x27;t cover my freckles..</li>
            <li> Sure you&#x27;re saving a few bucks</li>
            <li> , there were a few others which looked like they could be better than skin79&#x27;s, but the bottle shape and color won me over HAHA)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The redness on my cheeks was totally evened out, and the minor fading blemishes I had on my cheek somehow looked more like freckles than healing acne</li>
            <li> I may want to try the golden one with lighter color next time.</li>
            <li> A few more bucks, but</li>
            <li> If your skin isn&#x27;t acne-prone like mine, you may be able to use this without trouble.</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> even I was a bit more heavy handed with it - they say it builds up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like to leave reviews, but I felt this deserves one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s completely normal for some people</li>
            <li> It was more like a heavy foundation that did not match my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li> It was a bit thicker than what I&#x27;m used to putting on my face, but it applied smoothly when I warmed it between my fingers for a few seconds first.</li>
            <li> so I continued with my normal routine.</li>
            <li> But I just go with my normal cleanser routine</li>
            <li> But then, i stumbled upon this website and they say that a holographic VOID is normal on the sticker.</li>
            <li> There are a few okay ones, but this one blows them all away.</li>
            <li> I used two pumps of the BB and got a face full of shinny grey.</li>
            <li> watching too many YouTube videos I figured out a few tricks:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> and normally I can&#x27;t wear BB creams or even foundation without breaking out.</li>
            <li> It feels too oily at first (and if you slap on too much before running out the door you will feel gross for a couple of hours)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write review</li>
            <li> I even tried to cover it up with my normal foundation and it was still gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I found that the cream seemed kind of thick</li>
            <li> I used to moisturize and then add foundation and powder, now I just use this right out of the shower, no makeup sponge necessary, and brush a little powder on top.</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to apply and a little seems to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better than any other BB Creams I have used!</li>
            <li> My favorite was probably bare escentuals but the cost was too high after adding up the foundation, concealer, mineral veil, and other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it looks natural, feels great, improved my skins look and feel, and provides a good sunblock (I&#x27;ve been out in the sun a lot these past few weeks...and am very pale...</li>
            <li> And of course in the winter when my skin is more pale, I think there will be no difference at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying I am going to copy and paste this review onto the GOLD version because I alternate between the two, the GOLD is more moisturizing for when I dry out.</li>
            <li> own 12 different BB creams - half of them which are samples.</li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t, foundation easily covers up my freckles, and the second you put your hand on your face and touch a doorknob or keyboard later in the day</li>
            <li> I am Asian and I just know the color is right for me</li>
            <li> The pimples are now going away after switching back, so that makes me think maybe this SKIN79 BB cream isn&#x27;t right for my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin79 and Asian BB creams knows how to do it right.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my skin besides the break outs, but I can say I still find it worth using daily, and works as a great base for a full make up application.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t really have great buildable coverage like typical foundations and other BB creams - it&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re wearing a gray mask if you attempt a second application.</li>
            <li> the short time I used it like others said, it went on slightly grey but after a few minutes matched into my skin and looked nice- smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> It came out of the bottle a bit gray-ish, but that was normal, and it oxidized to a very natural looking shade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little light for my skin at the moment, but not so much to be noticeable to anyone</li>
            <li> , i really like the real skin 79 hot pink bb cream that i bought on the skin79nothamerica website</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also left my skin feeling a little oily, which I kind of understand since it has SPF.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of BB creams at first and did a ton of research before actually buying one and found that the REAL BB creams (originally from Korea) were the way to go and man, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, so it gets up to 100 degrees.</li>
            <li> (They are based in LA, and I live 30 minutes from there</li>
            <li> All ladies have their beauty products they can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> and I was kinda scared to try a new BB cream.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new bottle from BB Cosmetic when my ran out.</li>
            <li> I used this new bottle for a couple weeks when I started breaking out.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve been reading that the new bottles manufactured in 2013 will no longer have the sticker.</li>
            <li> Also, I have acne prone skin &amp; when trying new products, 9 times out of 10, I break out.  </li>
            <li> The store bought BB creams are just tinted moisturizers under new labels.</li>
            <li> New skin.</li>
            <li> and thought how it would live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Bought this after trying the new Garnier BB and liking it.  </li>
            <li> (I live in Florida).</li>
            <li> and my face looks way better than before and less breakouts, other things that I observed is that my pores are less noticeable, and my face looks flawless and and more radiant even than before, and also I observed that my dark circles are less noticeable than before, I only apply this BB cream, and no concealer</li>
            <li> It creates a nice, natural look with hardly any effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t very dark so most of the time I just put it on and leave it but putting some powder on after applying the BB cream will help it to blend into your natural skin color a lot</li>
            <li> My complexion isn&#x27;t really that light or dark for a Mexican, but the cream blends in really nicely and gets rid of the small blemishes I have from sun exposure, acne, etc.</li>
            <li> I used wayyy too much the first time, because A lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and you definitely have to follow the instructions and pat the product into your skin after the initial application.</li>
            <li> The skin79 hot pink bb bottle was my FIRST foray into BB creams and</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I used the Skin79 chart (on their website) to choose if I wanted this item (pink) versus the gold version, and that chart led me to believe this would better suit my skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re afraid of the gray tone or find this BB cream too light even after waiting for it to adjust, mix in a dab of foundation or concealer that is a shade or two darker than your own.</li>
            <li> light or white for my asian skin</li>
            <li> After a few days it rose to the surface of my skin- really gross.</li>
            <li> and it still hasn&#x27;t broken me out, which is surprising because my skin is so sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li> But overall I am extremely pleased, this went above and beyond my already high expectations, and I would definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it gives me a very natural look</li>
            <li> Looks very natural on my skin (light-medium olive/yellow undertones)</li>
            <li> but I am very sensitive to this problem.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> but I have been very busy.</li>
            <li> Granted, I do have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This cream gives me the coverage I love with using very little.</li>
            <li> watched a you-tube video, but the first time I used a bit too much and didn&#x27;t let it dry between layers.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with this product, as an Asian with a slightly darker skin tone on my face in comparison to the rest of my body due to sun tan, this works quite well in evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference with my skin tone - it covered up my dark spots and blemish scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to keep my skin clear!  </li>
            <li> ) ingredients help clear up my skin!</li>
            <li> Also bought Smash Box BB cream and tried many other American brands BB creams (Dior, Boscia, Too Face, Tarte).  </li>
            <li> It does look a bit white when you first put it on</li>
            <li> They are the EXACT same thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it for over 12 hours, and it still looks the same when I take it off, as it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> Its better to buy expensive ones frm the original website.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this daily since I first ordered it in August 2013.  </li>
            <li> This is actually the first time I have ever applied foundation of any sort.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that my forehead wasn&#x27;t that oily, and I have oily roots!</li>
            <li> If I can still see a blemish after my first application, a tiny bit more cream applied to the spot usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the real product has had both descriptions but it raised my suspicions.</li>
            <li> Even when applying it, I didn&#x27;t notice that gray cast that others have commented on (maybe that means my skin is naturally gray?!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty white</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve kept up with me so far, hooray!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I am a brunnete with beige - ginger type of skin - (not asia), at first when I put in my face looks very white, but then blends in.</li>
            <li> After my first and only use of it I broke out in a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> Just beware if you have a darker skintone because the BB cream is pretty white and may not match your skin color.</li>
            <li> but the product seems different from first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It made me way more oily than usual.</li>
            <li> but it blends with anyone&#x27;s skintone perfectly, light or dark.</li>
            <li> I have asian skin, so the color matches pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have heard that SKIN79&#x27;s other product, the VIP Gold one, is a bit better for somewhat tan skin, but I can&#x27;t personally vouch for that.&lt;br /&gt;(On</li>
            <li> In other words, I still look like me, only better.</li>
            <li> I use my rosacea cream first, then my daily spf, then an oil-free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The ones on the American market are pretty sub-par compared to the ones over there (per users that have tried both).</li>
            <li> I stopped using this during my last menstrual period and sure enough my period is back on track.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been very pleased, and for the price everyone should at least try this!</li>
            <li> Also, the shipping was actually quite fast!</li>
            <li> The Skin79 BB cream is a third of the price of the Smashbox, and it works better than more expensive foundations I have used over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my skin is extremely soft, never gets sunburned, and never gets acne- EVER!</li>
            <li> My face has been so soft since I started using it!</li>
            <li> I love using this product other than buying the american ones coz the ingredients of it</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter and most of all my pores are getting small.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I have oily/acne prone skin and still suffer from breakouts in my mid 20s</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish it had a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> After I blended it, I found that it matched my skin pretty well actually.</li>
            <li> For being oily when it goes on, it actually controls oil pretty well</li>
            <li> I noticed I occasionally get pimples on hot days</li>
            <li> Because I tried all of the western and most of the Korean more expensive BB creams and this one does its job</li>
            <li> and it just look so natural!</li>
            <li> I notice some show up with pretty deep groves in which now I know there is a health issue going on.</li>
            <li> Drugstore products do the same without the higher price tag.</li>
            <li> did make sure to scrub my face every night because I think the thickness of the cream could cause breakouts if you get lazy and don&#x27;t remove</li>
            <li> Most of the other products I tried wouldn&#x27;t cover enough</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure if people with darker skin tones will be able to use this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so that might be a factor to consider when ordering) Inside included a card saying thank you  and a sample of the Pink and Gold versions, which was sweet</li>
            <li> I ordered from Pink Gelee, and got a sample as well as a sweet note.</li>
            <li> If you have fair skin, and have trouble finding a makeup to accentuate your skin, you need to get this... and it doesn&#x27;t smell like other makeups either.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding the right face makeup because it&#x27;s either too warm or too pink.</li>
            <li> He said he couldn&#x27;t tell (which was a very nice white lie I think), but added that the right-side (BB side) was less red than the left -- score!</li>
            <li> Love the concealing effect - it really whitens my olive skin (I&#x27;m Asian) but doesn&#x27;t make me look too pale.</li>
            <li> I also love how the BB Cream isn&#x27;t too sheer nor too thick, but gives the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent although it fades pretty fast so if it bothers you, I&#x27;m not sure if it would matter so much</li>
            <li> Even though, you can build for more coverage, but I&#x27;d not recommended b/c it will look very heavy.  </li>
            <li> It was much more popular than I expected, so I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m probably very behind on discovering this product.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in the rest of my routine, I finish off my very natural look with Bare Minerals foundation in Fairly-Medium all over and add some Bare Minerals Warmth in the summer.</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick, and at first I was concerned that I would not be able to blend it evenly.</li>
            <li> I am unfortunately not sure how well of a matte though it acts because I live in a desert so its very easy to have oily skin in no time, but in normal conditions such as staying indoors all day, this BB cream does stay on for quite some time.   </li>
            <li> I love that there is SPF, just can&#x27;t really figure out how SPF derived since no real ingredient list since it&#x27;s foreign product.</li>
            <li> (I found out that I don&#x27;t live that far from the seller&#x27;s city).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was just slightly too light for her as an all-over foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m acne prone, scar easily, and have uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Dior BB creams are more of yellow tone and dark.  </li>
            <li> This cream is exactly what I have always needed for my skin, and at 27 years old, I have finally found it.  </li>
            <li> the SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream (Pink Label).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 28, 2013 Update&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> First of all, Pink Gelee has some FAST shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Pink Gelee, came SUPER fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try the pink label Super+</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think this is the real skin 79 hot pink bb cream.</li>
            <li> Pretty much gave up on them and continued filling a drawer with drugstore make up that was too pink, oily, drying, or over oxidizing.</li>
            <li> It does actually settle more into your skintone as time passes, but if you are yellow toned and darker, it will read like a pale greyish pink on your skin if you do not use something on top.  </li>
            <li> I am 35 yrs old but look very young.</li>
            <li> It feels very light and offers a light to medium coverage, whereas usually BB creams offer medium to heavy coverage.</li>
            <li> I noted the large number of positive reviews for Skin 79 Pink Label and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Beblesh Balm BB Cream VIP Gold (Gold Label) 40g (Autheticity label &amp; perforations with Free Hot Pink Sample!!!)]]) has what is termed as \\&quot;skin nourishment\\&quot; or just extra skin moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The color seemed spot on, which is the only positive statement I can make.</li>
            <li> I may use it for special occasions where I wont be doing anything active, like dancing.</li>
            <li> : Caused a slight breakout along my chin and unfortunately didn&#x27;t match my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> It always looks so amazing when you first put it on, but wait a few hours, do a few things, and you&#x27;ll notice considerable deterioration of the look of your make up.</li>
            <li> I use it daily for the most part, but I am admittedly lazy about it -- even not remembering to use it everyday, the results are STILL stunning.</li>
            <li> I had several dark spots from old acne breakouts that have completely disappeared and my skin tone looks much more even.</li>
            <li> This product is the very first BB cream that actually matches my skin tone... and not only that</li>
            <li> it also has more of a yellow under tone, so it matches my skin more than the American make-ups that usually has peach or pink tone bases.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly might worry someone with different toned skin.</li>
            <li> Discourage anyone else darker to purchase this unless you want to use as a primer/sunscreen under your regular makeup which you can certainly do.  </li>
            <li> all the \\&quot;traditional korean ingredients\\&quot; are pure</li>
            <li> do have pretty dry skin and am in my 40&#x27;s (plus live in the desert)</li>
            <li> and I tend to prefer my makeup a little bit light as it seems like it illuminates your skin from beneath.  </li>
            <li> I followed with a light dusting of finishing powder and then a little blush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is a little to light for my skin</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, after some research I found a lady who bought it full price from a local authorized retailer, and the real product also has this typo, which made me extremely</li>
            <li> Applying a little will keep the face hydrated and feeling light as air without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applying a little will keep the face hydrated and feeling light as air without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so its just a light application, over my problem areas just for a little added coverage.</li>
            <li> I use a light dusting of powder over it or it would be a little shiny for me.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little light for my skin tone</li>
            <li> I would definitely repurchase Skin79 Pink Label from Pink Gelee since I know they sell authentic products!</li>
            <li> I have only started using it for a few days, and it is very lightweight and smooth and feels very natural on the skin.</li>
            <li> I will continue to order for years to come, although I don&#x27;t anticipate having to do it often since you get such a generous amount in this lovely little package!ou.</li>
            <li> use this over most of my face, especially the T zone where I tend to be a little redder.</li>
            <li> , I noticed that the pores on my nose which is where I have a lot of black heads shrunk significantly.</li>
            <li> I do a bit of both every day but always on top of moisturizer because this tends to be hard to massage/blend in by itself.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews it does appear to go on with a grayish tinge, but quickly fades.</li>
            <li> in conclusion, I highly recommend these BB Creams: Skin79 Hot Pink, Skin79 Gold,</li>
            <li> I am asian and it is lighter than my skin a little bit (I also applied a darker one on top of it to make my skin look natural).</li>
            <li> previously purchased a Sigma flat top makeup brush, and just now retried this BB cream using the brush.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, it is pretty light and not grossly thick, so sometimes, it requires some extra dabbing for those hard to cover spots.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I do get eczema occasionally on my body.</li>
            <li> Under Primer (clear)</li>
            <li> Literally just got it out of the mail, only blended it on my hand, will update this when I start using it like tomorrow, but so far blends very well;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the Cetaphil cream under this to see if that helps me go the whole day, as that seems to be the gold standard for those with sensitive skin, but who also require a lot of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The listing didn&#x27;t have a clear description on what skin color / complexion this would work on.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and I can thank this product for contributing to that.</li>
            <li> I was surprised recently when I noticed that my pores were much reduced and my skin was clearer.  </li>
            <li> Clear skin?</li>
            <li> Well so far I&#x27;ve had the product for about a week</li>
            <li> Professional makeup artist and skin care specialist.</li>
            <li> I have had acne roseacea since i was eight years old (I&#x27;m 33).</li>
            <li> and it looks so natural, protects her skin from the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> Skin 79 BB cream is for the all natural look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for my holy grail product for my oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin one bit.  </li>
            <li> color is grey which can be offsetting at first but once its blended into the skin</li>
            <li> I know people are saying this is target for Asian market, but I really do like it</li>
            <li> Under fluorescent lighting and in flash photos the cream gives my face a ghastly, grayish cast, despite it looking semi-normal in natural lighting.</li>
            <li> Again, even though it doen&#x27;t have complete coverage, it evens out my skin that it doesn&#x27;t look blotchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I wanted natural, which I got with this.</li>
            <li> The color may appear slightly grey at first, keep blending and don&#x27;t freak out.</li>
            <li> Skin will look airbrushed and natural.</li>
            <li> If you look at the ingredients for this product they are all natural (which can not be said for the foundation, sunscreen, acne treatment and</li>
            <li> My face looks so soft and glowing because of this product.</li>
            <li> old with combo skin.  </li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s not my skin tone, once you rub it in it looks natural.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and as far as I can tell (using the internet as a reference)</li>
            <li> This cream offers medium coverage.</li>
            <li> And WOW.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the hue and undertones were NOT pinkish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the sellers/manufacturers out there that want to sell the fake stuff will fix that difference soon as they have many of the others differences that distinguish between the authentic and fake products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Wondering why the long gap between the time I first found it and used it to the now review?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Two stars because as far as I can tell it isn&#x27;t lying about the SPF25 part.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give off the natural matte look that I prefer for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I got this from Blue Queen and I received the real thing.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any way to tell how much product is left though, as the packaging is too opaque.</li>
            <li> Even the Neutrogena sensitive skin lotion did not play well with my face, and this has caused no issues (except a bit of dryness)</li>
            <li> I have a tan, brown skin and this product really makes my face look white alone.</li>
            <li> The cream feels soft on the skin, no complaints there.  </li>
            <li> However, I have to say this is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> (it is not heavy or oil).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any complaints and so far 3 of my friends have switched.</li>
            <li> I found it left my skin very oily and shiny.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover much at all, if anything, yet it left a gray cast on my face.</li>
            <li> It covers to make a noticeable but natural difference.</li>
            <li> I use a kabuki brush to get an even and complete coverage.</li>
            <li> how ever i rated this 4 because sometimes it doesn&#x27;t look natural under fluorescent lighting and in flash photos..</li>
            <li> well with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> I feel it really makes my eyes look bigger by evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I tend to keep my face natural</li>
            <li> But that can always be fixed with some concealer.</li>
            <li> It also brightened up my face, which I was really surprised to see.</li>
            <li> And wow, it does wonders</li>
            <li> I would give this product 10 stars for all that it offers.</li>
            <li> I suspect it&#x27;s not as natural as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> The fact that it feels greasy if I use too much makes me think that it might be so I wont use this product daily.</li>
            <li> If you have any skin tone but completely fair/ivory, don&#x27;t buy this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nearly $5/bottle.  </li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t look natural on me.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to have a considerable amount of time of using this before I wrote a review on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I smoked for 5 years and completely quit since Sept. 2011 when I found out</li>
            <li> Additionally, the coverage is sheer, but still evens out my tone really well.</li>
            <li> but they do not cover pimples completely.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t look obvious or cakey at all but covers really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, no skin issues as a result.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t irritated it.</li>
            <li> I tend towards having sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I outlined all of that for you is because it is important to take note that this product WILL NOT fit every skin type and tone, and it is not intended to.</li>
            <li> being said, this product applies like a dream: creamy, balmy, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The drying time is pretty long.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any change in my complexion in terms of acne (no different than my skin was before using this product) and have been very</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this BB cream</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I am 15 years old and a guy by the way.</li>
            <li> I also should add that my skin is naturally</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great, natural looking makeup?</li>
            <li> So far no breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds, from expensive Clinique to cheap E.L.F. For those of you who know my tale of woe, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> I feel like if you put on just enough and not too much, you won&#x27;t run into that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, I COMPLETELY recommend this.</li>
            <li> I feel like if you put on just enough and not too much, you won&#x27;t run into that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, I COMPLETELY recommend this.</li>
            <li> and this one feels soft and silky,</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes my skin look natural and</li>
            <li> I still powder over it with a powder that matches my face to help it just blend seamlessly, so I can&#x27;t wear it alone.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> but it does eventually even out to your natural skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin that is also sensitive</li>
            <li> bought this product because I have really acne-prone skin and regular foundation</li>
            <li> but it loses the greasiness as you spread it out even more.</li>
            <li> and then you can see the difference between my natural skin color near my scalp</li>
            <li> The BB cream I received came earlier than predicted AND is a real SKIN79 product.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen SPF30 Sensitive Ski(Love it-</li>
            <li> Wow-</li>
            <li> Then use the VIP Gold BB for forehead, surrounding eye area and cheeks to add hydration and natural coverage of imperfections where I dont break out...</li>
            <li> After a few minutes the whiteness went away and I ended up with perfectly smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Everyone tells me my face looks so soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I am completely head over heels with this BB cream.</li>
            <li> As I hit my early 30s</li>
            <li> ; it looks completely natural, never cakey.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a day or 2 of stopping use the bumps went away completely.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m Hispanic, 24 yr old,</li>
            <li> When you first apply it has a grey tinge to it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how much I have left because the container isn&#x27;t clear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love BB cream, because it replaces foundation and concealer (at least for me)...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and STILL get acne breakouts, to say I have combination skin is a cop out.</li>
            <li> I tried some on my 77 year old Mother and after just wearing it one day, she begged me to order some for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To apply I pat on and let it sit, it seems like it takes a few minutes to absorb, and then I smooth with a cosmetic sponge.</li>
            <li> I also use a brush that is a combo of natural and synthetic hairs.</li>
            <li> I have given up liquid foundation completely.</li>
            <li> for I am of a naturally tan skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t give me any problems.  </li>
            <li> Actually blends to match your tone within reasonable limits</li>
            <li> It has 15 natural ingredients!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a considerable improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and this BB cream hasn&#x27;t caused any blemishes.</li>
            <li> We have a real one bought from the company&#x27;s website and they are different as is the packaging.</li>
            <li> It does not have complete coverage</li>
            <li> it leaves my face feeling soft and it is not heavy at all on my face</li>
            <li> I still have to use quite a bit of bronzer to look natural.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they were really old samples, I will never know.</li>
            <li> Only have been using it a few weeks, but love it so</li>
            <li> Provides light natural looking coverage, does not feel heavy on the face</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s more likely because I&#x27;m don&#x27;t apply heavy make-up</li>
            <li> , if I need to conceal any really dark spots, I use MAKE UP FOREVER \\&quot;Professional Full Cover.\\</li>
            <li> I used it only a few times and bought more.  </li>
            <li> It also does not have the extent of coverage that Face Shop brands have, so I was forced to use more of it.</li>
            <li> I do have two bottles of expensive and good coverage foundations</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s not too thick and mask-like like some foundations.</li>
            <li> Most days I only use this product on my face, not a super heavy amount (not even a full pump).  </li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that the container/dispenser doesn&#x27;t help keeping my makeup bag clean, the liquid kind of leaks out a little even if I wipe it off after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> The SKIN79 cream is good, it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t understand why they have to make it a grey color that is hard to blend!  </li>
            <li> I kept my old bottle and compared with this new one and the new one does not have an authenticity sticker like my old one and the text spacing is different.</li>
            <li> This was a very good fake with no other obvious \\&quot;tells\\&quot; outside of the sticker.</li>
            <li> The only other warning I have is to be sure you are buying the actual product as there are some fakes on the market!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend it to my other olive-toned friends.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a problem finding the right colored makeup, as my skin tone is between pink and beige.</li>
            <li> The cream arrived much earlier than expected, that was a plus since I was majorly excited to get it.</li>
            <li> Further, included in the package were free samples of other types of BB Cream which I look forward to trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn’t want to try it longer because I usually don’t break out with foundations easily ,  </li>
            <li> The Korean BB creams also seemed to moisturize and smoother application, the Garnier &amp; Loreal seemed to dry out as the day went on so my face would look pretty shiny end of day.</li>
            <li> and I exfoliate a few times a week with a polishing brush, but I have never noticed this kind of effect with any other cosmetic product.</li>
            <li> The coverage is good enough to reduce the appearance of minor imperfections such as old acne scars and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The packaging is great; it looks mid-end (as in, not cheap but not super expensive IMO), and the little pump works great.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot little bit goes a long way especially if you buy one of those nice tear</li>
            <li> When I first apply the produce my face would be a very light pale color, but it will all blend after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is an average product and definitely can’t replace foundation for those who prefer more and longer lasting coverage, oil control, and natural products.</li>
            <li> I will continue to order for years to come, although I don&#x27;t anticipate having to do it often since you get such a generous amount in this lovely little package!</li>
            <li> So when I first tried this product, it didn&#x27;t really do much for me accept that it made my face a little whiter.</li>
            <li> However, I feel like the color is a little bit more on the grey side which is the reason I gave it a four star.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to the Asian BBs from a makeup forum discussion, and after doing much research, I wanted to try the Skin79 Hot Pink.</li>
            <li> I used up the bottle and purchased again through amazon through another seller because it was not available through the original seller.</li>
            <li> so it was definitely worth trying, maybe I&#x27;ll explore their other products to see if they have anything to specifically target my oily skin.</li>
            <li> good enough coverage that I wear it alone on normal days (it doesn&#x27;t cover dark spots, so when I go out, I just spot cover with a little of my regular</li>
            <li> The documentary briefly brought up the desire for pale preserved skin in most Asian countries as opposed to the desired golden goddess tan desired in the North American countries.</li>
            <li> guess I should have known that since one of the claims of this product is that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;whitening,&amp;#34; that it&#x27;s mainly for Asian women who want to look paler (which, why??</li>
            <li> But this product works for me pretty much all year round.</li>
            <li> I wear this over a light moisturizer, and it instantly improves my complexion (dark spots, blemishes).  </li>
            <li> I have slightly combination skin with a mildly oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty big, it looks likes it will last for awhile.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did was to make sure it wasn&#x27;t fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure if you are supposed to be able to see the inside container through the outside...</li>
            <li> The shipper had a really long estimated time of shipment but then had it ready early and sent it to me within a couple weeks of ordering.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m never going back to liquid foundation, liquid concealer or tinted moisturizer again!</li>
            <li> I have found that since I gotten a little older that less is more, as far as make up goes, and this reaaly works for me.</li>
            <li> When you wear this without makeup, it does not look very natural because 1) its gray tint and 2) not easy to spread on the skin without adequate moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product at all; it does work a little bit</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it gives a shiny look, but it can be easily corrected with bloat powder!</li>
            <li> I tried a few washed-down American BB creams and liked the moisturizer and sunscreen, but the coverage was just not enough for daily wear.</li>
            <li> But so far, I LOVE this product, and I hardly ever say that about beauty stuff!</li>
            <li> The only thing is the color is slightly too light for my skin.  </li>
            <li> next time I used slightly less than a pea-sized amount, dotted it on &amp; lightly spread it.</li>
            <li> I did notice a few dry patches, so now I make sure I exfoliate and am well moisturized before hand.</li>
            <li> When i got this product, the box was a little open, but everything else was fine.</li>
            <li> only drawback is the color, although it provides good coverage, it makes my skin look a little pale...</li>
            <li> Everyone keeps saying it&#x27;s like lotion and that it&#x27;s smooth, but all I have noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as my usual foundation.</li>
            <li> This covers up redness and acne and minor imperfections very well.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very please with this product so far (only been using for two weeks).  </li>
            <li> and I usually wear medium- medium beige foundation and was worried that this would be too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> all the time.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle lasts a really long time because you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> And I use bare minerals powder foundation over it and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I have combination, normal to oil skin, thus, make-up only lasts about 4 hours, even though I work indoor</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this cream only during the first few hours of application (short-term) as it made my face smoother though it didn&#x27;t really give much of a coverage.</li>
            <li> I normally use two different primers then my foundation</li>
            <li> I might not be the palest, but I&#x27;m Irish, German, and most likely any other Nordic orientation that results in severe sunburn, so the preserved look is a safer option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pimples were still evident, however, but I had expected this.</li>
            <li> The pimples were still evident, however, but I had expected this.</li>
            <li> When I use my normal foundation without any BB Cream, my makeup rubs off in the next 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> The hot pink was also a sample</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not dark skinned at all.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of people complimenting my skin, which is normally rather patchy with red marks from acne scars.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this product is exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I did my research (battling between Skin 79 Hot Pink and Missha&#x27;s) before purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Once I get my face back to normal</li>
            <li> i bought a hot pink bb cream from skin79northamerica</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it would work on fair skin (my skin is light/medium with yellow undertones but not as dark as my Korean husband)</li>
            <li> When completely dry, I could see it evened out my color and covered large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> give you a little background on how I came across this product, I&#x27;ll tell you a quick story.</li>
            <li> but what little smell it did have faded quickly.</li>
            <li> and I can see that a little bit will go along way and that even though I spent more than I would normally for makeup it is going to last awhile!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little light for my skin in the summer, as I am finally getting a tan...</li>
            <li> My skin is tone is cool toned and pale.</li>
            <li> : I have no idea how other reviewers are going through their bottles so quickly, unless perhaps they&#x27;re piling this cream onto their skin multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> In an excited frenzy I quickly checked to see if it was fake and looked for the sticker, the hashed perferated design on the box and etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to BB cream but this has definitely improved the texture of my skin compared to just using moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Curious as I am, I open the bottle (not an easy feat) only to find that there is definitely NOT 40 g in the container.</li>
            <li> It would dry out my skin even after i moisturize my skin very well already.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; coverage (I used Laura Bare Mineral and Mercier tinted moisturizure for a long time).  </li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pump container means you have know idea how much product is left.</li>
            <li> This foundation only lasts for 4 hours before I begin to to get really shiny on my face, but i feel that it&#x27;s the same with all foundations I have bought in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now im sure the product is fake, also I found out it was expired which really pissed me off.</li>
            <li> I usually wear the shade Light for Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing by itself; so much so that after a few hours you have a sheen on your face.</li>
            <li> I initially bought the garnier BB cream since I had found it at my local Target, but after one use I already felt like it wasn&#x27;t going to go very well.</li>
            <li> so far today, 8 hours in, I am nowhere near as oily as I would be with my regular foundation,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair now because it is winter, but I get pretty dark in the summer and would be disappointed if the tint doesn&#x27;t blend as well with my natural skin tone in the summer.</li>
            <li> As far as concealment goes, the coverage is build able but does not hide my tired eyes and acne all too well.</li>
            <li> and I have combination skin that freaks out during that time of the month, leaving me with red scars and faint spots on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> It kept me from getting burnt the last time I was outside for a few hours (not SUPER sunny but fairly sunny all day</li>
            <li> A single pump will cover the whole face.</li>
            <li> I also found comments of a person who talked to a representative of cute and pretty, who sells authentic skin79 products, who even said that the label can scratch off, real or fake, if it&#x27;s been let out in the sun or in different conditions long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for reviews but because of all of the positive reviews I saw here</li>
            <li> May be people who left reviews have light pale skin?</li>
            <li> It was sorta gray when I first put it on, which I was expecting based on other reviews, but it adjusted to my skin tone after about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> but I felt like I had no other options.</li>
            <li> Ive heard other reviews make note about the &#x27;gray&#x27; tint when they first apply, I would suggest that you continue patting it around your face to redistribute.</li>
            <li> I break out occasionally, but not excessively.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m never going back to my old foundation ever again!</li>
            <li> The tint and thickness was also a little different than the original product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I just put the BB cream on by itself with no other make up.</li>
            <li> I paid total of $13.87, bought it from seoulglamour, shipped from Korea, it look exactly the same as the smaller one I bought in the Korean store in</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a good bb cream for the past few weeks, and totally forgot about this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping this will change around the wintertime when I have a little less color in my face, but I am fairly light skinned.</li>
            <li> I use NC25 in MAC, Bisque in Laura Mercier (tinted moisturizer), Golden Medium in Bare Escentuals, and L3 in Smashbox, I40 in Shiseido, and Ivory in Hourglass (tinted moisturizer) and this BB cream is slightly lighter for me during the summer.</li>
            <li> I used a full pump (if you want lesser coverage, half a pump should do) and patted it on my face as instructed.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use a brush to apply it either, for me, clean fingers work just as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it does dry out my skin if I wear it multiple days in a row (which I rarely do).  </li>
            <li> My black friend tried this just for fun since we were curious how much it would blend to her skin color.</li>
            <li> and I find it sets better with the BB cream acting as a primer as well (assuming you give the bb cream a few minutes to dry before you apply the foundation).</li>
            <li> and I find it sets better with the BB cream acting as a primer as well (assuming you give the bb cream a few minutes to dry before you apply the foundation).</li>
            <li> So, if your skin has a grey undertone, I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li> The product appears to be authentic, and if its not its still amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very thick.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores and they are often hard to conceal even when I use primer, but once this settles on my face my pores become</li>
            <li> It also feels light, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little whiter, and eventually evens out and looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, just watch the video to be sure you&#x27;re not applying a fake to your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gray color and if your not pale white you will be after using this.</li>
            <li> It only comes in one color and may be too light if you are very dark skinned or for some if you are using facial self-tanners in the summer</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out really bad along my jaw line and it gives these pimples great coverage before I add my foundation.</li>
            <li> The shipping is free and of it comes late just send them an email to find out what&#x27;s up.</li>
            <li> This one is my general go-to BB Cream for every day use.</li>
            <li> Let my preface this by saying I have light skin, I usually wear the third lightest shade when choosing powders and foundations.  </li>
            <li> I paid $14.50 for a product that barely lasted for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was very critical when I bought this, thinking it probably wouldn&#x27;t work as well as everyone else claims it does, but I was surprised to found out</li>
            <li> It hides my red blemishes, doesn&#x27;t cover up completely some spots</li>
            <li> In fact, I ran out of Skin79 last week and had to use my old Olay cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such natural looking coverage.</li>
            <li> Not only is this product all natural</li>
            <li> If possible, buy it from the direct website because the sellers on Amazon are not required to have legit products.</li>
            <li> ordered a second BB Cream directly from the Skin79 site to compare this product to that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural looking with enough coverage for hiding redness.</li>
            <li> now I use my BB cream, under eye concealer, and Bare Minerals powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still apply my bare minerals powder for color as well as a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I can barely tell there is anything on my face, it doesnt feel oily at all.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin, but if you&#x27;re acne-prone</li>
            <li> This product clears my skin up and looks so natural, last all day, and covers imperfections.</li>
            <li> not much so it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am white and I have sensitive skin and acne here and there.</li>
            <li> I never expected it to CURE my acne, because it is not acne fighting.  </li>
            <li> Having tried dozens, if not hundreds of foundations, tinted moisturizers, concealers, etc over the years, I can finally at 30 years old stop the search, because I have found my holy grail of skin cosmetics in Skin 79 Beblesh Balm.</li>
            <li> the title says, I use this BB Cream under my bare minerals matte foundation.</li>
            <li> I can barely see my pores or blackheads</li>
            <li> I have slightly yellow undertones to my skin, even though I&#x27;m caucasian, and this looks natural once its blended.</li>
            <li> I got it today, immediately put it on bare skin</li>
            <li> I will get occasional tiny clusters of white heads, so I think this product may be a bit pore clogging, however, I regularily use gentle exfoliation and can keep that under control.</li>
            <li> I even stopped buying my bare minerals and just use this.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have slightly sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, but my breakouts are hormonal and only happen along my jawline.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, it only comes in one shade.</li>
            <li> I am 99% sure this is a fake but a good fake,</li>
            <li> So glad I know about this ancient secret.</li>
            <li> Consistency may be thick at first, but it spreads on very lightly&lt;br</li>
            <li> The look was ok, not great.  </li>
            <li> Will see how long this bottle will last, granted my last bottle lasted me nearly 10 months!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are on the cool/pinked toned side or VERY PALE yellow and range 25 and under on the MAC shade range you can use this fine.  </li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation and random other little flaws and it covers them perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have light/olive skin tone and with a high oil volume in the tzone with dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> Chiffon BB mousse, which are newer, has thinner textures, and sheer to light coverage that actually makes my blemishes less obvious.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that after I apply my skin feels a bit dry, not sure why, perhaps I need to use more moisturizer</li>
            <li> It covered large pores and gave a glowy finish even without the other illuminators.  </li>
            <li> The only con I can really see is that if you have dry skin or some of your skin is dry/combination, you may want to moisturize before applying this.</li>
            <li> yes it&#x27;s true that there is a slight grey tone to it</li>
            <li> Other than that, my skin seems to look clear and smooth after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> but only if I use a bronzer, or other sheertoned illuminator like Armani fluid sheers in golden beige or bronze or the YSL touche eclat pen in 4.5 (peach).  </li>
            <li> The ones I bought seem to be ok, however the BB on one of them has completely rubbed off and the other one is slowly fading.</li>
            <li> but even a few weeks later and with a clean face, I ended up with the same result.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s have combination skin, normal to dry cheeks with an oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> Unlike normal foundation that will dry my skin out and feel funky.</li>
            <li> After that major improvement, I was a little bummed to see that the hyper-pigmentation along my jawline was still pretty noticeable, but with a bit of concealer, those were just a faded memory (har har).</li>
            <li> It came in a neat little package on time with a little envelope and a cute card thanking me for ordering from the seller.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up wanting to spend 70 dollars for a small tube, so I researched other top brands, and Skin79 was one of them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up wanting to spend 70 dollars for a small tube, so I researched other top brands, and Skin79 was one of them.</li>
            <li> After an hour or so, I did notice that the product had settled a tiny bit into the wrinkle on my forehead (I have this weird single vertical wrinkle between my eyebrows that is pretty deep for my age), but with just a light hand, I massaged it away; I didn&#x27;t notice any settling in other fine lines that are starting to form on my face, like around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> Light and sheer, but with that said, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It did make my face white in strange way, i didn&#x27;t particularly like it.</li>
            <li> I have almost completely done away with foundation altogether thanks to this little miracle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers who say it has too much of a &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have a few sun spots, small amount of wrinkles and this makes my face look like a blank canvas, but not in a clown face kind of way.</li>
            <li> When using Skin79 BB cream it covers up the unevenness in my skin color, although, it is true that when you put it on the skin is a little grey.</li>
            <li> I have really pale skin and was a bit wary that it only came in one color but it matched my skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I just dot a little more after it has lost it&#x27;s grey cast to cover up any other areas that may need it.</li>
            <li> I guess I will be trying out other brands of BB creams as well after having such a positive experience with this one.</li>
            <li> When it got low I took a tip I learned from another reviewer and popped the pump open and used a q-tip to scoop out the inner tube while I waited for my new one to arrive.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear makeup to work since my makeup routine takes way too long to fit into my schedule</li>
            <li> this was the real thing and not an imitation or fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Makes ur skin baby soft, been using only for last week or so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely switched over from foundation to BB creams (Korean brands only since US BB creams are basically just tinted moisturizers which does not have the same consistency, coverage, or benefits of Korean BB creams).  </li>
            <li> I had pimples all over my forehead, so I recently switched back to my old BB cream (Holika Holika--</li>
            <li> I wear make up almost every day that I have to socially interact with the world</li>
            <li> So, I mixed it with my face lotion (Oil of Olay: Complete Daily Defense</li>
            <li> Not only did it cover my flaws, self-adjust to my deep olive skin tone, hide my sags and bags, but it completely controlled my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Then on days you need more you can apply two thin layers to get that extra coverage.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time finding a foundation to match me coloring because it is very light with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> A major plus is that it shipped all the way from Korea in only about 10 days.</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I didn&#x27;t know 40g would be so little.</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to tell a little bit about my face.</li>
            <li> It broke me out a little at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;The coverage is very light, which is not good for me since I have a bit of acne and a bunch of dark spots where my old zits used to be.  </li>
            <li> It can get very dry without proper care but also very oily in the T zone without proper care.</li>
            <li> Use it daily impact on the clean and purify the skin very noticeable, Purify the face of signs and dark circles and covers small drill and covers defects in the same moment..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so bad, but it&#x27;s still a few bucks more than my trusty old Maybelline Mousse that I can pick up at the store easily.</li>
            <li> You only need about half a pump to completely cover your face (mine, at least) and using any more than</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li> It really brightens up the eye area, as well, and covered veins and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Make up Forever foundation, Bare Minerals powder, and two different concealers (one for my eyes and one for my acne scars...</li>
            <li> ive only tried it a few times but so far it blends in really well with my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s initially not as grey as everyone makes it out to be, but it fades to match your skin tone (for lighter skinned individuals) in no time.</li>
            <li> the problem is that when i first put it on it felt heavy.</li>
            <li> and so I wasted some the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> My first bottle which I used everyday lasted me 9 months.</li>
            <li> And i&#x27;ve been using a different cream which has not impressed me enough to buy it again (to be honest</li>
            <li> I was using it pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the color (I&#x27;m pretty fair, and it was relatively dark)</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and still suffer from a certain amount of makeup slippage after a few hours, this didn&#x27;t take care of that, but it did hold well in comparison to other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I still have about half of my original bottle left, but I want to have another on reserve before my other one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe a little powder on top but no more hardcore foundation for me.</li>
            <li> It still isn&#x27;t 100% my color, but with a little mineral powder touch up and blush, it actually looks pretty</li>
            <li> i usually wear this on the weekend and not during the week as i need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> I was worried the first two days because of how pale it looked after application and even after it oxidized it still looked somewhat pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had purchased sample bb creams before to choose the right bb cream for me, when i got this i saw that it was a small size</li>
            <li> It takes less than one pump to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> have since purchased my SKIN 79 HOT PINK BB CREAM from PINK GELEE.  </li>
            <li> First of all, just a warning that this review will be lengthy, but it comes from the heart and speaks the truth on my part, and this is the kind of review I was looking for before purchasing this product because I hate purchasing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough to provide full coverage</li>
            <li> It also works really well with other products such as several different under eye concealers and some powder bronzers and cream blushes.</li>
            <li> If you want bb cream, this is the real deal, hands down, look no further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Skin 79 products before and had no problem with skin sensitivity, but this particular one gave me what I can only describe as a chemical burn on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m middle eastern but pretty pale</li>
            <li> and I would normally have been pink afterwards!)</li>
            <li> : Dry, Sensitive, Recently Acne-Prone&lt;br /&gt;Color:</li>
            <li> I really like the pump on the bottle as well as the fact that you don&#x27;t even need to use and entire pump to cover your face, maybe about half.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is I was unaware that when I push the button down how much was going to come out of the pump</li>
            <li> so it does make my skin little dry through out the day and also i purchased this right after summer over</li>
            <li> I still have the same amount of acne [possibly less, but as it comes in cycles its hard to tell], but I defiantly feel better about the way my face looks and will continue to use Skin79 BB creams.</li>
            <li> I like to use this on days that I like to go natural because it hides my uneven skin tone which is light yellowish with pink undertone, freckles/pimple scars and dark spots.</li>
            <li> My face can get really oily and at the same time have a few flaky dry spots so when I use regular foundation my face gets oily really fast and the foundation also seeps into the dry spots.</li>
            <li> so i do got a little tan, its little too light for my skin</li>
            <li> But my skin is overly sensitive, so after applying &amp; removing later on, it would become red and slightly dry.</li>
            <li> Only half a pump is enough to cover the whole face + neck.</li>
            <li> am 37 and have 20+ years of acne scars and also wrinkles and fine lines from all the caustic products I have used.</li>
            <li> I am close to 60, spent from 15 to 42 as a model while going to school to get multiple degrees, raising kids as a single parent, and hiding the very oily skin that I had to work with all the time to manage breakouts.</li>
            <li> More or less, I would describe this BB cream to be more of a tinted moisturizer except with the added benefits of acting in as foundation, base, whitening and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I was a little uncertain about the color matching correctly or that it would really work as well as everyone said it did...</li>
            <li> You really just have to use a little bit...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little much in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I am caucasian and find the Garnier a MUCH nicer color, although it is a little stickier than this one</li>
            <li> The pigment seems a little too &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; to cover really fully.</li>
            <li> Maybe not so much in summertime when I get a little darker, but the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Skin79 hot pink BB cream on my other Amazon account and have been using it for several months now.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin and normal foundations tend to dry me out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised that after a little while there were a few areas on my face that began to peel a little bit, as the BB cream is more drying than I realized.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little greasy but absorbs fast enough to a matte-ish finish covering EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> skin had been breakingout before (stress, hormones) and so far the blemishes haven&#x27;t been popping up, the old ones are shrinking away, and the dark spots/scars are fading!</li>
            <li> so this is a wonderful product if you hate wearing foundation like me, but you feel like you need a little something to brighten your face, and make you skin feel oh-so-soft.</li>
            <li> In fact, after switching to my regular foundation for new Driver license photos the other day I found myself wishing I has stuck with the BB instead.  </li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way and at first when you put it on, it seems too white</li>
            <li> One problem that I have with foundation is that it is SO thick and it easily transfers to other things.</li>
            <li> had high hopes for this bb cream based on the reviews but was let down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> The tint has a grey hue, which makes my skin tone dull looking, overall it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing and pink gelee sells the real stuff only bad thing is it took forever to get to me like 2weeks</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cut my time to get ready in the morning in half!</li>
            <li> It really blends in with my pale skin and evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The colour does have a slight grey undertone which isn&#x27;t much of an issue for me.</li>
            <li> The wear seems to be long lasting, however the true test will be in the summer when my skin becomes very slick.</li>
            <li> the only down side and the reason i gave this bb cream a 4 is it take awhile for it to change into your skin tone (20 min tops) and makes you look a one shade lighter but so far i think that the only bad side to it shipping was fast and and this bb cream didn&#x27;t cost that much i would recommend this to my family and friends and it worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so do not apply a large amount.</li>
            <li> Will keep on looking for other products but will maybe purchase this in the near future.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel thick or thin, it&#x27;s thin enough to feel the wind blow on your face but still has great coverage ;)</li>
            <li> My skin is very clear except for the capillary red spots around the nose and occasional black acne spots.  </li>
            <li> This particular one is a little on the gray side, but then I have an olivey complexion, so it works out.  </li>
            <li> I personally do not like to wear too much foundation because I have oil skin---and by the end of the day, only bits of foundation are left making my face look blotchy and very uneven.  </li>
            <li> type: oily, acne-prone, some redness, and incredibly sensitive to foreign</li>
            <li> and I have no complains as far as the quality of the cream itself.&lt;br /&gt;Did not get a skin breakout with some other makeup products</li>
            <li> I am extremely diligent about washing my face every morning and night, completely removing all traces of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to use as little makeup as possible, but I normally use a primer and a tinted moisturizer for my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still confused about whether the sticker or not the sticker should be there on the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but for me, I only have to use half a pump to cover up my entire face, a full pump if I want to pile it up</li>
            <li> so you would think that it will last you for a month but NO barely 2 freakin weeks!</li>
            <li> Anyways, I really didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to go out and make a $34 purchase at Sephora for another bottle of foundation (since my current Mat Velvet+ is kinda running out), so I talked to my friend who has been a BB cream user for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> At the recommendations of various YouTubers I&#x27;ve checked the bottle for authenticity, and it is in fact the real thing despite the small price tag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and been a big fan of BB creams for quite a long time now.</li>
            <li> I wish it was easier to compare the different Beblesh Balms - there seem to be several, but the differences are not clear to me.</li>
            <li> normally use Mac&#x27;s ProWear foundation but except for the fact that this bb cream is too white for me, I prefer to use this bb cream as my everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> small amount first, then apply more a few minutes later and buff with a BeautyBlender concentrating under my eyes and on my cheeks where my rosacea is worse.</li>
            <li> but I get annoyed pretty quickly as it feels heavy and always seems to look cake-y and or dry and flake-y over my acne.</li>
            <li> It was a little pale for my medium toned skin, but otherwise, it really evened out my complexion and looked very natural.  </li>
            <li> , the only down, it made me break out on the first week that I began using it, and it dried out my face in the chin and around the mouth area, so I had a facial done, and apply moisturizer in the evening after washing this cream off, and this is my second week using it</li>
            <li> The tiny little dispenser clogged very early on, and would squirt out in odd directions (small enough not to cause a mess, but wasteful for sure).  </li>
            <li> I did a little bit of research on the skin79 official site and it turns out this is for normal skin.</li>
            <li> What was most disappointing is that when I removed it I noticed that it caused irritation to my skin, casuing redness on parts of my left cheek especially around my left cheekbone.</li>
            <li> It is rather thick textured but does not feel thick on skin and my skin actually looks very smooth and eventoned.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly normal skin where I occasionally get dry patches and my t-zone can be slightly oily.</li>
            <li> After half an hour I checked and the makeup and was surprised!</li>
            <li> That sounds awful, I know, but I have pale skin, freckles and some red splotchiness around my nose and chin when I get out of the shower, and this smoothes everything over and looks great after it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li> (tone balance) effect that provides slight to moderate natural looking coverage</li>
            <li> The makeup may look dark on a tissue, but because I always use an SPF on my face, my face skin is naturally lighter than my chest and neck.</li>
            <li> I also have dark circles around my eyes as well and start to break out with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve tried in MONTHS that my skin hasn&#x27;t had an immediate negative reaction to.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel really soft and some dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year and highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li> use it for lazy days that i don&#x27;t want to wear so much makeup, just to even out the skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin care routine adds enough moisture and as long as I powder my forehead</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not old enough for wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> The bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> After a long while wanting to try BB cream, I finally got this (together with the Missha No. 21).</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d convinced myself that no BB cream could give me the coverage I wanted or last as long as I needed it to.</li>
            <li> I think this will be my daily foundation routine for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, so I can&#x27;t comment at all on how long one bottle</li>
            <li> However, I have had several cystic bumps during this time, which I haven&#x27;t had in a long time.</li>
            <li> so I imagine this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I definitely do not recommend this one for anyone with oily skin, because even on my combination skin my face sometimes feels oily after a long day.</li>
            <li> I hope this is long lasting throughout the day</li>
            <li> The effect is long lasting well into the evening</li>
            <li> so keep a back up on hand, and depending on where you buy from shipping can take a long time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very white, but i have a yellowy undertone and this just makes my face look grey</li>
            <li> It can look a little ashy but I put a little powder over it and than it looks really fresh.</li>
            <li> Good skin cover up, but made me break out like crazy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does have a very slight pink undertone which I have found only noticeable in certain lighting conditions.</li>
            <li> I chose Skin79 over other brands because I wasn&#x27;t looking for dramatic coverage or anything like that; I just wanted a \\&quot;one-stop shop\\&quot; sort of skin product that would help the minor issues I have with my skin while being healthy for it as well.</li>
            <li> my skin looks very natural after applying it(prob a little bit whiter) but no one noticed.</li>
            <li> I have had freckles my whole life and a very uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the coverage is medium - it covered up dark spots and old acne scars with no trouble at all, but there were a few spots that were still quite obvious.</li>
            <li> and I have had no breakouts due to this BB cream, which is a major plus considering the trials I&#x27;ve had trying to find a product that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I initially looked at some other kinds, a lot more expensive kinds, but found this</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll tell you why in a second), but comparing the back of one hand to the other, there was a big difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product had no tracking code and was estimated to arrive in a month, but came directly from Korea in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I also heard that BB creams are so widely marketed and sought after that many fake ones have emerged.</li>
            <li> The finish was slightly matte, which I like and can easily be fixed with some blush and a dab of highlighter.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that the product itself leaves my skin feeling a bit dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing enough to keep keep dry, flaky skin under control, yet does not look greasy on the oily parts of my face, even after wearing all day.</li>
            <li> I applied it in tiny amounts all over my face like a moisturizer, and unlike most foundations I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;m a serious makeup fanatic)</li>
            <li> I applied it in tiny amounts all over my face like a moisturizer, and unlike most foundations I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;m a serious makeup fanatic)</li>
            <li> While I won&#x27;t say that this cream completely covers these marks and discoloration, I can say that they are definitely less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The Missha dispenser was also easier to regulate how much product I wanted to dispense, I think I went through the Skin79 bottle much faster because of the weird bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this BB cream, it moisturizes my face enough so that the dry spots blend away without making my skin feel oily at all.</li>
            <li> Waiting for it to be fake: Color of the box, perforated side, spelling mistakes, font size/boldness, pump style, how easily the letters scratch off, barcode placement, &amp;#34;void&amp;#34;/seal of quality sticker: it all passed.</li>
            <li> My t-zone is far less oily throughout the day than before this bb</li>
            <li> It blends well with your skin tone and produces minimal side effects of standard makeup foundation such as having that cakey look.</li>
            <li> The pink took like literally 20+ pumps to get it going, and the white only 1 or 2 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also want to point out that my skin has become unbelievably sensitive over the last few months and this somehow does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely not what I expected and I watched several YouTube reviews/random blogs about this before I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This product after maybe a few days of use started to diminish the look of my red areas and really hydrated the rough and dry areas on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a slightly strong fragrance that reminds me of expensive creams from Lancome.</li>
            <li> but I only had limited time so the video has been unedited.</li>
            <li> I can use it daily and not have a single break-out.</li>
            <li> I wear it under loose powder, which helps set the product and make it last longer throughout the day.</li>
            <li> but since I started applying it all over my face and adding a little bit of extra on the problem areas, it really just make the imperfections so less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Almost anything can be scratched off if it&#x27;s out in heat, or dry areas long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using it for a while because another review I read said that her skin got used to it, but I&#x27;ve developed a few deep, painful pimples around my chin area - the kind that give you a headache.</li>
            <li> I usually use this or the Gold ( which is a bit more heavy, and not quite as pale ), and I refuse to buy anything</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten middle aged I have been searching for a new makeup that won&#x27;t look heavy and highlight wrinkles.</li>
            <li> For extreme blemishes, may need concealer, but does a great job as a base.</li>
            <li> will feel some oiliness, this can be fixed with little finishing powder.   </li>
            <li> I know it is a little early to say</li>
            <li> little side note-BB cream was actually developed to help plastic surgery patients heal post-opt.</li>
            <li> anyone who&#x27;s curious, the regimen that finally cleared my skin up was washing with African Black Soap twice daily and following that up with Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s clarifying toner.</li>
            <li> (And just for the record, I&#x27;m aware of the issues of fake imitation brands being sold online, and I can confirm that I&#x27;ve been testing the real deal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks, I&#x27;m seeing major improvements in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I still get a little shiny, but this stuff really evens out the skin and tones down my shine.</li>
            <li> have fairly pale skin from mid Fall til end of Spring and then a little darker, depending on how much sun exposure I get during the sunny season.  </li>
            <li> I notice if I wear it for extended periods of time (10-12 hours) or get sweaty, it will start to wear off or settle in my pores and look kind of bad, but it&#x27;s nothing a touch up with a foundation stick can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Cheap ones are of course fake products frm china</li>
            <li> (at least that isn&#x27;t what shows up when I apply it), and was very matte.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been so much rave lately about BB Cream that I decided that it was time for me to try some.</li>
            <li> in all, I cant give this product a negative review, because I really did like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about BB creams lately.</li>
            <li> I immediately stopped using it and the smaller bumps disappeared but for the 4 bumps on my jawline, it left dark spots on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Will not cover any imperfections such as scars, acnes, dark circles, redness, etc.&lt;br /&gt;• Not buildable as it will settle into lines especially around eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> Skin 79 pink label only comes in 1 color</li>
            <li> It only took me about two months to go through it all, and I was widely dismayed,</li>
            <li> This cream seems to have a grey undertone or something.  </li>
            <li> Since I have a long commute, I just apply and go and let the product oxidize as I drive.</li>
            <li> I received the open box (the pink paper box) item, it was used, it has been used by somebody before, maybe a return item.</li>
            <li> I am testing it too see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> All day long?</li>
            <li> Even when I received the bb cream (way earlier than expected) I was still apprehensive to try it out because it&#x27;s almost summer here</li>
            <li> UP STAY FOR A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> I popped the actual tube out of the pink outer cover by pushing up with my thumb on the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> I would be careful with darker or yellow skin tones.</li>
            <li> The product shipment arrived earlier than the expected time..</li>
            <li> Now, yes it does have a grey ash color</li>
            <li> the downside to this bb cream is that it leaves your face with a grey complexion.</li>
            <li> The product arrived much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> If the Cetaphil heavy-duty stuff does not moisturize enough for me to use the Pink version (since I already paid for it), I&#x27;ll switch over to the Gold and hopefully have the same experience, minus the dryness.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, this BB cream color is quite grey even on my NC 20</li>
            <li> , i have redness on my cheeks, and it hides it, not completely (cuz this is not the foundation), but it does.</li>
            <li> so I do have a lot of acne scars, and my cheeks have an orange-peel texture because of using BP for a long time.</li>
            <li> I received my Skin79 Triple Function BB Cream days earlier than expected, which was a surprise since the Vendor did not charge shipping.  </li>
            <li> Has long staying power too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to turn grey</li>
            <li> However, the BB cream itself is way too grey for my olive/tan skin tone.</li>
            <li> But still grey.</li>
            <li> I was really pleasantly surprised when I received a few samples along with my cream.</li>
            <li> The second bottle I got arrived almost empty-</li>
            <li> But after getting it through the mail (long wait).</li>
            <li> Contains long list of chemicals&lt;</li>
            <li> for the long review,</li>
            <li> I do look a bit shiny towards the end of the day, but in comparison to wearing Dr. Jart&#x27;s, not near as oily.  </li>
            <li> I then purchased it and there WAS a hint of grey</li>
            <li> I am not young - but the difference in my skin is visible.  </li>
            <li> The tint is slightly grey but that isn&#x27;t at all noticeable once it has soaked into the skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, and sets into my natural hue a few minutes after putting it on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for the long review -- but for those nervous Nellies out there like me, I hope it helped you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for the long review -- but for those nervous Nellies out there like me, I hope it helped you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-lasts a long time</li>
            <li> And if it does not completely match because you have darker skin</li>
            <li> Pink Gelee is the only seller I buy my BB creams</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, and after a few days of using this, no breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely order from Pink Gelee again.</li>
            <li> As expected it doesn&#x27;t cover up big pimples though</li>
            <li> I also have yellow undertones with some pink.</li>
            <li> so my face does not look as grey.</li>
            <li> Upon application the cream does  have a slightly grey cast to it, but just wait a couple minutes</li>
            <li> I dont know if I used this product in a wrong way, but I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference, neither better nor worse than before</li>
            <li> redness and minor imperfections</li>
            <li> Specifically, the sticker of authenticity will show a grey \\&quot;watermark\\&quot; in the background once compromised.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> NOT sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I obviously ordered the pink label bb cream</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just it made my face a bit strange looking in my opinion.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much for me to add concerning the basics of this product: similar to a tinted moisturizer but with a \\&quot;whitening\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It basically gives your face a photoshopped veil that covers minor imperfections.</li>
            <li> It starts off with a grey tone to it but give it a minute or two on your skin and it will blend to your tone.</li>
            <li> have only been wearing the pink skin79 for 5 days</li>
            <li> I think it helped improve my middle aged skin</li>
            <li> (the most I use is some mascara and a small thin layer of eyeliner.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you don&#x27;t see the ingredient list until you receive the product (full size; sample size is in Korean only).</li>
            <li> At first, yes it will look grey and pale but after a few minutes, the cream set into my skin and matched my skin color.</li>
            <li> I have an overall glow and any little marks that I had due to old acne are disappearing too.</li>
            <li> I received my product a few days ago and was anxious to try it right away.</li>
            <li> , my one daughter is classic porcelain and my other is olive skin but pale since it&#x27;s not tanning season yet.</li>
            <li> &quot; really does just mean \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; and it truly works.  </li>
            <li> much less bare</li>
            <li> You have to give it a little time, too to see any long term results, whether good or bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to give it a little time, too to see any long term results, whether good or bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t blend into my skin because the color was more on the grey side, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It appears a little white-ish when first applied, but blends in with very little effort.</li>
            <li> but it was somewhat the same as other bb creams i had tried.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use for as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> So long missha bb cream!  </li>
            <li> I dont have cronic acne, just the occasional spot, and other then some redness in the cheeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for the long review!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak as to whether it can/should take the place of all those other products for people who use them regularly.</li>
            <li> After just one application you will break out into a glorious bouquet of zits the likes of which you probably haven&#x27;t seen since the dawning of puberty, requiring heavier application of foundation, creating an endless cycle of low self esteem and Beblesh purchases.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it on, and like what other reviewers before me mentioned, the cream left a grayish-tint on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had four or five incidents of contact dermatitis in the last six months from makeup and other skin products I&#x27;ve used without problems for five or six years</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> Other than that the only wrinkles I have are expression lines on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I have found I like the opposite approach - rubbing into my face; the other way resulted in a pallid effect.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely buy the pink label again!</li>
            <li> My only dislike is that it doesnt come in other shades.</li>
            <li> Not drastically, but a much bigger difference to any other BB cream or moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> There is something about the texture and consistency of this product that is completely different than any other type of foundation I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I will definitely try other Skin79 products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always stayed away from other brands because I&#x27;m Filipino and have a lot of yellow in my skintone</li>
            <li> Will definitely be trying the other types in the line.</li>
            <li> i like the fact that this bb cream does not make your skin look too white like other bb creams i tried.</li>
            <li> The only other BB cream I have used is</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much less scary than something that intense), all while having a very high spf.</li>
            <li> Bought it because of high reviews but it makes my skin a dull gray color.</li>
            <li> it gave ok coverage but broke me out SOOO bad, it took me 2 months to get my skin back under control.</li>
            <li> However, I found that it&#x27;s a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> dont buy this product if you are acne prone and have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion with combination skin that goes through bouts of being excessively dry then breaking out</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is SKIN79&#x27;s BB cream for people with oily skin versus the gold label which is made for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, use a moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t felt too dry during the day or when I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It feels moisturizing to me and it does not cling to the dry patches on my face.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> However, if your skin is dry, go for the gold my friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mom has dry skin</li>
            <li> Despite having oily skin, I get dry after cleansing and must use a lightweight lotion (Cera Ve).&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely dry skin, this may not work for you.</li>
            <li> This made me a bit dry at the end of the day after 12-16 hours of wear and would recommend a stronger moisturizer, since I have oily skin</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t conceal dry skin too well.</li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell and it stays put for hours - it doesn&#x27;t make my skin look oily or dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Put lotion under if you have dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normal/combination skin that tends towards dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> all - letting that dry before I started and the BB went on smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i have dry skin as well</li>
            <li> Overall this is an average BB cream, it just does not deliver all of the long term benefits it advertises.</li>
            <li> The second time around, I slathered on 2 heavy layers of lotion and made it a solid 5 or 6 hours before I felt that my face was getting too dry.</li>
            <li> The heaviest of my dark spots are noticeably lighter and the lighter dark spots have faded away completely.  </li>
            <li> For someone who breaks out at the slightest addition of a scented lotion, I have not had a single instance while using this product.</li>
            <li> and I will say it won&#x27;t cover every single imperfection</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for about a year now, every single day and sometimes twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty thick product so a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I also have stupidly sensitive skin, so harsh perfumes and other chemicals are a no-go.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t cover my dark spots well enough comparing to missha bb cream.</li>
            <li> You can also layer on areas that needs extra coverage like dark circles.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it gives off a gray tint and is lighter than my face, so I must mix with my summer foundation, other than that no real complaints.</li>
            <li> However, I prefer the natural look that BB cream gives so I don&#x27;s need to worry about having eyeliners, shadows or other heavy make-ups after I put it on.its</li>
            <li> experience is with Pink Gelee only and I&#x27;m in no way trying to discredit any other sellers since I have no knowledge of them.</li>
            <li> a quite dark toned so lighter skinned people may have different results.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s standing up to my usually greasy summertime face, and I keep forgetting that I&#x27;m even wearing it.</li>
            <li> this product works well in covering up blemishes, but i have a dark complexion and it makes my skin look unnaturally white</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too dark for my skin; I simply can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is very unfortunate because this was so close to being my favorite product and replacing foundation forever.</li>
            <li> If you like using powder or Bare Minerals, I do not recommend this product as it can look heavy.</li>
            <li> and I have tried everything from proactive to expensive full coverage makeup to try to fix/cover my acne and scarring.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old, Asian with a tan complexion, I am just starting to notice a little bit of wrinkles around my eyes and have notice how much larger my pores have gotten over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I actually was on the interstate on my way to work when my car broke down.</li>
            <li> I have tried several BB creams and this is my hands down favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will not go back to another BB cream or other foundations!</li>
            <li> At first the consistency seems a little thick and dense but after it&#x27;s been on your face for</li>
            <li> I am 43 and have struggled with dry skin and acne forever!  </li>
            <li> Not only does my skin never look even slightly oily when I wear it</li>
            <li> The Tube is 40 grams (1.4 ounces) and I only needed a small amount to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> I use about half a pump (don&#x27;t think anyone using the product properly would need anymore than that)</li>
            <li> It has a veeeery slight fragrance that instantly dissipates once you</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would work for darker tone, but I definitely know you don&#x27;t have to be a nc25 or less to use it.</li>
            <li> I am a newby when it comes to BB creams, having only discovered these in the past several months.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is I feel that although it oxidizes to my skin tone, I still feel like it&#x27;s a big lighter than usual.</li>
            <li> I figured I could use it on my &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; makeup days and wear my typical foundation on the regular days.</li>
            <li> like that it has a higher SPF, and the Skin79 dispenser has either broken, or its close to being empty.</li>
            <li> The foundation I used previously and have now gone back to is Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse.</li>
            <li> having to spend less than $20 on a bb cream that does the job nicely, is a big thumbs up for me.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and the product does not clog your pores as a regular foundation would ( I havent used foundation in a long time now)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This BB Cream doesn&#x27;t seem to work as it&#x27;s advertised for my typical Asian skin tone(fair).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-20s with slightly oily skin that occasionally breaks out.</li>
            <li> It went on lighter than Garnier and left my skin feeling less greasy.  </li>
            <li> But now I have these little red spots that are itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> Only complain is it&#x27;s a little dry for me.</li>
            <li> I can still see some of my scars, but compared to other products I have used in the past (Mac, Shisheido, Clinique, Sephora, &amp; tons of other high end makeup products)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had absolutely no new break outs since I started using this product, and my skin tone actually does look like it&#x27;s evening out a little.  </li>
            <li> but i do have very dry skin</li>
            <li> It covered up alot of my sunspots and some of my lighter freckles and balanced my skintone but, after extended use 5+ hours it started to feel very dry on my face, I do use mositerizer before putting on bb cream.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and lately it&#x27;s been super sensitive and more difficult than usual so needless to say</li>
            <li> Plainly put, I was lazy haha, but I just felt like sharing it now, since it will be running on three years since I found my almost everything face makeup product^^</li>
            <li> if you try using it, too) does not have the pink, red, or orangey beige pigments like typical makeup does in the States-  </li>
            <li> After using this product for about 2 weeks, I stopped getting frequent acne that I usually do when I use other makeup.</li>
            <li> I was called dark by my skincare specialist, but only compared to her other clients.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically wear foundation at all, just concealer; in fact, I don&#x27;t think such heavy foundations are necessary at all.  </li>
            <li> seller was also nice enough to include samples of Heynature BB Black Diamond Moist Tightening Blemish Base and Aqua Brightening Gel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover 100% if you have acne or dark spots, so I could imagine myself wearing other make up for a photo shoot or a big occasion where lots of pictures would be taken.</li>
            <li> do find that the coverage is not as heavy as expected, so I do like to set with a slightly tinted powder after my skin has absorbed the sunscreen (which is the cause of the ashy-grey look others have complained about) and still use concealer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If applied on dry skin (like right after you wash your face), it may look a bit weird...</li>
            <li> Overall, my complexion has gotten a little brighter, and it does not irritate my skin or give me breakouts.</li>
            <li> After about 6 hours i had little white heads on my chin, nose, forehead, and cheeks.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a little worrisome is that I watched a TV news about a Mid-age woman who used this bb cream ended up having a lot of freckles on her face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, as a last check, I pumped a little on my hand.</li>
            <li> Sadly it only blended a little bit.</li>
            <li> I layer it over a little moisturizer because I like a sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> , you put a little pea size on the back of your hand and dot it on the places that you wish to cover and PAT the makeup into your skin.</li>
            <li> This little jar is way bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> a little MAC Select cover up mixed with fix+</li>
            <li> I told her that I was a big fan of South Korea&#x27;s fashion scene, and she rummaged in her purse and gave me a little tube of make up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was too white, and i&#x27;m a little taned, and it just looked rediculus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the american version of &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34; creams, but they offered little to no coverage at all</li>
            <li> Put a pump on the back of your hand and smudge it a little before applying to your face&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;But let me tell you a little it about my skin type so you can decide to b this based on if you have similar</li>
            <li> My skin looked a little different.</li>
            <li> but it definitely blends in after a little bit.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was very easy to spread but the coverage was not good for me (it takes about two layers to cover like another product with just one layer).</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cover serious blemishes, but it does even skin tone and offers moderate coverage, even on fairly dark under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> but it does not cover capillary red spots or black spots due to acnes.  </li>
            <li> I also felt like it has less coverage than some of the other BB&#x27;s I currently use...Dior and Smashbox.</li>
            <li> Except, the weight of the container feels much lighter and I had to push the tab down pretty hard to have some cream squeeze out, which is weird.</li>
            <li> I really do love the air-brushed look it gives my skin, but again, won&#x27;t be re-purchasing because if the \\&quot;bad chemicals\\&quot; it contains.</li>
            <li> It has replaced my need for heavy and fake looking foundations and feels light and airy.</li>
            <li> recently I stumbled upon a video on fake and real Skin79 BB creams...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve suffered from adult acne since my late teens/early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> : I bought the 2 bottles from Pink Gelee, because I did not find any mixed comments about fake vs real products as SeoulGlamour/other sellers.</li>
            <li> They mixed the real and fake cream to trick you.</li>
            <li> for American brands, Smash Box is heavy, almost like foundation.  </li>
            <li> Been on Accutane, spent thousands on dermatologists and every product you can imagine from infomercials to Sephora.</li>
            <li> then after a few hours my face got these red bums everywhere.</li>
            <li> And I would also recommend buying from Pink Gelee.</li>
            <li> when you think the bottle is empty, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Where this pink label has the sebum control, the gold label ([[ASIN:B004R6HIR6</li>
            <li> I looked like I plunged my face into wet cement.</li>
            <li> but after wearing it for a few days, I can already see a definite improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> There are some warnings to be careful not to buy imposter products--but I buy from Amazon Prime so am not worried.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered the pink and gold skin79 BB creams after researching dozens of BB creams(I&#x27;ll admit</li>
            <li> After I ordered it, I immediately sent an email to Pink Gelee.</li>
            <li> She even linked me a site to check the authenticity, and although that was reassuring I was not ready to give in the towel until I had the product in front of me</li>
            <li> However, I wish I had gotten the gold, as it is not supposed to be as drying as the pink</li>
            <li> On my face, the gray hue made me look like I came back from the dead.</li>
            <li> drop pink sponges that can be wet</li>
            <li> so be careful about it.</li>
            <li> No thanks, I&#x27;ll stick to my Dior Nude Skin or Clinique BB creams...</li>
            <li> The cream was a lot lighter in pigment than I had expected and it takes a bit before settling in and matching with the rest of my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Deliver from Seller Pink Gelee, arrived in 4 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a Skin79 Pink gift set.  </li>
            <li> it definitely clogged my pores!!), and it moisturized without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> They are not too big or heavy.</li>
            <li> so I was curious to try.</li>
            <li> I got mine from the seller Pink Gelee.</li>
            <li> Pink Gelee also gave two samples.</li>
            <li> I only need a few dots on my face, so it&#x27;s not wasteful.</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t tell if this makes it worse or not.</li>
            <li> I get mine through pink gelee here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be lighter in weight and almost transparent in color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever broken out so much before.  </li>
            <li> authenticity and my seller, Pink</li>
            <li> Pink Gelee will be my go-to company.  </li>
            <li> however, I feel like the pink label is easier to rub in.  </li>
            <li> I am early-30s, and have never had acne issues until the last few years.</li>
            <li> Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label )</li>
            <li> This cream stays on well with minimal need to blot for shininess.  </li>
            <li> I bought my product from Pink Gelee.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard about bb creams and was curious to trying it out</li>
            <li> At my age foundations look like dried up pancake batter and tinted moisturizers aren&#x27;t quite enough.</li>
            <li> It does not pill or have a rough texture.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Skin79 BB pink label for about three weeks now</li>
            <li> Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label )</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was a waste of money, my face ended up white like milk, it was&lt;</li>
            <li> and almost drowned myself.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a lot of people selling fakes on here, so be careful.</li>
            <li> this product dried out my skin even though I mixed it with moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I will sometimes put a couple dots of moisturizer on trouble areas before applying BB cream, but it is usually not necessary.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Pink Gelee and from everything I have read about detecting fakes</li>
            <li> I also have some pigmentation issues, acne scarring and some rough patches on my face.</li>
            <li> They have a lifelong user from me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was even faster than was expected.</li>
            <li> I came on Amazon and thought I would try the Pink Label Triple Function.</li>
            <li> You can imagine how my excitement disappeared when I reread that list a few days later to figure out what was causing my skin to freak out.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily t zone and this seemed to make it worse.</li>
            <li> Then I brushed on a bit of Everyday Minerals</li>
            <li> I found this BB cream suits my coloring well, without adding any pink tones.</li>
            <li> Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label )</li>
            <li> Along with this one I also purchased the Pink version of Skin79 BB cream.</li>
            <li> (well, since I had to peel off the dead skin after it dried my face, I had soft skin for 2 weeks, but again,</li>
            <li> It gives me a slightly dewy look, and I brush on a little Bare Minerals powder if I want a matte finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually sort of works as a lotion, way too pale for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considered a pale asian girl but Skin79 was still too pale for me, especially when you compare it to the color of my neck.</li>
            <li> For starters, I&#x27;m a 23-year-old female with pale, oily skin, and freckles.</li>
            <li> , YOU MUST HAVE A PALE SKIN TONE TO PULL OFF THIS PRODUCT, IT ONLY COMES IN ONE SHADE</li>
            <li> I am caucasian with pale skin and the whiting effect seemed to only even out my skin.</li>
            <li> I am white with fairly pale skin.</li>
            <li> It has such a pale undertone..</li>
            <li> It has not only helped me with my acne, but I&#x27;ve also noticed less dark circles...</li>
            <li> Previously, I used Bare Minerals for years, because I don&#x27;t like heavy creams/powders on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a pure liquid</li>
            <li> I have sun damage (hypo-pigmentation) &amp; in the summer months, it&#x27;s difficult to cover it up because foundation seems to sweat right off.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, therefor it did not work on me, and on top of that broke me out, really bad.</li>
            <li> The mate finish is not strong enough to me, I still need to apply powder after the application.</li>
            <li> It was breaking out constantly, then drying out, then breaking out again, and I couldn&#x27;t seem to tame it no matter what I did.    </li>
            <li> The reason I have to take away one star is because it contains 3 different parabens, as well as BHT, butyl acetate, and a few other not-so-good ingredients.</li>
            <li> You need less than a pump (which ends up being way less than dime size) to cover your entire face.  </li>
            <li> , the other one had leaked all over the pink box.</li>
            <li> People are beige, not grey - unless they&#x27;re dead!)  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like its a little to dark or gray for my skin, but nothing I cant deal with as I have never found a makeup that actually matches my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping around for a long time to find a nice base for my makeup that wasn&#x27;t heavy or cakey looking.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not completely positive on this&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> so be careful very very careful.</li>
            <li> First off, the packaging was damaged (crushed box) when I got it and the product had a weird chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I let that dry and applied again, using even less.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caution use just a little dab as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It looks a little grey when you squirt it out, but when you apply it, it blends in to match your skin tone.</li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And remember, as little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I spread a little on my face and it gave me a somewhat grey skin tone.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes in pump form, keeping the bottle sanitary, and that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way).</li>
            <li> Her skin is fairly dark, and while it definitely didn&#x27;t blend well enough for her to ever use this seriously, it surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> I concur with other reviewers, it goes on a little grey, just let it oxidize it will blend in.</li>
            <li> am never going back to any other foundation ever!!!</li>
            <li> I am half chinese and have trouble finding any makeup to match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> With other foundations and BB creams I always felt like I was wearing something, but this just melds with my skin.</li>
            <li> That was also one other reason I stopped using Missha.  </li>
            <li> I purchased both my products from Tokyo Japan Outlet and they are BOTH legit, so I am not vouching for any other seller.</li>
            <li> Shipping was way faster than I had expected- kudos for that!  </li>
            <li> Buy this cream if you&#x27;re too lazy to follow a regular routine or mix up your products in your palm...</li>
            <li> as i looked at other&#x27;s review i decided to purchase one and try it.</li>
            <li> or I get flaky, and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> My biggest problem is monthly breakouts due to hormones.  </li>
            <li> The color seems to have grayish undertones due to the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> As for the other properties of improving the skin and lightening scarring, I will update after I have been using the product longer.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a reduction in darkness of my freckles (due to the whitening agent).  </li>
            <li> but it was also created to rejuvinate and heal skin, which once again those other products were not made to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wrinkles are more visible, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong :/</li>
            <li> Also included samples of other Skin79 products.</li>
            <li> It is which I judge all other bb creams by.  </li>
            <li> and I usually wear the lightest or next to lightest shade in any foundation line.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a makeup product that would help reduce the redness in my face due to years of acne, and consequently, acne scars.</li>
            <li> Based off the other reviews, this also helps improve skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe other BB creams get the job done as well...</li>
            <li> I like this foundation, but like any other it wears off throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not breaking out or getting bumps on my face like with other primers or BB creams.</li>
            <li> I will probably never use any other BB cream.</li>
            <li> I was convinced by the other reviews to try this product</li>
            <li> Do need to blot or refresh after a number of hours, but this lasts longer than any other foundation I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It also didnt seem to moisturize as well as the other skin79 BB creams.</li>
            <li> I am not sure the BB Cream was the reason, but since switching to every other day or so have had no further breakouts.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t touched my other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with trying other \\&quot;foundations\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> And this makes me look like a ghost; maybe it&#x27;s because of the gray cast due to SPF.</li>
            <li> all the other ones i have tried.</li>
            <li> It got to me a lot faster than expected!</li>
            <li> what i&#x27;m going to do with all my other foundation.  </li>
            <li> and although I don&#x27;t have any other BB creams to compare it with, I gave it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this on a whim, and since, I&#x27;ve thrown out every other foundation in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use foundations from MAC, but recently this past year, I have switched to Make Up For Ever&#x27;s Mat Velvet+ and also use Revlon PhotoReady.</li>
            <li> I will look into other bb creams, maybe the gold version of this or a missha one.</li>
            <li> Be careful ladies!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;floral scent\\&quot; other people smelled, but to me, it smelled like baby powder.</li>
            <li> I tried on sample packets of BB creams from other brands before trying this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grey but after a few minutes, it changes to your skin tone.</li>
            <li> and it is not greasy like other BB</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dancer, and after a 6 hour rehearsal and sweating it did not come off like my other foundations had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dancer, and after a 6 hour rehearsal and sweating it did not come off like my other foundations had.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little grey but don&#x27;t panic!</li>
            <li> I have never used any other BB creams</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of bb creams but none have lived up to my expectations until this item.</li>
            <li> Seeing now that other companies are trying to cash in calling their cream BB</li>
            <li> Jart and my other foundation + mattifying primer routine.</li>
            <li> i also worry about it could be a fake one because it doesnt looks exactly like the pic in Skin79 offical website.</li>
            <li> I thought I would put in my two cents on this topic as a 50+ woman with freckles and other sun damage.  </li>
            <li> Both BB Creams look weird when you first put it on, but eventually blends to your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I never considered that there would be something that works like a foundation but doesn&#x27;t cause all those other problems.</li>
            <li> next day, I got up and took a peek at it, not sure if I should put anything on my face from a stranger.</li>
            <li> (those small samples will last you almost a week if you ration correctly!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (those small samples will last you almost a week if you ration correctly!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the other Skin79 products</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t need any other make up to blend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use this than any other foundation.</li>
            <li> this bb cream replaces all my other tinted moisturizers and foundation combined.</li>
            <li> Like all the other BB Cream from Korea, this product meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> will try other BB cream samples just so that I can compare them.</li>
            <li> Due to this, I have seen how we have Americanized a lot of things</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail the other day.</li>
            <li> I would always get a makeup crease between my eyebrows with other makeup.  </li>
            <li> It might not have been the product that broke me out, it might be the fact it made me oily and cause me to break out due to the oils and makeup.</li>
            <li> BB creams make your skin like an oil slick, in such cases as mine, and even go on oily.</li>
            <li> At first I was alittle nerves because of all the makeup in the cream,but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any skin improvements like the other reviewers</li>
            <li> I was worried about the gray color that other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and it doesnt make your face look cakey like other brands do.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this product and might even try some of the other Skin79 versions of BB cream.</li>
            <li> the other was the gold.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t get when I used it on a close to daily basis.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried other BB creams from the drugstore</li>
            <li> so now my face doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning while I squint at all the other cars in traffic, with the sun in my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today, there was \\&quot;surgery\\&quot; to remove the parts, and though it was not easy, I managed to transfer the rest (using a small paintbrush and a lot of patience)into another container, wasting some that had dried out from when it got clogged, but still salvaging a decent amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I top this with Ben Nye Banana powder (loose powder that stupid Kim Kardashian promoted), and my face looks photo shopped</li>
            <li> But the tint wasn&#x27;t right for me; I wear medium Bare Minerals powder and despite leaving the BB lotion on to absorb, it still had a light/gray hue, making me look like I was sick-</li>
            <li> I little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I also have combination skin in the summer, but get just a little dry in the winter, so I use a moisturizer before applying the product.</li>
            <li> I also bought another one from Korea, the first few uses looked great, but after that, the fake cream came out awful.</li>
            <li> Lasts long, isn&#x27;t too pale.</li>
            <li> Skin 79 pink bb cream fake vs real.</li>
            <li> , I expected to pay at least double that.</li>
            <li> I deal with moderate acne constantly and this seems to just be making it worse.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of thr reviews I expected it to be slightly lighter than my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Always Triple BB Cream which do what I want BB creams to do minus any odd scents/thickness/gray cast.</li>
            <li> I got it nearly 9 months ago and it finally ran out sadly.</li>
            <li> it even helped me get rid of broken capillaries around my nose, such a generous amount too will last me for months!</li>
            <li> its only who those are very very pale.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, with problems of having red around my nose/cheeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you&#x27;ve purchased this and found it was too light on you, seriously consider using it as a base for Bare Minerals instead of putting it in the back of the drawer with the rest of products that didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fair, but im not dark tanned either</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not your average complexion and lots of other tinted moisturizers and things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even skipped my usual face base because this product serves the same purpose even better.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my as I have used it for the past two months, the unevenness in my skin tone is lessened and smaller wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I only need to use concealer in extreme cases now, which is hardly ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 25), so I&#x27;ve been looking very hard for something my sensitive skin can handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within the pink outer shell is a smaller white container (not unusual for makeup), but what shocked me is that within the white container there was a small 1-inch container where the makeup is actually held.</li>
            <li> The job I do makes me work hard enough to sweat, and this product doesn&#x27;t run or smudge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packing is hard to tell how much is left</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s hard to do when you have to drive back and forth to school in California during rush hours.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s a little scary because it looks gray and way too dark (for my complexion anyway)</li>
            <li> I just dab a little on the spot and let it sit and dry a little before i blend.</li>
            <li> It made my face shiny and not really natural looking, like a little heavy and weighted down.</li>
            <li> One down side is that its hard to tell when you are running low because of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I guess this makes it sound bad, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I was using Fit Me by Maybelline, and I had really bad breakouts with it,</li>
            <li> American cosmetics companies have gotten into the BB cream business lately, but the ones I&#x27;ve tried from Garnier and L&#x27;Oreal are just basically tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for the undereyes it brightens the eyes and covers the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I was so angry and upset because i really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> I have mildly dark under eye circles and I have tried using concealer on them</li>
            <li> and my skin had been acting up lately.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hide my dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> I purchased a darker shade in Missha (another Korean BB Cream) but that was too dark.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it&#x27;d be a fake, but it was the real deal and the packaging was intact.</li>
            <li> It may look real but it is fake.</li>
            <li> There are websites that are dedicated to show you how a real and a fake bb cream looks like.</li>
            <li> Buying it on Amazon is not worth the wait</li>
            <li> I bought this product and even though some people claim that it is a fake knock off of the real product.</li>
            <li> product won&#x27;t work if your skin is dark or a darker medium.</li>
            <li> I was also worried about whether it was the fake BB cream, or the real one.  </li>
            <li> that went over telling a real from a fake bottle.</li>
            <li> so I have to still use concealer for my dark circles,</li>
            <li> I had been using another brand of BB cream (a drugstore brand, which I hear isnt a \\&quot;real\\&quot; bb cream), but it was too dark for me and my skin felt greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost too dark for my skin color, but it&#x27;s not that noticeable unless you&#x27;re specifically looking for it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, which is why I can&#x27;t give it five starts, is the applicator itself.</li>
            <li> I just need a bit of concealer under my eyes for dark circles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, since BB creams are made and marketed towards fair-skinned women, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for tan or dark skinned ladies.</li>
            <li> Even the lightest drug store and department store brands are too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> the dark spots seem to be fading</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any changes after I used it, and my face become dark in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> and the next month I was four days late.</li>
            <li> I tried everything with no success.</li>
            <li> I dedicated weeks to watching Youtube video and reading about how to tell the difference between the real and fake bottles/packaging.</li>
            <li> look.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this has lightened some dark spots and freckles on my face after about a month&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> Everything from the texture, oil, and dark spots have evened out.</li>
            <li> But be advised that they have  a fake  one that does not  meet t the standards of the real bb cream.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t use it cuz the color was too dark</li>
            <li> But this cream is thick, and unlike American products has a greyish tint to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated the way a full coverage, long lasting foundation felt and looked</li>
            <li> /&gt;After perusing around on the Internets for a product that could help even out skin tone but that wouldn&#x27;t require a heavy foundation or ten layers of a thin product, I came across this gem, which is mentioned on multiple YouTube Beauty Channels.</li>
            <li> I just ordered more from Kate the Babe because I would hate to run out of it.  </li>
            <li> I just spent a few minutes trying to think of a con, but</li>
            <li> 1 is dried up &amp;empty</li>
            <li> I have tried a few BB creams but certainly not all.  </li>
            <li> ... not going to sit here and try to scratch off my brand new product to base if it&#x27;s real or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s down to 1 if at all).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> down side</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve gone down to using oil-absorbing sheets maybe once</li>
            <li> It was stated that this product is identical to a daily routine and that if you decide to use this product it is because you are lazy!  </li>
            <li> So I decided to do little research of a product online, and read some reviews from other customers through google.</li>
            <li> Covers and blends extremely well!  </li>
            <li> The plus side is that the BB cream can be used underneath other makeup, so you can brush powder or blush onto it!</li>
            <li> i literally have tried everything to blend in the pink to match the rest of my face!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how it will do with other skin types, but for me, I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> It does take time for it to adjust on your face to match your skin tone but other than that it does so wonders!</li>
            <li> Alot of youtubers who are black mix this with thier foundation, but I wear it along with MAC mineralized skinfinish in Dark.</li>
            <li> I usually have somewhat dry skin in the winter and this product doesnot work for me.</li>
            <li> The pink gives a little heavier coverage whereas the gold is a little lighter coverage.</li>
            <li> You might need concealer if you have anything other than just uneven tone.  </li>
            <li> but as you blend it in the BB will match your color, a little goes a long way so use about 5 small pumps and spread evenly with a concealer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that I need to use a very small amount to cover my face (maybe a half-pump total?).</li>
            <li> The fake products have a tube extending down into the main chamber.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never suffered from acne or excessively dry skin, although I usually have a little unevenness in skin tone and my dark circles are pronounced.</li>
            <li> I use many products on my skin and hardly ever have a bad reaction</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and have really pale skin and can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on my arm!!</li>
            <li> , I find that when I&#x27;m wearing this cream, my face is remarkably less oily...</li>
            <li> So to my black sistas out their give this a try you might like the out come of this product.</li>
            <li> also wanted to address one issue that I saw in a previous review.  </li>
            <li> So, less than two weeks</li>
            <li> I got TONS of those from this product whereas typically I get maybe 1 or 2 from time to time.</li>
            <li> that any of my previous bottles.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually bother to write reviews, because usually someone else has already voiced the same opinion.  </li>
            <li> always looks slightly oily on me.</li>
            <li> it does have a slight scent</li>
            <li> I recommend it to those who already have their acne at bay as it has slight clogging properties.</li>
            <li> I use half a pump and pat it on, it goes on so creamy and matte that I don&#x27;t even need powder.</li>
            <li> The results are lighter and clearer skin with less acne all around.</li>
            <li> the pump and the nozzle were not sealed 3) slight difference in packaging as compared to the Skin79 site (I know...</li>
            <li> (besides the odd hormonal zit when I have my period).  </li>
            <li> this lasted less than a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for less than three weeks and can’t tell if there are any “anti-aging” or “lightening” benefits.</li>
            <li> Odd smell.</li>
            <li> There is a slight Gray-ish tint to it</li>
            <li> Less is more&lt;</li>
            <li> Package came in less than a week.</li>
            <li> It has a scent, but it&#x27;s slight and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slightly greasy to the touch</li>
            <li> (it is slightly grayish on me</li>
            <li> even the price is less than others.</li>
            <li> I managed to fix this by using a slight brushing of e.l.f.</li>
            <li> i am a little medium dark skin and it worked with my skin complection</li>
            <li> of the major things I&#x27;ve noticed: My acne has decreased.</li>
            <li> of the major things I&#x27;ve noticed: My acne has decreased.</li>
            <li> I have very pale Irish skin with brown hair and hazel eyes, and usually wear NW 1 MAC foundation which has a pinkish cast.</li>
            <li> My face still gets oily but not as bad and much later in the day; but my pores definitely look smaller and my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li> The only thing to take note of is if you are not fair skinned, then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> It dispenses the cream without much of a mess.    </li>
            <li> Why mess with perfection?</li>
            <li> So I started using the bb cream and it dried out my breakouts and lightened up the dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> did like the coverage and the finish, but the mess it made out of my skin was unforgivable.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few creams that isn&#x27;t too dark for my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used foundation or anything like that in the past</li>
            <li> Other BB creams and concealers left my skin dry, gave little coverage, and were expensive.</li>
            <li> It DOES apply a little thick with a slight grey hue</li>
            <li> and my skin felt tight even though I moisturized</li>
            <li> Just a small pump allows me to provide coverage for my entire face, and after I&#x27;ve blended it and patted it on, I hardly feel like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying from her from now on, unless someone finds new information to prove me wrong.</li>
            <li> but I have been using this product for a very long time now (at least 1 year)</li>
            <li> may be, a little.</li>
            <li> every day I have a couple little ones.</li>
            <li> is a little lighter</li>
            <li> However, it looks lighter on me because I tend to get a little tanner in the summer</li>
            <li> a little concealer won&#x27;t fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one-shade-fits-most color is a bit darker than my skin, but I blend a little into my neck and it works.</li>
            <li> Also, it is a little grayish.</li>
            <li> i use a brush to put it on my face, but i think this is a little oily for me</li>
            <li> It makes my face look brighter and a little lighter but not substantially.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit worrired about the whitening</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because it made me break out a little bit.</li>
            <li> little information about my skin tone -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I did a little research on BB creams, since some of my friends have been talking about it.</li>
            <li> This cream does make my skin a little bit brighter.  </li>
            <li> I was a little scared about the tone, since Im purchasing it online</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I started this product and stopped using my other skin care products.  </li>
            <li> Little product required to cover face.</li>
            <li> Lasted a little longer than Missha.</li>
            <li> give you a little background, I am a 22-year-old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other BB creams and was never really satisfied.  </li>
            <li> If I have any discolored areas I&#x27;ve been tapping a little foundation there for additional coverage.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing that a little concealer won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> so I just put a little bit of concealer on if I need to.</li>
            <li> Also, the cream does go on a little greyish.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it works for me, but I did try putting a little bit on my wrist.</li>
            <li> ; It smells a little bit like sunscreen and flowers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little gray, but the gray tint fades once</li>
            <li> It does go on just a little gray to begin with</li>
            <li> Besides, i got little free-try of SKIN79 BB Cream VIP Gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I usually apply powder once about halfway through the day, but other than that, I don&#x27;t notice shine.</li>
            <li> that little sample lasted me three days</li>
            <li> However, I got the hang of it and actually like the fact that it isn&#x27;t so thin because that means I need to use much less of it per application.</li>
            <li> I also heard that if the sticker comes off easily it&#x27;s a fake, so i went ahead and tried to pick at the label (silly me), and it came off at the corner easily</li>
            <li> My skintone is a little uneven and is combination.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not friendly to makeup and after a few hours will look cakey and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this in the humid summer weather because it is a little too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> it didnt let me down!</li>
            <li> I hate that I can&#x27;t be for certain, by the weight it still feels like there is product left in the container, and</li>
            <li> But other than that, this is all I need!!</li>
            <li> It covers all the little broken veins that are starting in my cheeks, undereye circles, blemishes what have you.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin type, acne scars, and am really not fussy, so I need something that won&#x27;t be hard to keep even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading alot on bb cream, and came across skin79, had a hard decision between gold label or the pink.</li>
            <li> However, it can be a little too pale during summer (</li>
            <li> My skin was a little tan and after putting this on I looked a bit pale</li>
            <li> To all of you who just bought one recently and your bottle still says Wrinkle Free, :&#x27;( idk, check the date if it&#x27;s 2012, should say Wrinkle Improvement!</li>
            <li> Some reasons, I felt it was too heavy, too oily.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for something to just smooth/even out your face, this shit&#x27;s the way to go.</li>
            <li> I thought, &amp;#34;Since it lasted through spin, it must be excessively harsh, so I will be breaking out any minute now.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to blend in with my complexion.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s Seoul Glamour sold it for around $9 bucks and another few bucks for shipping.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised about the price but also worried that this might be fake.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Seriously a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Does not provide heavy coverage</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of using the product I noticed my pores started to shrink.  </li>
            <li> everyday anyway</li>
            <li> but when you give it a few seconds it adjusts and matches your skin tone.</li>
            <li> When looking for a face cream, I run into a few problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream having read a few reports on it.</li>
            <li> , i use it for everyday wear w my eyeliner</li>
            <li> As it dried, it took on a whitish film color and dried sticky.  </li>
            <li> finally feel like I have found my beauty secret</li>
            <li> a few days before it arrived.</li>
            <li> So my make up still feels heavy.</li>
            <li> Just spot treat a few stubborn areas with coverup if need be.</li>
            <li> Does not feel too heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I researched BB creams heavily before buying this product.</li>
            <li> I wear Skin79 BB Cream everyday and one bottle lasted about 4months.</li>
            <li> Looked worse having it on than I did prior to putting anything on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now and have used it everyday</li>
            <li> and I tried patting it but got impatient and just rubbed it on.</li>
            <li> , a few things raised a flag with me.</li>
            <li> I do not wear it everyday because I do not wear makeup everyday</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about it is that when you put it on your face it turns gray but that disappears in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, a few sun spots and no pimples or visible blemishes or scar that I need to cover up with foundation.</li>
            <li> It also melts away quickly in a few hours after application</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel heavy like a foundation at all, but the coverage was undeniable.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel heavy like a foundation at all, but the coverage was undeniable.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is a step up and found after a few weeks I no longer needed to moisturize before application.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few BB creams before this one</li>
            <li> but I have a few problems with it that will not allow me to use it daily:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a waste when you can&#x27;t return the item...</li>
            <li> I immediately washed it off as it made me look halfway dead.</li>
            <li> and you wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> There are a few blogs dedicated to authenticating skin79&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> I also do not like the heavy face make up/foundation look.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and the way it made my skin look, but after a few weeks I started breaking out.  </li>
            <li> its now my everyday &#x27;makeup&#x27; routine  unless Im going somewhere</li>
            <li> then I will whip out my heavy duty foundation</li>
            <li> I do not use this as a moisturizer, but instead use my Cera Ve a few minute before applying and allow that to absorb before applying this.</li>
            <li> ... I happened to be one of the few who had a horrid reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who is a few shades darker than I am</li>
            <li> I apply one pump for my face + neck, wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> will look for another BB cream that is a lighter shade next time, just not happy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to pack on foundation everyday as I am a stay at home mom.</li>
            <li> I have dark under eye circles and some scars on my skin from past acne.</li>
            <li> few tips</li>
            <li> few tips</li>
            <li> However, after a few hours my face looks like a grease ball and every pore on my face is highlighted.  </li>
            <li> I bought my cream in February and still use it everyday.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-covers over any uneven skin tones&lt;</li>
            <li> I was fascinated with the hype behind these Asian BB creams.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday as base,&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sufficient coverage you need but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like a foundation.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or cakey at all either.</li>
            <li> However, a few weeks after using it, I started developing whiteheads everywhere.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has few blemishes.</li>
            <li> The sticker was also a bit misplaced</li>
            <li> The coverage is medium to slightly heavy</li>
            <li> Wait a few minutes to let the BB match your tone&lt;</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the product and the fact that it isn&#x27;t heavy like foundation, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy this BB Cream again.</li>
            <li> that usually make foundation look really weird on my, stays on all day, has a relatively unobtrusive scent and the container lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> things I don&#x27;t like however are I have to remove it everyday</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this product, it made me break out</li>
            <li> You will probably need to use a concealer to cover any trouble areas.</li>
            <li> (A few shades lighter than me...</li>
            <li> Have had issues with adult-onset acne and have been battling it for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all heavy like foundation</li>
            <li> I am a Pet Groomer and I wear makeup everyday to protect my skin from Hair, germs, flying poo, what have you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like I had some heavy product on my face, and it also didn&#x27;t make my face oily or shiny,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I will try to update this in a few weeks if I start noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on ashy but oxidizes to match your skin tone after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> my face completely dried up.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY .</li>
            <li> It became visible in my creases after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not a huge gamble.</li>
            <li> Well today I took the product apart to scavenge the remains of what seemed to be an heavy bottle with a broken pump just to find that almost the entire container is made out of plastic.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on pale, but after a few minutes it oxidizes to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m bad at picking the right color for my face.</li>
            <li> It took less than a week to arrive!</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t fights other skin problems (like wrinkles, moles, and scars), it&#x27;s too hard to get off your hands (</li>
            <li> I have a yellowish to pale skin tone that sometimes changes to a darker shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too pale (for a redhead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a redhead with pale skin</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re pale, these Korean products match</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my face look pale), it seems to cause my skin to break out for some reason (I have rather oily skin).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d stopped using it because I thought it made my face look too pale, but now I think I&#x27;m getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> One problem though - the shade is too pale.</li>
            <li> It looks a bit pale /grayish as soon as you apply it</li>
            <li> I have pale skin, but this makes me look like a ghost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a freckled, pale woman who&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> (I have some dark hyper pigmentation and a few angry red blemishes)</li>
            <li> But, there are other SKIN79 BB creams that are not as thick and do not feel like another layer on my skin.</li>
            <li> As other posters stated it is THICK.</li>
            <li> I managed to keep it operating for about 1/3 of the container, and then it just plain stopped.  </li>
            <li> However, after using this product every day for 1 week, I noticed that after a few hours, my skin started feeling very tight.</li>
            <li> but my skin is generally tame with a bit of redness around the nose.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems breaking out, in fact the BB cream seemed to have healed a few little blemishes that I did have!  </li>
            <li> This is not true at all!  </li>
            <li> and get&#x27;s a little lazy...)</li>
            <li> It is thick and the pigment is not right, but I also have an oily face, and my skin color is close to toffee.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say yet if it&#x27;s helping cut down on my breakouts</li>
            <li> My one hugeee problem with this product is that it seemed to break me out pretty badly.  </li>
            <li> My only real complaint about this is the oil control.</li>
            <li> My only sun exposure was when I was in my teens and early 20&#x27;s and stupidly used tanning beds for a few weeks here and there.</li>
            <li> It broke me out worse than anything I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> This allowed me to use just a teensy drop of concealer in trouble spots as opposed to all over my face like usual.</li>
            <li> This allowed me to use just a teensy drop of concealer in trouble spots as opposed to all over my face like usual.</li>
            <li> Made me moire oily than usual  after a few hours...  </li>
            <li> me its just full of crap.</li>
            <li> After it oxidizes it is still about a shade lighter than my skin tone, but I finish it with a slightly darker powder and the difference is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Leave it to Asia to create a new crazy beauty hype.</li>
            <li> have acne prone skin, awful scarring, red blotchy patches, huge pores and a ridiculously oily T-zone.  </li>
            <li> I seem to get giant, painful, red zits sporadically</li>
            <li> I tried this in the summer and it was a little lighter than what my tanned summer skin was but not pasty at all!</li>
            <li> used this site (a Little Makeup Box blog) to determine if my product was legit or not, and everything checks out!</li>
            <li> But i felt like i can&#x27;t put the foundation on my skin every single day, because i noticed it&#x27;s making my face worse.</li>
            <li> very pale and my skin tone is uneven, But this fixes it.</li>
            <li> coverage effect is not good as other foundations to be frank.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t apply too much of product as it made me look pale and sick.</li>
            <li> I would certainly by this again - too bad</li>
            <li> I literally use very little almost every day and I ran out of my bb cream on March 23.  </li>
            <li> I have tried both rubbing it in and patting it on an (with my fingertips) and the rubbing leaves very little product on your skin to oxidize.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit thick</li>
            <li> I got acne after using this for three days straight which I think is really bad.</li>
            <li> I also now have small hives all over my face.</li>
            <li> A lot of the foundations that I have tried on in the past has made me break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now and am not really sure what the hype is all about.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have acne.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it for anybody who is too lazy to put on layers and layers of foundation and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> (my face looks like an oily slick by the end of the day</li>
            <li> My usual coverage routine is Moisterizer + Concealer + Foundation (which takes forever so spackle on my face to get even coverage)+ Finishing Powder, now my routine is BB Cream + Dabs of finishing powder on the oily spots.</li>
            <li> For those that say it doesn&#x27;t give enough coverage, I&#x27;m guessing they are applying it wrong.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply BAreMinerals foundation over it.  </li>
            <li> The application usually has a \\&quot;firm\\&quot; feel to it, not springy feeling or sounding.</li>
            <li> (*  This past summer I tried IT Cosmetics CC+ with SPF 50</li>
            <li> I am not sure if is because is a fake or because it&#x27;s out in the open.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and just generally red angry rashy skin even when taken care of and pampered</li>
            <li> Usually I have to mix two colors together.</li>
            <li> Give it a few minutes to &#x27;settle&#x27; in and voila!</li>
            <li> I only recently learned there are fake SKIN79 bottles floating around (scary)</li>
            <li> It took me almost a year to finish one package, as the amount needed was fairly small.</li>
            <li> No more tinted moisturizer for me!although</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown up with acne in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s improved my complexion as I don&#x27;t see any noticeable changes</li>
            <li> I was instantly amazed at what it claimed it could do, but skeptical too of course.</li>
            <li> It is known to cause breakouts in a small percentage of users.</li>
            <li> My skin felt thick and greasy within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it came with a small sample of the gold</li>
            <li> So I rub in a small amount with both hands and then blot with a tissue.  </li>
            <li> my everyday make up is this wid power foundation!</li>
            <li> Start small and use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Just dab small dots all over your face and then *pat* it into your skin, don&#x27;t rub.</li>
            <li> Start small and use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Just dab small dots all over your face and then *pat* it into your skin, don&#x27;t rub.</li>
            <li> It feels thick and heavy when you apply it, also makes your skin shiny.</li>
            <li> countless money on expensive products and cosmetic tools.  </li>
            <li> no more oily:)[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> my face looked dried and cakey like that of elephant skin!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> so I tend to put small amounts on so that it can oxidize</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I buy that.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> It looks lighter, cleaner, and no more</li>
            <li> usually wash my face with cleanser and follow with my lotion which has SPF 30.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, ive had sun damage appear on my face that my dermatologist told me it&#x27;s next to impossible to reverse the discoloration.  </li>
            <li> Very few products surprise me and do just what they say...</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t feel very heavy</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is fake, but I did some research about how to tell the difference between the fake and real one.</li>
            <li> I will probably try out some other, less expensive BB creams for now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so much less splotchy and dull that I seriously wish I had tried this stuff sooner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of bad things about this particular BB cream being \\&quot;too grey\\&quot;, and I can see where that comes from.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale (NC 15-20) and I&#x27;m 28 yrs.</li>
            <li> I have a very pale skin tone and combination skin</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> However, this makes me look very pale wearing it, like I haven&#x27;t seen the sun in forever.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for oily skin</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching all of the different BB creams listed on Amazon and having been disappointed with a BB cream from a well known cosmetic company</li>
            <li> , I was a little wary of trying something new, but decided I was going to do it anyway because my tinted moisturizer wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.</li>
            <li> And, oh God, i discovered SKIN79 and fell for it hard.</li>
            <li> there is hardly anything in that pump.</li>
            <li> face has hardly had any breakouts since using this product.</li>
            <li> I notice my face had got dull and</li>
            <li> so I have a hard time matching makeup products.  </li>
            <li> I am a little confused about the color though.  </li>
            <li> St. Tropez looks almost black when squeezed out of the tube, but is actually a very thin liquid- almost with a green tint-</li>
            <li> , I even not noticed it was already too late until Amazon asked me to review.</li>
            <li> (and yes I tend to break out very easily, at least I use to)...</li>
            <li> i dont feel oil at all until late evening.</li>
            <li> The month I started using this product I was late for my period by a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super dramatic, and it&#x27;s not overnight...</li>
            <li> Or at least I don&#x27;t think it did!)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I never liked wearing foundations because I don&#x27;t like the make up look.  </li>
            <li> reviews for Pink Gelee&#x27;s product say theirs were fake, but I emailed the shop owner with my concerns, placed the order, and took a leap of faith.</li>
            <li> I stippled it on to ensure it wouldn&#x27;t go on thick</li>
            <li> , I need to use a thick concealer with this \\&quot;BB\\&quot; cream.</li>
            <li> It is not too thick and not sticky.</li>
            <li> so I do suggest applying a gentle sunscreen as a base layer before applying BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be quite thick</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just thick in that area.</li>
            <li> I get a few pimples a week, but this BB cream does not make it worse.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is slightly thick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not to heavy or thin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and i havent broken out from</li>
            <li> Decided to give this a go as I was slowly getting fed up with makeup again</li>
            <li> I found that it was too thick for all over</li>
            <li> so I was forced to stop using it.</li>
            <li> so no more dots of foundation showing!</li>
            <li> I know there are other reviews saying this product from Amazon is fake.</li>
            <li> and they end up nothing like the original (I am thinking of Ellnet hairspray as one horrible example).</li>
            <li> and they end up nothing like the original (I am thinking of Ellnet hairspray as one horrible example).</li>
            <li> My jaw dropped when I saw it retailed to 70 DOLLARS for a small tube!</li>
            <li> sometimes flaky, sometimes, oily slick!</li>
            <li> With BB Cream, no more makeup crease!  </li>
            <li> It has parabens... and some other ingredients that are a bit ~questionable~</li>
            <li> but I am not really sure on that!</li>
            <li> have tried other bb creams but haven&#x27;t cared for them, from garnier, to brands sold out sephora, they haven&#x27;t wowed me and are on the expensive end.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Like others have said the initial color is a very ugly grey but maybe 3 or 5 minutes of putting it onto your face</li>
            <li> dont have a very usual skintone either</li>
            <li> A very small amount goes a looonggg way&lt;</li>
            <li> Being the skeptical person I am, I did some research on this counterfeit subject through youtube before applying any to my face.</li>
            <li> and seriously i&#x27;m the happiest person in the World without necessity to put the ton of the makeup product in my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The breakouts have been terrible, especially around my chin, and they don&#x27;t go away even with multiple acne medications.</li>
            <li> My huge problem and why I rated it so poorly is that it broke me out terribly!</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s ridiculously affordable...</li>
            <li> I have to say that after I got this product I was a little skeptical as it made my skin look blotchy after I put it on</li>
            <li> This makeup is a little weird in consistency.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical trying bb cream but decided to give it a go.  </li>
            <li> how badly I wanted my Skin79 cream back!!  </li>
            <li> When this BB cream arrived I was having a particularly bad break out along my jawline with some fading acne and current cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad skin but with the BB creams I tried I always needed to put foundation over them because the coverage was just too sheer.</li>
            <li> My skin looks porcelain after this is applied, and my skin is NOT good at all.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few which say it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> I find of like the finish but be careful about this product , it broke me out like crazy</li>
            <li> 2 out of 3 are not good.</li>
            <li> and im not fair skinned</li>
            <li> Not a good look.</li>
            <li> I used to never leave the house without some concealer and foundation on, because I was uncomfortable with my uneven skintone and some spots.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to control sebum but after 6 hours I have a shiny t zone, so I am fearful it won&#x27;t hold up very well during the summer here in Texas, but I guess that remains to be seen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick, not too thin, and spreads evenly.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any added skin benefits, although I probably didn&#x27;t give it enough time for that since it made me look sick.</li>
            <li> It was disappointing to open a fake.</li>
            <li> Although I still have some acne, it is not near as bad as it used to be</li>
            <li> Even if I tried to apply extra layers, it&#x27;s as if it&#x27;s afraid of spots!</li>
            <li> This BB cream was so thick!</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> but since there weren&#x27;t any bad reviews i decided to buy from pink gelee.</li>
            <li> Like I said, this product does what it says, so I give it 4 stars, minus one for the bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> and I would always break out, which was frustrating.</li>
            <li> and I think it helped in making my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I got worried I&#x27;d get a rip-off.</li>
            <li> so whenever I put this stuff on without putting it on my neck, my face looked greyish, unhealthy looking.</li>
            <li> but it just turns out worse.  </li>
            <li> Not going to lie, I don&#x27;t have very severe acne, not cystic or anything horrible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like the immediate change in the look and feel of my skin, and I must have tried hundreds of skincare products during my 68 years.</li>
            <li> The real one shouldn&#x27;t smell like this, it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be too heavy for my skin, making the oily areas oilier.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out once since using this product.</li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t broken me out either.</li>
            <li> Have never used foundation because of its heavy feel and artificial appearance.  </li>
            <li> Sorry for the late review</li>
            <li> (think Victoria&#x27;s Secret type vanilla-y smell or Bath and Body</li>
            <li> You can apply a thin layer for days</li>
            <li> I found my beauty secret.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that it&#x27;s darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> lighter (like a tinted moisturizer) coverage is what you&#x27;re going for this may work for you, unfortunately I learned the hard way it doesn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> I am providing this info so that you know I am very serious about my skin care when I endorse this product.</li>
            <li> I was a tad disappointed because instead of receiving the Gold Label BB cream sample (as other buyers have indicated)</li>
            <li> I did look at other videos on the real on VS fake one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out this bad since I tried my hand at OCM a few years ago, and failed misserably.</li>
            <li> I opened the package expecting the worse, that it may be a fake BB cream.</li>
            <li> Im so tired of waiting for the cream to come and then realize it&#x27;s FAKE.</li>
            <li> but the fact that it made it worse is weird.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy as I planned to give the other 2 as gifts for Christmas stuffer.</li>
            <li> new, expensive make up that I take a risk on and then hate and never use again, so hopefully it helps you!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed at BB creams including this one.</li>
            <li> I recommend Dr. Jart+ Black Label Detox Healing Blemish Base BB</li>
            <li> Beware, fake products are out there</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not every expensive, why do people make/sell fake products).  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s NOTHING WRONG with this product.</li>
            <li> but im kinda skeptical about the seller.</li>
            <li> China is making lots fake copies of bb cream 79</li>
            <li> a fake</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re wanting to cover difficult acne or scars, you might want to go with a heavier one.</li>
            <li> I hope I didn&#x27;t receive a fake, but I have thoroughly researched on youtube.com what fakes look like, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the item is fake also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive brand names to drug stores stuff.</li>
            <li> I was merely hoping that the cream would help cover this up and control oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a mere $14.50, which price-wise, compares to drugstore foundations.</li>
            <li> Goes on scary white/gray, BUT turns into your skin color...</li>
            <li> So it helps cover my unfortunate acne.</li>
            <li> I am sad to report that I am returning both of my BB creams to the seller because I feel that I bought fakes.</li>
            <li> I sought out information online on how to spot a fake and I found that there are a lot of contradictions.</li>
            <li> Also as a side note, those who say \\&quot;oh, your product is fake if the labeled words scratch off,\\</li>
            <li> &quot; that&#x27;s just silly.</li>
            <li> , this is a fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that if it comes out leaky or watery, it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and within days, my acne started getting worst.</li>
            <li> , it was fake..</li>
            <li> 2 days after using it, I started breaking out which is weird..</li>
            <li> and theyre so red and its just disgusting..</li>
            <li> I did do ALOT of research before buying and found that alot of sellers were selling Fake SKin79 products.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s resources on how to spot fake brands out there if you search.</li>
            <li> I go off my daily care routine for a day and my face breaks out terribly.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try ANY coverage</li>
            <li> Seller sent me a FAKE skin79 bb cream.</li>
            <li> I reported seller to AMAZON and SKIN79 for selling fake products.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a store since i didn&#x27;t want to take the chance of getting a fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, since the product was not sealed, I am wary of trying it.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fake or not.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sad to say that I&#x27;ll be passing it along to my mom when I go home to visit over Christmas.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the idea that it said whitening.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t dislike this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried before, and it makes me look fake and cakey.</li>
            <li> The fake does not have the gray tint and is a thinner consistency.</li>
            <li> I always wondered if it was fake or not.</li>
            <li> the color is not perfect</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to set it aside and try something else.</li>
            <li> Just google fake</li>
            <li> well it truly looked like I was wearing the wrong color</li>
            <li> obviously fake pancake face\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> obviously fake pancake face\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> You can see that you have make-up on, but it doesn&#x27;t look fake or caked on.</li>
            <li> so I really hate when people waste it.</li>
            <li> I watched a video to learn about the fake products floating around Ebay and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying from amazon</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color of this product does not play well with my skin tones, hence the 4-star rating.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading the reviews that I may get a fake</li>
            <li> I compared it to the fake and</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plenty of products get a lot of useless hype</li>
            <li> I gotta admit this stuff is fake</li>
            <li> dat tell u is fake but the product it self</li>
            <li> but it is a fake product from China which means there is no regulation on what chemicals are going into the product.</li>
            <li> After hearing about this makeup I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> For about four months earlier this year, my skin had been absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry if you buy it if your skin is combination/dry like mine.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;not too expensive</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong</li>
            <li> If you go out to the product&#x27;s website it will show you how to tell if your product is a fake.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews that people have gotten fake BB creams from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I like to read reviews before I buy any product, online or not, and I was bummed to learn that a lot of people had come across fake BB Creams that made them break out.</li>
            <li> I have read the rumors about this being a fake product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a fake.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any weird reaction to it like some people did</li>
            <li> I used process of elimination for all my products, and unfortunately this is the culprit.</li>
            <li> low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being burned with fake BB Cremes before, I get a bit worried ordering this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> No glow but not perfectly matte either.</li>
            <li> , i do believe that it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a BB cream but was wary of the quality of mainstream US brands.</li>
            <li> but then i tried the product it was very irritating to the skin</li>
            <li> I also have combination skin, so it can be dry at the worst times, but it will get oily and melt my makeup off before the day is done.</li>
            <li> (not that bad but not great either)</li>
            <li> foundation that I was using, and didn&#x27;t break my skin out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Olay&#x27;s CC cream, but found that it made gave me a disturbing oompa-loompa orange tone, and the fillers in the product would pool up on my face, leaving me oily and dirty feeling.  </li>
            <li> i thought i was going to get a fake one, but after checking on helpful websites that show you whether your BB cream is fake or not, i was relieved!</li>
            <li> dirty easily.&lt;br /&gt;anyway</li>
            <li> however I can brakeout like crazy if I use makeup that adds oil.</li>
            <li> both times it broke me out in crazy acne.  </li>
            <li> then I start to notice my face getting unhappy.</li>
            <li> Also at their advice I ordered the BB Creme Gold Label for the cold weather months when humidity/sweat will no longer be an issue.</li>
            <li> (I use Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser), it seems like it&#x27;s sometimes causing acne (</li>
            <li> and I was afraid the BB Creams we have begun to make would be no exception to that rule.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this.  </li>
            <li> but when i got the package, to my disappointment, they sent me the orange one.</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Review the information on how to tell if this product is real or fake, and you will see it is a fake.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical buying this product.</li>
            <li> And yes, I am very angry about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might just be a very very very weird coincidence</li>
            <li> Almost like a paste, which makes it very difficult to blend.</li>
            <li> The BB Cream I purchased from them is FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> I had a really bad reaction on my face when I tried it.</li>
            <li> But the product is just not for me because my skin had a really bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> So far,it&#x27;s quality isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Too bad it washed me out.</li>
            <li> aint soo bad</li>
            <li> not that bad it can use as a foundation for your face</li>
            <li> and I have to say it was bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I look sick when I put this on.</li>
            <li> It made me look sickly.  </li>
            <li> Tips: even though, BB creams are all in one products, always wear moisturizures (&#x3D;/-</li>
            <li> This is FAKE and gave me awful breakout!!!</li>

            <li> /&gt;So, kinda of disappointed in the product...</li>
            <li> I got this product and I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> All in all i wouldnt buy this again:(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine is real or fake</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disappointing :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather disappointed because everywhere</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we are very disappointed from this product !</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can´t get it in Europe :-(</li>
            <li> I wish that I could return it, but it&#x27;s been opened and used 2 times :(</li>
            <li> Then I stumbled upon: [...].</li>
            <li> Disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> Boscia is water base</li>
            <li> I used to hate my skin.</li>
            <li> and I hate using sunscreen as it feels greasy and breaks me out.</li>
            <li> Hate the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate wearing make-up at all</li>
            <li> base for foundation&lt;</li>
            <li> So, I hate to break it to you but</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that it took me 7 BB creams before I started using this one!</li>
            <li> It made me look like I was sick!</li>
            <li> so this was horrifying to me.</li>
            <li> it contained, so I&#x27;ll admit I was slightly fearful of trying any of them out, including this one.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved but I hated not having anything to set my powder with...</li>
            <li> Hated it.</li>
            <li> My skin is just very bad and this happens with a lot of products any way.</li>
            <li> it is a very bad product ..</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the amount of cream in one bottle....</li>
            <li> How freakin annoying is that!?</li>
            <li> and I could see how nasty it felt on my skin and</li>
            <li> and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s fake!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
            <li> so I thought the worst that can happen with this one is that it doesn&#x27;t work miracles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne or any horrible skin problems</li>
            <li> Awful seller.</li>
            <li> The worst part, it didn&#x27;t even cover up my blemishes!</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when i took it apart and found the container was almost all made out of plastic!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed !!</li>
            <li> i am so shocked !!</li>
            <li> I thought it was the worst day ever.</li>
            <li> Others claimed it cleared acne and others said it was the worst BB cream</li>
            <li> It made me break out horribly</li>
            <li> It did, however, cause me to breakout horribly on my forehead.</li>
            <li> but when i used it, it was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down, and I&#x27;ve tried close to 20, mostly Asian but some European and American brands too. This feels like a \\&quot;second skin\\&quot; and it oxidizes to perfectly match, blend, and \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; my skin tone. With other foundations and BB creams I always felt like I was wearing something, but this just melds with my skin. I cannot think of one thing to complain about. I love the packaging even!</li>
            <li> I had purchased sample bb creams before to choose the right bb cream for me, when i got this i saw that it was a small size but still i was happy to have received it, for some reason the consistency was not the same as i had remembered but it was still ok, it was a bit runny, and left me looking a bit too dewy but it was somewhat the same as other bb creams i had tried. Will keep on looking for other products but will maybe purchase this in the near future.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Will keep purchasing over and over again. I am now using this instead of traditional foundation!</li>
            <li> American cosmetics companies have gotten into the BB cream business lately, but the ones I&#x27;ve tried from Garnier and L&#x27;Oreal are just basically tinted moisturizer. But this cream is thick, and unlike American products has a greyish tint to it. That sounds awful, I know, but I have pale skin, freckles and some red splotchiness around my nose and chin when I get out of the shower, and this smoothes everything over and looks great after it&#x27;s absorbed. I used to moisturize and then add foundation and powder, now I just use this right out of the shower, no makeup sponge necessary, and brush a little powder on top. And compared to department-store foundations this is a teriffic bargain.</li>
            <li> Few months ago, after all the hype about BB creams, I bought Missha Perfect BB Cream #23, Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream #13, and Skin 79 pink label BB Cream (Ebay seller in Korea).  Also bought Smash Box BB cream and tried many other American brands BB creams (Dior, Boscia, Too Face, Tarte).  I have combination, normal to oil skin, thus, make-up only lasts about 4 hours, even though I work indoor (I am a once-a-day make-up kindda girl). B/c of popularity of Missha, I used it first.  Some reasons, I felt it was too heavy, too oily.  Then I switched to Skin 79 and Etude House.  They all go on every smooth and easy to blend (I use stippling brush).  Skin 79 pink label only comes in 1 color and it&#x27;s sheer/light coverage.  It&#x27;s even out my skin but it does not cover capillary red spots or black spots due to acnes.  It lasts 4-5 hours.  Etude House Precious Mineral #13 is a bit light for me.  It is medium coverage.  However, I found that it&#x27;s a bit dry.  It makes me flaky around the nose area.  I decided to use Etude House as concealer.  Not the best but it works.  It also works when I mix Skin 79 and Etude House together.  Neither one of these products have any fragant to it.  Missha BB cream does have fragrant.  It smells like baby powder-ish.  It&#x27;s not bad (it eventually goes away after after few hours); however, I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  Some people actually like the fragrant (on youtube). That was also one other reason I stopped using Missha.  After months, I decided to \\&quot;re-visit\\&quot; Missha BB cream again.  Still don&#x27;t care for the fragrant; however, it gives a medium coverage.  My skin is very clear except for the capillary red spots around the nose and occasional black acne spots.  So I don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; coverage (I used Laura Bare Mineral and Mercier tinted moisturizure for a long time).  However, with a bit of setting powder, Missha BB cream lasts almost all day.  Plus of Missha BB cream, high SPF (maybe that why it seems more oily).&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for medium coverage Missha (if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrant), Etude House (if you don&#x27;t have dry skin).  For light coverage, Skin 79.  Tips: even though, BB creams are all in one products, always wear moisturizures (&#x3D;/- additional sun block) and setting powder.  Even though, you can build for more coverage, but I&#x27;d not recommended b/c it will look very heavy.  Also, buy from a reputable Ebay sellers.  It is cheaper than amazon, around $11-13.  Beware, fake products are out there (I do not understand this either b/c it&#x27;s not every expensive, why do people make/sell fake products).  I suspect that these products are \\&quot;drug-store\\&quot; brands in Korea.  But since we can&#x27;t get our hands on, we are paying a bit more.  Next, I want to try Tony Molly CC cream.&lt;br /&gt;As for American brands, Smash Box is heavy, almost like foundation.  Dior BB creams are more of yellow tone and dark.  Tarte is too powdery for my liking.  Boscia is water base so it&#x27;s nice; however, it&#x27;s one shade and not recommended for darker than NC-35.  Too Face gives a dewy/sheer/natural look and good for yellow tone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Hope you will find a right products.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have oily skin and this bb cream does not make it more oily, it covers great an feels great on skin.</li>
            <li> This is FAKE and gave me awful breakout!!! The first day using it was fine, actually good coverage, but starting from the second day breakout came!</li>
            <li> I went through this brand of BB cream fast. Super fast. It only took me about two months to go through it all, and I was widely dismayed, no wonder it was so cheap. It also does not have the extent of coverage that Face Shop brands have, so I was forced to use more of it. I was not impressed. Do yourself a favor and spend your money instead on Face Shop BB Cream: http://www.amazon.com/THE-FACE-SHOP-Magic-Natural/dp/B0054U56GO/. This one&#x27;s lasted me almost a year and still going strong, full, weightless coverage, and you use less of it.</li>
            <li> My complexion isn&#x27;t really that light or dark for a Mexican, but the cream blends in really nicely and gets rid of the small blemishes I have from sun exposure, acne, etc. The best thing about is that it makes my skin look really smooth and natural since the cream is really light so it&#x27;s actually like, the perfect product for me since I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup anyways (the most I use is some mascara and a small thin layer of eyeliner.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for something to just smooth/even out your face, this shit&#x27;s the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few BB creams but certainly not all.  This one is on the thicker side so it provides a bit more coverage than some.  I wish they had more colors.  I found this to be on the gray side, almost ashy in color.</li>
            <li> This cream is exactly what I have always needed for my skin, and at 27 years old, I have finally found it.  My skin is very fair/light and acne prone.  My skintone is a little uneven and is combination.  I use almost one full pump of BB cream on my face to start with, and it does an amazing job of evening my skintone out and giving it a nice, dewy glow.  Then, I use some concealer under my eyes and finish up with MAC loose powder in light.  I can tell a huge difference in my face, my acne has greatly improved and my makeup has never looked better.  I highly recommend this product, I have tried dozens of low-end and high-end creams, powders, treatments, masks, foundations, mousse, you name it, and this BB cream is the best thing that has ever happened to my face!</li>
            <li> I bought the MIssha brand a while ago and loved it.  I have had freckles my whole life and a very uneven skin tone.  I read the reviews on the skin 79 and thought it was a step above the Missha.  This cream seems to have a grey undertone or something.  It does not make my skin look radiant.  I like the MIssha brand much better.</li>
            <li> it doesnt give me enough coverage but the product is good for people with sensitive skin, and it is most likely for people with really light fair skin.</li>
            <li> I work outdoors, and I like simplicity, so I was looking for a single face product that has good spf, decent coverage, and would not wear off from sweat or rain.  I also have stupidly sensitive skin, so harsh perfumes and other chemicals are a no-go.  Tall order!  I heard about BB creams, and was willing to risk a breakout or rash to find a great product.  I had an amazon gift card, and used part of it on a mini set of Skin 79.  The &amp;#34;hot pink&amp;#34; was my favorite out of that bunch.  The first day I wore it, I went to spinning class - I thought it was a perfect test for the durability and sweat-proof-ness.  75 minutes later, I am astonished to say that this product (mostly) stayed put!!!  Wha?!?  I thought, &amp;#34;Since it lasted through spin, it must be excessively harsh, so I will be breaking out any minute now.&amp;#34;  Well, that never happened either.  There must be some catch, but I haven&#x27;t found it yet.  I only gave it 4 stars because it does dry out my skin if I wear it multiple days in a row (which I rarely do).  I am soooo happy that I have found this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it like 3 days ago and I already see improvement in my skin. It has not only helped me with my acne, but I&#x27;ve also noticed less dark circles...no one will be able to tell I&#x27;m using any &#x27;make up&#x27; because it will match your skin tone after a few minutes of putting it on</li>
            <li> I bought this in the summer time last year.  It made my tanned face look gray and ashy.  I saved it for the winter when my complexion is more fair.  And it worked.  It takes a few minutes to blend in with my complexion.  After that, I&#x27;m good to go.  The coverage is very light so I depend on concealer a lot.  It&#x27;s great for winter time because it&#x27;s so moisturizing.  I&#x27;m going to get the orange package and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t really influence my purchasing decision, but I really like the package.  It&#x27;s very cute, definitely icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream and wear it just about every day. I&#x27;ve tried samples of American BB creams from Sephora, and this one is better than all of them. It looks a little yellow or grayish right out of the bottle, but once I rub it in it blends in perfectly with my alabaster skin tone. It evens out any redness and makes it look like I have perfect skin without makeup. It gives me a slightly dewy look, and I brush on a little Bare Minerals powder if I want a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pump container means you have know idea how much product is left. One day I pump it and it&#x27;s fine, the next day it&#x27;s out. There&#x27;s no way to remove the top and scrape out the remaining BB cream. If it were in a tube or jar I could tell how much was left and also be sure I got every last bit out of it.</li>
            <li> This cream has a light coverage but evens my skin tone and does not irritate or make my sensitive skin break out :)</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product... except that I&#x27;m allergic to it! It goes on very nourishing and moisturizing at first, gives great coverage, and blends easily to match my pale skin. It looks flawless. However, after using this product every day for 1 week, I noticed that after a few hours, my skin started feeling very tight. By the end of the day, my forehead was flaking. I use moisturizer before applying this product though. In fact, I have not changed anything about my skin care routine except for adding this BB cream. I also now have small hives all over my face. At first I thought it was acne, but the spots are coming in places where I don&#x27;t normally breakout. I have never had acne on my cheeks or eyelids... ever! But now I have these little red spots that are itchy and dry. This is very unfortunate because this was so close to being my favorite product and replacing foundation forever. I have not heard of anyone else having this problem though. I would definitely give the product a try, but beware! I really don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I do get eczema occasionally on my body. I have never had it on my face and I think this product has caused that. Just something to think about...</li>
            <li> i bought this after seeing videos on youtube and i absolutely love it. the color is medium. it goes on well and it smells good too. this is what i put on my face, i don&#x27;t use foundation anymore, plus it has spf.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for this product even after all the rave reviews via youtube.  It comes off a little grayish and is meant or someone with a very light complexion.  I am medium skin toned and it just gave me a gray tinge that is all, however I may still use as a primer under my regular foundation.   But five stars for the shipping, the price is great if you have a lighter skin tone and you think it may work for you.   Got to me in under a week from Korea, WOW!!!</li>
            <li> As a person who doesn&#x27;t normally wear makeup, I heard of BB cream from a friend and decided to try it out. I got ordered this product from the seller seoulglamour and it arrived before the schedule date of delivery. I was a tad disappointed because instead of receiving the Gold Label BB cream sample (as other buyers have indicated), I got Missha BB cream instead. This product is legit from what I&#x27;ve researched online. Well so far I&#x27;ve had the product for about a week and I really like it! It really blends in with my pale skin and evens out my skin tone. I have lots of red blemishes that have almost disappeared when using this BB cream! It does provide sufficient coverage but you might have to dab on a bit more concealer for the more prominent imperfections. Bottomline: love the product so far! I&#x27;m hoping it does help diminish wrinkles and fade away my acne scars with prolonged use.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to try out this bb cream, it is one of the best one out there but i do have very dry skin so it does make my skin little dry through out the day and also i purchased this right after summer over so i do got a little tan, its little too light for my skin right not but when winter comes iam sure i will be using this almost everyday but with better moisturizer</li>
            <li> i like this BB cream it smells great it does wat its suppose to do basically...just like what all the review has been saying... the amount is pretty much easy to control because of the pump...it really did a GREAT job of covering blackheads and lightening your skin:D how ever i rate this 4 star is becuz it doesn&#x27;t really cover up scars or some redness....but in the end i still like this product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I think this would be perfect just for those people who have nearly perfect skin....&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is like a tinted moisturizer with high spf....This doesn&#x27;t cover my dark spots well enough comparing to missha bb cream. However, I like the scent and the packaging.</li>
            <li> So I was very excited to receive my first BB cream.  Everything was in a fast orderly manner meaning the purchasing process to the shipping.  I received my order around the 10th of March.  I literally use very little almost every day and I ran out of my bb cream on March 23.  How freakin annoying is that!? The bottle size is pretty decent so you would think that it will last you for a month but NO barely 2 freakin weeks! I am so pissed off. I do like the bbcream but i dont know if i will be purchasing it.  I paid $14.50 for a product that barely lasted for 2 weeks.  RIP OFF!</li>
            <li> It matched my Asian skin! I love the texture and lightness of the feeling.... It definitely gives me the best alternative for a liquid foundation.... I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and my skin didn&#x27;t break out, unlike some of those liquid make-up I have tried. And take note, an application in the morning would last the whole day! :-) So happy I have tried this one!</li>
            <li> This BB cream was the first one I ever bought. Ever since my favorite beauty gurus on YouTube started talking about these creams I&#x27;ve wanted one myself. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! The packaging is adorable, it feels light on the skin, and offers good coverage without feeling heavy. It does look a bit white when you first put it on but once you let it oxidize for about 2 minutes it matches your skin tone :)&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin with more of a pinky undertone and this cream works just fine. Will definitely be buying this again - and from this seller. FAST SHIPPING! Took 2 days!</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne with lots of scars and redness. After hearing the beauty gurus rave about BB creams and learning more about how big of a hit they are in Korea, I decided to give it a try. Amazon&#x27;s Seoul Glamour sold it for around $9 bucks and another few bucks for shipping. This product had no tracking code and was estimated to arrive in a month, but came directly from Korea in less than 2 weeks. I also heard that BB creams are so widely marketed and sought after that many fake ones have emerged. Being the skeptical person I am, I did some research on this counterfeit subject through youtube before applying any to my face. Turns out the product I received was the real deal. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks now. You can wear it alone or under makeup. I do a bit of both every day but always on top of moisturizer because this tends to be hard to massage/blend in by itself. When you wear this without makeup, it does not look very natural because 1) its gray tint and 2) not easy to spread on the skin without adequate moisturizer. Overall, my complexion has gotten a little brighter, and it does not irritate my skin or give me breakouts. I like it alot, but it&#x27;s not for everybody.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this, I happened to find reviews for it while researching BB creams to decide which one to try, and I&#x27;m so happy I picked this one. It&#x27;s far better than any other BB Creams I have used! I have combination skin and find that no matter what foundation I use, it will always make my skin look and feel oily and I would always break out, which was frustrating. I have tried many kinds of make up, even the mineral make up and nothing has worked even close to how I would like it to. The coverage on this BB Cream is amazing. It does look sort of gray and ashy when you first apply it, but it blends in perfectly within a few minutes and looks natural. I have been using it for a couple weeks now and my skin looks amazing, even after the BB Cream comes off. My skin tone is way more even already, and my skin is soft. I would recommend this to literally everyone. The only con I can really see is that if you have dry skin or some of your skin is dry/combination, you may want to moisturize before applying this. But otherwise, this is absolutely amazing! Not only does my skin never look even slightly oily when I wear it, it looks natural, feels great, improved my skins look and feel, and provides a good sunblock (I&#x27;ve been out in the sun a lot these past few weeks...and am very pale...I did not burn at all, I was very happy. I was very critical when I bought this, thinking it probably wouldn&#x27;t work as well as everyone else claims it does, but I was surprised to found out it went above even my expectations. I will continue to use for as long as they make it! And it&#x27;s cut my time to get ready in the morning in half! It&#x27;s so simple! I really can&#x27;t praise this product enough, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my face!</li>
            <li> Professional makeup artist and skin care specialist. I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect skincare product and I purchased this product in high hopes. There&#x27;s NOTHING WRONG with this product. There really isn&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t found any problems with it and it&#x27;s nice. But to be honest, BB creams are nothing more than tinted moisturizers. Save your money, go to the store, and get a nice tinted moisturizer with spf that won&#x27;t clog pores. They are the EXACT same thing. The ONLY difference is that this is more apt to work on many different skin types because it is not tailored to a certain skin type, which is a plus. But! If you find a nice tinted moisturizer that is good and compatible with YOUR skin, you&#x27;ll save a lot of money without sacrificing reliability and quality.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear makeup to work since my makeup routine takes way too long to fit into my schedule ( I treasure sleep), but this fabulous product makes it so simple. Since I have a long commute, I just apply and go and let the product oxidize as I drive. I do a quick check in the mirror to make sure that I don&#x27;t have the mask effect going on before I step into the building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it simple, but it doesn&#x27;t break me out. My skin is super oily and acne prone. A lot of the foundations that I have tried on in the past has made me break out. I have been testing this one out for a couple of weeks now and my skin is doing just fine. It also provides UV protection. Definitely an important factor since UV rays can be so damaging for the skin and is the main cause of skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great advantage is the price!! I don&#x27;t even want to think about how much money I have thrown away trying new foundations..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this product is definitely worth every penny :]</li>
            <li> I must say this BB Cream is one of the best products I have ever tried Probably the best! It feels sooo light on my skin and the coverage is great. I have Combination skin and this works for me well. The shipping was fast as well. Thank you Jolliskin! I will be ordering again. I would like to try the gold one next.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying I am going to copy and paste this review onto the GOLD version because I alternate between the two, the GOLD is more moisturizing for when I dry out. I purchased both my products from Tokyo Japan Outlet and they are BOTH legit, so I am not vouching for any other seller. I bought this one first and loved it but I have drier days, so for this price I figured I would try the GOLD too. Love both. I have had acne roseacea since i was eight years old (I&#x27;m 33). Caked on makeup to try to hide my skin. Been on Accutane, spent thousands on dermatologists and every product you can imagine from infomercials to Sephora. If you&#x27;ve been there, you know. I am also whiter than the whitest of white times infinity, almost see-through so redness is not something I can really easily hide. But this stuff?? Let me tell you. My skin has NEVER been this clear and smooth. I don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s in it! It works. Even when I have not used this for a few days, my skin still looks great. I use it daily for the most part, but I am admittedly lazy about it -- even not remembering to use it everyday, the results are STILL stunning. I put a LOT on, like you would a moisturizer and use it as a foundation. Maybe a little powder on top but no more hardcore foundation for me. I concur with other reviewers, it goes on a little grey, just let it oxidize it will blend in. It may not be for everyone, but at this price, after spending probably 10x as concoctions from department store brands, give it away if you don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to regular foundation again! This covers all my blemishes, hides my freckles, and wears very well. The job I do makes me work hard enough to sweat, and this product doesn&#x27;t run or smudge. I&#x27;ve worn it for over 12 hours, and it still looks the same when I take it off, as it did when I first put it on. A truly amazing product!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I had to purchase the Missha Bb cream signature one just to compare it to this skin79. And this won me. It just works perfect with dry and oily skin cos it just has the right amount of dewyness and matte-ness. I wanna give it 5 stars but im kinda skeptical about the seller. The text printed in the front and back easily gets scratched off. Though Ive never had a problem with it breaking me out.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> First pump it was very rich and creamy. Grayish to beige color. I have a darker tone..medium tan. In my case, I had to put press powder that was my color to set the BB. Remarkable coverage! I also have acne-prone skin and it works wonders. Best product yet! Will order some more.</li>
            <li> I like the product it does what it says, however people with a yellowish skintone it might be a bit white or grayish. People say they would wear this in the summer, but I think I would wear it in the winter b/c its grayish and I get a bit whiter. My skintone is yellowish like NC25 or NC30. I recommend it for the undereyes it brightens the eyes and covers the dark circles.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product from Korea combining SPF, moisturizer and highlighter in one. Great for normal skin types but would not recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a spectrum of higher priced (as well as lower end) foundations, tinted moisturizer, and bb creams but this one really is superb.  So long missha bb cream!  I have combination, medium toned asian skin, and this product is great at keeping my skin moisturized and even-toned without being too oily, plus it has a decent SPF.  The tint comes out more natural looking as well.  What more can you ask for?! I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on my skin within weeks of using this, with folks saying my skin is healthy and glowy.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream that I have ever used and I have to say buying this product was probably one of the best decisions I have ever made. I have had trouble skin for YEARS and after several weeks of using this cream as a foundation I have noticed remarkable results. My breakouts are milder and farther between, my scars have begun to fade, and the coverage and lasting wear for this BB cream are awesome.  After using this, I&#x27;m relatively sure I&#x27;ll never go back to using regular foundation again. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. It does everything advertised. For those with more severe acne scarring or dark circles, I would recommend using a concealer over the top, but even without the product has great coverage. After a few weeks of use my skin feels MUCH healthier.</li>
            <li> i love the look of this bb cream and the dispense of it is also great the problem is that when i first put it on it felt heavy. It made my pores look huge and let me tell you i have no existent pores. then after a few hours my face got these red bums everywhere. After about 6 hours i had little white heads on my chin, nose, forehead, and cheeks. I was so angry and upset because i really wanted to like this product but it made my face look like a pizza.     dont buy this product if you are acne prone and have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I received the open box (the pink paper box) item, it was used, it has been used by somebody before, maybe a return item.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different ones from skin 79 this one and the Gold one. I like the gold one better. This one is fine but doesn&#x27;t seem to match my skin as much. They look identical on my finger so idk maybe its just when they oxidize on my skin. I am totally loving BB creams though. I would recommend the skin 79 products. They go on so easy and make my skin just look naturally flawless. And I would also recommend buying from Pink Gelee. Super fast shipping and no fakes. I know I have heard stories about fakes on amazon but that seller has been great.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the M Missha cream in shade 21. I love this Pink Skin79 BB cream. It very light weight, goes on like a lotion rather than a foundation. The color does come a bit light, but it somewhat works out for me fine. I like to use this on days that I like to go natural because it hides my uneven skin tone which is light yellowish with pink undertone, freckles/pimple scars and dark spots. On days that I like a good coverage I applied a darker powder foundation on top to even out the color. This cream does help with controlling my oiliness compare to the M Missha. When I wore the Missha, my skin got oilier. Overall, this BB cream comes with very cute packaging, very convenience and easy to wear. I do notice my skin tone is improving ever since I started using this cream.If you&#x27;re looking for something of darker shades or more coverage, this would not be it, after all this is not a foundation. It&#x27;s more like a tinted moisturizer with all the good benefits of sunscreen/whitening/even skin tone</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream and probably my last (for good reasons too)!! The cream blends amazingly and have just the right amount of coverage to buff away any minor imperfections like pimple scars and blemishes. The finished look is very natural/airbrush finish and it doesn&#x27;t make your face oily so there&#x27;s no need to apply powder. This thing stays matte the whole day and my skin is super oily!! You can also layer on areas that needs extra coverage like dark circles. This will be the only BB cream I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> This product is AUTHENTIC and it works amazingly~ I really love it and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller and also the shipping was super super fast~! I&#x27;m going to order some more very  soon !! I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Hello seoulglamor!! I just wanted everyone to know that i actually ordered the Missha to you.  I was so surprised about the price but also worried that this might be fake.  I guess im gonna have to wait for it on the mail.  Ive heard so much good things about bb cream.  I actually have light/medium skin, asian, and acne prone skin.  I have acne scars too and very oily skin.  I was wondering what is the best BB cream for oily skin.  I will be waiting for my BB cream on the mail and I will definitely write a review about it as soon as i get it.  I hope this works for me bec its a headache trying to find the right concealer/foundation for my oily skin!</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it keeps my oil at bay. Coverage is light to medium. This particular one is best for oily skin. I have combination skin but still works great. Evens out my skin tone as well. Looks great after you set it with powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and been a big fan of BB creams for quite a long time now. I stick to Etude House BB creams though. However, I heard so much good reviews about this product and so, I decided to try it out myself. It makes good coverage, considering it covers up my blemishes and stuff but it broke my skin out. I got acne after using this for three days straight which I think is really bad. I also tried Skin79 facial cleanser and I think it helped in making my skin worse. I don&#x27;t even know why that happened but yeah :( I guess this is just not the right brand for me. Sticking to Etude House...</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moQ7K7XI35291Q]]I really wanted to do a video review but I only had limited time so the video has been unedited. :o&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product with great results over the past 3 days. I&#x27;m acne prone and this has NOT broken me out! It&#x27;s really fabulous, just be sure to treat it like makeup and wash it off before you go to sleep. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the seller (seoulglamour): AWESOME! Shipping was super fast (2 weeks earlier arrival than the earliest predicted arrival date). Additionally, the seller sent me other BB Cream samples. :)</li>
            <li> I use this as my foundation, I don&#x27;t even have a use for foundation since using this product. It&#x27;s a good price for a good amount.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this because of the blemish part.  I bought it because I heard that it is a great foundation that has built in sunscreen, helps with wrinkles and can blend with most any skin type.  I have to say that after I got this product I was a little skeptical as it made my skin look blotchy after I put it on but after I gave it a moment to dry it was perfect!  I loved the way that it blended and smoothed out the look of my skin.  The only problem I have is I was unaware that when I push the button down how much was going to come out of the pump and so I wasted some the first time I used it.  But now that I am in the know I use it everyday and I can see that a little bit will go along way and that even though I spent more than I would normally for makeup it is going to last awhile!&lt;br /&gt;I will for sure buy this again!</li>
            <li> after all the ho ha abt this cream ,started from korea i bought myself one to c what its all about...&lt;br /&gt;i am asian with a tan complexion...it suited me well but as for the wonders i am still to c them ... i currently use mac foundation...</li>
            <li> I have tried Missha M perfect cover and Skin79&#x27;s Dream Girls I thought they were perfect for me until I tried this. I&#x27;m 22 I have an olive complexion with combination skin that goes through bouts of being excessively dry then breaking out this has stopped that and made my skin smooth and almost completely clear!  I wear it even if I&#x27;m just staying in the house because I have not found a lotion this great.  It&#x27;s worth a try its affordable compared to many foundations and lotions and the bottle lasts awhile.  I hope it works for everyone like it has for me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was way faster than I had expected- kudos for that!  But the tint wasn&#x27;t right for me; I wear medium Bare Minerals powder and despite leaving the BB lotion on to absorb, it still had a light/gray hue, making me look like I was sick- or a zombie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of it was great- not drying, not greasy, so I use it for a base for my mineral powder.  Between the two products, my freckles and flaws disappeared with an airbrushed appearance and between the 25 SPF of the BB and the 15 SPF of Bare Minerals, I should be OK for the upcoming summer sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;ve purchased this and found it was too light on you, seriously consider using it as a base for Bare Minerals instead of putting it in the back of the drawer with the rest of products that didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;May 17, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously purchased a Sigma flat top makeup brush, and just now retried this BB cream using the brush.  I stippled it on to ensure it wouldn&#x27;t go on thick and it&#x27;s actually not bad!  It still isn&#x27;t 100% my color, but with a little mineral powder touch up and blush, it actually looks pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used coconut oil for moisturizing, stippled the cream with a Sigma flat-top brush and finished with a light brushing of mineral powder and blush.  The application is the crucial part, I guess.</li>
            <li> Ver very good product,  if its the original ones be careful of getting fake ones. China is making lots fake copies of bb cream 79 so be careful very very careful. Its better to buy expensive ones frm the original website. Cheap ones are of course fake products frm china</li>
            <li> Clearly should have read more into this.  This really for people that from a lighter or whiter skintone and its foundation which I also misread!</li>
            <li> This cream is really just all the stuff you used to use put together. Literally. I compared this to a mixture of my own I created of my favorite sunblock, foundation (with acne control...Neutrogena), and a few drops of argan oil. It was the SAME. Same texture, same coverage, same application, same feel. SAME SAME SAME. Leave it to Asia to create a new crazy beauty hype. My own mixture that I have been using for some time has reduced the darkness under my eyes and fine lines around my mouth. This cream (used for 2 weeks) seems to allow the creases by my mouth to start to deepen. There is nothing about any facial cream that makes it miraculous. Buy this cream if you&#x27;re too lazy to follow a regular routine or mix up your products in your palm...or if you enjoy trial and error shade matching attempts. Seriously a waste of time. Good for lazy people!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now and am not really sure what the hype is all about. I have fair skin with light freckles over my nose and no acne. This makeup is a little weird in consistency. Everyone keeps saying it&#x27;s like lotion and that it&#x27;s smooth, but all I have noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as my usual foundation. I have to use my normal foundation and powder over it.     I guess this makes it sound bad, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just nothing too special. I think I&#x27;ll stick with my grocery store foundation rather than shipping this from Japan.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Evens out skin&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Light coverage&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t break me out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Mediocre oil control&lt;br /&gt;Packing is hard to tell how much is left&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference in the natural tone of my skin or wrinkles (then again I don&#x27;t really have many), but it works great as quick foundation. My only real complaint about this is the oil control. I have pretty oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t quite do the job to what I was expecting. I did a little bit of research on the skin79 official site and it turns out this is for normal skin. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I bought both this one and Missha one almost the same time. They both work very well. I don&#x27;t usually have acne. I use them as foundation. The coverage is pretty good especially when I apply some power on top, it lasts all day even in a hot sweaty day. One thing worth mention is that, I found out apply it with finger is better than using the brush. And don&#x27;t apply too much of product as it made me look pale and sick. A little goes a long way. They match my NC25 Asain skin color very well.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of BB cream. I have used quite a few different brands over the years and this is the BEST so far. It&#x27;s so easy to apply. Great coverage! Love it love it!</li>
            <li> I have very pale Irish skin with brown hair and hazel eyes, and usually wear NW 1 MAC foundation which has a pinkish cast. As another reviewer found, this product makes me look kind of gray. And it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;oxidize&amp;#34; into a different color after a while - I just walk around looking like I have porcelain doll skin instead of living breathing human skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides great coverage when you dab it on, but I have to wear a lot of blush to get any color back in my face, and that just makes me look even more like a porcelain doll. (If that&#x27;s your thing, though, then this is the product for you!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have known that since one of the claims of this product is that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;whitening,&amp;#34; that it&#x27;s mainly for Asian women who want to look paler (which, why?? embrace your melanin!), but I decided to give it a chance anyway. I&#x27;m bummed it didn&#x27;t work out though, because it is really an easy all-in-one skin product and provides great coverage as a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that&#x27;s helpful to those of you trying to figure out if this will work with your skin tone!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! it adjusts to your skin tone very quickly, has great coverage, and improves your skin. The service was great, and you get a lot of product for the price. When you receive your product for Pink Gelee they send you a little thank you card, which I thought was great. All and all great service and product</li>
            <li> I love BB creams from Korea, not the newer ones coming into the US. I purchased this one for my 11 year old daughter, it goes on so smoothly, there is a grey cast as you&#x27;re blending it in but it goes away to perfectly match your skin (fair to light-medium). This is far better for her skin than foundation and it looks so natural, protects her skin from the sun&#x27;s rays. Skin 79 makes, IMO, the best BB creams. There are several choices. This seems to be the most universal. I definitely recommend this for all ages. Really great stuff for your skin!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! I will never wear foundation again!!! Great Coverage, withstands heat &amp; humidity, doesn&#x27;t make me break out!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also I highly recommend the seller of this product, seoulglamour. Fast shipping &amp; Authentic!!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this BB Cream. And the price for this is amazing, :O I got worried I&#x27;d get a rip-off. But it came perfectly packaged and everything. Kamsahamnida!! :D</li>
            <li> I like this product for my combination/oily skin especially for the warmer weather. Skin79 Hot pink bb cream is supposed to adjust to your skin color but the color is still too light for my complexion. I received this product almost a week earlier than was estimated. I would buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> The BB cream is pretty nice, and this is for my wife. So I do not have any idea how about the products. While my wife do like it. The only complain to me is about the dilivery, I even not noticed it was already too late until Amazon asked me to review.</li>
            <li> For most of year this color is perfect. I&#x27;m fair skinned (but with olive tone) with auburn hair, dark brown eyes and brows. However, it can be a little too pale during summer (esp if I&#x27;m tanning) but the BEST thing I found to make this a bit darker without making it orange is to mix a bit of St Tropez Wash Off Instant Glow Face into the BB cream before you apply it to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The St. Tropez looks almost black when squeezed out of the tube, but is actually a very thin liquid- almost with a green tint- so it&#x27;s not a red or orange tan at all. By doing that, it&#x27;s basically just adding a bit of brown pigment to the cream- and again- it will cancel any redness you may have- which is great for evening your skin tone- because the BB cream (and St Tropez if you try using it, too) does not have the pink, red, or orangey beige pigments like typical makeup does in the States-  I&#x27;ve found that mixing that with this BB Cream in summer is my PERFECT color match and it makes my face look flawless, effortless, and clean- not like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup. I just love the effect it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY it!! For the price, it&#x27;s not a huge gamble. You&#x27;ll love looking at your skin in your car vanity mirror with all the natural light- because for me that&#x27;s the true color match test. If a makeup looks good in direct sunlight AND the color matches, it&#x27;s great in my opinion.  Plus did I mention at the end of the day, it still looks good?? Not greasy. Not chalky.</li>
            <li> i have never used bb cream before. as i looked at other&#x27;s review i decided to purchase one and try it. nd it didnt let me down! my skin looks very natural after applying it(prob a little bit whiter) but no one noticed. haha. and the shipping is so fast, i received it approx. more than 2 weeks before i am supposed to receive it! i am very pleased with both the shipping speed and the product itself! great great!</li>
            <li> I had previously really loved another BB Cream, which I still do love, but this BB cream is now my new favorite! It blends well with my skin color and it spreads well. Coverage is good, not cakey, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin. I am testing it too see how long it lasts. I have had it on for five hours now and I did set it with a sebum catching powder and it still looks great! The only thing to take note of is if you are not fair skinned, then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> The cream arrived much earlier than expected, that was a plus since I was majorly excited to get it. I opened the package expecting the worse, that it may be a fake BB cream. I know there was maybe four reviews on here saying that this seller has sold out fakes, but with my experience, that is not the case. There were no harm done to the box or my product, and it was NOT a fake.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but recently someone commented on how great my skin looks.  I&#x27;ve been using this about two months.  Most days I only use this product on my face, not a super heavy amount (not even a full pump).  It definitely has a grayish tone and I&#x27;m not sure it would work on fair skin (my skin is light/medium with yellow undertones but not as dark as my Korean husband) but it works for me.  I have to put moisturizer under or I get flaky, and a little goes a long way!  Generally happy with it and makes my morning routine very fast.  The price is great for the amount of product that you receive and I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone.</li>
            <li> THey sent me an open box item, and the BB cream is leak all over the box and . so dissapoint.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure how I survived without my BB Creams??? But seriously this is some great stuff!! Have been using for quite a while now (about a year) and I can tell you my skin is much more even toned, for sure!! Now it IS more of a light coverage but it is build-able (if needed). And I&#x27;ll add that this does NOT cause my skin to break out whatsoever (and yes I tend to break out very easily, at least I use to)... I have spent a lot of money on designer brands, just trying to find &#x27;the one&#x27; that works for me... and this stuff simply is just great and very affordable!! Love Love Love :)</li>
            <li> Skin color: Very fair (NC 15 is still a shade too dark for me :/ ), pink/red undertones.&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: oily, acne-prone, some redness, and incredibly sensitive to foreign oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this bb cream based on the reviews but was let down quite a bit. First of all, it would not adjust my skin tone. As previously mentioned, I&#x27;m very fair and my neck does match my face so whenever I put this stuff on without putting it on my neck, my face looked greyish, unhealthy looking. It made me look like I was sick! Also, I&#x27;m not a fan of the matte look and this made my skin look dry and kind of flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I think I&#x27;ll stick to my Laneige and Feverlet bb creams.</li>
            <li> After reading so many great reviews and watching videos praising this product I had to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium complexion with a golden undertone and acne scaring. At first I was worried that the one shade that it comes in would not work for my tone. But many of the reviews said that the one shade worked on pretty much any complexion shade. For the price this product was going for I thought I would give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put the product on my face it was way too light, but I let it sit and hoped that it would adjust to my skin. After about 30 minutes I checked my face in the mirror and it was still too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only advantage of the product that I noticed was that there were no signs of pores or acne scars! Honestly the texture of my skin looked flawless. Almost like porcelain. It also did a good job of hydrating my skin. Hence the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> Shipping fast , And I received samples . It&#x27;s very very very good .my friend told me I looks young and my face skin looks so good ,I can&#x27;t help myself and told her what I used.</li>
            <li> Very few products surprise me and do just what they say...but this one does!!  I love that I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing foundation but my face looks flawless!!  I have mildly dark under eye circles and I have tried using concealer on them but it just turns out worse.  This brightens them up without settling in the fine lines under my eyes.  I also have oily/combo skin and I still had to blot my skin arond 2pm but I didn&#x27;t use an oil mattifier for the first time in years!! Love it!</li>
            <li> This foundation melts into my skin.  It is only for light skin, though, but my husband told me my complexion looked really nice the first day I had this on.  It has light/medium coverage and does not highlight fine lines or dryness.  I really, really like it.</li>
            <li> Well, let&#x27;s check the description. \\&quot;It smoothes away lines, leaving skin elastic. * Latin America Hadatamo: It provides skin with moisture and freshness. * Osmopur: This protective ingredient is extract....\\&quot; I guess somebody forgot to copy something before they pasted it in the description. But, really, here&#x27;s the complete description I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A triple function blemish balm cream, Skin79&#x27;s Super Plus BB Cream (Pink Label) shields skin from premature aging with potent SPF 25, while whitening skin and reducing existing lines and wrinkles. The creamy formula effectively covers up skin imperfections, creating a perfect base for makeup and foundation. Skin feels and looks fresh, with a beautiful matte finish all day long. Recommended for combination and oily skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shields skin from premature aging with potent SPF 25 - May be. It doesn&#x27;t seem to shield it very well though.&lt;br /&gt;- While whitening skin and reducing existing lines and wrinkles - I don&#x27;t think so. Whitening? Definitely not. Reducing existing lines and wrinkles? - I haven&#x27;t notice any improvement and I don&#x27;t have many lines. In fact, while using this product, I should say, that my lines deepened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Effectively covers up skin imperfections - covers? may be, a little. Effectively? No. Not at all. I have sum sun spots that I am trying to cover. But the coverage of this product is so sheer, I need to use a thick concealer with this \\&quot;BB\\&quot; cream. It doesn&#x27;t treat nor does it cover blemish spots. Absolutely not.&lt;br /&gt;- Skin feels and looks fresh, with a beautiful matte finish all day long - Matte? No. Only if I use powder and only for an hour or so. Fresh? I don&#x27;t think so. All day long? This must be a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, kinda of disappointed in the product...</li>
            <li> I received this about 4 business days after I ordered it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and it has pretty much replaced my normal foundation (Lancome Teint Miracle). It provides great coverage, it has cleared my complexion, and the color is buildable. Best of all, it feels light, it moisturizers and reduces the size of my pores, and it doesn&#x27;t cake on your face and lasts all day with finishing powder!    This is definitely worth the money, I really love this product!   The color is very light, so it&#x27;s most suitable for VERY fair skin and for those who desire \\&quot;whitened\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a BB cream that pops out noticeably then this one isn&#x27;t the right one for you. Skin 79 BB cream is for the all natural look. It blends well with your skin tone and produces minimal side effects of standard makeup foundation such as having that cakey look. More or less, I would describe this BB cream to be more of a tinted moisturizer except with the added benefits of acting in as foundation, base, whitening and sunscreen. I am quite happy with this product, as an Asian with a slightly darker skin tone on my face in comparison to the rest of my body due to sun tan, this works quite well in evening out my skin tone. It hides my red blemishes, doesn&#x27;t cover up completely some spots but that&#x27;s what concealer is for and should be used concurrently with this product.   I also have oily skin and this product also acts as a matte as well and I quite like it. I am unfortunately not sure how well of a matte though it acts because I live in a desert so its very easy to have oily skin in no time, but in normal conditions such as staying indoors all day, this BB cream does stay on for quite some time.   Overall I am very happy with this product and would buy it again especially with this affordable price in comparison to many other brands.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I read the reviews and decided to try this... I have been wearing this daily since I first ordered it in August 2013.  I am a Caucasian girl with a neutral skin tone, I&#x27;m EXTREMELY fair, and have crazy-oily skin.  This product is the very first BB cream that actually matches my skin tone... and not only that, I find that when I&#x27;m wearing this cream, my face is remarkably less oily... it left the texture and tone of my skin even, velvety and supple.  I also noticed that it covered better than my Benefit Oxygen WoW! foundation that I was using, and didn&#x27;t break my skin out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Olay&#x27;s CC cream, but found that it made gave me a disturbing oompa-loompa orange tone, and the fillers in the product would pool up on my face, leaving me oily and dirty feeling.  In fact, I ran out of Skin79 last week and had to use my old Olay cream and I could see how nasty it felt on my skin and how badly I wanted my Skin79 cream back!!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff... it has been a game-changer.  I don&#x27;t know if this product would be for everyone, such as people with darker-toned skin... but I&#x27;d say if you are really fair skinned and have oil issues, don&#x27;t even hesitate to look for anything else.  Pick up a bottle of this ASAP.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a BB cream and I love this product. I have only started using it for a few days, and it is very lightweight and smooth and feels very natural on the skin. I am hoping that it will also help with some of my acne scars. The product shipped quickly and the seller also provided some extra samples. Overall impressed with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only skin products I haven&#x27;t strayed from. I&#x27;m always looking for my holy grail product for my oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;m pretty fair-skinned (usually have to wear Ivory foundations) but people tell me I have olive undertones. This matches perfectly! It starts out kind of ashy or grey in the beginning, but blends beautifully into your own skin tone. My skin looks porcelain after this is applied, and my skin is NOT good at all. I don&#x27;t even need to use a foundation anymore. This covers up redness and acne and minor imperfections very well. When I have a lot of pimples I do need to use concealer, but those occasions are rare. Doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it keeps my oily skin in check if I use a primer under or over it. Sometimes I use primer underneath, but I feel like that prevents all of the goodness of the BB cream to penetrate, so sometimes I will put primer over it and it gives a flawless result either way. Skin looks glowy and perfect. I notice if I wear it for extended periods of time (10-12 hours) or get sweaty, it will start to wear off or settle in my pores and look kind of bad, but it&#x27;s nothing a touch up with a foundation stick can&#x27;t fix. My skin is just very bad and this happens with a lot of products any way. You need to try this!</li>
            <li> I think this cream is great for young and old alike.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and love it and I see many young people use and love it as well.  Ordered from H2Dream and it came in two days across the country!  I love it so much after a week, I am ordering another because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  The cream is a light tan with a gray tint but it just disappears into my very fair skin.  It just makes my skin look perfect, like no makeup is on at all and yet it covers and has spf.  I do read that it actually improves the skin over time, so that would be a bonus.  I can wear this with just a bit of setting powder over it and my skin looks naturally flawless.  You might need concealer if you have anything other than just uneven tone.  I use a bit of under-eye concealer and I&#x27;m good to go.  I am just thrilled with this and will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> I had no idea it was going to work this beautifully.  I started wearing make-up just this year.  And I only wear this product only when I got out in the sunlight.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin one bit.  It blends with my skin perfectly and helps protect it and take away some of my super dark dark circles. I would recommend this to anyone.  It&#x27;s super!  \(^o^)/</li>
            <li> I am a 40-year-old white woman, who has had problem with acne since I was a teen.  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to keep my skin clear!  My biggest problem is monthly breakouts due to hormones.  I did not have much faith this this product would help... and while it does not prevent 100% of my break-outs, it definitely has made a HUGE difference!  I really cannot believe how well this product works to keep my skin looking clear!  When I first went to use it in mid-February, and I saw the color of the cream, I did not think there would be any way it would blend with my skin tone.  But it does... perfectly!  And you only need just a tiny tiny bit!  The price is right.  This BB cream works!!  I am now a long-term customer!  Highly, highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical buying this product. However, it was very nice. It covers like a foundation but with light to medium coverage. If you&#x27;re looking for full coverage, check into another BB cream. I did not have to wear a moisturizer or foundation primer with this product. Very nice.</li>
            <li> when i got this bb cream,i really like the color of the bottle,so cute so pink!&lt;br /&gt;the bb cream&#x27;s color is a little bit dull,but after i use it, it looks really good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i dont like is the pump, i hope they can make it a tube, the pump gets dirty easily.&lt;br /&gt;anyway,it is a good product~!</li>
            <li> Came in a couple of days, and I loved it! I used wayyy too much the first time, because A lot goes a long way. And I know this was authentic, so don&#x27;t listen to the reviews saying it wasnt. To be sure for yourself, go on youtube and search: Skin 79 pink bb cream fake vs real. You can find out for yourself.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast. The bb cream looks decent and have a natral smell. It is not too thick and not sticky. Good coverage and natral color. Would recommend it for anybody who is too lazy to put on layers and layers of foundation and sunscreen.  The only thing that is a little worrisome is that I watched a TV news about a Mid-age woman who used this bb cream ended up having a lot of freckles on her face. And the report said that the dermotologists did not recommend using it too often.</li>
            <li> It is perfect BB cream for me. It looks like not with make-up! I use it everyday. Feel so nice!</li>
            <li> Great order. Arrived quickly. Love the cream because it&#x27;s soft and looks natural on me. Don&#x27;t need powder. Thanks! Will purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> I bought this off of ebay since it was cheaper and free shipping. I heard alot of great reviews from other websites and I thought I go ahead and try it. The bottle is a cute pretty pink. That was a plus for me. I am in my mid 20s and my skin type is combination and I have lots of acne. This product is suppose to help with acne skin and to heal it while covering your acne and scars. So when I first tried this product, it didn&#x27;t really do much for me accept that it made my face a little whiter. It&#x27;s only been about 2 weeks since I used this product. But I will still continue to use it and hope that this product will help with my acne.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream!!  It goes on like silk and does everything it says it will do!! I have tried about 9 BB creams and this is the BEST!!</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this product it has done nothing but impress me! My skin has such a healthy glow throughout the day and it&#x27;s so amazingly natural looking. I highly suggest it to anyone with acne prone skin because it has even helped me tremendously in that aspect.</li>
            <li> I bought the variety pack containing a bunch of samples of BB Cream by SKIN79 and ended up liking the Pink Label best. The packaging of this product is good and stays relatively clean and the pump is very convenient. I&#x27;m on my second one in a year!</li>
            <li> After using this product for about 2 weeks, I stopped getting frequent acne that I usually do when I use other makeup. My skin has gotten much clearer and a lot of the redness on my face disappeared. As for coverage, I still had to apply a concealer to cover blemishes. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this bb cream is that it made my face appear too white.&lt;br /&gt;I normally use Mac&#x27;s ProWear foundation but except for the fact that this bb cream is too white for me, I prefer to use this bb cream as my everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gray color and if your not pale white you will be after using this. It went right in the trash for me</li>
            <li> After watching BB cream reviews on youtube I decided this was the one to try. I was worried to order online but I havent been dissapointed. The product arrived before estimated date and it was packaged nicely. The product appears to be authentic, and if its not its still amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very thick. Very thick. I first tried with a real techniques expert face brush and it was horrible. I washed my face and brush imediately! Then tried again with my hand which worked beautifully! If I had to compare the texture to anything it would be the freeman face peel (probably others but thats the only face peel Ive tried).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is grey which can be offsetting at first but once its blended into the skin it looks flawless on my NW20 (MAC) skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is quite good expecally for a BB cream. Even better then just covering the u even skin it seems to magically blur the problems. It really is quite mind boggling how good my skin looks wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish is at first sticky but once it sets it sets. It feels soft and smooth and simply amazing. I do still top with a powder, sometimes powder foundation if I need more coverage, just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry/combo. It can get very dry without proper care but also very oily in the T zone without proper care. My skin care routine adds enough moisture and as long as I powder my forehead im good to go. So when I use this I probably have the equivelent of normal skin. I dont have cronic acne, just the occasional spot, and other then some redness in the cheeks I have pretty even skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would deffinately suggest it and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin and live in a very humid place which just exacerbates my acne. When I heard about BB cream I really wanted to try it out because of all its benefits but I was worried that it would clog my pores. I did a lot of research and decided on Skin79. Even when I received the bb cream (way earlier than expected) I was still apprehensive to try it out because it&#x27;s almost summer here and my skin had been acting up lately. Well, I&#x27;ve worn it two days now and my skin has actually cleared up a bit! Not going to lie, I don&#x27;t have very severe acne, not cystic or anything horrible but it&#x27;s enough that I have red scars on the sides of my cheeks and every day I have a couple little ones. I was also wondering if the coverage would be enough and it&#x27;s actually just like my foundation when it comes to that aspect. Like others have said the initial color is a very ugly grey but maybe 3 or 5 minutes of putting it onto your face it matches your skin tone. I have very light skin so I dunno how it&#x27;d work for darker tones which is sad because bb cream is excellent besides this one thing. The smell is barely noticeable, it&#x27;s a very light flowery fragrance that completely goes away after a couple of minutes. The seller (seoulglamour) is excellent, the packaging was very cute and they even put in a free sample. The price is very reasonable. Definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> Light on the skin and does not leave a \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; feel that most make up does. It has a nice light scent and evens out my skin tone while also protecting my skin from the sun. The design of the bottle is very cute too and convenient because it prevents from mess.</li>
            <li> Pros  -It makes my face smooth after application  -The container is pretty. It dispenses the cream without much of a mess.    Cons  -I didn&#x27;t get much coverage. I had to put two layers to hide some blemishes. It didn&#x27;t hide my dark eye circles. I find that Dr Jart BB creams give much better coverage, but Dr Jart creams make my face break out.  -My face got really oily after a few hours. This is probably because of this BB cream because my face doesn&#x27;t oil up that much when I don&#x27;t put anything on my face.  - I have been using this product for a couple of months now, and I must say that I can&#x27;t see any whitening effects or the reduction of the appearance of blemishes.     Overall, I like this cream only during the first few hours of application (short-term) as it made my face smoother though it didn&#x27;t really give much of a coverage. It didn&#x27;t have any long-term effects for me.</li>
            <li> I am really loving this BB cream. I have been hearing all the rave about this stuff what great things it does for your skin. I am loving this product. Alot of youtubers who are black mix this with thier foundation, but I wear it along with MAC mineralized skinfinish in Dark. It is perfect. I think I might have replace my tinted mositurzier. I like the feel of my face and how it looks on camera.    I know people are saying this is target for Asian market, but I really do like it and I see some of my acene scars fading with this product.  So to my black sistas out their give this a try you might like the out come of this product.</li>
            <li> I have bought this BB Cream in Nov 2010 and I dindnt quite use it cause it did not meet my expectations...recently I stumbled upon a video on fake and real Skin79 BB creams...And I realized that mine was 100% a fake and I got it for 18.99$...Don&#x27;t buy these FAKES here, just go to their website and oredr a real one!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Skin79 hot pink BB cream on my other Amazon account and have been using it for several months now. It&#x27;s a decent BB cream, but I have yet to benefit from all of the \\&quot;triple functions\\&quot; promised. The color seems to have grayish undertones due to the sunscreen. Under fluorescent lighting and in flash photos the cream gives my face a ghastly, grayish cast, despite it looking semi-normal in natural lighting. It whitens pretty well (my skin tone has lightened quite a bit from its use) although some acne scars and redness haven&#x27;t faded. As far as concealment goes, the coverage is build able but does not hide my tired eyes and acne all too well. I do love the smooth, lotion-like texture of the cream, it has a nice scent and leaves my face soft and smooth. The oil control is also good, it prevents my t-zone from getting too shiny. I&#x27;m not old enough for wrinkles yet but I do have laugh lines and this cream does not improve them. Overall this is an average BB cream, it just does not deliver all of the long term benefits it advertises. To sum it up:  Pros:  Smooth texture and buildable consistency  Leaves skin smooth  Good oil control  Whitens skin color and temporarily evens skin tone  Cons:  Most effects are only temporary, it&#x27;s almost like a tinted moisturizer  Does not improve wrinkles nor fade acne scars and blemishes  Color is grayish and can look unnatural sometimes  Does not provide heavy coverage</li>
            <li> First off I have oily skin so there&#x27;s that. I was really excited about the bb cream movement so this was my first dip into this kind of product. I used it as a primer for my foundation and loved it, making my foundation go on smoother and last longer. It oxidizes on the skin, so if you have really light skin on your face this might not work as well for you. I love the creaminess and the quality of the product. Color me impressed.</li>
            <li> I used my sister&#x27;s and thought it had really good coverage. When I ordered mine, the coverage doesn&#x27;t look the same. I&#x27;ve read that sometimes there are stickers to indicate the authentic but this one did not have a sticker. Most likely not going to buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB a week now and I LOVE it.  I&#x27;ve been wearing cover ups since I was 15 and I&#x27;m now 32, so I know my foundations.  And the great thing about this is it&#x27;s not a foundation.  It&#x27;s a skin care product w/ the added bonus of a cover-up, so now I don&#x27;t have to use all those layers of serums, pimple cream, moisturizer, sunblock, foundation, powder.... You name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had problem skin since forever and it&#x27;s still a problem.  I have all these acne scars that I try to hide every day.  I have started on laser treatment recently and am getting good results, and I didn&#x27;t want to jeopardize that by continuing w/ my heavy make-ups, that&#x27;s why I was looking for a simpler regiment.  A friend (Korean, of course) recommended that I try BB cream.  This is the 3rd product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m sticking with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All those other reviews about the BB creams being too light or gray are true.  But it&#x27;s also true that they&#x27;ll eventually blend to match your skin color.  But I have to admit it&#x27;s not always a perfect match, since each product are slightly different tones.  This particular one is a little on the gray side, but then I have an olivey complexion, so it works out.  it also has more of a yellow under tone, so it matches my skin more than the American make-ups that usually has peach or pink tone bases.  I was called dark by my skincare specialist, but only compared to her other clients.  My color is like a light tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I love this particular BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;- great oil control (my face looks like an oily slick by the end of the day w/ regular make-up.  And much sooner when I&#x27;m bare faced)&lt;br /&gt;- light feel, but good enough coverage that I wear it alone on normal days (it doesn&#x27;t cover dark spots, so when I go out, I just spot cover with a little of my regular foundation)&lt;br /&gt;- evens skin tone greatly.  Again, even though it doen&#x27;t have complete coverage, it evens out my skin that it doesn&#x27;t look blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s super cheap, and the size is not small.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not require a lot each application. For me, 3-4 dots for face and neck.  The bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This specific item that i received was a counterfit/fake. I had a really bad reaction on my face when I tried it. Manufacturer told me that amazon and ebay sell fakes (99.9%).</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff.  It&#x27;s a little light for my skin in the summer, as I am finally getting a tan...but the rest of the year the color is perfect.  Skin looks great with it.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to  jump on the BB Cream bandwagon and I am happy I did. I did alot of research and ended up buying Garnier BB Cream at the drugstore. The coverage was so so, which lead me to try different kinds. I LOVE this brand. I have a few sun spots, small amount of wrinkles and this makes my face look like a blank canvas, but not in a clown face kind of way. Very even and very natural. This is actually the first time I have ever applied foundation of any sort. I am always horrifed to see women with caked on face makeup and the color stops at the neck. I didn&#x27;t want an obvious look, I wanted natural, which I got with this. The coverage is perfect. I live in Florida, so it gets up to 100 degrees. Sweating doesn&#x27;t affect the makeup at all. This was very important in selecting what BB Cream I chose. I apply the BB Cream after my face moisturizer ( I use emu oil), with my fingers or I use a damp beauty blender makeup sponge (which rocks by the way). One pumps does it, on the top of your hand, then dab away. I dot cheeks, both sides of neck, temples, under my eyes and then forehead. I am a product overuser so I was actually surprised that one pump does do the whole face. The color may appear slightly grey at first, keep blending and don&#x27;t freak out. I top this with Ben Nye Banana powder (loose powder that stupid Kim Kardashian promoted), and my face looks photo shopped, it&#x27;s THAT good. One more word of advice, when you think the bottle is empty, it&#x27;s not. Cut it open and you literally have at the bottom, alot more cream. I read there is alot of fraudulent Skin79 sellers, so watch out for that as well. The bottle I got from this seller is legit. Great experience all the way around. I hope this helps you.</li>
            <li> I had several concerns when I was thinking about buying this product. Would it match my super light skin well? Would it clog my pores at all? Would the item I receive be a knock-off? But with such a great price I decided to give it a whirl and boy am I glad I did! I bought it from PinkGelee and they did send me an authentic product. When I went to put it on I noticed the texture was very smooth and felt more like a lotion than a make-up. It was sorta gray when I first put it on, which I was expecting based on other reviews, but it adjusted to my skin tone after about 5-10 minutes. It really helped to even out my skin tone and cover all of the redness! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and it still hasn&#x27;t broken me out, which is surprising because my skin is so sensitive to everything. This product has met and exceeded all of my expectations and is my new favorite make-up product!</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations. The coverage is great (I have some dark hyper pigmentation and a few angry red blemishes) This product covered them well. The Tube is 40 grams (1.4 ounces) and I only needed a small amount to cover my entire face. The cream is very easy to blend and matched my skin perfectly to my skin (NW 25) and my moms (NW 20). If an area needs more coverage, you can dab more BB Cream on the area without the spot becoming cakey or sticky. I let the product set on my face for 5 minutes and was amazed at the transformation. I&#x27;ve never had such natural looking coverage. The finish was slightly matte, which I like and can easily be fixed with some blush and a dab of highlighter. My skin looked flawless and did not look unnatural with flash photography. I set the BB Cream with some light translucent powder (Loreal Translucide) just so I could blend my blush better and because it is a personal preference but I really did not need to. The product felt extremely light on my face and smooth to the touch, I was not left with a sticky residue on my finger like other foundations. The wear seems to be long lasting, however the true test will be in the summer when my skin becomes very slick. My usual coverage routine is Moisterizer + Concealer + Foundation (which takes forever so spackle on my face to get even coverage)+ Finishing Powder, now my routine is BB Cream + Dabs of finishing powder on the oily spots. As for the other properties of improving the skin and lightening scarring, I will update after I have been using the product longer. I ordered from Seoul Glamour and took only 6 days to deliver (from South Korea!!). The product is genuine and I will be ordering a second tube for my mom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type of person to wear a lot of make up, if at all, but this Super BB cream by Skin 79 is magnificent! The product came way before the scheduled delivery date. The customer service (Katie The Babe) was quick and so kind. Me and my sister have been using this Bebliesh Balm for not even a full week and we have both notice better feeling and looking skin. You don&#x27;t need a lot of this BB cream. It goes on smoothly and you definitely have to follow the instructions and pat the product into your skin after the initial application. It&#x27;s true it does have a grayish tint to it but it does go away rather quickly. Blends perfectly and is a matte finish. Best part is that you don&#x27;t have to figure out what color will match your skin because it pretty much matches it for you. And the samples came in abundance. 5 stars for the Seller, Product, and Delivery Time.</li>
            <li> Luv this product its gives u great coverage withiout feeling cackey and at the same time mosturize!! I have oily skin and worked for me. ^^</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with mild acne and have been looking for a good cover up.    This BB cream was definitely better than 2 others I have tried by different companies.     The consistency blends nicely after you let it set, is not greasy, and the bottle packaging is easy-to-use. However, after purchasing this, I did more research and spoke to friends who recommended other brands over Skin 79.     I&#x27;m giving it 3-stars because my search continues, but I do feel that it got the job done for only $10.</li>
            <li> thats ok, maybe i expected more benefits or coverage but not bad i think can be better with more color options maybe ligth,medium and dark skin color .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I don&#x27;t like using foundation because it feels like I have a layer of transferable liquid on my face. It&#x27;s not the case with this, it feels weightless and I forget I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many helpful reviews, so I just wanted to add that to build coverage and not get a \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; look - wait 5 minutes between layers. Skin will look airbrushed and natural.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase and the product itself.  In fact, I wanted to order two units, but the shipping cost  doubled, which didn&#x27;t make much sense me. So, I ended up   buying one unit only.</li>
            <li> Considering how affordable this is, an excellent deal.&lt;br /&gt;Light to medium coverage, okay as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to cover redness, works great for that.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on gray-ish but it will adapt to your skin after blended and set.&lt;br /&gt;Also, consider your complexion before buying, it only comes in one shade and it won&#x27;t adapt to everyone&#x27;s color.&lt;br /&gt;Safe for acne prone skin. Light fragrance (floral).&lt;br /&gt;BB Creams are NOT meant to replace sunscreen so I do suggest applying a gentle sunscreen as a base layer before applying BB Cream.</li>
            <li> It actually sort of works as a lotion, way too pale for me but I gave it to a friend and she loves it</li>
            <li> This is a miracle worker. I love the way it works. It is better than makeup too me. Have my face looking perfect like a model.</li>
            <li> I have freckly fair skin that gets quite oily during the day. I still get a little shiny, but this stuff really evens out the skin and tones down my shine. Cool product.</li>
            <li> I TRIED MANY DIFFERENT BRAND OF BB CREAMS. MOST OF THEM I USED, THEY DON&#x27;T KEEP MY MAKE UP STAY AND MY FACE WILL TURN VERY OILY THEN THE CREAM FALL DOWN!!WHEREAS, THIS ONE WORKS VERY GOOD, KEEP MY MAKE UP STAY FOR A LONG TIME AND MY FACE WON&#x27;T BE OILY!!!!    I REALLY SUGGEST YOU TO GET THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Initally I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review because there are already so many good reviews, but after reading each review posted on this product I had to add my two cents.  So, first I&#x27;m going to say that I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s caucasian with combination skin.  I have always suffered acne proplems and my skin is usually very oily in my T-zone, especially during the hot, humid summer months.  My skin is very fair, light ivory in most foundations and burns extremely easily.  I have a face full of freckles from all my burns.  Now that I have told you everything about my skin that is important, lets get to the review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product about a month ago and have waited to write my review because I wanted to make sure the results were going to last and give the product time to work.  The first time I used the product I was very iffy.  It has a greyish tint and made me look like a ghost.  Since I had read the reviews I was expecting it and knew to give it time to oxidize.  After it had oxidized it matched my skin amazingly well and made my skin look flawless!  I use about half a pump (don&#x27;t think anyone using the product properly would need anymore than that) and it covers my whole face very nicely!  For those that say it doesn&#x27;t give enough coverage, I&#x27;m guessing they are applying it wrong.  After I watched a video, I learned that when you apply it you MUST PAT IT ON, NOT RUB IT IN.  This is extremely important.  I have tried both rubbing it in and patting it on an (with my fingertips) and the rubbing leaves very little product on your skin to oxidize.  With the patting it will easily cover acne, or any other issue you may be using this product for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using the product I noticed my pores started to shrink.  Forgot to note at the top that I have always had very large pores.  And that my acne has diminshed immensely!  Although I still have some acne, it is not near as bad as it used to be and I have only been using this product for a month!  Also since using this product I have had no oil and no sunburns (on my face)!  I also must add here that when I have used the product by rubbing it in I did notice oil on my T-zone about half-way through the day.  When used by patting it onto the face (as the box recommends), I have experienced no oil problems.  I have also noticed a reduction in darkness of my freckles (due to the whitening agent).  I didn&#x27;t notice it first, my husband actually commented on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to address one issue that I saw in a previous review.  It was stated that this product is identical to a daily routine and that if you decide to use this product it is because you are lazy!  This is not true at all!  If you look at the ingredients for this product they are all natural (which can not be said for the foundation, sunscreen, acne treatment and whatever else the reviewer said to use). Also I&#x27;m sure that by purchasing all of these products that the reviewer recommened you would be spending much more than the $10 you can purchase this superior product for! Not only is this product all natural but it was also created to rejuvinate and heal skin, which once again those other products were not made to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, if you doubt anything I have said here google this product!  There are literally thousands of reviews out there and this product, to me, is unbeatable for the price and the results!</li>
            <li> I am going to keep it short n sweet-&lt;br /&gt;PROS -&lt;br /&gt;* Makes ur skin baby soft, been using only for last week or so and I can already feel the smoothness and softness&lt;br /&gt;* Awesome oil control, I apply this in the morning n i dont feel oil at all until late evening. And I have Oily T zone. I have never felt my nose non-oily&lt;br /&gt;* Good Coverage - it cover up the spots well and blends into the skin color so you actually dont feel that you are wearing any make up&lt;br /&gt;* Spot lightening - I have some acne spots on my face n they have started lightening already.. i cant wait to have my clear skin back :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS-&lt;br /&gt;* None so far!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am from South Asia and i have wheatish skin tone and it works on my skin tone too. The only issue i ran initially was the greying of the skin, but I think once you use the right quantity which is very less you are good. Now it takes only 5-10 mins before it blends into my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never going back to any other foundation ever!!!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- Light and airy and easy to apply and blend - I love he way this feels after applying&lt;br /&gt;-- Natural, slightly dewy look that I really like - great for a no-makeup look&lt;br /&gt;-- Like most other BB creams, brightens my skin very nicely although it does darken a little over time (oxidizes). I&#x27;ve heard that this helps it adjust to many other skin tones beyond those of us who are very fair but I&#x27;m not completely positive on this&lt;br /&gt;-- I really like the scent although it fades pretty fast so if it bothers you, I&#x27;m not sure if it would matter so much&lt;br /&gt;-- SPF 25 although I always put on an SPF 30 underneath it (and over my moisturizer) everyday anyway so this doesn&#x27;t matter so much to me personally. This is the face protectant I use which is super awesome. No greasy feel and good for your skin --&gt; [[ASIN:B0009DY9JQ Jan Marini Antioxidant Face Protectant SPF 30]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- Bottle - You can&#x27;t tell how much is left in the bottle at any given time&lt;br /&gt;-- Not as thick in feel and in coverage as others (particularly Dr. Jart+) which translates to not as nice of coverage. This will work nicely on normal skin but if you&#x27;re wanting to cover difficult acne or scars, you might want to go with a heavier one. I would say this is more of a medium coverage cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is SKIN79&#x27;s BB cream for people with oily skin versus the gold label which is made for people with dry skin. Where this pink label has the sebum control, the gold label ([[ASIN:B004R6HIR6 SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream VIP Gold (Gold Label) 40g (Autheticity label &amp; perforations with Free Hot Pink Sample!!!)]]) has what is termed as \\&quot;skin nourishment\\&quot; or just extra skin moisturizing. I have fairly normal skin where I occasionally get dry patches and my t-zone can be slightly oily. Both of these work perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought both kinds because I&#x27;m in the in between of skin types. I use the gold label in the winter since it has extra skin moisturizing and will start using this one in earnest soon since it&#x27;s warming up and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control more now.will start using this one in earnest soon since it&#x27;s warming up and I&#x27;ll probably enjoy the sebum control more now.</li>
            <li> I would have never tried this were it more expensive. At this price, really, everyone should try it. It takes less than one pump to cover my whole face. One whole pump covers my neck and throat area. The color blends perfectly into my skin tone. It&#x27;s not drying and I have dry skin. I do go ahead and put a light layer of moisturizer on my face first. My skin looks brighter and healthier than it&#x27;s looked in 10 years (I&#x27;m 33). Although I still have some lines around my eyes, overall my skin looks like a teenager&#x27;s. My face looks so soft and glowing because of this product. It really brightens up the eye area, as well, and covered veins and dark circles. It covers blemishes decently well, but a concealer may be required. I was very impressed with this cream. It&#x27;s the first BB cream I have tried and I don&#x27;t feel the need to keep looking at all. It&#x27;s absolutely lightweight. I don&#x27;t feel it. It doesn&#x27;t sweat off or transfer. I haven&#x27;t touched my foundation or tinted moisturizer since I started using this BB cream. A major plus is that it shipped all the way from Korea in only about 10 days. So, less than two weeks and it was packed well. The container is nice and has a nice feel and heft. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and it hasn&#x27;t clogged yet. I&#x27;m really happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The most amazing facial product I ever purchased.  Best concealer, pore cleanser, whitens well while still looking like a light foundation.  I&#x27;ve referred this product to many friends and they are just as in love with it as I am.</li>
            <li> It goes on well and provides good coverage but I notice at times my fine lines/wrinkles are more visible, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping around for a long time to find a nice base for my makeup that wasn&#x27;t heavy or cakey looking. I think I may have finally found the answer I&#x27;ve been looking for. After looking at several different reviews on YouTube for the BB creams out on the market - I decided to give Skin79 a try. I am very happy with the product so far. Just a small pump allows me to provide coverage for my entire face, and after I&#x27;ve blended it and patted it on, I hardly feel like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup. This is also been really great on my acne prone skin - I haven&#x27;t broken out once since I&#x27;ve used it.  The coverage could be a little more, but I&#x27;ve found that putting some mineral makeup over this works great. All in all I am very satisfied with this product and will be trying other Skin79 items in the future!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the quick shipping. Under 2 weeks from S.Korea to Maine.  Love the look of my skin with this BB cream. will definately order again. Also included samples of other Skin79 products.</li>
            <li> Best makeup I have used! I am half chinese and have trouble finding any makeup to match my skin tone. I decided to give an Asian brand a try to see if it would match my skin tone better. So happy with the results! This matches my skin tone perfectly, and you cannot tell I have makeup on. It looks like it is natural healthy skin. Also I am very impressed with the moisturizing properties in it. I have acne prone skin and moisturizing (not oily) ingredients help clear up my skin! I left a star out just because I would rather be able to see the inside of the container to see how much is left over so I won&#x27;t run &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;. Definitely buy this product if you are looking for a great everyday make up, the American BB creams have nothing on this!</li>
            <li> When I first heard about BB cream I knew I had to try it.  When you first put it on it looks kind of grey but when you give it a few seconds it adjusts and matches your skin tone. If you have a tan skin do not get this product. Also do not get it if you are looking into a product that covers acne. This is mostly for evening the skin tone and it&#x27;s great for everyday because it feels super light. It has a shiny finish so make sure you set it with a mineral or setting powder.  It&#x27;s a pretty thick product so a little does go a long way. My first bottle which I used everyday lasted me 9 months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I tend to have acne prone skin. I&#x27;m very pale (NC 15-20) and I&#x27;m 28 yrs. old with combo skin.  I found that the look and feel of this product were the best I&#x27;ve ever seen--a miracle cream is an understatement. My one hugeee problem with this product is that it seemed to break me out pretty badly.  I hope I didn&#x27;t receive a fake, but I have thoroughly researched on youtube.com what fakes look like, so I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s not the case.  Obviously it does not do this to everyone as I can see from the rave reviews. I ordered the skin79 oriental gold bb cream to see if that does the same thing.  Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews on Korean BB Creams that I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m considered a pale asian girl but Skin79 was still too pale for me, especially when you compare it to the color of my neck. I purchased a darker shade in Missha (another Korean BB Cream) but that was too dark. So I started to mix the two different types of BB Creams to create my own color. It gives good thick coverage without looking cakey. Another thing is while I will get blackheads and pimples from time to time, Skin79 gave me tons of clogged pores. The kind where you squeeze your nose and a white/clear hard thing comes out. I got TONS of those from this product whereas typically I get maybe 1 or 2 from time to time. Other than that, my skin seems to look clear and smooth after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I ordered it from Emma&#x27;s Cosmetics &amp; Skincare. I was worried that it&#x27;d be a fake, but it was the real deal and the packaging was intact. The only problem I have is that the product itself leaves my skin feeling a bit dry. I would recommend this for people with combination to oily skin. If you have dry skin, use a moisturizer underneath. It helps a lot. Other than that, this product is awesome and may just replace my foundation routine completely.</li>
            <li> Hydrates, but doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy at all. As soon as you put it on, you feel as though your skin absorbs it right away (and you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing anything). Only have been using it a few weeks, but love it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very fair with pink undertones. even though it&#x27;s not my skin tone, once you rub it in it looks natural.</li>
            <li> This BB cream arrived about 2 days after I ordered it (I found out that I don&#x27;t live that far from the seller&#x27;s city).&lt;br /&gt;I have used this BB cream as a sample before but didn&#x27;t get to see it&#x27;s results over a period of time as I dived into a pool right after. XD. Today I used it and it is my favorite! It&#x27;s too bad that it took me 7 BB creams before I started using this one! I have oily skin and my T-zone gets oily quick. This BB cream does a good job at controlling oil for me, My nose and around my nostrils have been super oily and are my number one problematic area and everything that I put doesn&#x27;t help, but not this BB cream!&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream significantly reduced the oiliness of my nose and even my forehead. I have full bangs that fall across my forehead, so an oily forehead is inevitable. I was surprised to see that my forehead wasn&#x27;t that oily, and I have oily roots! The color stayed nice throughout the day and my skin feels great, as if I&#x27;m not wearing anything! I&#x27;m throwing out my Missha BB cream now. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I received mine promptly and I was happy to get it straight away. It looked like the real thing. It had no perforations however and no authenticity sticker. I am still confused about whether the sticker or not the sticker should be there on the original. It did have a bar code on the bottom of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the item is fake also because once I put it on my face, I looked like a gray ghost. There was no oxidation whatsoever. It just sat there no matter that I smoothed it all over. I looked like I plunged my face into wet cement. It did not do anything except give me a gray cast.</li>
            <li> After a long while wanting to try BB cream, I finally got this (together with the Missha No. 21). The texture of this product is pretty light, smooth on nicely, however, applying moisturizer prior to this product is recommended. Though, combination to oily skin (I have combination) will feel some oiliness, this can be fixed with little finishing powder.   I have NC35 (according to MAC) and this product matches my colour just fine. I have some acne scar and history of freckle, this product does somewhat even out my skin tone.  I will continue looking for a better match product for myself, though, I will recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive, acne prone skin. I do not recommend.. It broke me out worse than anything I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> love the product - no colors even close to my complextion.  I mix it with my makeup and apply it...so it will last me quite a while.  love it though.</li>
            <li> When looking for a face cream, I run into a few problems. I have a combination skin type, acne scars, and am really not fussy, so I need something that won&#x27;t be hard to keep even. Also I&#x27;m bad at picking the right color for my face. WELL. I love this BB Cream! It feels like a face mask when you put it on, and it really adjusts well to your skin tone.  It&#x27;s super easy to apply since you pretty much just rub it in, and it&#x27;s hard to leave streaks on your face. It&#x27;s moisturizing (I&#x27;ve noticed better skin since I started using it!) and works very well as sunscreen too. I probably won&#x27;t bother with another face cream again- this stuff is easy and good, and it&#x27;s not that much for how long the bottle will last you!</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream.  It wears well with my oily skin and does not cause any breakouts.  I like that it has SPF and has nice coverage.  The only thing is the color is slightly too light for my skin.  I use a bronzer to bright my skin up.  I wish they would offer a couple of shades in this BB cream.  Overall great cream, texture and coverage, just slightly too light, but I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today so excited to try the HYPE. I&#x27;m telling you after first use, yeah it makes your face TOO WHITE for a minute but after it settles, your face is ready for all day photo shoot. It&#x27;s so light, I love the scent. BTW im combination mostly oily and very sensitive acne prone skin, I also have acne scarring. But you can&#x27;t tell after you apply this magic cream! I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive brand names to drug stores stuff. Looks like I finally found my skins match. I will give another week and update this review even more and maybe I will take some pictures too. Also I want to add that I bought mine through SeoulGlamour! Hope to do more business with you. Keep your prices reasonable and your honesty so even if there will be cheaper stuff, you&#x27;ll have our loyalty.</li>
            <li> The skin79 hot pink bb bottle was my FIRST foray into BB creams and It is which I judge all other bb creams by.  The texture is not too watery or matte and it glides onto skin easily and blends well..it is a little light at first but it will oxidize into your skin color.  I&#x27;m a NC30 in MAC..light to med skin Korean and I tend to prefer my makeup a little bit light as it seems like it illuminates your skin from beneath.  I&#x27;ve had excellent results with it in terms of color, texture, coverage, sun protection...&lt;br /&gt;but since I&#x27;m such a product junkie, I have tried other BB creams from Missha signature, Holika Holika, the face shop, and they are all goon in their own way..each one has its own effect/texture/sheen..I think skin79 hot pink stands on its own.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!! It had better coverage than I was expecting. I will definitely order more! this seller is also amazing they sent me a sample of a primer and the product I ordered this way if it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone I could return the unopened package is what I imagine that was for!! They even sent  a little thank you card :)</li>
            <li> I bought this cream having read a few reports on it. I wanted a simple one stop shop skin regime. I was using anti wrinkle,moisterizer, sun cream then a light foundation on every morning!SKIN 79 is the answer, now my skin regime in the morning is,  a makeup sponge to apply BB cream, its none greasy and stays on all day!Which proves  an old dog can learn new tricks!!</li>
            <li> After researching BB creams, I really wanted to try one that was affordable. SKIN79 Pink Label fit the bill and matched my need for an acne-friendly version. It arrived promptly and as far as I can tell (using the internet as a reference) this was the real thing and not an imitation or fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve suffered from adult acne since my late teens/early 20&#x27;s. When this BB cream arrived I was having a particularly bad break out along my jawline with some fading acne and current cystic acne. I was merely hoping that the cream would help cover this up and control oil. Within 3 (!) days, I my jawline area dramatically improved in texture and color. I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively fair Caucasian toned skin. I can tan, but I do not and I usually wear the lightest or next to lightest shade in any foundation line. This cream offers medium coverage. If I can still see a blemish after my first application, a tiny bit more cream applied to the spot usually does the trick. My face hasn&#x27;t felt too dry during the day or when I wash my face at night. My nose does get a bit oily with this product, but I just refresh the translucent powder that I wear over top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first BB cream, but I have been very pleased with it and am planning to order more of the same and from the same seller.</li>
            <li> Omg omg omg. I am in LOVE with this product. Immediately after purchasing, I started having doubts. I bought this for a mere $14.50, which price-wise, compares to drugstore foundations. Since I have had more disappointing than good experiences with those products, I started wondering if I should have invested in something a bit more top of the line. Perhaps, done a little research to see which brand of BB creams come out with the most positive reviews. But I decided not to worry so much about it and hope for the best. And WOW. This stuff is incredible. I don&#x27;t even know what this particular product is meant for? Is it a mositurizer, sun block, or foundation? In any case, I discovered that it works as all three. I was on the hunt for a makeup product that would help reduce the redness in my face due to years of acne, and consequently, acne scars. As soon as I had finished applying this on my face, it seemed as though all my blemishes magically disappeared. Okay, okay, so that is a bit of an overexaggeration. I can still see some of my scars, but compared to other products I have used in the past (Mac, Shisheido, Clinique, Sephora, &amp; tons of other high end makeup products) this one offers THE BEST coverage I have ever seen. I am so impressed right now that I am utterly speechless. Based off the other reviews, this also helps improve skin. Since today is my first day of using this fantastic product I cannot vouch for that. But coverage wise, nothing beats this stuff. Maybe other BB creams get the job done as well...but this is my very first, after hearing many of my friends rave and rave about it. I guess I will be trying out other brands of BB creams as well after having such a positive experience with this one. But overall, I am so happy with this product and I would gladly repurchase this in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> i just got this product and i like it alot because it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily thats what i like most about it. when i have this product on my face i can tell that it makes my face looks smoother and younger feeling. and its a really good service! i recommend this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I had been researching for a while about the whole \\&quot;BB cream\\&quot; phenomena, and decided to take a chance and check it out for myself. I have combination skin and lately it&#x27;s been super sensitive and more difficult than usual so needless to say, I was a little wary of trying something new, but decided I was going to do it anyway because my tinted moisturizer wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. Anyway, I just got it in the mail today and let me tell you.. it is AWESOME! My skin feels amazing, it is super creamy and even my husband ( who NEVER notices anything) asked if I had done something different because I looked better! I know it is a little early to say this is \\&quot;the one\\&quot; but I haven&#x27;t been this pleased with any cosmetic product in a long time, and I really wanted to share my experience with the gals that are still \\&quot;considering\\&quot; to get it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I was most worried about was the fact that I didn&#x27;t know if it was going to look weird on me because I&#x27;m very fair, but it works fantastic! At first it&#x27;s a little scary because it looks gray and way too dark (for my complexion anyway) but after a few minutes it looks really natural and beautiful, it evens out my skin and I really like the effect it gives me. Keep in mind though that it doesn&#x27;t cover as much as a normal foundation, for example it doesn&#x27;t cover my freckles.. so if you are looking for something with full coverage this is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for something that looks natural, not too heavy and that is actually good for your skin then this product is for you! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is simple.. do it! You don&#x27;t have anything to lose (well you would lose 14 bucks but it&#x27;s not that much and you can probably return it anyway). I definitely recommend it and I also want to mention the seller i got it from, the name is \\&quot;seoulglamour\\&quot; and they rock!! I ordered a week ago and I already have it (pretty awesome considering it comes all the way from Korea!). They are wonderful and sell the original one, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review! haha but I really wanted to share the whole experience and I hope it helps you decide if this BB cream is for you :)</li>
            <li> This bb cream is great for when you don&#x27;t  want a heavy foundation, great for day wear, at the beach etc.</li>
            <li> Light and sheer, but with that said, a little goes a long way. A single pump will cover the whole face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It smells very good and is very good for light skin. I have seen my acne scars get lighter and I sometimes replace my foundation with the cream. The cream has a gray/purple tint and I recommend it only for people with light or fair skin color because it has a light tint.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing i think its helping my skin the color i choose is a little lighter but i like it, i use it for everyday wear w my eyeliner and it gives me a very natural look</li>
            <li> I like this foundation, but like any other it wears off throughout the day.  I would suggest setting with powder.  Also, it is somewhat greasy, so if you have oily skin, this isn&#x27;t for you...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week so I will not be able to help those looking for an in depth review but I&#x27;ve given it five stars because it has a nice texture and does smooth the appearance of skin and makes it feel extremely soft , there is no doubt that it will do what it claims to do if your on the bb/cc cream bandwagon what better way to do so than to buy it straight from the source in Korea I&#x27;m very excited to have it and recommend to those with skin imperfections</li>
            <li> For someone who breaks out at the slightest addition of a scented lotion, I have not had a single instance while using this product. The cream is very thick, and at first I was concerned that I would not be able to blend it evenly. However, I got the hang of it and actually like the fact that it isn&#x27;t so thin because that means I need to use much less of it per application. I was pleasantly surprised that the hue and undertones were NOT pinkish (at least that isn&#x27;t what shows up when I apply it), and was very matte. It doesn&#x27;t seem to add any extra shine which is also nice. The cream seems to have a very neutral undertone, so would be a good balancer for people with pinkish undertones like myself.</li>
            <li> FIRST, Review of the PRODUCT--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!  It comes out grayish in color but after application it oxidizes and matches my skin.  I sometimes will layer it to get extra coverage where I might need it.  I usually apply BAreMinerals foundation over it.  I have tried several American BB creams and this is by far the best I have used and you can&#x27;t beat the price if you shop around.  However, BEWARE, there are sellers that say their products are authentic but are in fact, FAKE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leads to my REVIEW OF THIS SELLER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had done a fair amount of research on this product before I ever started purchasing it. There are many websites/blogs/videos devoted to educating us on the differences between the fake products and the authentic ones.  One such place is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read and rely on the feedback and comments made by others regarding the sellers out there.  I thought I had made a good choice with this seller.  I WAS WRONG!  The boxes and the tubes seemed to look authentic.  I did notice that the back of the bottles said \\&quot;wrinkle improvement\\&quot; but the front of the bottles said &#x27;wrinkle free\\&quot;. Apparently, the real product has had both descriptions but it raised my suspicions. It wasn&#x27;t until I squirted out the product that I noticed that the application button was more \\&quot;springy\\&quot; that any of my previous bottles.  The application usually has a \\&quot;firm\\&quot; feel to it, not springy feeling or sounding. The product itself was more watery and had a pink/peach appearance instead of the gray color I&#x27;m used to.  When I rubbed it on my skin, it had a very watery feel and had virtually no coverage effect.  As it dried, it took on a whitish film color and dried sticky.  The feel and appearance looked and felt like I had spread elmer&#x27;s glue on my skin.  YUCK.  I popped the actual tube out of the pink outer cover by pushing up with my thumb on the nozzle.  The fake products have a tube extending down into the main chamber.  Guess what?  Both bottles had this tube.  I&#x27;m sure the sellers/manufacturers out there that want to sell the fake stuff will fix that difference soon as they have many of the others differences that distinguish between the authentic and fake products.  The bottom line is the actual product looks and feels totally different from the authentic product.  This seller posts that he/she sells the Authentic product and this is simply a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAME ON YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I returned both bottles to amazon and got my money back!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since purchased my SKIN 79 HOT PINK BB CREAM from PINK GELEE.  It IS AUTHENTIC and I will purchase from them from now on.  They even sent a thank you note with my purchase along with several samples.</li>
            <li> It works better than foundation. I easily spread it evenly over my face and it comes off as a more luminous complexion. There is no greasy or clogging feeling that you get with sunblock. There is SPF protection. Just great stuff overall.</li>
            <li> I have tried many primers and BB creams. I don&#x27;t have bad skin but with the BB creams I tried I always needed to put foundation over them because the coverage was just too sheer. I received this in the mail after about two weeks. I just love it! I don&#x27;t have to use foundation over it and if I want more coverage I just need a drop of foundation, blends great! Gives my face a glow and I&#x27;m not breaking out or getting bumps on my face like with other primers or BB creams. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I used to hate my skin. It was a combination Korean and Russian, and I couldn&#x27;t find makeup to bring out my Asian complexion. But I found my salvation with all the Skin79 products. It blends beautfifully, and is so easy to clean off... I&#x27;m hooked on this brand, and it&#x27;s worth the addiction.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to everyone. i am so in love with this. no strong ingredients, no smell at all and its perfect especially for Asian skin</li>
            <li> I have a bb cream obsession....at the moment.  Next week it may be another product.  So far this is my favorite day time bb cream.  It provides medium coverage and meshes with the skin like nothing I have ever used (and I have had foundation obsessions, mineral foundation/powder obsessions).  I hydrate my skin first with a good moisturizer.  Then one pump, spread over my fingers, rubbed on my face.  Goes on scary white/gray, BUT turns into your skin color...and it is your skin, only better.  It provides a semi-matte finish and doesn&#x27;t have any glitter or shimmer.  Depending on my mood, if I want the dewy look I will mix one pump of this bb cream with 1-2 drops of argan oil for a beautiful radiant glow...without the shimmer/glitter.  At 36...I do not need shimmer or glitter settling into my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have light, oily, acne prone skin. I was weary about ordering this but I love it. I use to daily.  So stones I use under eye concealer as well. It covers so well for a bb cream and my skin has had no breakout issues. I love the texture and how clear my skin has been. It is a lighter shade. I would be careful with darker or yellow skin tones.</li>
            <li> I was scared at first cause i thought i was going to get a fake one, but after checking on helpful websites that show you whether your BB cream is fake or not, i was relieved! I love this BB cream!&lt;br /&gt;My seller was Blue Queen and the Shipping was very fast! Will buy from again soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair skin, and have super sensitive skin and this product was not too dark nor did it cause breakouts. I have actually noticed fewer break outs (which occur during my cycle, and before, would consist of 2-3 pimples- now it&#x27;s down to 1 if at all).&lt;br /&gt;I do find that the coverage is not as heavy as expected, so I do like to set with a slightly tinted powder after my skin has absorbed the sunscreen (which is the cause of the ashy-grey look others have complained about) and still use concealer.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my skin besides the break outs, but I can say I still find it worth using daily, and works as a great base for a full make up application.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of BB creams and this is the best.  It looks great and is easy to apply.  It only comes in one shade (which is nice for me- no decisions to make on color).  This product works great for fair to light medium skin tones.  This has replaced the foundation I was using.  I wear this all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Skin 79 products before and had no problem with skin sensitivity, but this particular one gave me what I can only describe as a chemical burn on my cheeks.  I thought perhaps it was out of date, or it reacted with another product that I used. Because I love the BB Creams from Skin 79 I figured I&#x27;d give it another shot- but even a few weeks later and with a clean face, I ended up with the same result. Bummed but I&#x27;ll go back to the Oriental Gold product.</li>
            <li> this was a gift...to be honest I have no clue what it is for.  Came in substandard packaging, but great considering it was shipped with other objects. No problems with how it was mailed.</li>
            <li> I break out alot which leads to a lot of acne scarring, this after only 2 days of using it has improved my skin and lightened up the tone.</li>
            <li> After hearing all they hype, I knew I wanted to try this.  I was a little uncertain about the color matching correctly or that it would really work as well as everyone said it did... but after wearing it for a few days, I can already see a definite improvement in my skin.  I have not had any problems breaking out, in fact the BB cream seemed to have healed a few little blemishes that I did have!  My pores also seem to be less noticeable and my skin seems overall more smooth and even in tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin, and tend to be on the dry side.  This is more matte than I expected, so I might try experimenting with using a moisturizer before I apply in the morning.  But overall I am extremely pleased, this went above and beyond my already high expectations, and I would definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally feel like I have found my beauty secret and I feel like a movie star when I go out now!  I am a customer for life..</li>
            <li> I first bought this on a whim almost three years ago and I still use this.&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly pale skin from mid Fall til end of Spring and then a little darker, depending on how much sun exposure I get during the sunny season.  But this product works for me pretty much all year round. On those rare occasions where I am a bit darker, I easily just add some color from another foundation and apply like normal. Absolutely love love this! I will probably never use any other BB cream. I usually don&#x27;t use a brush to apply it either, for me, clean fingers work just as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondering why the long gap between the time I first found it and used it to the now review? Plainly put, I was lazy haha, but I just felt like sharing it now, since it will be running on three years since I found my almost everything face makeup product^^</li>
            <li> I was convinced by the other reviews to try this product and I LOVE it! Like other reviews it does appear to go on with a grayish tinge, but quickly fades. I apply about a pea size amount using a kabuki brush and get great coverage (and i am a full coverage type of person)...although I did not like the way it covered just using my fingers! I have light yellow/olive undertones, in the summer tan somewhat easy (on top of using self tanners), but keep a pretty fair complexion in winter months. For spring this bbcream has been fine. After applying it with a foundation brush, I use a very small amount of my bareminerals in golden medium, just to get it to a shade that matches my skintone better; because just the bb cream is too light for me. Then i do the rest of my makeup routine as normal!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the BB Cream from Blue Queen! The BB Cream I purchased from them is FAKE FAKE FAKE!!! It may look real but it is fake. You have to pay close attention to the details. There are websites that are dedicated to show you how a real and a fake bb cream looks like. Sure you&#x27;re saving a few bucks but you will pay for it after you put it on. I thought I was getting a good deal since it&#x27;s cheaper than the one on the Skin79 website but when I put it on, I started breaking out within a couple of hours. Biggest regret ever! Buying it on Amazon is not worth the wait and the money for the bb cream. If possible, buy it from the direct website because the sellers on Amazon are not required to have legit products.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d leave a review detailing my own personal experience with this bb cream, since it seems like the effectiveness of different brands and types varies a lot from person to person. Hopefully it&#x27;ll help someone! (And just for the record, I&#x27;m aware of the issues of fake imitation brands being sold online, and I can confirm that I&#x27;ve been testing the real deal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 18, with skin that&#x27;s never given me many issues either way. I&#x27;ve never suffered from acne or excessively dry skin, although I usually have a little unevenness in skin tone and my dark circles are pronounced. I&#x27;m not sure what my exact skin shade is, but I&#x27;m Hispanic, and light-skinned with definite yellow undertones. As far as the color of this particular bb cream goes, I may have gotten lucky, because it&#x27;s a spot-on match with my skin tone. Even when applying it, I didn&#x27;t notice that gray cast that others have commented on (maybe that means my skin is naturally gray?! EEP.) But whatever the case, it did exactly what it advertises -- evened out my skin tone and brightened my complexion while still looking really natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely see the \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot; effect that&#x27;s popular with Asian brands, but not to an unnatural extent. It just looks all-around healthy, matte, even, and bright. I chose Skin79 over other brands because I wasn&#x27;t looking for dramatic coverage or anything like that; I just wanted a \\&quot;one-stop shop\\&quot; sort of skin product that would help the minor issues I have with my skin while being healthy for it as well. Prior to this, I didn&#x27;t wear anything on my skin at all -- no foundation, primer, concealer, anything -- so I can&#x27;t speak as to whether it can/should take the place of all those other products for people who use them regularly. I suppose that might make me more sensitive to feeling \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; with any sort of product on, but I&#x27;m happy to say that Skin79 barely feels like anything at all. It has a veeeery slight fragrance that instantly dissipates once you applyit. And it comes in just about the cutest bottle I&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more as soon as my first supply runs out.</li>
            <li> This product is great.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE A FAIR SKIN TONE.  and i dont need that much coverge, so for what i wanted is perfect my face looks very even and it actually improves teh apearance of my face.&lt;br /&gt;I used on top of my mosturizer or sunscreen if i feel i need extra protection!!! great product</li>
            <li> this item already has lots of reviews but I felt compelled!&lt;br /&gt;its got SPF, its perfectly tinted, it doesnt get shiny or sticky! it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont have a very usual skintone either, I&#x27;m middle eastern but pretty pale so it&#x27;s not your average complexion and lots of other tinted moisturizers and things look off on me. but like everyone said, this stuff just works with your tone and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey or fake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does say its got \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; elements but with my experience it&#x27;s really more of a \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; effect. you don&#x27;t literally look whiter or anything, so it shouldnt be a problem if you&#x27;re tan or wanna get some color in the summer.</li>
            <li> I love this product; it blends really easily, evens out my skin tone, and covers amazingly. It also works really well with other products such as several different under eye concealers and some powder bronzers and cream blushes. I don&#x27;t find that it lasts ALL day, but then again I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s meant to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually bother to write reviews, because usually someone else has already voiced the same opinion.  But, at the risk of being redundant:  This product is great!!!  I have medium fair skin that although I am in my fifties, I have to be careful not to use any pore clogging products to avoid breakouts.  I also have a mild case of rosacea and very sensitive skin.  I was using Clinique&#x27;s BB Cream, but after googling product reviews, I purchased Skin 79&#x27;s version in May 2013.  It only comes in one color and may be too light if you are very dark skinned or for some if you are using facial self-tanners in the summer*.  But now that winter is almost here, I&#x27;ve gone back to this--I think it is the best crossover of a tinted moisturizer with a skin serum.  It provides just enough coverage but still looks imperceptable in daylight--I put it on with fingers and then blend with a makeup sponge.  When I buy a new product, I test it--at a mirror, in the daylight--and then I see how good it looks several hours later without retouching.  This looks good all day--it also has sunscreen.  There are some warnings to be careful not to buy imposter products--but I buy from Amazon Prime so am not worried.  I will also mention that is of far better quality than drugstore brands, but does not have the high department store price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*  This past summer I tried IT Cosmetics CC+ with SPF 50+ in Tan and used it when outdoors--it even lasted all day at a beach party where I wanted to look good, be protected but still not look &#x27;made-up\\&quot;.  When I want to wear \\&quot;real make-up\\&quot;, I love Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Maestro--it is pricey, but with foundation I believe you get what you pay for.)</li>
            <li> Was introduced to the Asian BBs from a makeup forum discussion, and after doing much research, I wanted to try the Skin79 Hot Pink. For a fair skin girl with more neutral undertones, this works amazing! The color isn&#x27;t 100% perfect match, but it blends fairly well. Plus the coverage is great - medium to full. So it helps cover my unfortunate acne. For extreme blemishes, may need concealer, but does a great job as a base. The longevity was the best part as I have oily skin and nothing lasts very long. This keeps the oil at bay and my skin shine-free longer. Do need to blot or refresh after a number of hours, but this lasts longer than any other foundation I&#x27;ve used. And has the benefit of SPF.</li>
            <li> I just received this BB cream and I am already in love with it! I can&#x27;t stop looking at my face in the mirror! At first the cream has a grey tint to it, but after blended (and patted) onto the skin, it matches perfectly! I followed with a light dusting of finishing powder and then a little blush. I didn&#x27;t need any of the concealer I normally use!! To give you an idea of my skin tone - when buying makeup, I buy the lightest shade possible. I am ivory/fair/neutral/cool. The makeup may look dark on a tissue, but because I always use an SPF on my face, my face skin is naturally lighter than my chest and neck. When applied it matches my normal overall look perfectly. This cream evens out the redness in my skin and gives me dewy, healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Emma&#x27;s Cosmetics &amp; Skincare, and the product appears to be authentic &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, works great at covering up acne and redness near my chin and forehead.  I&#x27;ve had absolutely no new break outs since I started using this product, and my skin tone actually does look like it&#x27;s evening out a little.  It&#x27;s by no means a miracle product, but it does everything I wanted.</li>
            <li> The product shipment arrived earlier than the expected time..It is very good package with very professional. I satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I think this particular BB cream is part of a conspiracy. After just one application you will break out into a glorious bouquet of zits the likes of which you probably haven&#x27;t seen since the dawning of puberty, requiring heavier application of foundation, creating an endless cycle of low self esteem and Beblesh purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;m not sure why this company decided that &amp;#34;olive&amp;#34; was a pretty good default skin tone but I highly disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because as far as I can tell it isn&#x27;t lying about the SPF25 part.</li>
            <li> Im happy with this product, doesnt have as much coverage as i tought, but still keeps me very haooy :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely switched over from foundation to BB creams (Korean brands only since US BB creams are basically just tinted moisturizers which does not have the same consistency, coverage, or benefits of Korean BB creams).  Missha was the first BB cream I tried, and I thought it was okay but it made my face look too gray and ashy, and the coverage wasn&#x27;t great either.  It didn&#x27;t give off the natural matte look that I prefer for my skin.  I gave up on BB creams for a while because of it and went back to my MUFE HD Foundation.  Then I noticed the rave reviews that Skin79 was getting for their BB creams so I started using Skin79 hot pink BB cream, which I fell in love with.  It gave me a newfound hope for BB creams.  It made my skin look really matte and natural- the coloring is great.  The gray ashiness that you first get right after application oxidizes within 15 minutes to a beautiful finish that matches my skin tone really well.  I started using the gold version, which I equally love, for when I want a more dewy natural look since it&#x27;s more moisturizing than the hot pink version.  I wear all of my BB cream with Laura Geller Spackle Under Primer (clear) and I set my BB cream with Maybelline Dream Matte Powder for a super matte finish or Sonia Kashuk Bare Minimum Pressed Powder for a more skin-like natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Lioele Triple the Solution BB Cream out of curiosity, and after applying it on my skin I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful my skin looks!  It is light and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize as much as Skin79, but the finish makes my skin look like my skin only muchmuch better.  I&#x27;m in love!  I am now awaiting the Lioele Beyond the Solution because I want a BB Cream with no SPF version for when I know I&#x27;m going to have my picture taken since SPF reflects light particles, making your face super white and glowy in photographs.  Also, I read that the Beyond the Solution has a more natural coloring since there&#x27;s no SPF (no white ashiness like most BB cream start out with) so no waiting to oxidize!&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, I highly recommend these BB Creams: Skin79 Hot Pink, Skin79 Gold, Lioele Triple the Solution, and I am pretty sure I will love Lioele Beyond the Solution as well but if not I&#x27;ll update this review!  :)&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention that these above BB creams lasts all day and stays pretty matte on my super oily skin!  I never have to blot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not tan but I&#x27;m a bit darker than most \\&quot;pale\\&quot; Asians. This product actually adjusts really well, covers blemishes, and moisturizes :D it has a VOID sticker that the skin79 site said to avoid but I did more research into it and turns out the VOID sticker is on the real skin79 and also based on the seller&#x27;s money back guarantee, I&#x27;ll take their word that it&#x27;s a true beauty ;] I&#x27;ve tried Missha Signature Real and it&#x27;s pretty white -__- but that also covered well, too. However, this bb cream from skin79 feels lighter on my skin. Also ordered Missha Cho Bo Yang so let&#x27;s see how it turns out :D</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream because it does everything its suppose to. It whitens, protects, and give enough coverage. Some people say that the BB do not give enough coverage and I will say it won&#x27;t cover every single imperfection but it does give enough. What this means is the BB cream feels light and doesn&#x27;t turn out cakey later on. It also doesn&#x27;t turn a different shade as the day goes on. This BB cream is great for someone like me who uses minimal makeup.</li>
            <li> After reading mixed reviews both here and elsewhere online, I put off buying any type of BB cream for over 6 months. It was something I really wanted to try but I&#x27;d convinced myself that no BB cream could give me the coverage I wanted or last as long as I needed it to. I ordered this product but before it came, I picked up another BB cream in the drugstore (Maybelline Dream Fresh). After trying that one, I was even more convinced that I wouldn&#x27;t find a BB Cream that would work for me. This one arrived a couple of days later and I tried it the next day. I was blown away! I have fair skin and have had acne all of my teenage and adult life. I also have a fair amount of freckles. My skin has finally cleared up and while I don&#x27;t need a full coverage foundation anymore, I need a lot more than a tinted moisturizer can provide to help cover the freckles and some scarring. I&#x27;ve always hated the way a full coverage, long lasting foundation felt and looked but I felt like I had no other options. I use this in combination with UD deslick makeup setting spray and I have been thrilled with the results. I feel like when I wear this BB cream, my skin looks natural but a lot better. It hides my imperfections but doesn&#x27;t look cakey or overly made up. plus, it feels fantastic! I do use a setting powder and a setting spray because I have oily skin and I feel like a dewy finish always looks slightly oily on me. I think this will be my daily foundation routine for a long time to come. FYI it does have a slight scent but I find that it smells soapy and pleasant, not at all over powering.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who&#x27;s curious, the regimen that finally cleared my skin up was washing with African Black Soap twice daily and following that up with Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s clarifying toner. The soap is cheap but the toner is on the pricey side. Worth a shot if you&#x27;ve tried everything else &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> So I read good reviews about this bb cream, but the only problem I was coming across was people saying it won&#x27;t work on a non white skin tone. So I decided to try the product, im a nc35 and the product came out good on me! It comes out grayish and blends into your skin, leaving a flawless look! My sister who&#x27;s a nc40 used it as well, at it adjusted to her color as well as mine! I don&#x27;t think it would work for darker tone, but I definitely know you don&#x27;t have to be a nc25 or less to use it.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I got this from Blue Queen and I received the real thing. After using this, my roommate and boyfriend have complimented on my more natural looking skin. I am asian so this matched my skin color better than Revlon Colorstay which I used before this. It also has lots of skin benefits and SPF so that&#x27;s a plus. I no longer have to applying sunscreen underneath my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for reviews but because of all of the positive reviews I saw here I am now a proud owner of this amazing product! I received this bb cream on 9/2/12 so I&#x27; ve been using it for 5 days now and I&#x27; ve already ordered my 2nd bottle. Now I have fair, smooth oily skin, I don&#x27;t have any acne however I can brakeout like crazy if I use makeup that adds oil. This BB not only gives you great coverage but makes your skin almost glow, it helps to keep my oily face nice and dry and my other makeup just falls into place and stays there. Now, yes it does have a grey ash color but as you blend it in the BB will match your color, a little goes a long way so use about 5 small pumps and spread evenly with a concealer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* 10/10/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. So I thought it fair to update my review since there&#x27;s some issues that can change your mind. I am sad to report that I am returning both of my BB creams to the seller because I feel that I bought fakes. I was developing a rash so I started eliminating products until finally I had to admit it was the BB cream. I sought out information online on how to spot a fake and I found that there are a lot of contradictions. The ones I bought seem to be ok, however the BB on one of them has completely rubbed off and the other one is slowly fading. I am not sure if is because is a fake or because it&#x27;s out in the open. To be sure I went to the Skin79 website where they only provide you with one sure way of verifying authenticity which is to check the silver sticker on the back of your bottle. If you go to their website it will show you the difference between an original sticker and a tampered one. At first glance mines seem to be ok, but if you place it under the light it does look like the tampered image they show you. I have decided to buy the BB cream straight from the Skin79 website just to be sure, it&#x27;s a little more but I rather pay more and have a piece of mind than be cheap and pay for it with my face. Good luck!!</li>
            <li> it broke me out, but it seems all foundations do that to me:(&lt;br /&gt;Why I love it:&lt;br /&gt;-I love that it reduces the redness on my face and I love how it makes my skin tone took brighter like in a clean way.&lt;br /&gt;-It minimizes my pores. I have huge pores and they are often hard to conceal even when I use primer, but once this settles on my face my pores become invisible.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s also a skincare product. I have been trying to maintain a strict skincare routine, which takes a lot of time in the morning, but this lets me save time.&lt;br /&gt;-It is lightweight. It feels like I am wearing almost nothing. It looks really natural.&lt;br /&gt;-It feels moisturizing to me and it does not cling to the dry patches on my face.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t love:&lt;br /&gt;-It is a little to light for my skin right now(I&#x27;m a nc25). However, it looks lighter on me because I tend to get a little tanner in the summer but this will work fine for me during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;-I have really oily skin. This foundation only lasts for 4 hours before I begin to to get really shiny on my face, but i feel that it&#x27;s the same with all foundations I have bought in the past.&lt;br /&gt;-It does not hide blemishes, but that&#x27;s not something a little concealer won&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The reason I gave this four stars was mainly because it broke me out. It was probably because humidity+makeup&#x3D;acne(They were tiny pimples though) Other than that, this bb cream along with a little bit of concealer makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and even though some people claim that it is a fake knock off of the real product. So I must say if it is fake, it&#x27;s the best fake product I have ever used. It works great, doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily. It actually feels very light and breathable. I would order this again.</li>
            <li> the downside to this bb cream is that it leaves your face with a grey complexion. its only who those are very very pale. everything is okay.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that tans well.  I had read about BB cream as being used for coverage as well as a moisturizer that has SPF (all in one type deal).  It works great at evening out my skin tone (I have red blotches around my nose) and covering up \\&quot;sun freckles\\&quot;.  Overall I am very please with this product so far (only been using for two weeks).  I will report again as the only concern I have is that the packaging of the bottle, which looks quite nice, is deceiving about actually how much product you are getting.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, came two weeks earlier than I expected and was relieved that it worked out that way because I actually moved to campus a few days before it arrived. It evens out my skin, visibly fades away my acne scars (not entirely), and it conceals moderately. The only downfall is that it gives off a gray tint and is lighter than my face, so I must mix with my summer foundation, other than that no real complaints. Within two weeks of using this daily and going to see family, my mother was quick to comment on my even skin tone. I adore this product and the price was fantastic for me. Definitely would recommend and am actually in the process of purchasing some for my mom.</li>
            <li> The product arrived much earlier than expected. Ordered on 09/28 and received by 10/11. It is packaged nicely and includes a free sample of another beauty product (in my case (time revolution night repair science activator serum by missha).</li>
            <li> Hi! So I ordered the pink and gold skin79 BB creams after researching dozens of BB creams(I&#x27;ll admit, there were a few others which looked like they could be better than skin79&#x27;s, but the bottle shape and color won me over HAHA)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little bit about me: Never used bb creams before, this is my first time ordering. Literally just got it out of the mail, only blended it on my hand, will update this when I start using it like tomorrow, but so far blends very well; I&#x27;m asian and have really pale skin and can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on my arm!! There is a very light fragrant smell, the pink version feels more light than the gold, gold will probably be better for the dry winter time. I bought the gold version for my mom, but now that I look back the orange one seems it might be better for her skin, as it has higher SPF and she has a lot of sun spots on her cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My delivery experience: I bought the 2 bottles from Pink Gelee, because I did not find any mixed comments about fake vs real products as SeoulGlamour/other sellers. After I ordered it, I immediately sent an email to Pink Gelee. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to ask bluntly if they were real or not, and then I&#x27;d check it when the package came in. I received a reply promptly the next day, guaranteeing that their products are 100% guaranteed authentic. She even linked me a site to check the authenticity, and although that was reassuring I was not ready to give in the towel until I had the product in front of me and I could check for myself. The product came very promptly, first day of the estimated delivery date. (They are based in LA, and I live 30 minutes from there so that might be a factor to consider when ordering) Inside included a card saying thank you  and a sample of the Pink and Gold versions, which was sweet (but I sorta just bought those 2... I kinda wished it was the orange vita plus sample :c )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overview on the authenticity: So it came in the mail today and I readily checked all thebookmarked links of how to tell if it&#x27;s real or not. The thing though, about these photos are that Skin79 changes their packages regularly, probably to fool the people who are making fakes out there. The front label on the box and on the bottle says \\&quot;Wrinkle Improvement\\&quot; instead of Wrinkle Free. That freaked me out, because some of the &#x27;Real&#x27; versions out there shows Wrinkle Free. Upon further studying and research, I found out that Skin79 recently changed their products to say Wrinkle Improvement, so +1 there. To all of you who just bought one recently and your bottle still says Wrinkle Free, :&#x27;( idk, check the date if it&#x27;s 2012, should say Wrinkle Improvement! Also as a side note, those who say \\&quot;oh, your product is fake if the labeled words scratch off,\\&quot; that&#x27;s just silly. Almost anything can be scratched off if it&#x27;s out in heat, or dry areas long enough. I also found comments of a person who talked to a representative of cute and pretty, who sells authentic skin79 products, who even said that the label can scratch off, real or fake, if it&#x27;s been let out in the sun or in different conditions long enough. So I think I&#x27;m going to skip that test, haha... not going to sit here and try to scratch off my brand new product to base if it&#x27;s real or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the barcode should be on the bottom of the box; mine was on both products, as well as the expiration date and the manufacturing date. The manufacturing date was very recent as well, sometime this year, and expiration date in 2014. On the bottle itself there was also a sticker of authenticity, the gold version wasn&#x27;t as nicely placed as the pink bottle.. it was slightly crooked, which made me worried. Perforated lines on both boxes were shown as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, If you read inside the box, on the English part I found a typo: it said Wriinkle Improvement. I was like, damn, this is a fake. HOWEVER, after some research I found a lady who bought it full price from a local authorized retailer, and the real product also has this typo, which made me extremely relieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, as a last check, I pumped a little on my hand. I&#x27;ve read that if it comes out leaky or watery, it&#x27;s fake. It came out finely mixed, in one unison color and was lightly fragrant. The pink took like literally 20+ pumps to get it going, and the white only 1 or 2 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all this, I am almost sure now that the product I got was an authentic skin79 product. If you&#x27;ve kept up with me so far, hooray! You are now more informed! These are the elaborate reasons why I think my product is legit. I&#x27;ll be buying from her from now on, unless someone finds new information to prove me wrong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Evens out skin tone, covers blemishes and controls oil really well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Caused a slight breakout along my chin and unfortunately didn&#x27;t match my skin tone perfectly. I found the product to be quite thick so I mixed it with my moisturizer which made a world&#x27;s difference when applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lighter skin tone then this product does a really great job balancing your skin and giving you a great even tone. I recommend it to those who already have their acne at bay as it has slight clogging properties.</li>
            <li> This one blended my skin well, but was very light coverage. It also didnt seem to moisturize as well as the other skin79 BB creams.</li>
            <li> Age: Mid 20s&lt;br /&gt;Skin: Dry, Sensitive, Recently Acne-Prone&lt;br /&gt;Color: Fair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After perusing around on the Internets for a product that could help even out skin tone but that wouldn&#x27;t require a heavy foundation or ten layers of a thin product, I came across this gem, which is mentioned on multiple YouTube Beauty Channels. I must say, I&#x27;m so impressed! I wasn&#x27;t holding out high hopes, as my skin has become a source of stress and irritation lately, but I&#x27;m loving this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;m very fair-skinned (Caucasian), and this product is made for light skin tones. However, I wasn&#x27;t exactly holding my breath for a miracle or anything the first time I put it on, but within 3 minutes of massaging this in, I literally looked at myself in the mirror and said \\&quot;woah\\&quot; and had to do an inspection. The redness on my cheeks was totally evened out, and the minor fading blemishes I had on my cheek somehow looked more like freckles than healing acne (I&#x27;m talking 1 week since they started healing away, not full-blown height of breakout). After that major improvement, I was a little bummed to see that the hyper-pigmentation along my jawline was still pretty noticeable, but with a bit of concealer, those were just a faded memory (har har). After an hour or so, I did notice that the product had settled a tiny bit into the wrinkle on my forehead (I have this weird single vertical wrinkle between my eyebrows that is pretty deep for my age), but with just a light hand, I massaged it away; I didn&#x27;t notice any settling in other fine lines that are starting to form on my face, like around my mouth and eyes. I should note though that I did not set this with a powder, as I have very dry skin and wasn&#x27;t sure if you were supposed to do that anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great; it looks mid-end (as in, not cheap but not super expensive IMO), and the little pump works great. There isn&#x27;t any way to tell how much product is left though, as the packaging is too opaque. I&#x27;m also not sure how the pump is designed inside, but I&#x27;m guessing there will be a fair amount of product that won&#x27;t be able to be used at the end. Since I don&#x27;t even need a full pump for my whole face, I&#x27;m guessing it will last a while, and the lost bit at the end will just be a part of the deal, though a bit of a bummer. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, so I can&#x27;t comment at all on how long one bottle lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I used the Skin79 chart (on their website) to choose if I wanted this item (pink) versus the gold version, and that chart led me to believe this would better suit my skin. However, I wish I had gotten the gold, as it is not supposed to be as drying as the pink (found that out from blog entries and reviews after purchasing this--d&#x27;oh!). I used a light moisturizer on my face before applying this the first time (just Olay&#x27;s sensitive skin lotion), and within an hour, the dryness around my nose was driving me crazy! The second time around, I slathered on 2 heavy layers of lotion and made it a solid 5 or 6 hours before I felt that my face was getting too dry. I&#x27;m going to try the Cetaphil cream under this to see if that helps me go the whole day, as that seems to be the gold standard for those with sensitive skin, but who also require a lot of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve read, this pink version is better for those with oily skin. It is also slightly thicker and has a bit better coverage, so if you&#x27;re on the fence between pink and gold, and are looking for something a bit more heavy-duty, maybe this is better for you than the gold. However, if your skin is dry, go for the gold my friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to point out that my skin has become unbelievably sensitive over the last few months and this somehow does not irritate my skin. Even the Neutrogena sensitive skin lotion did not play well with my face, and this has caused no issues (except a bit of dryness) aftera week of use. If the Cetaphil heavy-duty stuff does not moisturize enough for me to use the Pink version (since I already paid for it), I&#x27;ll switch over to the Gold and hopefully have the same experience, minus the dryness. But so far, I LOVE this product, and I hardly ever say that about beauty stuff! The number one benefit is evening out the redness on my cheeks and it does that SO WELL without looking like I have anything on my face. It&#x27;s like your own skin, but better!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I usually use this or the Gold ( which is a bit more heavy, and not quite as pale ), and I refuse to buy anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was prompt, and product was packaged nicely. By far the best BB cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Not so great for me personally because of the color. It&#x27;s greyish. It has good coverage, pretty thick. Maybe I can use it to highlight and conceal but I&#x27;ll have to go over it when something else to match my skintone.</li>
            <li> Skin 79 has the best BB Creams. I&#x27;ve purchased this one as well as the Gold VIP. This one I use in the summer when my skin is more oilier and use the Gold VIP in the winter when I need a little more moisturizing. This seller prices are very good and the shipment was fast and packaging was very good.</li>
            <li> The listing didn&#x27;t have a clear description on what skin color / complexion this would work on. I have a tan, brown skin and this product really makes my face look white alone. I have to apply my darker shade of powder in order to even it out. So my make up still feels heavy. And the purpose of this was supposed to be good by itself. Sadly, not for darker skin complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also made my skin break out easily. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and within days, my acne started getting worst. And yes, I am very angry about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;d suggest using those you see at the store; such as garnier, neutrogena type of BB cream. Since they are known branded, you can feel more safe using them.</li>
            <li> it gave ok coverage but broke me out SOOO bad, it took me 2 months to get my skin back under control. I only used this for 1 week! So unless you have the best skin ever that is not the slightest bit acne prone, you won&#x27;t be happy. Fair warning!</li>
            <li> Great stuff but only for light to very light skin types. Worldbuy365 sells legit skin 79 products no fake order from them!</li>
            <li> I have only used it for 1 week so I havent seen the results yet. I leaves my skin super soft so far.</li>
            <li> Product special and beautiful, and works well with the natural skin has no effect&lt;br /&gt;Easily absorbed by the body.&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product because of the good reviews it has. I never wore a foundation but always wanted to atleast cover up some of my acne scar and I also have oily skin on my t-zone and i thought this would cover the shine. So when i got it, i looked for the sticker in the back, but it did not have it so it came accross my mind, it was fake.. But since im so into it and really wanted it, i tried it on my skin. 2 days after using it, I started breaking out which is weird.. Like all over my face has a tiny pimples and theyre so red and its just disgusting.. So I decided not to use it anymore. Now im sure the product is fake, also I found out it was expired which really pissed me off. dont get it from this seller &amp;#34;KATIE THE BABE&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is a Great item  ~~~i like it very much. It is better than any BB cream I have ever use.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get a package from korea but then i tried the product it was very irritating to the skin</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream! It has replaced my need for heavy and fake looking foundations and feels light and airy. It stays on all day, even when I sweat a bit, and makes my skin look awesome. It covers really well and it matches any skin tone. I love it!</li>
            <li> Wow! I have severely dry/flakey skin and this is the ONLY CREAM I CAN USE. I have eczema and just generally red angry rashy skin even when taken care of and pampered it&#x27;s not friendly to makeup and after a few hours will look cakey and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with this.. My makeup looks flawless for hours!! I can tell it really moisturizes my skin as well! Amazzzinggg.</li>
            <li> I bought this not realizing it was being shipped from China.  I am 99% sure this is a fake but a good fake, the box and the container look real the only thing was there was a tiny misspelling on the box.  But I have used it and it does work like it&#x27;s suppose to and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or rash.  So if you want to buy a good knockoff then buy this one but realize it&#x27;s not the really thing.</li>
            <li> Goes great with my skin tone (beige/medium) and it is light weight. Hides my acne scars and redness very well. Just spot treat a few stubborn areas with coverup if need be.</li>
            <li> Works better for fair skin. My skin was a little tan and after putting this on I looked a bit pale</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged and truly like the product very much, this is my second order and won&#x27;t be my last.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, well done!</li>
            <li> OMG, I have been using this fabulous product for three days and am PRAYING that it will not make my skin break out! I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like the immediate change in the look and feel of my skin, and I must have tried hundreds of skincare products during my 68 years. I was considering a facelift, but now I may not need one! I&#x27;m at the age where they say less is more as far as foundation; this BB cream gives perfect, undetectable coverage. I am rather fair, and have not had any difficulty with the cream being too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a problem finding the right colored makeup, as my skin tone is between pink and beige. Usually I have to mix two colors together. Being able to buy one product at a reasonable price will save me a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate all the reviews, which helped me make the decision to try the SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream (Pink Label).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 28, 2013 Update&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this product for over a month, and love it. However, I have had several cystic bumps during this time, which I haven&#x27;t had in a long time. I am not sure the BB Cream was the reason, but since switching to every other day or so have had no further breakouts. Also use Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Moisturizer underneath the BB Cream sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a second BB Cream directly from the Skin79 site to compare this product to that; I am convinced the discounted product is authentic.</li>
            <li> I got this product and I am really disappointed. because it&#x27;s fake!!!!!!!!! The real one shouldn&#x27;t smell like this, it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> I got this cream because I saw good reviews and the website claimed that they were the top selling original BB Cream. When I received it, I noticed that the word \\&quot;beblish\\&quot; balm was not just a typo on the ad but was printed on the product as well. Made up word. Whatever. The color of the cream itself looked grayish, but I still tried to make it work. On my face, the gray hue made me look like I came back from the dead. I usually wear the shade Light for Bare Minerals. The cream feels soft on the skin, no complaints there.  Just the color.  I tried it twice just to give it a second chance. Same results. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a cream to wear underneath make up, just something I can put on and leave the house on errand days. So, I will not be keeping this product. I&#x27;ve purchased the Dior Hydra BB Cream instead, which is 3-4 times the cost but gives me a warmer glow and feels great on my skin. The one-shade-fits-most color is a bit darker than my skin, but I blend a little into my neck and it works.</li>
            <li> Hi! Loving this BB cream. I put a light film of it all over my complexion and allow to dry a moment, then add a light finish of my regular foundation. Somehow my skin looks &#x27;perfected&#x27;...&#x27;no pores mom&#x27;! Gorgeous skins could wear it alone. I need a little more coverage. Overall, am pleased with product, purchase, and delivery.Wii order more. Thanks!*****</li>
            <li> so far i love this bb cream i been using since i got it and i got to say it dose wonders for your skin each time i put it on my skin feels so soft and clean and you only need one or two pumps to cover your whole face (less is more) the only down side and the reason i gave this bb cream a 4 is it take awhile for it to change into your skin tone (20 min tops) and makes you look a one shade lighter but so far i think that the only bad side to it shipping was fast and and this bb cream didn&#x27;t cost that much i would recommend this to my family and friends and it worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> I got this product back in May (it is now just before Christmas) and I love it. It provides good coverage, makes your skin tone look even, matches my skin tone, and it has even improved my overall skin tone. The last part doesn&#x27;t happen instantly but I&#x27;ve seen gradual improvement over the time I&#x27;ve been using it, which blows my mind. My skin is oily and I am prone to breakouts and I have had no breakouts due to this BB cream, which is a major plus considering the trials I&#x27;ve had trying to find a product that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. Though you can&#x27;t see how much is left, I still haven&#x27;t run out of my initial can even with daily use, so I&#x27;d say it probably lasts about 8-9 months. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this and decided to try it. I normally use two different primers then my foundation and now I just use this I haven&#x27;t touched my other products this stuff gives my face a nice smooth finish and highlights it nicely. I&#x27;ve seen improvements in my skin which is a nice plus! You don&#x27;t have to use a lot little bit goes a long way especially if you buy one of those nice tear drop pink sponges that can be wet lol I would recommend that with this :) You will love this if you give it a try. Also came with two samples of their other products Love the orange one I think when this one is finished I&#x27;ll go to that one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  It conditions my skin and covers up blemishes well.  Every time I order, I get free samples too (great for traveling!).  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you can&#x27;t tell when you&#x27;re running out.</li>
            <li> it creates healthy looking skin, covers the blemishes in a natural way, the seller is very thoughtful, I love the little card you sent me. Thank you~</li>
            <li> it leaves the face loking like porceline is really amazing; it givs a soft look to the face more glowing</li>
            <li> This bb cream is easy to apply, non sticky. Does not feel too heavy on my skin. Could last for one day. The smell is good as well.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use and the gray color will blend with the skin so don&#x27;t worry. And thanks for the free sample</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery!  The product is just as,good,as,the ones I paid almost double the price. It goes on smoothly and covers the flaws.</li>
            <li> I researched BB creams heavily before buying this product. When it finally arrived I was pretty excited to try it. I applied at and waited and waited for it to fade and blend into my skin color. Sadly it only blended a little bit. It&#x27;s pretty light, and i had hoped it would darken to my skin color. I&#x27;m not fair, but im not dark tanned either, I&#x27;m a steady medium skin tone. I looked like a vampire:/ I also thought the oiliness would go away too, even after I applied powder, an hour later the oiliness came back. All in all i wouldnt buy this again:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months now, and I&#x27;m quite impressed with it. I have oily skin, light-medium with olive undertones. It&#x27;s been decent with oil control, better than anything I&#x27;ve used previously. The product has nice coverage, without feeling heavy. I feel like my skin just looks natural and healthy with this BB cream on. The packaging is great; it has a pump so you&#x27;re not sticking your hands into it and you can easily control how much you want to get out. The color is fairly light though. It&#x27;s a little light for my skin at the moment, but not so much to be noticeable to anyone but myself (I hope!). I think it should be an even better match in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product won&#x27;t work if your skin is dark or a darker medium. It&#x27;s just going to be too light. Also, it is a little grayish. It works well for me but it certainly might worry someone with different toned skin. And finally, don&#x27;t expect this to cover like a foundation would. It does provide coverage, but it is a BB cream and won&#x27;t fix everything.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! I love this product -I always have one for reserve. I am a brunnete with beige - ginger type of skin - (not asia), at first when I put in my face looks very white, but then blends in. It is of light  consistency.....just perfect, I apply before my full foundation (mac). You really just have to use a little bit...last about 2 months with daily use. Worth a try ;)&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
            <li> All ladies have their beauty products they can&#x27;t live without. This cream is one of mine. I have a fair complexion with pink undertones. This cream gives me the coverage I love with using very little. It goes on smooth and covers any imperfections I may have. I&#x27;m done with trying other \\&quot;foundations\\&quot;. Why mess with perfection?</li>
            <li> This product is amazing i am a little medium dark skin and it worked with my skin complection I would recommend this product for anyone that is debating in buying it. I did do ALOT of research before buying and found that alot of sellers were selling Fake SKin79 products. Thankfully KATIE THE BABE did not dissapoint! I compared my product and I have an authentic Skin79 BB Cream. I would Recommend anyone to buy from seller KATIE THE BABE! Did i mention the shipping was awesome... I ordered my product 08/01 and they already had it shipped by 08/03!!! I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I love the idea of BB creams and own many cult favorite asian BB creams. However, I have to say this is my least favorite. The finish is satin and only within an hour my t-zone is more oilier than normal. Not to mention, this BB cream color is quite grey even on my NC 20 (MAC shades) skin AND the coverage is light to barely non-existent (fades within an hour or so)if anything I feel like it doesn&#x27;t even cover, it just leaves an white/grey cast on the face. Also, I did not experience any enchancments on my skin like the BB cream claims. I do not recommend for those who have imperfections + combination/oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m leaving two stars for the use of a sun screen/foundation primer and also it did not break me out.</li>
            <li> I do have two bottles of expensive and good coverage foundations and I know thatsome friends criticize a lot about BB cream cause it seems that is one kind of so-so foundation but not easy to remove. However, I prefer the natural look that BB cream gives so I don&#x27;s need to worry about having eyeliners, shadows or other heavy make-ups after I put it on.its coverage effect is not good as other foundations to be frank.I am Asian and I just know the color is right for me but it may not work for everyone so be careful about it. I may want to try the golden one with lighter color next time.</li>
            <li> I am asian and it is lighter than my skin a little bit (I also applied a darker one on top of it to make my skin look natural). it feel good when I put it on my face (it is not heavy or oil).&lt;br /&gt;I use it for summer.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream..I&#x27;m hispanic and on the tan side and this bb cream blends right in! Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I really liked this and I don&#x27;t use make-up too often. It sets really well on the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or like there&#x27;s a film on my face. It helps to cover up blemishes and any problems that I have with my skin.</li>
            <li> i use a brush to put it on my face, but i think this is a little oily for me &#x27;cuz my skin is very easy to get oily.</li>
            <li> Too white for my skin; I only used it once. I&#x27;m around NC 25-30. And this makes me look like a ghost; maybe it&#x27;s because of the gray cast due to SPF. It&#x27;s a good bb cream though.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying BB cream and I have no complains as far as the quality of the cream itself.&lt;br /&gt;Did not get a skin breakout with some other makeup products, the color was okay for my light beige skin (yellow undertone).&lt;br /&gt;It looks good just by itself, but sometimes I touch up with foundation if I am out on a date or at night.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the container/dispenser doesn&#x27;t help keeping my makeup bag clean, the liquid kind of leaks out a little even if I wipe it off after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s perfect and for the price, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I GAVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE IT DOESN&#x27;T MATCH MY SKIN TONE. IT&#x27;S FINE THOUGH, SOMEBODY MAY BE ABLE TO HAVE IT AND USE IT.</li>
            <li> My first impressions were: FUN PACKAGING! I love the sanitary pump. I use half a pump and pat it on, it goes on so creamy and matte that I don&#x27;t even need powder. I have light/olive skin tone and with a high oil volume in the tzone with dry cheeks. I use proactive for acne prevention and I was kinda scared to try a new BB cream. But i am a true believer now! I wear Skin79 BB Cream everyday and one bottle lasted about 4months. When it got low I took a tip I learned from another reviewer and popped the pump open and used a q-tip to scoop out the inner tube while I waited for my new one to arrive. Any time I had a friend over I would brag and give out samples. I love it so much I even offer to buy their bottle from them if they don&#x27;t like it! I haven&#x27;t had any complaints and so far 3 of my friends have switched. This BB cream is matte with a fresh dew though out the day and easy to wash off at night. It has a very very light flowery powder smell that dissipates. Ive heard other reviews make note about the &#x27;gray&#x27; tint when they first apply, I would suggest that you continue patting it around your face to redistribute. Maybe it is just thick in that area. Give it a few minutes to &#x27;settle&#x27; in and voila!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this BB cream. After my first and only use of it I broke out in a rash on my face. I do not have any allergies that I am aware of, but something in this cream did not agree with my skin. Also, the only day that I wore it I found it left my skin very oily and shiny. The color seemed spot on, which is the only positive statement I can make. It&#x27;s a shame, because an all in one cream would have been so nice.</li>
            <li> I am 41 and I have rosacea and fair skin. I am allergic/sensitive to so much and foundation sometimes makes my face burn.  But SKIN79 (hot pink) has been so awesome for my skin.  My husband commented that my skin looks so much more natural when I wear this instead of foundation.  I just ordered more from Kate the Babe because I would hate to run out of it.  If I am going out for an event sometimes I wear Physician&#x27;s Formula Conceal RX underneath on my cheeks but for the most part I wear Skin79 BB Cream and get nice smooth, build-able coverage....love, love, love this stuff! It feels so light and wonderful!</li>
            <li> I did the research on BB cream, and decided to go with this one for my first try. It goes on well, and fades to a nice, evening, correcting color in about 5 minutes. I put a little finishing powder over it, and my skin looks awesome. It creates a nice, natural look with hardly any effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to cause pimples, even washed off. That&#x27;s the only reason I took a star off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gray when it pumps out, but it oxidizes to a more natural color. The SPF in it is nice.. I liked it enough to use it all. Texture is great. I&#x27;d rather use something that has a greater shade range.</li>
            <li> Looked worse having it on than I did prior to putting anything on my face. It didn&#x27;t cover much at all, if anything, yet it left a gray cast on my face. It quickly turned slick and oily, within 2 hours of wear, even when having powder on top. No thanks, I&#x27;ll stick to my Dior Nude Skin or Clinique BB creams... They may be double the price, but they do ten times the work.</li>
            <li> i love this foundation, it goes on smoothly. it doesnt look cakeky or anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,i recommend this product to anyone ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> After coming upon this product and reading the reviews I decided to try it. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now and have used it everyday and I simply love it. I have a very pale skin tone and combination skin yet it blends in perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leave a cakey finish like most others I have tired. Also you do not need to use very much of it for it to cover all of your face. I will most definitely keep buying this product!</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and I can thank this product for contributing to that. I use it all the time and nearly every day for more than a year. The results are lighter and clearer skin with less acne all around. I hope one day that they make a product like this for darker skin. This product is the real deal by the way. I only recently learned there are fake SKIN79 bottles floating around (scary) but the one I received was authentic and had the official sticker on it. There&#x27;s resources on how to spot fake brands out there if you search.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest BB cream I&#x27;ve ever had. The coverage is flawless and it&#x27;s improved my skin, which is really cool. And it looks beautiful on, too! It makes my skin look like porcelain. I&#x27;ll definitely be coming back to this.</li>
            <li> What I love is the easy application and nice coverage.  It can look a little ashy but I put a little powder over it and than it looks really fresh.</li>
            <li> This product really blends well on my skin. No negative reactions etc... I need to purchase some more soon :-)</li>
            <li> Love this beauty balm.  I am Asian with a &amp;#34;pale ish&amp;#34; complexion.  I tan during the summer, so I end up using this only during the winter months as there is a lightening effect to your skin.  I wear this over a light moisturizer, and it instantly improves my complexion (dark spots, blemishes).  My face looks fresh and natural.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> This BB cream is definitely the best product for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have a fair skin with not that many problems, i mean acne. But i felt like i can&#x27;t put the foundation on my skin every single day, because i noticed it&#x27;s making my face worse. And i&#x27;ve been using a different cream which has not impressed me enough to buy it again (to be honest i didn&#x27;t even finished it). And, oh God, i discovered SKIN79 and fell for it hard. I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 months now and seriously i&#x27;m the happiest person in the World without necessity to put the ton of the makeup product in my face.&lt;br /&gt;It does moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, i have redness on my cheeks, and it hides it, not completely (cuz this is not the foundation), but it does.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB Cream and it works really well. Would like to try the others by this brand.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this BB cream, I like the smell of it and the color matches perfectly with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I bought this bb cream mainly because I read so many good reviews.  This product was a bit too oily for me and the color is a couple shades lighter than my skin.  I stopped using it after I realized that I&#x27;d break out each time I used it.  By the way, this seller is awesome!  The product arrived 2 weeks earlier than the scheduled date!</li>
            <li> First off, the packaging was damaged (crushed box) when I got it and the product had a weird chemical smell. It&#x27;s definitely too light for my skin complexion and it didn&#x27;t look good... I look sick when I put this on. Gross! Definitely not what I expected and I watched several YouTube reviews/random blogs about this before I ordered it. Very disappointing! I contacted the seller and I&#x27;m hoping to get a refund. I&#x27;m going back to Sephora &amp; picking up Laura Mercier&#x27;s tinted  moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I feel like this BB was not as moisturizing as some of my previous ones, but was still really good, highly protective and lasted longer then all the other ones i have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve researched BB creams for along time, and i&#x27;ve bought real ones.. First of all the shipper is SO fast, and the packages were perfect and this is 100% REAL, the comments that say \\&quot;fake,fake\\&quot; are probably people trying to get you to purchase their over priced BB creams, this has the seal of authenticity and Korean barcode&#x27;s, when you get yours google pictures of fakes and you can OBVIOUSLY SEE, this is real..especially from the texture...I also go free Misha samples...LOVE this seller &amp;lt;3 will be buying from them soon!</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I have used this brand of makeup, but I knew something was off from the moment I first put it on. It wasn&#x27;t creamy like the bottles I received in the past, and the makeup didn&#x27;t look as good. Then, the bottle ran out very quickly. Curious as I am, I open the bottle (not an easy feat) only to find that there is definitely NOT 40 g in the container. Within the pink outer shell is a smaller white container (not unusual for makeup), but what shocked me is that within the white container there was a small 1-inch container where the makeup is actually held. Of that 1-inch container, the only makeup that could fit would be what could fit around the inserted pump. AWFUL!</li>
            <li> love this b b cream. it&#x27;s perfect.  Easy to apply and it never causes breakouts.  Coverage is great, it goes on a little grey at first, but then it blends to your skin.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOve it.  I really love this product and feel pretty on my face. I would continued used this product again. hAPPY</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin. I go off my daily care routine for a day and my face breaks out terribly. I was skeptical to try ANY coverage but this was recommended to me by a Korean friend and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! It covers to make a noticeable but natural difference. I can use it daily and not have a single break-out. :D Plus I work in the sun all day and the sunscreen aspect is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> I choose this product because I&#x27;d heard really great things about it. It took me almost a year to finish one package, as the amount needed was fairly small. It&#x27;s a nicely build-able product, and has great coverage for a bb cream! It was smooth and didn&#x27;t break me out. I ordered from Pink Gelee, and got a sample as well as a sweet note. It got to me a lot faster than expected! It was well within the Amazon ordering estimate. :) I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Great coverage, but still looks natural. It does go on a bit gray, but it oxidizes and matches my skin perfectly. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin since I started using this product. Also, a little goes a long way (I don&#x27;t even need a full pump!) so I imagine this will last a long time. Great packaging too.</li>
            <li> Like this better than most bb creams but would like a little more coverage but is better than foundation will buy again</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying my skin color is tan and the bb cream doesn&#x27;t match my color but I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and my face has shown improvement already.  I was having several breakouts that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of not matter what I used or tried.  So I started using the bb cream and it dried out my breakouts and lightened up the dark spots on my face.  I wear this bb cream most when I&#x27;m inside because it makes me look like a ghost.  I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it didn&#x27;t match my skin color, but I will buy this forever!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased my amazing BB cream from Think Pretty and after research, figured out that the BB cream they sell is indeed legit.  Look for a tampering label from Skin79 and perforated edges on the box.  If you go to Skin79&#x27;s website, they&#x27;ll show you tips on how to spot an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, on to the product.  let&#x27;s just say that I have no idea what i&#x27;m going to do with all my other foundation.  This stuff is amazing!!  It has a great velvety thick texture that blends and covers very easily without looking caked on or flaked.  My skin tends to be flakey sometimes, especially after getting a chemical peel.  This product moisturizes so well that my flakes are gone.  I am also acne prone and this does not break me out.  I am a little confused about the color though.  On my hand, it didn&#x27;t look like it would match my skin color but somehow it blends and perfectly matches my skin color... The only logical conclusion is that it&#x27;s Korean magic.  If you&#x27;re ok with using magical products, then definitely buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slightly strong fragrance that reminds me of expensive creams from Lancome. I like it and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong personally but a word of caution to those who are more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely worth the hype.  Just buy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the color, it didn&#x27;t improve my skin color, but I do still use it for some reasons.</li>
            <li> This product is one in a million! Within weeks of starting to use it, my pores appear much smaller, my skin looks clearer overall, and my pesky acne scars are even starting to fade a bit. I had almost given up on foundation, since it clogs my pores, and I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found something so much better. It goes on like moisturizer, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, even if I accidentally leave it on over night. I love love love it!</li>
            <li> This has really nice coverage. I put it on in the morning and it&#x27;s basically the only thing I put on besides mascara. It has cut my time getting ready in the morning significantly. My skin tone had also evened out. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I watched several reviews on Youtube, and decided to give it a try.  I mix this product with my regular moisturizer before applying my foundation and it makes my skin so soft and smooth! My foundation lasts longer and the BB cream also helps it cover. I am very happy with the price and the product!</li>
            <li> So this is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased and although I don&#x27;t have any other BB creams to compare it with, I gave it 4 stars.  The cream was a lot lighter in pigment than I had expected and it takes a bit before settling in and matching with the rest of my skin tone.  I&#x27;m Korean, so I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned too, but it was a little lighter than I had expected. I presume it is because of the SPF 25 - which i love. I play tennis outdoors and the BB cream, with its SPF provides good coverage and i didn&#x27;t get sunburned even after four hours of playing in the sun.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good product with smooth application and pretty good coverage.  Just beware if you have a darker skintone because the BB cream is pretty white and may not match your skin color.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite BB creams to date. This BB cream can be intimidating to some people, but this particular one is great for anyone, especially for new BB cream users. This one looks particularly gray, but like every BB cream, it will adjust. I have read a lot of reviews about how the color adjusts after an hour, but those people are tripping. I timed it, and it adjusts WITHIN 15 minutes. This cream has a lovely light floral scent. It feels very light and offers a light to medium coverage, whereas usually BB creams offer medium to heavy coverage. This one doesn&#x27;t really have great buildable coverage like typical foundations and other BB creams - it&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re wearing a gray mask if you attempt a second application. If you&#x27;re afraid of the gray tone or find this BB cream too light even after waiting for it to adjust, mix in a dab of foundation or concealer that is a shade or two darker than your own. I use NC25 in MAC, Bisque in Laura Mercier (tinted moisturizer), Golden Medium in Bare Escentuals, and L3 in Smashbox, I40 in Shiseido, and Ivory in Hourglass (tinted moisturizer) and this BB cream is slightly lighter for me during the summer. I definitely do not recommend this one for anyone with oily skin, because even on my combination skin my face sometimes feels oily after a long day. No matter your skin type, always use moisturizer before you apply BB cream. Overall, this is a nice BB cream, most fit for BB cream newbies.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream. It goes on smooth and even. I have oily skin and it works just great. Doesnt make me feel like im wearing a mask. Seller was very quick with my order.</li>
            <li> Prior to discovering this product, I was wearing L&#x27;oreal Bare Naturale mineral foundation, because liquid foundation always made my skin more oily and acne-prone. I decided to try this on a whim, and since, I&#x27;ve thrown out every other foundation in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m generally pale (mostly Anglo-Irish descent, with a small amount of Native American thrown in), and was worried when I read reviews that said it was grayish, but this product suits me perfectly! I have no problems with it muddying my skin tone, and since I started using it, my skin is healthier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love it!</li>
            <li> For those of us who have tan skin, a BB cream may seem like an iffy makeup product, but this particular BB cream seems to oxidize to fit just about any ivory fair to caramel tan skin tone. My mom who is very fair, my sister who is toasty colored, my aunt who is sienna, and my very tan self all get full coverage from this product. The product after initial application is greyish and oxides to match the color of skin in minutes. I apply this product for special occasions and outings and it makes me feel so confident. I use a kabuki brush to get an even and complete coverage. It works well for people of all ages (so it seems). All I can say is: will buy more.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this Skin 79 BB Cream because I didn&#x27;t know how it would match up with my fair skin.  I was also worried about whether it was the fake BB cream, or the real one.  I had watched and read many other reviews about this product, and just like everyone else,and I am highly satisfied.  This is the REAL BB cream, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER.  They sent my product the day I ordered it.  And, it came 2 1/2 weeks BEFORE my scheduled arrival date. Once I run out, I will be buying more! It goes on my face nicely, and blends into a smooth and flawless finish with amazing coverage.  If you have fair skin, and have trouble finding a makeup to accentuate your skin, you need to get this... and it doesn&#x27;t smell like other makeups either. I also like this because it is a concealer/moisturizer/liquid foundation/SPF all in one. Get this product! Oh, and just to let you know, I am not getting paid to do this review.  Everything I say is my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to buy this product after I&#x27;ve read all the positive reviews here.I bought this a month ago and was very impressed for the fast shipping!they also included some VIP sample..I&#x27;m gonna buy the gold one in the future.. so thanks pink gelee!!I&#x27;ve been using tinted moisturizer before i got this bb cream, and now I am happy to found this one.No more tinted moisturizer for me!although It&#x27;s almost a tinted moisturizer but this one has a triple functions which i really like..how ever i rated this 4 because sometimes it doesn&#x27;t look natural under fluorescent lighting and in flash photos.. I&#x27;m gonna try this together with neautragena healthy skin foundation as what I&#x27;ve seen on youtube\\&quot;frmheadtotoe&#x27;s channel..It might works pretty good on my face too!  pros:Light coverage    Easy to use    leaves skin smooth    doesn&#x27;t break me out  cons:It looks unnatural sometimes</li>
            <li> I received my BB cream right before I was headed out for vacation. While I was there, I realized that I could easily scratch off the lettering on the front, and that it wasn&#x27;t the REAL Skin79 product.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it a 1 star rating, is because whatever product this was laid really nicely on my skin. Good skin cover up, but made me break out like crazy!</li>
            <li> This is second time to buy this product. Nice price but it works, My skin looks gorgeous.  I like it!</li>
            <li> My order says it was from BB Cosmetic and fulfilled by Amazon. I loved this BB cream and used up my entire bottle, my skin has never looked better. It&#x27;s natural looking with enough coverage for hiding redness. I ordered a new bottle from BB Cosmetic when my ran out. I used this new bottle for a couple weeks when I started breaking out. It also seemed to come off throughout the day and made my skin look oily unlike the first bottle. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it and just though I need to cleanse my face more. Now after I&#x27;ve been doing some research on skin care, it hit me that maybe I&#x27;m not using the same product as before. Well low and behold I looked up on this website [...] that went over telling a real from a fake bottle. I kept my old bottle and compared with this new one and the new one does not have an authenticity sticker like my old one and the text spacing is different. So, it&#x27;s a great product if you get the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;ve been reading that the new bottles manufactured in 2013 will no longer have the sticker. I don&#x27;t know if mine is real or fake but the product seems different from first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd Edit: Ok, I ordered another bottle on Oct 16, 2013 from Letif Beauty with fulfillment by Amazon. This bottle was manufactured in 2013 and it came WITH an authenticity sticker on the bottle. This one seems just like the first bottle I had and the cream is thicker like the original one. This one seems like the real thing.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my daily routine so much easier with beautiful results. I love the coverage (light yet complete)&lt;br /&gt;Great price for an excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is the exact product I needed. Non greasy, and I really like using this product. I bought two and gave one to a friend. I use it every day and mine is almost out. I hope the price doesnt go up!</li>
            <li> I used to use foundations from MAC, but recently this past year, I have switched to Make Up For Ever&#x27;s Mat Velvet+ and also use Revlon PhotoReady. I have slightly combination skin with a mildly oily T-zone. I&#x27;ve grown up with acne in the past so I do have a lot of acne scars, and my cheeks have an orange-peel texture because of using BP for a long time. Anyways, I really didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to go out and make a $34 purchase at Sephora for another bottle of foundation (since my current Mat Velvet+ is kinda running out), so I talked to my friend who has been a BB cream user for the past couple of years. She recommend me to the Skin79 Super+. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting a full-coverage \\&quot;foundation\\&quot;, but the idea of seeing smaller pores and (apparently) scars healing made me jump at the purchase.  Today is my first day wearing it. I didn&#x27;t even need to use a full pump, and it covered my whole face nicely. I did apply it with my Sigma F82, and my face looked flawless. My pores look significantly smaller, my face isn&#x27;t oily, and the redness on my cheeks are gone! This product matched my tanned, Asian skin (I think I was a NW25) tone very well, and I don&#x27;t look like a geisha lol. Definitely recommend this for those that want to simplify their makeup regime and have skin discolorations. It is a fraction of the price of getting a MUFE foundation!</li>
            <li> I usually have somewhat dry skin in the winter and this product doesnot work for me. It would dry out my skin even after i moisturize my skin very well already. Maybe it would work better in the summer time. I have tried the clinnique&#x27;s bb cream and i think it works a little better than this one, it doesnot dry out my skin and gives more coverage. I am waiting to try the gold vip bb cream from skin79, hope it works better!</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a couple days now, but I sure do love it. At first the consistency seems a little thick and dense but after it&#x27;s been on your face for awhile you sort of forget it&#x27;s there. The coverage is also very nice, I&#x27;m extremely pleased. I will definately buy this BB Cream again soon!</li>
            <li> This was one of the best BB cream products that I have used. The coverage is fantastic and I saw a noticeable difference in my skin tone. The only problem was, I only had enough cream for 2 WEEKS!!!! It ran out!!!!! I am very disappointed with the amount of cream in one bottle....I thought it would last me months! I used the recommended amount and everything, yet I still ran out! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: GREAT COVERAGE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NOT ENOUGH CREAM FOR EVEN 2 WEEKS!!!!</li>
            <li> I received my Skin79 Triple Function BB Cream days earlier than expected, which was a surprise since the Vendor did not charge shipping.  I opened my package and found the product not only well packaged, but a generous size as well.  Further, included in the package were free samples of other types of BB Cream which I look forward to trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, SKIN79 Super+ appeared way too light when first applying it to my face; however, it blended into my skin well and looks more natural on my face than my usual foundation.  The product is rich and does not require a great deal to cover well.  When I removed the product, my skin felt smoother and healthier; however, it is too soon to perceive any definitive changes to my skin.  Despite needing to wait to find out if there is any actual change to the texture and tone of my skin, I am happy to use this product as a healthier replacement for my foundation and am looking forward to seeing more changes as I continue to wear Skin79.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must give this product a good review based on not only the feel of the product, the packaging, but also the care of the vendor in their quick shipment and extra bonus of samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to try BB Cream - you want to try this one.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase again because the color is too light. I wear a MAC studio fix NC30-35 or Estee Lauder Intensity 2.0. i would consider my skin color to be medium. When i apply this i get the \\&quot;white\\&quot; clown look. this does not fade. My face is white the entire day. I must add a foundation on top that is darker than my normal skin color to cover up this whiteness. I also seal it with a darker powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Great application consistency, feels nice&lt;br /&gt;Medium coverage&lt;br /&gt;SPF 25&lt;br /&gt;Matte Finish, non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;Fast Deliver from Seller Pink Gelee, arrived in 4 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Too light or white for my asian skin&lt;br /&gt;expensive for only 40 grams of product&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t confirm that the product is expired or authentic</li>
            <li> Well after reading the reviews I was sure this would do wonders to my skin. I use many products on my skin and hardly ever have a bad reaction so I thought the worst that can happen with this one is that it doesn&#x27;t work miracles. After one week of using it I saw four large bumps on my jawline. After a few days it rose to the surface of my skin- really gross. I don&#x27;t have acne or any horrible skin problems so this was horrifying to me. I started to inspect my skin and also saw I was getting smaller, finer bumps around my nose. I immediately stopped using it and the smaller bumps disappeared but for the 4 bumps on my jawline, it left dark spots on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;For the short time I used it like others said, it went on slightly grey but after a few minutes matched into my skin and looked nice- smooth and clear. But the product is just not for me because my skin had a really bad reaction to it. So when purchasing it remember that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and therefore will have different reactions. Good luck when using this product!</li>
            <li> If I wear this bb cream I have to wear blush or bronzer or else I look like a ghost. I&#x27;m really hoping this will change around the wintertime when I have a little less color in my face, but I am fairly light skinned. It controls oil really well and i think it might work for people with a lighter skin tone than me, I certainly did not notice any oxidation to match my skin color. It was a good purchase, I look fine after I put on a little blush or bronzer, which I usually put on anyway when I wear foundation, but I can&#x27;t certainly leave the house just with it on. It has medium coverage so I have to still use concealer for my dark circles, But it looks more natural than foundation. I will look into other bb creams, maybe the gold version of this or a missha one. But I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Having super oily skin already, when I applied this product over my Cerave moisturizer, it was looking pretty shiny. Then I lightly applied my Tarte amazonian clay finishing powder and, voila! Lightly matted, perfectly matching my skin tone. Looks like me but airbrushed, and it really does keep the shine away for much longer. The more I use this product the more I love it. I am 38 years old with very light fair skin and I can go out in the Arizona sun without worrying about freckles. It&#x27;s that good! Has long staying power too. Highly recommended and have told all my friends about it.</li>
            <li> I really, really, love this product...for many, many reasons...I am 35 years old, Asian with a tan complexion, I am just starting to notice a little bit of wrinkles around my eyes and have notice how much larger my pores have gotten over the past few years.  I also have dark circles around my eyes as well and start to break out with adult acne.  Because of this, I started to use a lot of make up, in my 20&#x27;s I rarely used any makeup and rarely got any pimples.  I used to wear layers of makeup...Make up Forever foundation, Bare Minerals powder, and two different concealers (one for my eyes and one for my acne scars...now I use my BB cream, under eye concealer, and Bare Minerals powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I love this cream:&lt;br /&gt;-Works well with my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;-I have not broke out with acne using this product&lt;br /&gt;-Skin appears smooth and even&lt;br /&gt;-My pores have disappeared&lt;br /&gt;-I no longer have to wear layers of makeup to cover up&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s nice and matte, seems to control my oil even after a long day at work&lt;br /&gt;-It has SPF!!!&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the color, although it provides good coverage, it makes my skin look a little pale...I still apply my bare minerals powder for color as well as a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I bought it from SHOPPER DISCOUNT.I would leave a 0 star if I could. Seller sent me a FAKE skin79 bb cream. I reported seller to AMAZON and SKIN79 for selling fake products. Awful seller. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!! I also bought another one from Korea, the first few uses looked great, but after that, the fake cream came out awful. They mixed the real and fake cream to trick you. Im so tired of waiting for the cream to come and then realize it&#x27;s FAKE. It smells completely different too. From now on, I only order from skin79northamerica. Be careful ladies!</li>
            <li> This is my dads&#x27;s account, so i&#x27;m reviewing this product. I bought this product from a store since i didn&#x27;t want to take the chance of getting a fake. The smell isn&#x27;t so great first off. I got kind of nauseaous just from smelling it. I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;floral scent\\&quot; other people smelled, but to me, it smelled like baby powder.So far,it&#x27;s quality isn&#x27;t bad at all. Sure it goes on weird, but then it oxidizes nicely. I have a yellowish to pale skin tone that sometimes changes to a darker shade. My forehead needs this the most, so i&#x27;ll repost after i do it on my forehead. Hopefully, this&#x27;ll whiten my skin tone since im using a honey and lemon mix every night. it seems to work also. i would highly recommend it. Overall, not bad although i paid a higher price for my authentic bottle.</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a Skin79 Pink gift set.  First off, let me say that I have sensitive skin with a skin tone that is medium with neutral undertones.  I was leery with trying it because it may not match my skin tone.  I tried it on, and like what other reviewers before me mentioned, the cream left a grayish-tint on my skin.  The color eventually faded but you can easily tell that I&#x27;m wearing make-up by how my face is visibly lighter than my neck!  I loved how it gave a matte effect, made my skin soft and had staying power (wore it for full 8 hours for 4days) but the noticeable color difference bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I would like to love this product, it just isn&#x27;t for me.  Maybe I&#x27;ll be lucky with a different Skin79 line.</li>
            <li> I read SO MANY REVIEWS before trying to decide on a BB cream. Some warned of scams, others that this one was great for their combination skin, or better for dry skin, etc. My mom has dry skin and I have combination skin that freaks out during that time of the month, leaving me with red scars and faint spots on my fair skin. She recommended one type, but of course I ordered this one after reading all the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing :( This BB cream did exactly what I was wanting to avoid, it made my skin itch, especially in hot and humid conditions, and the color was just slightly off and didn&#x27;t adapt to my skin color. The worst part, it didn&#x27;t even cover up my blemishes! Even if I tried to apply extra layers, it&#x27;s as if it&#x27;s afraid of spots! My skin, fine wrinkles, breakouts, acne scars and all, basically looked similar to how it does without any makeup. Soooo, I gave in when my mom ordered me her kind - I was afraid it would be too heavy for my skin, making the oily areas oilier. Instead, it covered great, didn&#x27;t itch or make me breakout (which I think the other one may have - it definitely clogged my pores!!), and it moisturized without feeling heavy. I just blot with a tissue sometimes before applying a light layer of powder. I recommend Dr. Jart+ Black Label Detox Healing Blemish Base BB Cream SPF25 PA++ Whitening Anti Wrinkle 1.7oz/50g. At the time I was looking, it was more than double the price, now it&#x27;s very inexpensive and I think way better in terms of coverage and making you look like the examples in the ads!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If lighter (like a tinted moisturizer) coverage is what you&#x27;re going for this may work for you, unfortunately I learned the hard way it doesn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> I heard about BB cream from a friend. There are so much of different brand of BB cream out there. I have no experience of using any of BB cream before. So I decided to do little research of a product online, and read some reviews from other customers through google. Then I decided to purchase my very first BB cream. I chose SKIN79 because it had so many great reviews on internet. When my product arrived I was so excited to tried it on. And I can say I love it! My skin looks so flawless and smooth and it perfects to wear it as it is without to put any other make up on it. The little pink packaging so cute and its great to bring on travel. They are not too big or heavy. Just the right size to put on your purse.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been so much rave lately about BB Cream that I decided that it was time for me to try some. I initially looked at some other kinds, a lot more expensive kinds, but found this and I couldn&#x27;t believe the price, I expected to pay at least double that. Since it is my first BB Cream, I can&#x27;t say if its better than the rest or even better than some, but I&#x27;ve always had oily, yet dry skin on my face, not to mention.. blotchy red spots, especially when I&#x27;m in the sun for any period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream covers all that up though! My husband doesn&#x27;t really like it when I wear any kind of makeup, he says it looks like clay, no matter how little I put on, so I was pleased to hear that this blends into the skin and boy does it. It evens out my skin tone really nicely. I have pretty fair skin and the cream looked so dark, but it blended perfectly AND it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have clay on my face as my husband would put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anything better, but I honestly don&#x27;t see how it could get any better. Awesome price for a great product, I&#x27;m sticking with this!</li>
            <li> This is my new best friend!  I have sun damage (hypo-pigmentation) &amp; in the summer months, it&#x27;s difficult to cover it up because foundation seems to sweat right off.  This product, however, does not.  It&#x27;s absorbed &amp; leaves skin looking even &amp; fresh.  It has a nice tint that gives coverage as well as SPF.  Also, I have acne prone skin &amp; when trying new products, 9 times out of 10, I break out.  I haven&#x27;t broken out once since using this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, Pink Gelee has some FAST shipping. I ordered this on Wednesday, 7/11 and received it today 7/14! Wow. Totally did not expect it in the mail but THANKS FOR THE QUICK SHIP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, once I got it I tried it out. I used my fingers to apply it and I tried patting it but got impatient and just rubbed it on. At first, yes it will look grey and pale but after a few minutes, the cream set into my skin and matched my skin color. It makes my face look brighter and a little lighter but not substantially. I was really wanting a bb cream to even out my skin tone and it did the job! Also after the few minutes of the cream oxidizing or whatever it does :) it really set in my skin and once I felt my face, it didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing anything! I hope this is long lasting throughout the day cause I sweat A LOT and my face gets super oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, awesome product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying the product feels great on my skin, and has a light pleasant scent. I can barely tell there is anything on my face, it doesnt feel oily at all. The coverage is pretty good, I usually only need a little concealer under my eyes. I had been using another brand of BB cream (a drugstore brand, which I hear isnt a \\&quot;real\\&quot; bb cream), but it was too dark for me and my skin felt greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB Cream I purchased had the perforated box, tamper-evident sticker, large pink circle on top of box and 4 diff languages inside, manufacture and expiration dates and just about everything I&#x27;ve read the real package and box should have. The only difference was that it says wrinkle improvement, while the one in the picture on Amazon said wrinkle free. I found out that product for Korean distributors say wrinkle improvement, while for US distributors it says wrinkle free. Also the product for Korean distributors has Korean on outside of package. I saw the word WIZCOZ on bottles so I went to their website and was able to confirm that is the same as the bottle I got. I&#x27;ve heard PinkGelee, Seoulglamour, &amp;neverprice all sell real product, I got mine from Emmas.</li>
            <li> My expectation was higher then usual having seen really good reviews on Amazon for this product. I also heard a lot about BB creams recently so I was curious to try. I tried on sample packets of BB creams from other brands before trying this one. I was a little disappointed at BB creams including this one. It turned out okay, nothing really special. I have pretty good skin so I was not looking for any skin healing effects, just to look better with makeup. Skin 79 color isn&#x27;t that great, a little greyish. It made my face shiny and not really natural looking, like a little heavy and weighted down. I read another reviewer said that it made the skin texture show more, like little bumps appear more instead of disappearing and it was the same for me (bumps like pores and your skin texture, not acne or anything like that). If you like using powder or Bare Minerals, I do not recommend this product as it can look heavy. Anyhow, this review is solely based on the look and not any skin healing effects that it may or may not provide. I&#x27;m a makeup junkie and have tried a ton of products and I wish I could give away my almost new and full bottle of Skin 79 as I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> There are many reviews on here saying it&#x27;s the real thing. There are quite a few which say it&#x27;s fake. The jury is still out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product quickly. Plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, a few things raised a flag with me. 1) box was damaged, but not squished as if from shipping 2) the pump and the nozzle were not sealed 3) slight difference in packaging as compared to the Skin79 site (I know... they change their packaging a lot I&#x27;ve heard, but my bottle and box say \\&quot;wrinkle improvement\\&quot; not \\&quot;wrinkle free\\&quot;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, since the product was not sealed, I am wary of trying it. I have just gone ahead and bought from the Skin79 website. A few more bucks, but this way I know it&#x27;s legit and I know I&#x27;m not at risk for using something that may contain who knows what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fake or not. But I&#x27;m suspicious enough not to try what I received. Buyers, just do your research.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB Cream I tried, it did nothing but make my face slick no coverage at all.</li>
            <li> I got mine from the seller Pink Gelee. I trusted the reviews of it being authentic and they also sent me 2 samples. Shipping was VERY fast! After using it for only 1 week, my skin is softer and more even toned. I&#x27;m very impressed by the product not sticking in the large pores on my nose so no more dots of foundation showing! One metered squirt is more than I need for my entire face so I lightly depress the top button. It&#x27;s grey but after a few minutes, it changes to your skin tone. After wearing Mary Kay&#x27;s Creme to Powder foundation for 14 years, I&#x27;ve switched to this because it&#x27;s much more natural looking, has a high SPF and is good for my skin. Try it and I know you&#x27;ll agree.</li>
            <li> I am warming up to this product. I do not wear it everyday because I do not wear makeup everyday but when I do put this bb cream on it is great coverage. I have been breaking out really bad along my jaw line and it gives these pimples great coverage before I add my foundation. I was a little bit worrired about the whitening but I do not believe it is going to Michael Jackson whiten your face. I have not tried any other BB creams so I cannot compare but this product is also great.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and I&#x27;m in love. The consistency is perfect, medium coverage and SPF too! The shipping was also super fast and arrived exactly as promised. Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, very fair skin that&#x27;s oily in the T-zone and acne-prone. I&#x27;ve had four or five incidents of contact dermatitis in the last six months from makeup and other skin products I&#x27;ve used without problems for five or six years (I&#x27;m 25), so I&#x27;ve been looking very hard for something my sensitive skin can handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is day two of using this BB cream and overall, I have to say I really like it. First, and most importantly, my skin didn&#x27;t react by turning all red, blotchy, and flaky - hurray! It goes on a bit grey, but oxidizes after a few minutes to match my skin color pretty closely. It&#x27;s almost too dark for my skin color, but it&#x27;s not that noticeable unless you&#x27;re specifically looking for it. I used my fingertips to pat it on and had a pretty flawless finish after setting it with a little mineral powder. It&#x27;s very creamy and blends easily. I&#x27;d say the coverage is medium - it covered up dark spots and old acne scars with no trouble at all, but there were a few spots that were still quite obvious. I just dabbed a little more on those spots and they disappeared. I was very impressed that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about blotting until about mid-afternoon, and for the most part the cream stayed on my face and not on the blotting sheets. Not sure how well it would hold up in humid conditions or while sweating, but it&#x27;s perfect for cooler weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because it made me break out a little bit. I&#x27;m going to keep using it for a while because another review I read said that her skin got used to it, but I&#x27;ve developed a few deep, painful pimples around my chin area - the kind that give you a headache. I&#x27;m really hoping my skin will adjust because this product feels AMAZING on my skin and it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve tried in MONTHS that my skin hasn&#x27;t had an immediate negative reaction to. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin, but if you&#x27;re acne-prone you&#x27;ll want to make sure you&#x27;re treating your problem areas with something extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/05/2012: I have given this product three weeks and I&#x27;m sad to say that I&#x27;ll be passing it along to my mom when I go home to visit over Christmas. The breakouts have been terrible, especially around my chin, and they don&#x27;t go away even with multiple acne medications. I&#x27;m rather disappointed because everywhere I DIDN&#x27;T break out, my skin looks fantastic! I had several dark spots from old acne breakouts that have completely disappeared and my skin tone looks much more even. If your skin isn&#x27;t acne-prone like mine, you may be able to use this without trouble.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a week and my skin has def been improving in terms of tone/pore size. My black friend tried this just for fun since we were curious how much it would blend to her skin color. Her skin is fairly dark, and while it definitely didn&#x27;t blend well enough for her to ever use this seriously, it surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> I find of like the finish but be careful about this product , it broke me out like crazy&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin . I&#x27;ve tried a lot of product [ USA and Europe] and never break out&lt;br /&gt;BUT THIS BB CREAM!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this BB cream on July 28, and I received it in the mail yesterday, which was August 1. It took less than a week to arrive! I really liked how they gave a thank you note, along with a hand written &#x27;thank you&#x27; at the bottom; I thought it was very nice. Pink Gelee also gave two samples. When it first arrived, I didn&#x27;t know 40g would be so little. The bottle looked so much bigger in the picture... Haha. But i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, matches my skin tone after application, and helps my skin! I will not go back to another BB cream or other foundations! Plus, it has sun protection!</li>
            <li> Purchased this since it gets such amazing reviews, it was cheap, and I&#x27;d been wanting to dry out these oh-so-amazing BB Creams from Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color matched mostly matched my skin tone, although it made me look slightly paler. Things I did not like about this BB Cream:&lt;br /&gt;1. The cream wouldn&#x27;t absorb into my skin entirely, regardless of what I did. I tried putting it on with nothing underneath, putting it on after putting on a toner, after applying moisturizer, etc. My 24% zinc oxide facial sunscreen absorbs more easily than this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;2. My skin really does not like silicones, and this BB Cream started to irritate my skin after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;3. You need a make up remover to take this off.&lt;br /&gt;4. Fragrance. Again, irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;5. Arbutin. I understand that a lot of Asian skincare products contain arbutin (whitening agent), and that it&#x27;s more natural than hydroquinone, but there&#x27;s that study out there that shows intestinal bacteria transforms arbutin into hydroquinone and I really just want nothing to do with hydroquinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea of a 3-in-one product (moisturizer, foundation, sunscreen), but this BB Cream just did not work with my skin, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Got three different ones past half a year or so, this one is the best of them all - adjusts to skin tone, is not heavy, looks natural, really cool. Got it for my mom too, and she&#x27;s as happy as i am</li>
            <li> I had mixed feelings when I ordered this product; some reviewers said that it gave their faces a gray tint, while others raved about it. I figured for the price I might as well try it. I&#x27;m glad I did because it has turned out to be the best foundation-type product I&#x27;ve used thus far. I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there, but this is working for me. I use it in combination with [[ASIN:B000UVZU1S St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin, 10oz]] and [[ASIN:B0026QPS4E Spring Valley - Biotin 5000 mcg, Super Potency, 120 Softgels]], and ever since I&#x27;ve used these 3 together my skin has never looked better. I have to mention though that for combination-skinned people like myself, a moisturizer really isn&#x27;t necessary under this. It&#x27;s very moisturizing by itself; so much so that after a few hours you have a sheen on your face. That&#x27;s why I use a powder foundation over top of it and I&#x27;m usually good to go.</li>
            <li> Blends in wonderfully with my pale half-Asian skin, evening out my skin tone while looking incredibly natural. I feel it really makes my eyes look bigger by evening out my skin tone. I have heard that the VIP Gold BB cream has more skin-improving qualities, however.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;She told me that  it is done for her exactly what is written in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Good product for a excellent price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Beblesh Balm for about 2 weeks, and am very pleased. I&#x27;ve been looking for a foundation that was not too heavy and would look good all day on combination oily/dry skin. This works perfectly! It&#x27;s moisturizing enough to keep keep dry, flaky skin under control, yet does not look greasy on the oily parts of my face, even after wearing all day. It gives my skin a lovely, dewy finish, and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out. It also feels light, and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve read reviews from users with darker skin tones, and would agree that this product will look best on fair skin. It won&#x27;t cover serious blemishes, but it does even skin tone and offers moderate coverage, even on fairly dark under-eye circles. I wish it was easier to compare the different Beblesh Balms - there seem to be several, but the differences are not clear to me. I got lucky in that this was the first BB I ordered and I am thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, shipping was super fast took only 2 days to arrive (via free super saver). I tried it out and i fell in love, easy application, perfect color for my skin, finish is amazing smooth, stays well on skin. Beautiful and sturdy packaging. Just wish more colors would be availble. Defenatly recomended for people for light skin( since they only have light skin shades)</li>
            <li> I love how well this BB Cream covers my uneven skin tone and leaves my oily skin shine free all day. I am definitely sticking with this one!</li>
            <li> The cream is nice, maybe for younger age 20-25 but I did not work for me!It drys my skin even I have a mixed complexion and it doesn&#x27;t look good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;But it worth to try for this price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but nothing fantastic. It&#x27;s supposed to turn grey and then kind of blend, but I never felt like it blended all that well. I have fair skin (basically not pale and not tan), so I figured this stuff would work well for me with it&#x27;s blending properties (or whatever), but eh not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also left my skin feeling a little oily, which I kind of understand since it has SPF. I used a spray lotion SPF now before I put on my makeup every morning, which doesn&#x27;t get oily and I find works better for me.</li>
            <li> I did look at other videos on the real on VS fake one. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s real. My huge problem and why I rated it so poorly is that it broke me out terribly! All over my forehand and around my lips. It was terrible. DO NOT BUY! I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> My skin look natural and smooth and bright up my face&lt;br /&gt;I love it&lt;br /&gt;now I want to try gold BB cream , what is a Gold ????</li>
            <li> The BB cream works pretty well. It makes my skin look flawless. What I don&#x27;t like about it is that when you put it on your face it turns gray but that disappears in a few minutes. Great scent. The bottle is pretty big, it looks likes it will last for awhile.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the idea that it said whitening.  But it applied so smoothly and it matched my fair skin tone exactly.  I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing anything and it is not greasy like other BB creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just LOVE this BB cream and will purchase it again as soon as I run out.  I have so many regular foundations and theres&#x27;no need to use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution use just a little dab as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my cousin because it was her birthday and when she received it she loved it! She didn&#x27;t know it came with 2 free samples in the package which was a surprise to her and me but other than that, she loves it! :D</li>
            <li> I am a newby when it comes to BB creams, having only discovered these in the past several months. I had been using Boots no 7 creams which I like very much but saw an ad for the Loreal BB cream and thought to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;Although I like the effect of the Loreal, I found that the cream seemed kind of thick and I &#x27;noticed&#x27; it on my skin. I tend to keep my face natural so do not like being able to feel what I have on.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I received the Skin77 Super+ Beblesh Balm and so far am really impressed. Today the weather here in Melbourne is a stifling 37 degrees (98 F) and my skin feels like it did this morning; not clammy or anything. And it is safe for my walk with SPF25.&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of other BB creams coming for my experimentation (Boots Beautiful Skin &amp; Loreal Magic Skin Beautifier) before I settle on a winner!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t dislike this but I guess after reading all the hype about BB creams I was expecting the cure for cancer or something. Which this is most definitely not. It gives ok coverage but at only about the level of a tinted moisturizer so you can still see some pores and bumps on your skin. It does not work well for my eyebags so I still have to use concealer separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like how it evens out my skin tone in a very natural way, however, and its creaminess makes it really easy to apply and spread. I also like its scent. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s improved my complexion as I don&#x27;t see any noticeable changes but it hasn&#x27;t broken me out either. Probably shoulda had more realistic expectations, but I&#x27;ll still keep using this.</li>
            <li> Only complain is it&#x27;s a little dry for me. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very easy to put on, the smell is fantastic, improves skin color immediately.</li>
            <li> I am coming to buy more now, and you can see how much I like it. Got to have it.</li>
            <li> Got here pretty fast in perfect condition. However, the BB cream itself is way too grey for my olive/tan skin tone. I even tried not to rub it in and allowing time so that it can oxidize. But still grey. Although great coverage. It can look a bit ashy.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, a few sun spots and no pimples or visible blemishes or scar that I need to cover up with foundation. I am looking for a product that BB cream claims to provides: nice coverage and even out skin tone and make skin looks radiant.  Between the Gold and the Red bottle, I believe the Gold bottle works best for my skin. It brightens up my skin and I looked radiant. The effect is long lasting well into the evening and my make up stays. I often receive compliments about my skin.  In comparison, the Red bottle BB cream is inadquate for coverage because I didn&#x27;t feel I have it on even I was a bit more heavy handed with it - they say it builds up but it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen to me.  It also melts away quickly in a few hours after application so my make up slides as a result. I don&#x27;t think the Red bottle is good for oily skin at all.  I would recommend you buy a few different ones to try on and compare in order to find the right one that works best for your skin.  We are all different and our skin changes over time too.  I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> Feels awesome going on my skin. Lasts all day long! Covers most imperfections. Looks very natural on my skin (light-medium olive/yellow undertones)</li>
            <li> Bought from the seller PinkGelee&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in about a week or so, an authentic product, not a fake. It matched my skin tone very well. I have about a NC20-25ish face, with combination skin. I&#x27;m still in my troublesome skin years, so it covers up acne scars very well and though with just one layer it doesn&#x27;t fully disguise my acne, it came pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that after a little while there were a few areas on my face that began to peel a little bit, as the BB cream is more drying than I realized. However, this should be easily solved with some strategically applied moisturizer (I wasn&#x27;t using any at the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited as this is my first BB cream and I hate using sunscreen as it feels greasy and breaks me out. Foundation I&#x27;ve also tried before, and it makes me look fake and cakey. I don&#x27;t even need to use powder to set this BB cream necessarily as my skin wasn&#x27;t that oily after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, I really recommend it. I&#x27;d say however if you have skin that&#x27;s any drier than about normal, this isn&#x27;t the right BB cream for you (try something with more moisturizer) as the oil-absorbing properties are quite strong.</li>
            <li> My complexion is caramel , the BB cream that I got was too light for my complexion . I gave it to my friend ,it suits her skin tone better than it did mine ...now she can&#x27;t stop raving how how transformed it makes her feel .Do you have a tone for my complexion 😟</li>
            <li> This product clears my skin up and looks so natural, last all day, and covers imperfections. I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing compares to this product.</li>
            <li> The colour is a little dark for my skin (I&#x27;m super pale) but the application of it is perfect and it covers up what I need to cover up. It&#x27;s silky and smooth. It looks a little grey when you squirt it out, but when you apply it, it blends in to match your skin tone. A little product goes a long way. I will be buying another one when mine runs out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one who was particularly excited for the BB creams in the US. Sunscreen severely burns my face, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to the majority of foundations that are available. The concealer I used prior to using this BB cream even made my face burn from the light spf 15 it contained, so I&#x27;ll admit I was slightly fearful of trying any of them out, including this one. I had recently seen a documentary talking about what&#x27;s perceived as beautiful in different cultures, especially the ones that were particularly contrasting. The documentary briefly brought up the desire for pale preserved skin in most Asian countries as opposed to the desired golden goddess tan desired in the North American countries. I won&#x27;t advocate which I find more attractive, for I do believe that the majority of what we consider beautiful is relative and cultural; but, I will say that I advocate preserving my own skin from sun damage. I might not be the palest, but I&#x27;m Irish, German, and most likely any other Nordic orientation that results in severe sunburn, so the preserved look is a safer option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing the documentary I did some searching for asian skincare products, and I inevitably came upon the Skin79 BB Cream. It was much more popular than I expected, so I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m probably very behind on discovering this product. Anywho, I picked the pink one first because it contained a few more interesting ingredients than the orange and gold versions (in my personal opinion). I was instantly amazed at what it claimed it could do, but skeptical too of course. It was supposed to tighten the skin to eliminate wrinkles, smooth the appearance of the skin over all, and whiten the skin (which made me think of bleach initially but it&#x27;s much less scary than something that intense), all while having a very high spf. Oh, and it&#x27;s a foundation of course. I&#x27;m sure US BB creams have some of the same attributes, but just because of the cultural beauty differences I decided to go with this Korean one first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was astounded at the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people claimed it left a grayish cast, but I must have a grayish face, because it matched my skin color perfectly. I applied it in tiny amounts all over my face like a moisturizer, and unlike most foundations I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;m a serious makeup fanatic) it felt like my skin was light and airy. It didn&#x27;t feel heavy like a foundation at all, but the coverage was undeniable. I have acne and a peach tint to my skin, and instantly my skin tone looked even and flawless. The pimples were still evident, however, but I had expected this. This allowed me to use just a teensy drop of concealer in trouble spots as opposed to all over my face like usual. There was also an almost pearly luminescent quality to the overall look of my skin, which made it look very healthy. I&#x27;m a dancer, and after a 6 hour rehearsal and sweating it did not come off like my other foundations had. Best of all, there was no burning at all! I couldn&#x27;t even smell the sunscreen. All and all, I was an extremely happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to consider: I&#x27;m not incredibly pale, but I am pale enough that this BB cream matched perfectly with my skin, so someone that&#x27;s darker complected or has an olive tone might want to try some of the others that are tinted differently. Wash this off before bed! It will make you break out if you don&#x27;t, so don&#x27;t go straight to bed even if you&#x27;re just rolling in at 1 a.m...I also felt that my skin was tighter and wrinkles elimininated. I am very young however, so I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, and it&#x27;s possible it was simply a placebo effect. Don&#x27;t apply a lot! It doesn&#x27;t take much at all to create the desired effect, and too much will make it seem like it&#x27;s too oily. Applying a little will keep the face hydrated and feeling light as air without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I definitely encourage anyone looking for a BB cream to purchase one from Skin79.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I&#x27;ve helped!ith this Korean one first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was astounded at the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people claimed it left a grayish cast, but I must have a grayish face, because it matched my skin color perfectly.

            <li> I decided to get this product after reading all the good reviews but, was somewhat dissapointed after using it. First of all,I did enjoy the intial look it gave. It covered up alot of my sunspots and some of my lighter freckles and balanced my skintone but, after extended use 5+ hours it started to feel very dry on my face, I do use mositerizer before putting on bb cream. What was most disappointing is that when I removed it I noticed that it caused irritation to my skin, casuing redness on parts of my left cheek especially around my left cheekbone. Would be a very good product for me if it were not for the dryness and redness it caused.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product itself would be perfect for people who aren&#x27;t allergic to talc. I wish I would have looked at the ingredients first. I wore it and it broke me out the very next day. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be for oily skin, either. It made me way more oily than usual.</li>
            <li> This feels great on my skin!  It has more benefits than foundation.  I had researched bb creams before buying this one and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It covers my imperfections and it looks and feels like I have nothing on. I only need a few dots on my face, so it&#x27;s not wasteful. I will definetely buy again!!</li>
            <li> Typically, I use &#x27;MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream No. 23&#x27; but decided to switch up my routine because I was breaking out. I was really pleasantly surprised when I received a few samples along with my cream. The cream itself is a step up and found after a few weeks I no longer needed to moisturize before application. My only complaint, which is why I can&#x27;t give it five starts, is the applicator itself. I had it my makeup bag in my purse and must have accidentally pressed on the button and my stuff was covered in cream. I would love a better bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like to leave reviews, but I felt this deserves one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little information about my skin tone - I am somewhat in between fair and medium. I do not have a big problem with my skin, although it is combination-oily. I break out occasionally, but not excessively. I like to use as little makeup as possible, but I normally use a primer and a tinted moisturizer for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I did a little research on BB creams, since some of my friends have been talking about it. I ordered Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Fresh BB Cream, but I found out after lots of research that it was just another moisturizer, not a \\&quot;true\\&quot; BB cream. So back to the research I went - I came across quite a lot and decided to try my luck with Skin79&#x27;s product(s). I&#x27;ve read that the Pink Label&#x27;s more for those with oily skin (ideal for the summer), the Gold for dry (ideal for winter season, as many reviewers have said), and the Orange falls between the two. I ordered this from seoulglamour (09/01/2012) and the product arrived today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty excited to try it out! And I have to say that the results so far are amazing. I used a full pump (if you want lesser coverage, half a pump should do) and patted it on my face as instructed. It oxidized as soon as I was done setting it with some translucent powder. I noticed a huge difference with my skin tone - it covered up my dark spots and blemish scars. It doesn&#x27;t exactly cover it that you can&#x27;t see it; it sort of evens out those areas to give my face a more even skin tone, if that makes any sense. But that can always be fixed with some concealer. It also brightened up my face, which I was really surprised to see. It really does a good job with oil control for me, so I have not broken out since using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my go-to makeup every day - saves me a number of steps in my daily routine. I am saying goodbye to my primer and tinted moisturizer! I will definitely be re-ordering this when I run out. I may purchase the Gold one as well, if the Pink Label isn&#x27;t suitable for Winter.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the reviews it has, for me I have medium skin tone and it blends good, I look a bit lighter but I apply a bit of loose mineral powder on top of it and it blend really good with my skin tone, the only down, it made me break out on the first week that I began using it, and it dried out my face in the chin and around the mouth area, so I had a facial done, and apply moisturizer in the evening after washing this cream off, and this is my second week using it and my face looks way better than before and less breakouts, other things that I observed is that my pores are less noticeable, and my face looks flawless and and more radiant even than before, and also I observed that my dark circles are less noticeable than before, I only apply this BB cream, and no concealer and they disappear so far so good with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time because I read so many positive reviews. After trying it, I think that it creates a nice smooth coverage. I was hoping that this product would help even out my skin tone and reduce redness or acne, but I have not seen a difference yet. If you have a darker skin tone, I would not recommend this. This product works great on people with fair skin, and if I do get a tan, it makes me look pale. It is ideal for winter because it gives you moisturized skin. I can&#x27;t use this in the humid summer weather because it is a little too heavy for me. Overall, I think I would repurchase this BB cream. I like how it makes your skin so smooth and gives you a porcelain skin look. Its color is gray brown. I love the packaging!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is the first time I tried out BB cream . And wow, it does wonders, I&#x27;m never going back to my old foundation ever again! It&#x27;s a light foundation if your a person who loves full coverage because of acne and or scars I don&#x27;t recommend using this product because it doesn&#x27;t hide any of those.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product if your wanting a natural look  or a foundation that&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I always try something for a while before I make a judgement, and this one I gave two chances and both times it broke me out in crazy acne.  I should mention I&#x27;m not prone to break outs (besides the odd hormonal zit when I have my period).  People compliment me on my skin a lot if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;I did like the coverage and the finish, but the mess it made out of my skin was unforgivable. Its possible I was having a reaction to something in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this, however it seems many people have had positive experiences with it.  It might be worth it, but if you start to break out, stop using it right away....because I can assure you it won&#x27;t get better!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Skin79 BB cream (pink label). It&#x27;s very light, but covers very well. I will buy again. Also, the vendor (Pink Gelee) was very nice; product came earlier than estimated and they included a couple of samples.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this BB cream.  It&#x27;s not too thick, not too thin, and spreads evenly.  Out of the bottle it is slightly grey but blends nicely into skin and leaves a very nice finish.  I have tried a few BB creams before this one but I like this one the best and even with shipping it is cheaper than department store brands and the larger size makes it more cost effective than drug store brands.  The higher SPF is also a plus.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, perfect light coverage. Made my skin feel really soft and some dark spots are fading. Love the dispensing of this product....just the right amount. Will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  It&#x27;s good for everyday low maintenance look.  It comes with SPF 25 and the shade is more true to your skin color unlike other bb creams that look greyish.</li>
            <li> This gives a nice light coverage on the skin with the added benefits of skin care. I don&#x27;t know that it made my skin any smoother or clearer, but it was a nice light weight moisturizing formula. The color matched my fair and  freckled skin fine when blended out. The only con would be it did get my face a bit greasy at the end of the day, granted I live in hot and humid Florida.</li>
            <li> I have tried several BB creams and this is one of my favorite.  When I first put it on, I was shocked at how gray it appeared, but after I rubbed it in, it took away any redness and discoloration and provided a perfect palette for bronzer and blush.  I have very oily skin and still suffer from a certain amount of makeup slippage after a few hours, this didn&#x27;t take care of that, but it did hold well in comparison to other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ll buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> I would give this product 10 stars for all that it offers. It&#x27;s the best BB cream I tried. Full coverage. It goes on a little greasy but absorbs fast enough to a matte-ish finish covering EVERYTHING. SPF 42 is a great bonus. My esthetician couldn&#x27;t believe my age. I guess it&#x27;s a good thing that I don&#x27;t speak or read Korean and I can&#x27;t read the ingredients. I suspect it&#x27;s not as natural as I would prefer. But I like it anyway.</li>
            <li> I like this BB cream in turns of the coverage, the feel on your face, the packaging etc.  However, I feel like the color is a little bit more on the grey side which is the reason I gave it a four star.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product. In many ways it is fantastic but I have a few problems with it that will not allow me to use it daily:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Blends well&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; finish-- not powdery&lt;br /&gt;- SPF protecting is pretty high&lt;br /&gt;- Covers redness very well&lt;br /&gt;- I have red hair with pinkish skin and the color works well on me even though it is designed for asian skin. I&#x27;m not too pale (for a redhead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Makes me feel greasy but I am very sensitive to this problem. I don&#x27;t have very oily skin, but I do breakout so I don&#x27;t like products that make my skin greasy.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t hold up well to sweet. This isn&#x27;t really a problem in the winter, but there is no way I would be able to wear this in the summer if I&#x27;m planning on spending time outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pretty unsure about it. I have hormonal/cystic acne and I really can&#x27;t tell if this makes it worse or not. The fact that it feels greasy if I use too much makes me think that it might be so I wont use this product daily. Since it does make my skin look really good I may use it for special occasions where I wont be doing anything active, like dancing.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST FACE PRODUCT I HAVE BOUGHT. IT MAKES MY FACE SMOOTH AND IT HASN&#x27;T BROKE ME OUT, MOST PRODUCTS DO. I DON&#x27;T EVEN HAVE TO WEAR MAKEUP WITH THIS..LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I loved this product from the first time I put it on.  It&#x27;s important that you pay attention to the color.  This is for fair skin. If you have any skin tone but completely fair/ivory, don&#x27;t buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is better than any drugstore foundation I&#x27;ve ever bought, without having the layers of creams, foundation, concealer, powder, etc.  It looks gray when I squeeze it out of the container, but when I put it on, it blends right in and takes away the blotchy redness, and masks my pores.  This stays on all day as well and my face doesn&#x27;t get oily/shiny.  I really like the SPF 25 as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on Amazon from Tokyo Japanese Outlet and got it in 2 days (Amazon Prime eligible).  Will definitely buy it again from them.</li>
            <li> At first after reading all the reviews on this website and a few others, I thought this would be good for me. But my skin is overly sensitive, so after applying &amp; removing later on, it would become red and slightly dry. I started to have more break-outs, but not much so it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable. I use powder after applying the cream so my skin wouldn&#x27;t be too oily.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good product that covers %90 of most skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> I really love this bb cream. I was a little skeptical about the color (I&#x27;m pretty fair, and it was relatively dark) but it blends with anyone&#x27;s skintone perfectly, light or dark. and it had GREAT coverage. It brightened up my face. Great price. Overall GREAT product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have used many products over the years and this has probably been the best one I&#x27;ve come across. I usually apply this as my first layer, then i apply my foundation over it. When I use this product, my makeup stays on all day. My blush, bronzer, everything stays on which is amazing because I have extremely oily skin. When I use my normal foundation without any BB Cream, my makeup rubs off in the next 3-4 hours. I just finished my bottle and am definitely purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this product it was great. My skin loved it and did not cause any breakouts. I layer it over a little moisturizer because I like a sheer coverage. I used up the bottle and purchased again through amazon through another seller because it was not available through the original seller. The second bottle I got arrived almost empty- I only got around 3 pumps of product out before there was just air and I had to open it and scrape the inside. The tint and thickness was also a little different than the original product. The authentic product looks a little grayish when you put it on and oxidizes to a nice beige. The fake does not have the gray tint and is a thinner consistency. I was able to get a prompt refund through amazon for the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product but don&#x27;t buy it at the cheapest price point on amazon because it will likely be a knockoff. Pay a couple more dollars and buy through a reputable seller.</li>
            <li> I will never buy foundation or compacts again. This stuff is perfect for my fair but uneven complexion and provides sun protection. I only wish I could see when the bottle is running low so I can order my next bottle. Beware of imitations, this is the stuff you want. The store bought BB creams are just tinted moisturizers under new labels. Once you use this, you&#x27;ll never go back. And remember, as little goes a long way. When used correctly it does not cause mew to break out and everything seems to make me break out and I&#x27;m almost 30. Great product.</li>
            <li> This cream does make my skin a little bit brighter.  It goes on smooth and stays on all day.  It isn&#x27;t great coverage, but it does seem to help my makeup stay put a little longer.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It goes on a little grey but don&#x27;t panic! It will blend in nicely! Patting instead of rubbing gives it a more natural look. Also be sure to use a light moisterizer before hand, I use cetaphil. My skin has improved so much since using it and it is my new go to product. It has pretty good coverage (covers hyper pigmentation and under eye circles) I just dot a little more after it has lost it&#x27;s grey cast to cover up any other areas that may need it. Be sure to wash it off before bed to reduce any breakouts, I haven&#x27;t had a single one since using it! It really helps get rid of sun spots ( I am super fair and had a ton of freckles and some acne scars). Bottom line, try it! It is so much cheaper than the MAC foundation I had been using, feels amazing and doesn&#x27;t look like you are wearing any makeup on your skin. The SPF is a huge plus too! The only other warning I have is to be sure you are buying the actual product as there are some fakes on the market! I get mine through pink gelee here on amazon. The shipping is free and of it comes late just send them an email to find out what&#x27;s up. They also give me free bb cream samples and I got this wonderful paper face mask from them!</li>
            <li> Covers and blends extremely well!  I had never used a foundation or a BB cream before and now I know that I&#x27;ll need to use one from now on.  It truly does perfect and even the skin tone of your face and without being heavy or looking like a mask.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve seen a video in YouTube I decided to perches it and I am not disappointed. For the price it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> I am 43 and have struggled with dry skin and acne forever!  I used to use proactive foundation until my skin began to age. I switched to the Clinique \\&quot;even better\\&quot; makeup last year. It was a great color match but it filled in my \\&quot;dry skin micro cracks\\&quot; making it appear as though I had more wrinkles. Ug. I LOVE THIS STUFF!  I no longer wash my face in the morning. I apply a pump of this BB CREAM as though it is lotion. Goes on really grey-ish at first. Kind of looks muddy... Wait 3 to 5 minutes and...BAM!  New skin. Healthy skin. My family gave me compliments right away and could not tell I had any \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; on. The best part:  it is actually GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN!  So glad I know about this ancient secret. Don&#x27;t buy into the big cosmetic companies trying to capitalize on bb cream!  This is the best!  Oh, I have middle of the road pinkish/ yellow toned skin. Try this product!  At under $20.00?!  You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I bought this product months ago and didn&#x27;t have any complaints. In the back of my head I always wondered if it was fake or not. Well today I took the product apart to scavenge the remains of what seemed to be an heavy bottle with a broken pump just to find that almost the entire container is made out of plastic. The product portion could literally fit 4 dimes. After watching a youtube video about getting more out of your BB cream I was shocked when i took it apart and found the container was almost all made out of plastic!!! Seriously, I almost laughed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for about a year now, every single day and sometimes twice a day.  I have never used any other BB creams so I have nothing to compare it to, but I love how easily it goes on and blends in, evens out my skin tone, and I love that it has SPF in it.  I came back to order my 4th (maybe 5th?) bottle just now and was bummed to see the price has gone up nearly $5/bottle.  I am hesitant to spend almost $18 on a bottle of makeup.  I know that&#x27;s completely normal for some people but it&#x27;s a little much in my opinion.  I will probably try out some other, less expensive BB creams for now.  I will check back to see if the price decreases back to what it was, in which case I will definitely get it again.</li>
            <li> BB cream itself is ok product. But I received it about 1 week ago. Already pump not working...&lt;br /&gt;Such a waste when you can&#x27;t return the item...</li>
            <li> Okay, I really wanted this cream to work. I wanted to love it. It came in a neat little package on time with a little envelope and a cute card thanking me for ordering from the seller. The bottle is also really pretty. It is moderate sized and a bright pink. I am a huge beauty product junkie and this is definitely not the first time I&#x27;ve used BB cream. I expected it to be lighter in weight and almost transparent in color. It was more like a heavy foundation that did not match my skin tone at all. I was excited to try it on and immediately washed my face and squirted some BB cream onto my fingertips. I spread a little on my face and it gave me a somewhat grey skin tone. It is thick and the pigment is not right, but I also have an oily face, and my skin color is close to toffee. I immediately washed it off as it made me look halfway dead. Should have returned it, but it was cheap enough for me to write it off as a loss. That the bottle was pretty and that is was cheap are the only two good things I can say about this cream.</li>
            <li> when i bought this item i thought i might have been a good match because i&#x27;m asian and the product was made in asian (korea)&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m vietnamese but i am not too tan (medium biege?) anyways it just never matched my skin and but i do notice that it was good at moisturizing my skin and it made my skin feel better. down side it just doesn&#x27;t look natural on me. even when it should change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe for more whiter skin tones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading alot on bb cream, and came across skin79, had a hard decision between gold label or the pink. Got the Pink because it&#x27;s my favorite color. anywho! I was a little scared about the tone, since Im purchasing it online i didn&#x27;t know what to expect. But after getting it through the mail (long wait). When I first apply the produce my face would be a very light pale color, but it will all blend after a few minutes. Over all i love it! It did its work as described.</li>
            <li> Just placed my second order for this BB cream!  I am blue-eyed/very fair and burn easily.  I am also getting older and noticing I need more moisture.  I would not call this a moisturizing product, but it&#x27;s not drying, either.  It glides on so very smoothly and leaves my face feeling very, very soft.  It evens out my skin, but you can&#x27;t see that I have anything on.  LOVE THAT!  I feel like a million bucks whenever I wear this stuff~LOL!  If I were to stockpile one beauty item, this would be it!</li>
            <li> The color was way to light for me. However, its texture and coverage were great. Too bad it washed me out. Passed it along to someone with lighter skin tone, and they are happy. That is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for very fair to light-medium skintones. For oilier skin, an oil absorbing primer is helpful, or you will need to powder a bit as the day goes on. The coverage is medium sheer, but buildable. When I need more coverage, I prefer Missha M Perfect Cover, which doesn&#x27;t require quite as much building, but decent coverage can be achieved with this, with a little time.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s have combination skin, normal to dry cheeks with an oily T-zone. I love this BB cream...it covers really well and stays on all day. I found if I applied it by dotting on my face and patting it in like instructed on the box it works and covers much better than if I rub it in. My pores just disappear. The color looks like it won&#x27;t match at first, but when its blended in your skin and you wait a few minutes it totally matches my skin tone. The seller Pink Gelee is a reputable seller and my Skin79 was authentic. The price was excellent and it shipped fairly quickly. I would definitely repurchase Skin79 Pink Label from Pink Gelee since I know they sell authentic products!</li>
            <li> this coloring is a little better than the gold label so i can wear it without adding any foundation.  the color is not perfect but it&#x27;s okay.  it is very hydrating and makes my skin look dewy, which i like.  i usually wear this on the weekend and not during the week as i need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin and because of this, I stopped using liquid foundation a couple of years ago. My skin has improved but I hated not having anything to set my powder with... I love love love this product! It DOES apply a little thick with a slight grey hue but if you just give it a minute or 2, it blends smooth and will match to skin tone. Its absolutely perfect and I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to tell a little bit about my face. I am white and I have sensitive skin and acne here and there. I have a good amount of hyperpigmentation that is pink from old acne that I had and I was worried that this wouldn&#x27;t cover the spots but I was wrong because this stuff covers amazingly!!!!! I like that its lightweight and that I don&#x27;t have to put a lot on just to cover those spots. Its great to me because it is just so simple, you put a little pea size on the back of your hand and dot it on the places that you wish to cover and PAT the makeup into your skin. I recently got married on the beach and this was the most wonderful stuff to put on to just get out an go and have great coverage! Now I will only be using my air brush makeup on special occasions or mabey not at all. :)</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas Gift for my daughter and she loves it. Works as a concealer or foundation. Thank You</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this product and I received it in early January and I wanted to have a considerable amount of time of using this before I wrote a review on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About myself... I&#x27;ve always had skin problems since I can remember.  I&#x27;m acne prone, scar easily, and have uneven skin tone.  I smoked for 5 years and completely quit since Sept. 2011 when I found out I was pregnant.  After having my baby in May 2012, my face has been breaking out non-stop even to this day.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever broken out so much before.  On the skin79 website, there is this little test of sorts that you can take to see which of their products is the best for you.  I wish I had done that before buying this since I feel like this was not the right product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is very light, which is not good for me since I have a bit of acne and a bunch of dark spots where my old zits used to be.  So if you&#x27;re in this same boat as me, don&#x27;t throw away your concealer/foundation - you&#x27;ll be needing it!  The whitening feature did help my skin significantly.  The heaviest of my dark spots are noticeably lighter and the lighter dark spots have faded away completely.  My skin tone does even out nicely once the cream sets in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my current supply runs out, I&#x27;m going to try another cream within the skin79 line that is supposed to be more suited towards my skin type.  If that doesn&#x27;t work out then I will buy this again.  It is not a bad product at all; it does work a little bit but it&#x27;s just not quite right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About authenticity and my seller, Pink Gelee:&lt;br /&gt;Normally I don&#x27;t talk about any of the sellers in my review but I thought I should since many people are questioning authenticity and whatnot.  I believe without a doubt that my bottle is 100% authentic.  There are a few blogs dedicated to authenticating skin79&#x27;s products so I won&#x27;t go into detail here.  Just Google &amp;#34;skin79 authentic&amp;#34; or something like that.  When I did receive my bottle, I went to one of the blogs and did a thorough comparison as well as watching a youtube video on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is with Pink Gelee only and I&#x27;m in no way trying to discredit any other sellers since I have no knowledge of them. I believe the company is located in California and I received my package fairly fast.  It&#x27;s important to me to have my sellers located in the U.S. so that it doesn&#x27;t take forever for something to reach me from overseas and I don&#x27;t want to have to deal with customs, etc.  Pink Gelee will be my go-to company.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin and normal foundations tend to dry me out.  This had incredible coverage and left my skin looking healthy, moisturized, and glowing.  I used it to the last drop.  I have really pale skin and was a bit wary that it only came in one color but it matched my skin beautifully.  Definitely a holy grail product for me!</li>
            <li> This little jar is way bigger than I thought it would be. I have fair skin and I like the coverage provided by this cream. It appears a little white-ish when first applied, but blends in with very little effort. Good quality and price for the amount of cream received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It does not break me out.  I am 26 and had acne varying in severity since I was 11.  I get a few pimples a week, but this BB cream does not make it worse.  I never expected it to CURE my acne, because it is not acne fighting.  But it doesn&#x27;t cause any extra acne and that is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a sent.&lt;br /&gt;- It covers pretty well for a BB cream.  This isn&#x27;t meant for full coverage, but most of the time I don&#x27;t need full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;- Blends well with my skin tone.  My skin is pretty fair with pink undertones.&lt;br /&gt;- I can wear it all day and not feel like I need to take it off mid-day.  That happens a lot with foundation.&lt;br /&gt;- It has SPF in it.  I am pretty lazy about applying SPF, so it&#x27;s great that I get some protection with the BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;- The bottle is great.  I like the pump.  Very easy and sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I just spent a few minutes trying to think of a con, but I cannot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Great product.  I have a feeling I will be using the entire bottle, which rarely happens with most make up products.</li>
            <li> this lasted less than a month. i contacted seller and they stated that because it is an air pump and will ONLY work if there is product in the cannister, that i must have used one gram per day, since there were 40 grams. not the case at all. i used a drop or two, so either a. the pump stopped working or b. there is hardly anything in that pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and wish I could give it a better rating, but I guess it&#x27;s not just for my skin type. I deal with moderate acne constantly and this seems to just be making it worse.  I loved the coverage on it though and it blended to my skin shade very well and was moisturizing and long-lasting. Unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to set it aside and try something else.</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream!  So much better than american brand stuff.  It has so many wonderful ingedients to help skin!  And its a fraction of the cost!  Go suck it Sephora!</li>
            <li> I bought this after I had purchased the gold label.  The color of the make-up looks the&lt;br /&gt;same however, I feel like the pink label is easier to rub in.  Either way, I like both of them.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, my skin is normally controlled acne free till I use this product. It probably has to do with the spf in it. I broke out and it made my face really oily.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Provides light natural looking coverage, does not feel heavy on the face&lt;br /&gt;• Contains sunscreen and moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;• Spreads easily&lt;br /&gt;• Pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;• Decent size&lt;br /&gt;• Pump packaging&lt;br /&gt;• Good price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Will not cover any imperfections such as scars, acnes, dark circles, redness, etc.&lt;br /&gt;• Not buildable as it will settle into lines especially around eyes&lt;br /&gt;• Color too light even for fair skin&lt;br /&gt;• Not suitable for oily skin&lt;br /&gt;• No staying power&lt;br /&gt;• Caused some minor break-outs for the first few days&lt;br /&gt;• Contains long list of chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an average product and definitely can’t replace foundation for those who prefer more and longer lasting coverage, oil control, and natural products. I have been using it for less than three weeks and can’t tell if there are any “anti-aging” or “lightening” benefits. However, I will continue to use it as an alternative on days I prefer make-up free look with sun protection.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color but I wish the coverage was better. I brush on some powder after and it looks fine.</li>
            <li> I am early-30s, and have never had acne issues until the last few years. Thinking maybe foundations were the issue, I switched to BB Creams, and have tried several, but SKIN79 has been the first to do what it says it does---for the first time, I have NO ACNE. And that&#x27;s with changing nothing in my skin care routine except for the BB Cream. Additionally, the coverage is sheer, but still evens out my tone really well. I just need a bit of concealer under my eyes for dark circles. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> After reading some of thr reviews I expected it to be slightly lighter than my skin tone.  To me, it&#x27;s not a natural skin color for a caucasian woman, even with fair skin.  It made me look sickly.  I didn&#x27;t notice any added skin benefits, although I probably didn&#x27;t give it enough time for that since it made me look sick.</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream. Previously, I used Bare Minerals for years, because I don&#x27;t like heavy creams/powders on my face. I also do not like the heavy face make up/foundation look. I have asian skin, so the color matches pretty well. It goes on a little whiter, and eventually evens out and looks pretty natural. It really feels like I am not wearing any makeup at all. The coverage is light, so I do put concealer in certain areas that need more coverage. I know there are other reviews saying this product from Amazon is fake. I am not sure if it is fake, but I did some research about how to tell the difference between the fake and real one. I bought the same exact BB cream from another site that sells authentic asian cosmetics, and I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between that one and this one I got from Amazon. Overall, I am happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> great product!!, I used it and my skin looks perfect i highly recomend that you use it you will like it</li>
            <li> I saw all the raves on this SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label ) and thought how it would live up to the hype. As I am getting older, my skin feels drier and I do not like mineral powder as much anymore because it seems to make my pores more obvious. This was not my first BB cream and maybe if it was, I would have liked it more. This BB cream was so thick! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was very easy to spread but the coverage was not good for me (it takes about two layers to cover like another product with just one layer). The thickness made it feel like I had a layer of foundation on and my skin felt tight even though I moisturized and I moisturize with all my BB creams with no issues. There was a floral scent that was very light and didn&#x27;t seem to bother me. Also, everyone already knows there&#x27;s a grayish cast. This was no surprise to me, and I thought I would liked it regardless. But, there are other SKIN79 BB creams that are not as thick and do not feel like another layer on my skin. Perhaps this product has great reviews because it&#x27;s been out there (I heard it was one of the first popular BB cream in Korea). People tend to stick with what works for them, so maybe people are okay with how it feels because it&#x27;s the first few BB creams that they&#x27;ve tried or it really just works for their skin. Just note that BB creams are good for making skin tone even or hiding pores and small blemishes but they do not cover pimples completely. This cream could not even cover my blemishes although it did even my skin tone and cover my pores. I&#x27;ve seen YouTube videos where some people use up to three layers of this cream and then concealer. Why would I want to use that much if another BB cream can do what I need in just one layer? No wonder some people are breaking out from this product.&lt;br /&gt;I own 12 different BB creams - half of them which are samples. The hot pink was also a sample and I&#x27;ve tried the gold as well. The gold felt more moisturizing but also felt too thick and the coverage was more sheer. I&#x27;ve tried the SKIN79 Lovely Girls and SKIN79 Chiffon BB mousse, which are newer, has thinner textures, and sheer to light coverage that actually makes my blemishes less obvious. Also, they have NO gray cast (I heard the Skin79 Snail Nutrition BB cream has a peachy tone which I have the sample for and will try). Some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried that I love are Holika Holika Luminous Silk BB cream and Elishacoy Noblesse Naturalism Always Triple BB Cream which do what I want BB creams to do minus any odd scents/thickness/gray cast. These don&#x27;t have a lot of reviews but I searched blogs to find these. My best advise is to get samples; there are a lot of sellers that provide samples when you made a purchase so that you can try different brands before you commit to anything.</li>
            <li> What a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Do not buy American BB cream. Buy this. American BB cream is just tinted moisturizer. This is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Try the sample that Amazon sells if you haven&#x27;t used this before. It comes with 4 types and you can see if you like them at all and if so, what shade you like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a redhead with pale skin and this is great. Covers up some of my red tone in my skin (which is good) and matches very well. This may not work if you&#x27;re tan / olive but if you&#x27;re pale, these Korean products match pretty well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit thicker than a tinted moisturizer but feels so sheer. I literally do not feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup. It also doesn&#x27;t look obvious or cakey at all but covers really well. You can layer on more if  you need more coverage but a little pump of it is plenty for me most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, no skin issues as a result. I have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t irritated it. It&#x27;s hard to say yet if it&#x27;s helping cut down on my breakouts but I&#x27;m optimistic. Also, it has SPF 25 which is great. It kept me from getting burnt the last time I was outside for a few hours (not SUPER sunny but fairly sunny all day and I would normally have been pink afterwards!)</li>
            <li> I love this product and this is my 2nd time ordering from the same seller. Except, the weight of the container feels much lighter and I had to push the tab down pretty hard to have some cream squeeze out, which is weird. Will see how long this bottle will last, granted my last bottle lasted me nearly 10 months!!!! I know, I just realized that after looking back in my purchase record! I guess it&#x27;s more likely because I&#x27;m don&#x27;t apply heavy make-up nor my skin need too much coverage.</li>
            <li> Started of great!  I like the texture and the way it made my skin look, but after a few weeks I started breaking out.  Not sure if it&#x27;s because I started this product and stopped using my other skin care products.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again and will stop using.</li>
            <li> Ever since I stopped using foundation and switched to this bb cream my skin is pretty much flawless. I have used other brands of bb creams but none have lived up to my expectations until this item. I love this product and I will purchase again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this stuff probably about 8 times. I am so glad I found it, it&#x27;s by far the best BB cream on the market!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, lasts a long time, looks awesome, and doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;greasy&#x27; if you seal it with powder (I haven&#x27;t tried it without putting powder on top so I can&#x27;t say anything about how well it does without powder).&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s an overall great product and 10/10 would buy again. Shipped fast and without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since BB creams are made and marketed towards fair-skinned women, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for tan or dark skinned ladies. I have heard that SKIN79&#x27;s other product, the VIP Gold one, is a bit better for somewhat tan skin, but I can&#x27;t personally vouch for that.&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note, I have fair, slightly acne-prone skin).</li>
            <li> This makeup is super creamy with fabulous coverage , light and airy texture. Color match is perfect, and is starting to remove dark patches. Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing about how great it was, I went to the website and it was about $28 I knew I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much just to try something incase I didn&#x27;t like it. I really love this stuff when I first got it I was wearing it under my foundation because I didn&#x27;t feel it gave off enough coverage but I decided to try it alone with more of a patting motion and it gave me a really good coverage I added just a little concealer to my red areas and some powder and it looks great, its now my everyday &#x27;makeup&#x27; routine  unless Im going somewhere fancy then I will whip out my heavy duty foundation lol!</li>
            <li> I trusts reviews so much especially when buying online. I love BB Creams and decided to try this out as this is the \\&quot;best\\&quot; they say. But to my dismay, it doesnt work for me. It&#x27;s like I didnt put anythin on in my face. It doesnt cover much and it doesnt make my skin smoother as promised. I rated it 3 stars because I bet this one is original. All the original signs are found in this product as Ive searched for the signs in youtube. Now I&#x27;m still searching for the best BB Cream!</li>
            <li> Love this BB Cream!!  I have very pale skin and this is one of the few creams that isn&#x27;t too dark for my complexion.  Even the lightest drug store and department store brands are too dark for me.  This cream stays on well with minimal need to blot for shininess.  My skin is very oily and acne prone.  So far this cream has not made me break out and it keeps my skin somewhat matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I love how it looks on my skin and the coverage is just wonderful!!  Don&#x27;t ever see me using another foundation in my life!  What is so great is that it is so much more than just a foundation.  The price is awesome.  Seeing now that other companies are trying to cash in calling their cream BB but I will stick to my wonderful pink bottle.  Thanks so much for this product!  I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I am a self confessed beauty product junkie. Having tried dozens, if not hundreds of foundations, tinted moisturizers, concealers, etc over the years, I can finally at 30 years old stop the search, because I have found my holy grail of skin cosmetics in Skin 79 Beblesh Balm. Here&#x27;s some information about my skin type so you can compare before you purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I am a fair skinned caucasian with both pink and yellow undertones. My skin tone is best describes as neutral fair ivory.&lt;br /&gt;2. I have almost no sun damage as I do not go tanning and avoid the sun. My only sun exposure was when I was in my teens and early 20&#x27;s and stupidly used tanning beds for a few weeks here and there. I do not desire a tan, either, which is important to note if you want to use this product because it has whitening agents and spf 25.&lt;br /&gt;3. I smoked for 12 years before quitting 2 years ago and have tiny fine lines under my eyes. Other than that the only wrinkles I have are expression lines on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;4. I have oily, acne prone skin, though I keep it in check with Duac and Retin-A micro.&lt;br /&gt;5. Despite having oily skin, I get dry after cleansing and must use a lightweight lotion (Cera Ve).&lt;br /&gt;6. I have eczema, also held in check with proper moisturizing. I tend towards having sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;7. I am extremely diligent about washing my face every morning and night, completely removing all traces of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I outlined all of that for you is because it is important to take note that this product WILL NOT fit every skin type and tone, and it is not intended to. It is designed for Asian skin, and in most eastern cultures having fair, untanned skin is highly desirable, unlike western cultures where everyone spray tans to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this product applies like a dream: creamy, balmy, but not greasy. At first appearance it may appear to have a gray-ish cast, but that quickly dissipates after being blended into skin. I do not use this as a moisturizer, but instead use my Cera Ve a few minute before applying and allow that to absorb before applying this. This evens my skin tone out perfectly, although I do need to use a little concealer under my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my fourth point above, I do have oily skin, and this product is designed to control oil. I set it with Maybelline Shine Free loose powder and have noticed a substantial decrease in the oiliness and shine of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto my biggest rave of this product. In addition to leaving my skin flawless and beautiful while I&#x27;m wearing it, my skin is actually improving after I take it off! I started noticing this effect after about 2 weeks of using the product almost daily. I did not anticipate this effect; indeed, it is what inspired me to write this review. The expression lines on my forehead are actually noticeably diminished, my pores appear tighter, and my skin is baby soft and smooth. Now, I do use Retin A micro and I exfoliate a few times a week with a polishing brush, but I have never noticed this kind of effect with any other cosmetic product. I have an overall glow and any little marks that I had due to old acne are disappearing too. I attribute that to the whitening agent in this and the face that there are so many natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little side note-BB cream was actually developed to help plastic surgery patients heal post-opt. It allowed them to blend their scars away while healing. That should tell you something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review, but I felt it was important to point out that this product can and does work miracles for the right kind of skin type and tone. If you have extremely dry skin, this may not work for you. Skin 79 offers different formulas that are designed for different skin types; you can check their website for more detailed information. If you have olive or tan skin, or plan to use tanning beds/go out in the sun/spray tan, this is not the right thing for you. Also, if you are not diligent about your skin and do not wash it off at night, I do not think you would get the same effects I have. It really is a cosmetic and needs to be applied to clean skin in the morning and removed at night. I suspect that it would be easy to think of this as a lotion and not bother washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I truly love this product and can&#x27;t wait to explore other Skin 79 products. I honestly hope they never bring this to market in the US because it seems like whenever a cult product overseas comes to the US they have to change their formulas and they end up nothing like the original (I am thinking of Ellnet hairspray as one horrible example). I will continue to order for years to come, although I don&#x27;t anticipate having to do it often since you get such a generous amount in this lovely little package!ou.

            <li> I was so excited when I bought this product. I&#x27;ve heard nothing but amazing things about it, so I finally decided to give it a try myself. Shipping was pretty quick, only a few days, and it was packaged in a pretty generic shipping bag INSIDE a box, which was slightly impressive, I must say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first BB cream, and I adored it from the get-go. It was a bit thicker than what I&#x27;m used to putting on my face, but it applied smoothly when I warmed it between my fingers for a few seconds first. I was pretty impressed with the coverage, and it was extremely buildable. It came out of the bottle a bit gray-ish, but that was normal, and it oxidized to a very natural looking shade. It looked amazing, and even without powder, it dried to a natural matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But... I happened to be one of the few who had a horrid reaction to it. I&#x27;ve been using this every day for about a week, and began noticing breakouts only a day or two into wearing it. I finally admitted to myself last night that it was the BB cream, and not some temporary flare up. I haven&#x27;t broken out this bad since I tried my hand at OCM a few years ago, and failed misserably. This gave me any and every kind of breakout imaginable in places on my face I never get pimples or blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I cant give this product a negative review, because I really did like it. I would use this with caution, though. It is known to cause breakouts in a small percentage of users. I just really didn&#x27;t want to be among them.</li>
            <li> 2 out of 3 are not good. 1 is dried up &amp;empty, the other one had leaked all over the pink box. The other one is good. Very unhappy as I planned to give the other 2 as gifts for Christmas stuffer.</li>
            <li> when the huge rave for BB creams began spreading around the US, of course I was excited to try it. However, I am one of those people who like to research, research, research on a product before I use it. I read reviews over and over to find people of my skin type before I even decided on purchasing anything. So, after much reviews, I decided to try this BB cream. I initially bought the garnier BB cream since I had found it at my local Target, but after one use I already felt like it wasn&#x27;t going to go very well. So I returned it and got this. It was only a couple dollars more expensive ($15 compared to $13) and so I decided why not? I love it! I used to have to use an spf moisturizer, followed by foundation every day. now, i only need the BB. The only problem I have with it is I feel that although it oxidizes to my skin tone, I still feel like it&#x27;s a big lighter than usual. However, it&#x27;s a great deal, especially compared to the smashbox and sephora store ones.</li>
            <li> This BB cream goes on really smooth and seems to soak up oils. I left it on overnight to see if it would give me breakouts and it did not; it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have on any cream at all. I bought my product from Pink Gelee. You get a great price, free samples and the products that I have purchased have all been genuine and un-tampered with. The seller responds quickly and has been very nice to me. I bought 3 more products as gifts.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful BB cream for dry skin! I have combination skin, so I wound up liking Holika Holika&#x27;s Petite Clearing BB Cream better.  But this one is good for those dry winter months. It has a great scent, as well as nice pigment and good coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream ! It is very lightweight and blends so easily. The problem I have with this product is the packaging! I have had this product for two days and the pump already broke!</li>
            <li> I bought the trial sizes first and loved this one!!! I have quite a bit of scars and hyper-pigmentation to cover and I usually wear medium- medium beige foundation and was worried that this would be too light for my skin tone. It had awesome coverage but I believed it was too light and that it looked that I used two shades lighter on my face and it was a bit  grey-ish. I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere so I continued with my normal routine. To get some color I used my BE tinted mineral veil (still too white) and Benefit Dallas to contour and finished off with mascara. After half an hour I checked and the makeup and was surprised! The color evened out and &amp;#34;darkened&amp;#34; to better match my skin tone, but still had a brightening effect. Another great plus was this was matte and stayed matte the whole day.What a miracle! I have the oiliest skin ever and would normally need to blot every 2 hours and if its hot every hour!!! This made me a bit dry at the end of the day after 12-16 hours of wear and would recommend a stronger moisturizer, since I have oily skin I only used this light water get based one. You could also use a moisturizing mist if you have it. Over all I love this product and will be purchasing this again and also give my sisters and mom a bottle! Oh almost forgot best price ever too! so cheap- compared to Dr.Jart and my other foundation + mattifying primer routine.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing and pink gelee sells the real stuff only bad thing is it took forever to get to me like 2weeks but well worth the wait it works greats im puerto rican and italian and am pretty light but have yellow undertones and this just matched my skin perfect i think im in love lol</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It conceals my acne and spots quite well, makes my skin color a shade or too lighter, and just gives my skin a pearl like shine. It feels cool and moist on my skin and keeps me protected from UV rays. I absolutely love this product! I don&#x27;t recommend this product for people with flaking or peeling skin though. It&#x27;s not a pure liquid so it doesn&#x27;t conceal dry skin too well. But overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is only the second BB cream I have ever tried, but this is one of the best things that has ever happened to my beauty routine!  I have a bottle of Dr. Jart&#x27;s, and it is pretty great, but Skin79 is sooo sooo soooo much better!  I have extraordinarily oily, blemish-prone, sensitive skin, and this BB cream does not break me out one bit.  I do look a bit shiny towards the end of the day, but in comparison to wearing Dr. Jart&#x27;s, not near as oily.  I would be oily towards the end of the day if I didn&#x27;t wear makeup anyways..that&#x27;s what blotting papers are for.  Note: I don&#x27;t typically wear foundation at all, just concealer; in fact, I don&#x27;t think such heavy foundations are necessary at all.  This does give great coverage, my skin can still breathe, and I love the way it looks!  EVERYONE NEEDS THIS!</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit worried that it was going to be really light. I have a friend who is a few shades darker than I am and she claimed that it gave her a gray tone on her skin. I saw. But she let it set and it became her color with a hint of gray which was upsetting. I then purchased it and there WAS a hint of grey but it went away after 5 minutes. I have to put press powder very this stuff. After using it for a month I definitely seen results in the chemistry of my skin. It has become softer and smoother without changing my own routine. I would definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for some time now and I have to say I love this product.  I am not young - but the difference in my skin is visible.  I was surprised recently when I noticed that my pores were much reduced and my skin was clearer.  I also noticed that it is much softer ... the dark spots seem to be fading (was that even on the list of benefits for this product?)  I am not doing anything else ... so this has to be it.  Goes on smoothly and stays on all day.  I am really happy with it and would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with trying to find the right color foundation for my skin PLUS something that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I have super sensitive skin and when I wear products more than 5 hours, I get a rash or break out :/&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard about bb creams and was curious to trying it out but there was so many to choose from. I luckily passed this product while researching and read nothing but amazing reviews. When I got my package, I instantly tried it on and it feels soooooo amazing. Doesn&#x27;t feel thick or thin, it&#x27;s thin enough to feel the wind blow on your face but still has great coverage ;)&lt;br /&gt;When I squirt some of the cream on my finger, I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t blend into my skin because the color was more on the grey side, but I was wrong. It perfectly blends into your skin and feels so smooth and nice :) I am so happy with this product! Definitely recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone, and makes my combo skin feel soft, smooth, and non greasy. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mask, my freckles still peek through :), but the tiny capillaries and imperfections just seem to fade. In other words, I still look like me, only better. And after using it for 3 weeks or so I do believe my skin is improving. What&#x27;s in this stuff? I love it!</li>
            <li> I am 42 and have ruddy skin with freckles. I also have rosacea.  I love this product because it&#x27;s not too thick and mask-like like some foundations. You can still see my freckles but my imperfections are not as noticeable.  I use my rosacea cream first, then my daily spf, then an oil-free moisturizer. After 15 minutes between each layer (I check emails, feed the pets, drink my coffee,etc) I finally apply the bb cream..small amount first, then apply more a few minutes later and buff with a BeautyBlender concentrating under my eyes and on my cheeks where my rosacea is worse. I set it with the Skin79 bb pact or L&#x27;oreal AirWear powder.  I love it and both my daughters who have opposite skin tones can wear it just fine. I recommend it if you are fair skin with any undertones as I&#x27;m ruddy, my one daughter is classic porcelain and my other is olive skin but pale since it&#x27;s not tanning season yet.</li>
            <li> Super seller, Super quality bb cream. Now I have a place to order for my friends. Nice matching color with my skin, and texture of the cream is far smoother than the one that I used. Thank you.</li>
            <li> When i got this product, the box was a little open, but everything else was fine. In an excited frenzy I quickly checked to see if it was fake and looked for the sticker, the hashed perferated design on the box and etc. The cream itself was quite nice, and I liked the consistency. However, after a two weeks I accidentally \\&quot;scratched\\&quot; the \\&quot;BB\\&quot; label and it kind of scratched off. I&#x27;m not quite sure if that&#x27;s a sign of FAKE, and all the posts online said that it shouldn&#x27;t - but then some posts said that after a while the BB lettering becomes worn off. Today after not using the BB cream for a couple days I noticed that it did not have the same fluid consistency as before..it looked like the cream \\&quot;separated\\&quot;, like the pigments and oil dispersed. Of course after a couple of pumps, it was fine again. But i&#x27;m just kind of cautious and worried now.</li>
            <li> I guess i was justing expecting too much from this item. it is not as good as i thought it would be. doesnt do a good coverage at all and also a bit grey on the skin. i also worry about it could be a fake one because it doesnt looks exactly like the pic in Skin79 offical website.</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty okay, not forever. The product itself is slightly thick. The colour does have a slight grey undertone which isn&#x27;t much of an issue for me. The drying time is pretty long. I love the glow I get from it and my skin does seem to be smoother.</li>
            <li> For starters, I&#x27;m a 23-year-old female with pale, oily skin, and freckles. Before committing to this BB Cream, I had tried a number of skin79 samples over the course of a week or so. I liked the gold-label BB Cream, but found that the pink-label (this one) left me less shiny and was better for my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said before, you really should \\&quot;pat\\&quot; this product on rather than rubbing it in. I find that I need to use a very small amount to cover my face (maybe a half-pump total?). I have not noticed any change in my complexion in terms of acne (no different than my skin was before using this product) and have been very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the title says, I use this BB Cream under my bare minerals matte foundation. After washing my face, if my skin is especially shiny, I apply Murad \\&quot;Oil-Control Mattifier SPF 15,\\&quot; although if I don&#x27;t need to, I skip this step (because that stuff is wonderful but expensive!). After that dries, I pump a pea-sized drop of BB Cream to my finger tips and pat it on my face (my friends make fun of me because it just looks like I&#x27;m slapping myself in the mirror). After the BB Cream (which is SPF 25, thank god!), if I need to conceal any really dark spots, I use MAKE UP FOREVER \\&quot;Professional Full Cover.\\&quot; Then, on goes my Bare Minerals Matte Foundation, and although my skin looks great at this stage, I add on the Bare Minerals Mineral Veil after this to set my foundation for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the routine I mentioned above, I&#x27;ve gone down to using oil-absorbing sheets maybe once a day on my face, a great improvement over my former 3-4 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have no idea how other reviewers are going through their bottles so quickly, unless perhaps they&#x27;re piling this cream onto their skin multiple times a day. This product is best in SMALL amounts. I don&#x27;t need to apply it more than once in a day. The 40g bottle should last me through the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying a sample kit of BB Creams, the Skin79 mini set of 4 for example, is worth it. I felt much more confident in which formula to pick after doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product works wonders for me and has become a part of my daily skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it helps, I ordered from pinkgelee, and their products are legitimate (they ship pretty quickly, too!).BB Creams, the Skin79 mini set of 4 for example, is worth it.

            <li> I love the color, it isn&#x27;t too light like other BB Creams but actually blends into my skin really nicely (and I am not a light skinned Asian). I also love how the BB Cream isn&#x27;t too sheer nor too thick, but gives the right amount of coverage. And the nice packaging is a plus! It&#x27;s very cute. :)</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin- moisturizing but not greasy. The tint is slightly grey but that isn&#x27;t at all noticeable once it has soaked into the skin. Little product required to cover face. Cute packaging. Package arrived promptly. i use it daily with or without foundation.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is so amazing. It feels so amazing on skin and has not broken me out. The makeup looks great on and definitely makes my skin feel amazing! It does a good job at fighting my oily skin which is great. Awesome product and i am happy to have found it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about BB creams lately. With every local brand coming up with a BB I decided to give them a try.  I&#x27;ve honestly found most of the local BB creams to be nothing more than tinted moisturizers, with the exception of the Clinique version which is a little better.  I have almost completely done away with foundation altogether thanks to this little miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin, awful scarring, red blotchy patches, huge pores and a ridiculously oily T-zone.  While I won&#x27;t say that this cream completely covers these marks and discoloration, I can say that they are definitely less noticeable.  My complextion is smoother, clearer and appears fresh and dewy as opposed bumpy, blotchy and oily.  It is SO lightweight that I can see myself wearing this cream to the beach or on a hot day out.  (The super high SPF means I also don&#x27;t need to worry about a sun screen).  In fact, after switching to my regular foundation for new Driver license photos the other day I found myself wishing I has stuck with the BB instead.  My skin felt thick and greasy within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work 12 hours shifts and so far today, 8 hours in, I am nowhere near as oily as I would be with my regular foundation, much less bare skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the color at first.  I found that with dabbing motion, as opposed wiping motion, the color corrects quite quickly and matches my skin tone (very fair with pink undertones) quite quickly.  I don&#x27;t need powder and I don&#x27;t need to panic if I forget my blotting sheets at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is everything I have wanted in a skin corrector!  The price makes it definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product offered good coverage, however it was light compared to the color shade illustrated in the listing.  I am a tan complextion and it was extremely light on me, I had to blend it with my foundation.  I would try again if darker colors were offered.</li>
            <li> Deep penetrating and correcting cream all in one application.  EZ to use and to remove...does not cake in lines and wrinkles.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Having used U.S. BB creams that are really just tinted moisturizers, this is the real deal. It goes onto my skin like butter and stays on the whole day! I like that it comes in pump form, keeping the bottle sanitary, and that a little goes a long way. It gives my skin the SPF protection it needs when I&#x27;m occasionally in the sun, and has such a light feel that I rarely notice it is there. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, and sets into my natural hue a few minutes after putting it on. The plus side is that the BB cream can be used underneath other makeup, so you can brush powder or blush onto it!</li>
            <li> Ive used the Skin 79 diamond bb cream, and decided to try this one out. I like the pink label a lot more than the diamond one. It is a little thicker and provides better coverage. I am korean and have fair-medium skin. I apply one pump for my face + neck, wait a few minutes and i can apply the rest of my makeup. It goes on really smooth and moisturizes better than the diamond bb cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Pink Gelee, came SUPER fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect wrapping as well, the box was in perfect condition and intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looked exactly like the one I purchased before. It had all the authentic symbols (box with the proferated edges, Red dot on box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream had the right holographic letters, the manufacturing date on the bottom, and the sticker of authenticity. Just google fake SKIN79 and you&#x27;ll see this passes the test and it came with a small sample of the gold one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!! Overall I really like this BB cream, it has help tremendously with my acne.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with freckles, this color was a bit too dark, even after blending&lt;br /&gt;in well it truly looked like I was wearing the wrong color foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t use a moisturizer under it the first time and it was good all day, second&lt;br /&gt;time used a moisturizer and it felt gooey all day and came off if I touched my face.&lt;br /&gt;I will look for another BB cream that is a lighter shade next time, just not happy&lt;br /&gt;at all with the color or the cream itself as a foundation for my face.</li>
            <li> I thought I would put in my two cents on this topic as a 50+ woman with freckles and other sun damage.  Have never used foundation because of its heavy feel and artificial appearance.  I decided to try the pink label Super+ Beblesh... for a more finished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but have experimented with the best method for applying.  One helpful review suggested patting it on instead of rubbing in.  I have found I like the opposite approach - rubbing into my face; the other way resulted in a pallid effect.  So I rub in a small amount with both hands and then blot with a tissue.  It gives good coverage and an even tone without looking make-up-y. And it lasts all day!  I am stunned in the evening when I wash my face at the amount I find on my washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the condition of my skin, I think the claims are valid - my skin looks better and feels better since I&#x27;ve been using it - will look at the gold label to see what that&#x27;s about.  Would definitely buy the pink label again!</li>
            <li> This bb creme is the best that i have tried so far. I bought this during the summer and its great. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any changes after I used it, and my face become dark in the afternoon. Very disappointed !!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying bb cream, i was really impressed!!! I have oily skin and im not fair skinned but im not tan, so this was a little light when i first applied it but after i let it sit a little it adapts to my skin mostly. It has good coverage for a bb cream and i loveeeeee the packaging!! My only dislike is that it doesnt come in other shades. But its definately worth it!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and got a little too excited to find such a cheap, nice cream. I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin and this didn&#x27;t help much. While it did keep my skin from looking shiny, it made me break out regardless of the amount I wore. It&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
            <li> I have very fair sensitive skin and I have to say this is the BEST BB cream I have ever used. It oxidizes to my skin just perfectly. I have such a hard time finding a foundation to match me coloring because it is very light with pink undertones. the coverage is so great it&#x27;s not to heavy or thin. I dont have a lot to cover up but I did feel like if I did it would be able to cover it well. The price is amazing as well. I will def. be purchasing this again. I am in Love with it.</li>
            <li> This has made my skin so soft and so much more even!!! I will so be buying this again!! LOVE. LOVE. LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> love the product - no colors even close to my complextion. I mix it with my makeup and apply it...so it will last me quite a while. love it though.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this BB cream. But it is so light. My face color is different with my neck color at first, but it will be better soon.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t cover any blemishes or redness on my face. it seemed to enhance my blemishes on my forehead especially and make them shine.  Made my face feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and it has been great. I am very pale, with problems of having red around my nose/cheeks and I have had troubles keeping them covered. I also have combination skin, so it can be dry at the worst times, but it will get oily and melt my makeup off before the day is done. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of primers, nothing really worked as well as I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use this alone if I&#x27;m not looking for a lot of coverup or don&#x27;t feel like wearing make up that day. Usually though, I moisturize first and let that absorb, then I use this over my entire face. I follow it up with a little MAC Select cover up mixed with fix+ so its just a light application, over my problem areas just for a little added coverage. I set it with my mineralize skinfinish natural (light) and mineralize skinfinish&lt;br /&gt;(light &amp; natural) and finish with fix+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My makeup FINALLY stays on ALL day (from 7am when I put it on and it&#x27;s still there and looks FAR better than it used to around 9-10pm) I feel like a porcelain doll now and I LOVE what this has done for me.</li>
            <li> yes it&#x27;s true that there is a slight grey tone to it but it goes unnoticeable after u apply power foundation! my everyday make up is this wid power foundation! it has light coverage and its not heavy it glides on easily so u dont need the liquid foundation brush...just wash ur hands b4 applying this...i do see a difference in my skin color! my skin color got lighter! i&#x27;m not saying that this works for everyone but it worked for me</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product, and was able to use a pea-sized amount 3 times before the bottle stopped dispensing. Incredibly dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/12/13: Upon informing the seller, Think Pretty, of the problem, they offered to replace the product and did so right away. I received a functional bottle of BB cream, and it appears perfectly authentic. Thank you, Min for the good customer service.</li>
            <li> Great price, especially for the size of the product. The product itself works great! I typically use BB Creams from The Face Shop, (example: HD Perfect BB Cream), and this works just as well as those. Lasts long, isn&#x27;t too pale. Blends well. I would purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Even though my skin is dark, I love this product and I use a powder to match my skin over it.</li>
            <li> The product came to me in perfect condition, with great packaging and right on time service! Product works great, goes on skin smooth and easy and it&#x27;s wondeful! Thanks much!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and I love it. Coverage is amazing and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin. I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Use it daily impact on the clean and purify the skin very noticeable, Purify the face of signs and dark circles and covers small drill and covers defects in the same moment..</li>
            <li> Works better than American-type BB creams just now hitting the market for my skin. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and a little goes a long way. Works well under most translucent finishing powders.</li>
            <li> I just wish it&#x27;d be a little more moisturizing. other than that, I&#x27;m really satisfied. It&#x27;s a great product and it has a good coverage for those who don&#x27;t have a lot to cover (like me). and it has the SPF too, which is really nice ;)</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! Light weight powdery finish that has really great coverage. It last all day and doesn&#x27;t melt off. My skin looks great with this product on and when I take it off. I don;t know how it does it but my face is clearer and smoother &lt;3 I would definitely recommend this product and buy it again :)</li>
            <li> While I like the color of this BB cream (it&#x27;s a bit darker than most of the other BB creams I&#x27;ve used, so it doesn&#x27;t make my face look pale), it seems to cause my skin to break out for some reason (I have rather oily skin).  I had pimples all over my forehead, so I recently switched back to my old BB cream (Holika Holika--I&#x27;d stopped using it because I thought it made my face look too pale, but now I think I&#x27;m getting used to it.  Plus, the paleness seems to fade as the day goes on.).  The pimples are now going away after switching back, so that makes me think maybe this SKIN79 BB cream isn&#x27;t right for my skin.</li>
            <li> I rrally love this BB Cream. The color is perfect for me and it goes on nice. I like the container and it was a very good price. I woulld buy it again and will.</li>
            <li> Love how this product gives a nice light coverage for my face. I don&#x27;t like to pack on foundation everyday as I am a stay at home mom. So this is perfect with a little concealer. Also a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I can barely see my pores or blackheads and i am amazed... The covergirl bb cream doesnt compare to this i am so shocked !! Though i bought this off ebay from seller ichitrading. I am a fair skin tone white but not ghost not light tan either...  Love this it smells great the coverage is actually good hides my redness and it stays on!  It smells great too! I have medium sized pores. I am 15 years old and a guy by the way. Please try this item but  make sure you buy it from ebay, from seller ichitrading. Also, my tan to fair skinned sister used it and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Was concerned about this being a copy of some sort. Definitely not. Very happy with the purchase and price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Missha perfect cover is better but this is a close 2nd place for me. Honestly the american brands really can&#x27;t compete with the amazingness of the korean BB&#x27;s they are far superior:)</li>
            <li> I heard amazing things about this product and was excited to see it on amazon for a great price. But maybe I had too high of an expectation. The shade was not flattering on my skin. I also felt like it has less coverage than some of the other BB&#x27;s I currently use...Dior and Smashbox. I didn&#x27;t feel like it had any effect on my complexion overall. So I gave it a neutral 3 stars...didn&#x27;t mess up my skin but didn&#x27;t do anything to make it better either.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a good bb cream for the past few weeks, and totally forgot about this brand. i immediately went to Amazon and ordered this. along with my oily skin, i have many acne blemishes and scarring. i only use one pump, and it gives a medium coverage for me. i&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and i havent broken out from it.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll be repurchasing when i run out, the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;definitely give this product a try! :D&lt;br /&gt;if you tend to have dry skin, i recommend the gold label. :)</li>
            <li> I made the rookie mistake of applying it topically before but since I started applying it all over my face and adding a little bit of extra on the problem areas, it really just make the imperfections so less noticeable. I also should add that my skin is naturally a quite dark toned so lighter skinned people may have different results.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is the best I&#x27;ve tried as far as texture and coverage without feeling heavy, and believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of BB creams. Barely any scent at all either, which I love. It feels like I have nothing on my face, which is exactly the feel I&#x27;m going for. My skin is super oily with big pores in the t-zone and this is fantastic in covering those imperfections and in keeping the shine at bay. Like I&#x27;ve said, I have tried many other BB creams, even ones made for oily skin, but nothing has made my skin feel good like this one. BB creams always make me shine after just 30 minutes of having it on. Not this one, so it&#x27;s a great choice for oily skin. One problem though - the shade is too pale. I&#x27;m not dark skinned at all. I&#x27;m actually Asian with light/medium skin tone. However, this makes me look very pale wearing it, like I haven&#x27;t seen the sun in forever. I really wish they made one a shade darker, and it would be a perfect product!</li>
            <li> So when I first heard about BB Creams, they sounded exactly like what I needed. I tried a few washed-down American BB creams and liked the moisturizer and sunscreen, but the coverage was just not enough for daily wear. So then I tried Skin79&#x27;s BB cream. I figured I could use it on my &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; makeup days and wear my typical foundation on the regular days. After using it, I haven&#x27;t even touched my traditional foundations again. It makes my skin look BEAUTIFUL. It&#x27;s not a thick coverage - but that&#x27;s OK for me because it looks so natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian and used to wear Neautrogena&#x27;s foundation (in 40) and this stuff blends in a matches my skin perfectly. I blend it in with a beauty sponge and it lasts all day. Also, I have Kerotosis Pilaris and after 3 months of this BB cream - my KP flares have reduced dramatically!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, natural looking makeup? Clear skin? In one?! I&#x27;m sold. I won&#x27;t even use another product on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both Missha and Skin79, and I thought I&#x27;d wait until I finished both products to write my review. Here&#x27;s my quick and dirty:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missha - Good coverage. Odd smell. Made my skin look dewy. Better SPF level. Somewhat melted off my face by the end of the day. Good dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin79 - Good coverage. Nice smell. My skin looked more matte after applying. Okay SPF. Lasted a little longer than Missha. Hate the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve done both, I&#x27;m going back to Missha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has a higher SPF, and the Skin79 dispenser has either broken, or its close to being empty. I hate that I can&#x27;t be for certain, by the weight it still feels like there is product left in the container, and the frugal in me hates throwing it away without checking to make sure its empty. I&#x27;ll probably break it open to make sure I can use the rest of it. The Missha dispenser was also easier to regulate how much product I wanted to dispense, I think I went through the Skin79 bottle much faster because of the weird bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like using a *real* BB Cream. My skin looks really nice, no wrinkles, and I rarely break out. I wear it under loose powder, which helps set the product and make it last longer throughout the day. Both BB Creams look weird when you first put it on, but eventually blends to your skin tone. I have slightly yellow undertones to my skin, even though I&#x27;m caucasian, and this looks natural once its blended.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much money on American BB creams! The coverage is medium but it&#x27;s still really lightweight. So far no breakouts.  My face still gets oily but not as bad and much later in the day; but my pores definitely look smaller and my skin smoother.  I have gotten several comments from different people about how great my skin looks and that is all I really want.</li>
            <li> I love BB cream, but only skin79 brand. Other BB creams don&#x27;t work as good. The only cons are, you can&#x27;t tell how much is left in the bottle so keep a back up on hand, and depending on where you buy from shipping can take a long time.</li>
            <li> First of all, just a warning that this review will be lengthy, but it comes from the heart and speaks the truth on my part, and this is the kind of review I was looking for before purchasing this product because I hate purchasing new, expensive make up that I take a risk on and then hate and never use again, so hopefully it helps you! ;) If it&#x27;s too long for you, just know that I LOVE it and that&#x27;s all you need to know -- you won&#x27;t be disappointed. :) But if you want more details, read further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want everyone to take heed: *this bb cream is NOTHING like American bb creams -- and I mean that in the best possible way ever*, so *do not* judge Korean bb creams off of American ones. American bb creams are more like a tinted moisturizer, while Korean bb creams are a magical make up wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you a little background, I am a 22-year-old, my skin is combination, I suffer from moderate acne especially in my T zone and especially when I am hormonal. My skin is light, and depending on how much sun I&#x27;ve gotten can range from an ivory to a light nude color. I have freckles. I have dark under eye circles and some scars on my skin from past acne. I wear make up almost every day that I have to socially interact with the world (well, maybe not every day, because a girl&#x27;s gotta let her skin breathe and get&#x27;s a little lazy...) even if it&#x27;s just foundation of some type and mascara, and I always hope my makeup lasts all day, with anywhere from working at my internship at a desk job rubbing my eyes and squeezing my head from stress or working outside in my yard or going for a walk with my dog later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have *always* worn foundation since I started wearing makeup around 8th grade. I really wanted it to even out my tone and cover blemishes. One problem that I have with foundation is that it is SO thick and it easily transfers to other things. It always looks so amazing when you first put it on, but wait a few hours, do a few things, and you&#x27;ll notice considerable deterioration of the look of your make up. I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds, from expensive Clinique to cheap E.L.F. For those of you who know my tale of woe, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. For those of you who don&#x27;t, foundation easily covers up my freckles, and the second you put your hand on your face and touch a doorknob or keyboard later in the day, there&#x27;s a good chance that some of your makeup will transfer to your hands and other things. For good coverage, the amount of foundation you&#x27;ll need (and keep needing, if you need to keep applying it throughout the day to cover imperfections) can be massive. I never considered that there would be something that works like a foundation but doesn&#x27;t cause all those other problems. That sounded too good to be true. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you a little background on how I came across this product, I&#x27;ll tell you a quick story. I actually was on the interstate on my way to work when my car broke down. I was horrified, having to get my car towed standing in dress clothes and heels looking like a fool as everyone passed me. I thought it was the worst day ever. But when I got into the car with the man who towed my car, his wife was waiting in the truck, too. She was from South Korea and was the sweetest thing ever and instantly made my day brighter. I told her that I was a big fan of South Korea&#x27;s fashion scene, and she rummaged in her purse and gave me a little tube of make up. She told me everyone in South Korea loves bb cream (authentic Korean, not American, bb cream) and swears by it. The kind of bb cream was Charm Cell and it looked goofy but I thanked her regardless. It was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I got up and took a peek at it, not sure if I should put anything on my face from a stranger. I opened it and it was sealed, and then I looked up online more information about the product. My jaw dropped when I saw it retailed to 70 DOLLARS for a small tube! I tried it out for the next weekand fell in love. I&#x27;ll tell you my revelations on why below, so keep reading. I didn&#x27;t end up wanting to spend 70 dollars for a small tube, so I researched other top brands, and Skin79 was one of them. I&#x27;m so happy I went down this route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have to say that my skin is BETTER than it ever has been before after using Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink bb cream. I&#x27;ve never actually worn make up that I believe improves my complexion, allows me to have my *natural* skin but still covers blemishes, and feels light weight and fresh. I purposely waited A MONTH to write this review so that I didn&#x27;t just rant or rave after a day, or even a week after trying this product. You have to give it a little time, too to see any long term results, whether good or bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the major things I&#x27;ve noticed: My acne has decreased. My skin tone has evened (not as much of a drastic difference between a face with no make up vs. a face with make up). my make up breathes better and isn&#x27;t completely obvious that I&#x27;m wearing it on my face (you know, the whole \\&quot;it makes you look more professional and naturally pretty instead of obviously fake pancake face\\&quot;). You can still see my freckles (depending on whether you&#x27;re proud to don those or not, and if not, use a little of your foundation on top to cover them, this bb cream works great as a primer :)) It blends PERFECTLY into my face. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave residue everywhere. It LASTS for almost the whole day and looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips: don&#x27;t just pump a large amount into your hand and rub your face. Start small and use a small amount. There&#x27;s a certain technique to putting it on that you can read about online (I hope to post a review/tutorial soon to my own website, so I&#x27;ll update this review when I do). Just dab small dots all over your face and then *pat* it into your skin, don&#x27;t rub. Apply two to three applications depending on how much coverage you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people mention a greyish tone when it first goes on, but I don&#x27;t find this with mine. I feel like if you put on just enough and not too much, you won&#x27;t run into that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On days when I want a bit more coverage and to look more flawless on my face (say, for a special occasion) I take my regular foundation (I use E.L.F. liquid foundation, that&#x27;s amazing too, you should check it out) and just apply a little bit around my under eye circles and around my mouth and jawline. It blends in PERFECTLY with the bb cream and I find it sets better with the BB cream acting as a primer as well (assuming you give the bb cream a few minutes to dry before you apply the foundation). I also use a bronzer or matting powder to set the bb cream and I find this makes it stay even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I COMPLETELY recommend this. I&#x27;m your average girl who tried this after a chance encounter and a lot of reading of reviews online, and I am telling you that I&#x27;m impressed. I would hope this product would work as well for all of you, but realistically I know that not all make up is created equal for each person. However, if any of my traits sound like you, try this, try this, try this. It&#x27;s totally worth it. And if you&#x27;re too scared to invest in a big bottle, Amazon does sell sampler packs so you can purchase a small amount first (those small samples will last you almost a week if you ration correctly!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review -- but for those nervous Nellies out there like me, I hope it helped you. ;) Once again, check back soon and I&#x27;ll hopefully have a link up to my website with further information and before/after pictures for you to look at. :)and fell in love.

            <li> Love the concealing effect - it really whitens my olive skin (I&#x27;m Asian) but doesn&#x27;t make me look too pale. The best part is it doesn&#x27;t get oily even when it&#x27;s really hot outside so it stays all day for me. Love it and def coming back for it!</li>
            <li> Bought this after trying the new Garnier BB and liking it.  I am caucasian and find the Garnier a MUCH nicer color, although it is a little stickier than this one once it&#x27;s dry.  The SKIN79 cream is good, it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t understand why they have to make it a grey color that is hard to blend!  (Why not beige???  People are beige, not grey - unless they&#x27;re dead!)  Yes, I know you can blend it and blend it, but by the time it&#x27;s \\&quot;blended\\&quot; (i.e., not looking greyish anymore), it is very sheer as well which is sometimes not desired.  So, if your skin has a grey undertone, I highly recommend this cream.  If you are beige, not so much.  :D</li>
            <li> oh yeah baby hahahaha i love thisss shizzz :p mix it with my foundation (nc35 in mac) gives me a simple glow btw this was my first bb cream &lt;3 no regrets LOL it does whiten my face bit i use to be a Nw now im a nc hehehehe i got neutral skin now :)!!!!! &lt;3 will buy again once i get close to running out :O fast shipping thanks!!~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this - this is a fantastic product! It offers great, natural coverage; it&#x27;s easy to apply.  It looks a bit pale /grayish as soon as you apply it but after a few minutes it matches your skin beautifully. It doesn&#x27;t smell and it stays put for hours - it doesn&#x27;t make my skin look oily or dry, my skin just looks much healthier and even toned. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go without this product anymore. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product has good coverage. Minimum needed, if too much is applied color will not match your skin color and will have a grayish tone. Setting powder is needed to take away shine. Also, must be washed off every night it does clog pores. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it does not lasts a full day&#x27;s work.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the other Skin79 products I got.&lt;br /&gt;This one is just amazing as the others&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pale and my skin tone is uneven, But this fixes it. Light weight, doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes or hand, Im so in love with Skin79 products, that Im telling everyone about them. Will order more when its needed. So thank ya&#x27;ll so much</li>
            <li> This is the third Asian BB cream I have tried.  The first two are Lioele&#x27;s Triple the Solution and Beyond the Solution... both of those are amazing with Beyond the Solution being my favorite.  The SKIN79 BB cream is just ok to me.  Coverage is similar to that of a tinted moisturizer, but with slightly more coverage.  On first application I could tell it wouldn&#x27;t provide as much coverage as the Lioele ones I&#x27;ve tried.  It felt greasy on my face and it seemed like it never set.  I put on powder to counteract this and it looked great.  However, after a few hours my face looks like a grease ball and every pore on my face is highlighted.  Not a fan at all.  Also, while the package is pretty and the pump is convenient (when it works) it is too bulky.  My pump has stopped working and will only dispense product after I&#x27;ve pumped it two or three times.  Not buying this again and I will stick with my Lioele BB creams which provide better coverage and have superior packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other BB creams and was never really satisfied.  They are really just tinted moisturizers.  This was totally different.  It covers great.  I have redness on my cheeks and it covers without needing concealer.  It really does seem to brighten my complexion too.  I really love it!  I do use a primer underneath.  I noticed that when I don&#x27;t, I seem to get shiny pretty quickly, but the primer stops that from happening.  This product is my new best friend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for weeks now and it&#x27;s hands down the best BB Cream. I&#x27;ve tried many, but this one is really amazing. It&#x27;s a great value but also is great for your skin. I noticed a difference right away when I started using it. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old, have a ton of freckles with pretty oily skin that is also very break-out prone. I was skeptical of BB creams at first and did a ton of research before actually buying one and found that the REAL BB creams (originally from Korea) were the way to go and man, am I glad I did. The ones on the American market are pretty sub-par compared to the ones over there (per users that have tried both). I&#x27;ve heard a lot of bad things about this particular BB cream being \\&quot;too grey\\&quot;, and I can see where that comes from. You only need about half a pump to completely cover your face (mine, at least) and using any more than that can make you look very washed out. I bought my cream in February and still use it everyday. All in all:&lt;br /&gt;-light, but very full coverage&lt;br /&gt;-covers over any uneven skin tones&lt;br /&gt;-did NOT cause breakouts&lt;br /&gt;-inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Hope this works out for you as well as it has for me!</li>
            <li> This is a BB cream that is whitening which I&#x27;m not a big fan of and the reason I will be tossing this cream. It feels thick and heavy when you apply it, also makes your skin shiny. Overall, it hydrates fine but there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I have tried and it does what it says. I have used it for exactly two months now and I can say my acne has gotten better. I like the coverage as well. The reason I give four stars is because I am unsure if it is related to recent abnormal menstrul cycles. I have had a normal cycle almost to the hour for many years now. The month I started using this product I was late for my period by a week and the next month I was four days late. I also have never had a problem getting pregnant and since using this product we have been trying for another child and regardless of what we do we can&#x27;t get pregnant. I am trying to look for ingredients so my pharmacist can look at them to make sure. It might just be a very very very weird coincidence but I am going to postpone using this product for two months And if my cycles normalize and I get pregnant quickly then I will stop using this product. If it is just a weird coincidence then I would love to use this for life.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;So I stopped using this during my last menstrual period and sure enough my period is back on track.  I mentioned this to my health care provider and she also believes this is the culprit.  She named a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredient that can be used for whitening that messes up Estrogen levels.  I have had discharge from my nipples for months now and it finally seems as though it is drying up.  My PCP also said this happens when they give Depo - so definitely not what you want when trying to conceive......or ever for that matter.  This product is obviously no regulated and that is fine, but know what you&#x27;re putting on your body people.</li>
            <li> I have been a makeup artist for 14+ years and have used every product/brand out there. I was fascinated with the hype behind these Asian BB creams. I was very pleased with the consistency of this product, it has great coverage and feels a bit tacky. That is why it goes on better by dabbing rather then applying like a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Although the color may seem light at first, it does transition to your skin color quite a bit. And if it does not completely match because you have darker skin I reccomend a bronzing powder.&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt super soft and looked flawless! I also have noticed a difference in skins texture and appearance. Not drastically, but a much bigger difference to any other BB cream or moisturizer I have ever used. I have even used it to cover and reduce the appearance of a scar on my stomach. So far I have been very pleased, and for the price everyone should at least try this!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten middle aged I have been searching for a new makeup that won&#x27;t look heavy and highlight wrinkles. I am now the owner of a large drawer full of foundations, tinted moisturizers, and a couple of BB creams that didn&#x27;t quite do it for me. At my age foundations look like dried up pancake batter and tinted moisturizers aren&#x27;t quite enough. I think this BB cream is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this over most of my face, especially the T zone where I tend to be a little redder. When you first put it on it&#x27;s kind of startling because it&#x27;s so gray, but somehow it quickly changes color and blends right it. If I have any discolored areas I&#x27;ve been tapping a little foundation there for additional coverage. After a couple of months of using it my skin seems to have improved to the point I haven&#x27;t even been using the foundation. The cream has a different texture which I don&#x27;t have words to describe, kind of like lotion without being greasy. It does feel different on my skin, kind of wet, not oily. I use a light dusting of powder over it or it would be a little shiny for me. I really think my pores seem tighter and my skin seems healthier.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look nice! I like light coverage so this is perfect and it has SPF! My Asian skin appreciates it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we are very disappointed from this product !&lt;br /&gt;where we choose to buy it after reading a lot of reviews about it !!&lt;br /&gt;but it is a very bad product .. we are more than 4 girls, and we didn&#x27;t like it all !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the color of it is going to the gray level !&lt;br /&gt;if your skin is dark or light , it will turn to the gray !</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin smoother and brighter. I use it everyday as base,&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t even need foundation since I like nature look. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I range in skintone between NC25-NC30.  I am darker in the summer since I tan easily and this blended into my naturally oily skintone  OK but only if I use a bronzer, or other sheertoned illuminator like Armani fluid sheers in golden beige or bronze or the YSL touche eclat pen in 4.5 (peach).  It does actually settle more into your skintone as time passes, but if you are yellow toned and darker, it will read like a pale greyish pink on your skin if you do not use something on top.  I actually do like this cream and will continue to use it until I finish the bottle.  But if I were to find another BB cream with a better skintone match but similar finish, which I can, since there are dozens, I will liekly not buy this again.  But I did like the finish.  It is rather thick textured but does not feel thick on skin and my skin actually looks very smooth and eventoned.  It covered large pores and gave a glowy finish even without the other illuminators.  If you are on the cool/pinked toned side or VERY PALE yellow and range 25 and under on the MAC shade range you can use this fine.  Discourage anyone else darker to purchase this unless you want to use as a primer/sunscreen under your regular makeup which you can certainly do.  It does not pill or have a rough texture.</li>
            <li> Skin79 Super Beblesh Balm BB Cream Triple Funtion (Pink Label) with SPS 25 is good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;I like quick effortless makeup and this one feels soft and silky, quick spreading with my fingers and with Sun Protection Factor, I feel I&#x27;m accomplishing more with less.  Japanese products are good.  I just wish it had more ounces in bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the second BB Cream that I tried and it is the best! I am amazed at how it feels silky on my skin. It also gives you&lt;br /&gt;The sufficient coverage you need but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like a foundation. It is how you blend it to get the perfect coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this one as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> I am 39 and grew up on the beach.  As I&#x27;ve aged, ive had sun damage appear on my face that my dermatologist told me it&#x27;s next to impossible to reverse the discoloration.  Im very fair, and the damage looks like rosecia on my cheeks but it&#x27;s not.... i literally have tried everything to blend in the pink to match the rest of my face!! I&#x27;ve been trying for a couple of years; countless money on expensive products and cosmetic tools.  This cream is unreal!!!! I am speechless and so happy  i recommend to anyone looking to blend their skin tone.  I got it today, immediately put it on bare skin and i didn&#x27;t need any other make up to blend.  I feel so confident and am blown away by what i see</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I have very oily skin and it controls the oil better than any other BB cream I&#x27;ve tried. Very quick shipping also!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin so I bought this product hoping it would cover acne, post-acne marks, and match my skin tone. It does all 3! My face is fair and the BB Cream does not look orange (yay!!) or gray, as some reviewers have mentioned. It actually blends quite well and is really light and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply, I leave time for it to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; on my face so that it doesn&#x27;t rub off right away when I put blush on.  Like I said, it is pretty light and not grossly thick, so sometimes, it requires some extra dabbing for those hard to cover spots. I feel like it makes my skin look natural and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has hardly had any breakouts since using this product. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Has a color that is too light for me, has a sweet smell that I can not wear would not buy again</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and even and looks &amp; feels so natural.  You can see that you have make-up on, but it doesn&#x27;t look fake or caked on.</li>
            <li> It was disappointing to open a fake. I&#x27;ve done my research and have been buying BB Cream for a while. I don&#x27;t have a lot of money either so I really hate when people waste it. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought it because of high reviews but it makes my skin a dull gray color. Probably not the best if you&#x27;re a light olive color or darker. I do like that the product is authentic and has the authentic skin79 sticker on it so it&#x27;s not a rip off.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I thought it was awesome. It IS good, but I realized after using it for about a month and on a whim going back to my old foundation one morning that... my old foundation is better, for less money. At first I was so impressed by the way the BB Cream hides my pores, but other than that it honestly isn&#x27;t the greatest for me. It doesn&#x27;t do an excellent job covering the darkness under my eyes or the redness around my nose. The pigment seems a little too &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; to cover really fully. The foundation I used previously and have now gone back to is Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse. It does the exact same great job of hiding my big pores, while also having a thicker consistency that covers blemishes better. But it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or cakey at all either. In the time I used the BB Cream I never noticed it improving the health of my skin (or any whitening or wrinkle reduction, though I&#x27;m very fair to begin with and don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my purchase, the price of this has been has been slashed about 45%. Yeesh. I would never buy this at the price I paid again. For what it&#x27;s at now it&#x27;s not so bad, but it&#x27;s still a few bucks more than my trusty old Maybelline Mousse that I can pick up at the store easily.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to oxidize to the right color, but once it does, it&#x27;s ok matching wise. Reference: NC25/27. Yellow undertone. Bare Minerals Light. Korres Golden Beige. TheBalm Medium. So if you&#x27;re in this range, the bb cream should work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I still powder over it with a powder that matches my face to help it just blend seamlessly, so I can&#x27;t wear it alone. I haven&#x27;t tried powdering with Ben Nye Banana.....though I have been meaning to since part of my concern with the bb cream is that it isn&#x27;t yellow enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin and it doesn&#x27;t bug me too much. If I wear allll day (like...12+ hrs) then I start to notice my face getting unhappy. But I just go with my normal cleanser routine and it&#x27;s all good the next day.</li>
            <li> This product has great coverage and is really mattifying. It lasts through my 12 hour night shifts and longer. My skin texture and clarity seem to be improving.&lt;br /&gt;I am 37 and have 20+ years of acne scars and also wrinkles and fine lines from all the caustic products I have used. I currently use a benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid product and a pore minimizer. I use an electric brush to wash my face twice daily. I use the Skin 79 Crystal Peel twice a week. I am providing this info so that you know I am very serious about my skin care when I endorse this product. It&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it through Seoulglamour and it is the real product. It was delivered super fast and there were some samples. I think it&#x27;s a great price, too. I highly recommend it to everyone I meet!</li>
            <li> I ordered my BB cream on June 9 and received it about a week and a half later, which was such a good surprise! This seller really does prioritize customer satisfaction. I have been using my Skin79 BB pink label for about three weeks now and I can proudly say that my skin has greatly improved. It broke me out a little at first but that soon went away and I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t discontinue the use of this product, it has definitely replaced my old foundations. This is perfect for summer time use especially on my oily skin. It is light and keeps me almost oil free all day. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and will buy more from the same seller once I run out. Thank you so much seoulglamour! I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> Wow. i just received this in the mail 20 minutes ago and already I&#x27;m in love with it. The first thing I did was to make sure it wasn&#x27;t fake. It isn&#x27;t. I watched a video to learn about the fake products floating around Ebay and Amazon.So once I was sure, I felt safe to put it on my face. It is amazing. I have hyperpigmentation and random other little flaws and it covers them perfectly. The sunscreen and moisturizers will give them a chance to fade. After it oxidized a bit the color adjusted to match my skintone perfectly! I&#x27;m generally fair skinned, but I live in the desert and have a bit of a tan. I&#x27;m certain that this product will match my skin in the winter as well. Best of all, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make-up. And the smell is pleasant as well. I highly recommend this product, just watch the video to be sure you&#x27;re not applying a fake to your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to love BB creams. In my opinion, they are so much better than your average foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream is really good. In comparison to the VIP GOLD BB Cream, this one is meant for people with oily skin. Therefore, I feel like this BB cream in particular doens&#x27;t provide as much coverage but it&#x27;s nothing that a little concealer won&#x27;t fix. I also love it because it evens out my skin tone automatically. There is a slight Gray-ish tint to it but it does eventually even out to your natural skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast. Only took 3 days. And It came with two samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is credible and really good! Pink Gelee is the only seller I buy my BB creams from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone with oily skin and who doesn&#x27;t like wearing the layers of foundation and moisturizer. Please Try It Out &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching some vids online about it. It does go on a little gray, but after blending it I was amazed at how great it covered and matched my skin. My skin glowed and looked almost flawless. I did notice a few dry patches, so now I make sure I exfoliate and am well moisturized before hand. It also has good staying power after a full day out. I also have sensitive skin, and after a few days of using this, no breakouts.  So thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li> so happy that I found the best for my skin. Don&#x27;t need powder anymore and no more oily:)[[ASIN:B0020ZEA40 SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label ) SPF25 PA++ 40g]]</li>
            <li> I had tried a previous BB cream by Boscia and really like this one a lot better! This provides really good coverage and makes your skin kind of glow but not in a shiny oily way that a lot of moisturizers tend to do. I have acne prone skin that is also sensitive but this has worked great for me! I would definitely recommend it. The only \\&quot;issue\\&quot; is that this is probably for lighter skin tones. I tried this in the summer and it was a little lighter than what my tanned summer skin was but not pasty at all! Will be fabulous for the fall and winter. Also, the shipping was actually quite fast! All in all, a really great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much this is the second time I have purchase it , it makes my skin look so clean and look fresh. Love it</li>
            <li> i do not understand how so many great reviews are for the product, ant it sucks.&lt;br /&gt;it was too white, and i&#x27;m a little taned, and it just looked rediculus.&lt;br /&gt;it was a waste of money, my face ended up white like milk, it was&lt;br /&gt;just horrible.&lt;br /&gt;i do not recomend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;probably those good reviews are paid to say that it works, because to real people&lt;br /&gt;like me its just full of crap.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this looked on my skin.  It was a little pale for my medium toned skin, but otherwise, it really evened out my complexion and looked very natural.  I had a lot of people complimenting my skin, which is normally rather patchy with red marks from acne scars.  However, a few weeks after using it, I started developing whiteheads everywhere.  I battled them for a while, but finally had to give this product up.</li>
            <li> if you have very fine skin this stuff will work with you. can&#x27;t cover redness and acne. keep the skin oily. for me it&#x27;s like skin cream with color.</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream, it glides on like sunscreen/lotion. The smell isn&#x27;t too great but its okay, usually i set this with pressed powder and lasts till the next day. Unlike normal foundation that will dry my skin out and feel funky. The one thing that set my alarm bells off was that it was already opened and didn&#x27;t have the legit bottle. I ordered this product from seoul i think came in about 2 weeks not bad but I am willing to give it another go whenever this bottle is done.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;d rather use this than any other foundation. It saves me time, and it does the job. My skin doesn&#x27;t need any heavy coverage foundation, this bb cream is just perfect for my skin, it gives me a glowy natural look. Sometimes I set it with a translucent powder.  It feels light and i&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has few blemishes. I will definitely repurchase this bb cream again!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year and highly recommend this brand! Personally though, I do believe that the \\&quot;silver label\\&quot; Beblesh Balm offers more coverage overall and prefer it to this particular one.</li>
            <li> This BB cream has really exceeded my expectations.  It keeps my skin SO moisturized!!! The color oxidizes to match my skin perfectly and provides great coverage! I have some left over redness and scarring from acne and with this product my skin tone looks more even.  However, this product does require the use of a setting powder or you will get oily.  Once set, it stays put for about six hours before I have to reapply some or touch up.  This product is so great because it provides real skin protection that will make a difference in the long run for your skin.  Korean products are amazing.  I have just started using them and I will never buy American face or skin care products again.  Laneige is a great skin care line with toners and lotions that I have recently become obsessed with and goes great with this BB cream to provide great skin all day! love love love!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week or two here and there. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything drastic as far as changes but it has great coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> I have had a skin79 sample before and i loved the bb cream so i decided to get the full size. I don&#x27;t have any blemishes, maybe a break out from stress every so often. But i liked how it made my skin look so even-toned. I also have combination skin in the summer, but get just a little dry in the winter, so I use a moisturizer before applying the product. I was skeptical about buying from amazon but since there weren&#x27;t any bad reviews i decided to buy from pink gelee. I got very scared at first when I opened it, because on the authenticity label, there wasn&#x27;t a clear VOID printed across, but a rather holographic one. I also heard that if the sticker comes off easily it&#x27;s a fake, so i went ahead and tried to pick at the label (silly me), and it came off at the corner easily so I was even MORE scared. The sticker was also a bit misplaced but i have heard some cases of that and the product was still authentic But then, i stumbled upon this website and they say that a holographic VOID is normal on the sticker. [...]  (without the spaces). I think that my order is 100% authentic now, because everything else on the bottle is authentic, and on the packaging too. I&#x27;m just not sure if you are supposed to be able to see the inside container through the outside...everything else in place though.  I am also VERY impressed wit the shipping. it shipped on the 14th of november and came on the 19th! I will definitely order from Pink Gelee again. They also included free samples! :) I give it four stars because I still haven&#x27;t tested the product, even though I have concluded it is authentic.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream I have tried, hands down. I&#x27;ve tried many. There are a few okay ones, but this one blows them all away. It goes on a little grey, but once you rub it in and let it sit, it matches light/fair toned skin perfectly! It has reduced redness, and reduced my pores dramatically. I love it so much I recommend it to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> first thing, i received it 2 days early! that was a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;i heard about this product from beauty guru&#x27;s on youtube and i read reviews about this bb cream. when i received it, i was so stoked to open it and try it. the packaging of the bottle is very unique and i love it. the bb cream itself, is amazing. i was about to spend over $30 on the smashbox bb cream, but i stumbled upon this bb cream and i bought it. i&#x27;m glad i did. having to spend less than $20 on a bb cream that does the job nicely, is a big thumbs up for me. the bb cream is thicker than a tinted moisturizer but thinner than a foundation. this bb cream replaces all my other tinted moisturizers and foundation combined. if you are looking for a great bb cream, you should definitely buy this one! great product!</li>
            <li> I was very nervous to purchase this from Amazon but decided it was worth the gamble.  After carefully reviewing several youtube videos and the SKIN79 website I am confident that Pink Gellee sells authentic products and I will purchase again in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product - love it!  It blends very nicely and is perfect for my fair, freckled skin.  It does a good job with oil control and provides a nice coverage that isn&#x27;t too heavy.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Ever since I moved back to States, I missed all the good&lt;br /&gt;Korean cosmetics. I&#x27;ve tried American BB Creams but&lt;br /&gt;they weren&#x27;t just working for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard this SKIN79 BB Cream was amazing, and found it!&lt;br /&gt;I love AMAZON. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light and at the same time it covers my blemish.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and shipping was FAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Like all the other BB Cream from Korea, this product meets my expectations. The coverage is medium to slightly heavy I&#x27;d say and. It covers the redness but doesn&#x27;t cover freckles nor mole. I top it off with some matting loose powder and my skin looks very natural and healthy. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this BB cream after doing some research and reading a lot of reviews. A lot of people said that this was a really good product and I really have to agree. It works well on my skin and sells at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I have really acne-prone skin and regular foundation always makes me break out, sometimes almost immediately. My face can get really oily and at the same time have a few flaky dry spots so when I use regular foundation my face gets oily really fast and the foundation also seeps into the dry spots. With this BB cream, it moisturizes my face enough so that the dry spots blend away without making my skin feel oily at all. Even after wearing it for a good portion of the day my face isn&#x27;t as oily as when I used to wear regular foundation. It also doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as foundation so you can wear it longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I just put the BB cream on by itself with no other make up. It provides a pretty good amount of coverage. It works well to even out my skin tone and covers up my red spots and acne scars. Overall it makes my skin look a lot fresher and smoother and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all. As expected it doesn&#x27;t cover up big pimples though so I just put a little bit of concealer on if I need to. Also, the cream does go on a little greyish. My skin isn&#x27;t very dark so most of the time I just put it on and leave it but putting some powder on after applying the BB cream will help it to blend into your natural skin color a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am really satisfied with this BB cream and definitely recommend it, especially to those who have problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Hated it. I am NW35 in mac shade. when I put the bb cream under my makeup it makes me look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> ive only tried it a few times but so far it blends in really well with my skin. i am asian with fair/yellow undertone skin.  i can use this without a foundation.</li>
            <li> I had been bouncing around from wearing makeup, to wearing no makeup, to wearing only powder and then to trying foundation again. Foundation is okay for me but I get annoyed pretty quickly as it feels heavy and always seems to look cake-y and or dry and flake-y over my acne. I have pretty light skin, but its pretty much an all over pinkish tone with more red in certain areas due to acne and scarring. I tried the american version of &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34; creams, but they offered little to no coverage at all [mind you im not trying to hide every bump and blemish] and I ended up just putting more makeup over it anyway. Decided to give this a go as I was slowly getting fed up with makeup again and im really glad I did. Skin79 and Asian BB creams knows how to do it right. I have been using this product for a month now. Coverage is perfect  it covers more than I expected, but it feels very light on my skin. Easy to apply and smooth out [I use my fingers and or a brush depending on the day]. Nice light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger. I will apply a translucent or lighter powder over it to finish and to try to match my skin tone a little better. Sometimes I feel like its a little to dark or gray for my skin, but nothing I cant deal with as I have never found a makeup that actually matches my skin. I enjoy wearing makeup much more now since I have been wearing BB cream. I ended up purchasing the orange label yesterday hoping it might match my skin tone a little better. I still have the same amount of acne [possibly less, but as it comes in cycles its hard to tell], but I defiantly feel better about the way my face looks and will continue to use Skin79 BB creams.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, 5-star kind-of love. Unfortunately, the color of this product does not play well with my skin tones, hence the 4-star rating. Regardless, I&#x27;m going to use every last drop of this stuff :) Just for comparison for those who are curious about this product reacting with their own skin-types, I&#x27;m mixed race (basically everything except Asian) with a medium skin tone that tans very easily. I also have yellow undertones with some pink. My skin type is &amp;#34;Angry&amp;#34; and oily -- most makeup / skin care products are vetoed via breakouts (good o&#x27;ll fashion zits + cystic), burning sensations, giant blackheads, redness, etc. ad nauseum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried this product my husband was in the room and I only applied it to one side of my face then asked which side had makeup. He said he couldn&#x27;t tell (which was a very nice white lie I think), but added that the right-side (BB side) was less red than the left -- score! Plus, the BB felt like a nice, soft lotion, not at all like makeup or US brand BBs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day wasn&#x27;t so great. I used two pumps of the BB and got a face full of shinny grey. Regardless, the product felt great on my angry skin so I left it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day three I used three pumps (more is always better, right?) and almost drowned myself. I covered my face, neck, chest, shoulders, and hands (just for good measure, this stuff does feel amazing on). I looked like, and felt like, Casper the friendly ghost and resolved to figure out what I was doing wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching too many YouTube videos I figured out a few tricks:&lt;br /&gt;1. Less is more&lt;br /&gt;2. Put a pump on the back of your hand and smudge it a little before applying to your face&lt;br /&gt;2. RUB RUB RUB (counter intuitive for a foundation-like product, but necessary)&lt;br /&gt;3. Wait a few minutes to let the BB match your tone&lt;br /&gt;4. If you still want some more coverage / correct color match, use a powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage isn&#x27;t as dense as a foundation but it still conceals uneven tones nicely. It really looks like no makeup and feels nice on (even in 85% humidity weather).ation but it still conceals uneven tones nicely. It really looks like no makeup and feels nice on (even in 85% humidity weather).</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research looking for a good BB cream that would also match me and I decided to give this one a try. It does match pretty close. Maybe not so much in summertime when I get a little darker, but the rest of the year. The only downside is that it does have Parabens, so I don&#x27;t think I will be giving it that much use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. This is the first BB cream I have ever used. It does not leave a very cakey look that foundations do. Because I have oily skin, I have a high chance of breaking out when using make-up. When using Skin79 BB cream it covers up the unevenness in my skin color, although, it is true that when you put it on the skin is a little grey. I use it with transparency powder so my face does not look as grey. The quality of this product is exactly what I expected it to be. I love it.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it at all. it doesn&#x27;t cover anything and i realized that I can&#x27;t believe youtube makeup review...</li>
            <li> i loved this product very much it looks very natural&lt;br /&gt;on the skin&lt;br /&gt;i have been using it only for one week&lt;br /&gt;and i aspect a lot of it</li>
            <li> I was not too impressed at the beginning, because it just felt like tinted lotion from neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Then I started receiving compliments about how smooth and clean my skin was.&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing that I do not get sun spots anymore and feel my face is more protected overall. I use it everyday and the product does not clog your pores as a regular foundation would ( I havent used foundation in a long time now)&lt;br /&gt;I do not leave the house without it.&lt;br /&gt;Put lotion under if you have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;ALso, it is very light, so it is great for me but does not work for darker skin, I tried it on a friend and it just leaves your face whiter but with a healthy glow as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will try other BB cream samples just so that I can compare them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the coloration of my face, when I don&#x27;t use it, my face seems more blotchy and red in places than it did before using the product. I have pale skin, but this makes me look like a ghost so I have to use blush. I like the texture of the product and the fact that it isn&#x27;t heavy like foundation, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy this BB Cream again. If anybody has a suggestion of a better BB Cream, please let me know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because it matches my super-paleness, fills in my pores, doesn&#x27;t stick to the tiny blonde hairs on my face that usually make foundation look really weird on my, stays on all day, has a relatively unobtrusive scent and the container lasts for a long time. I&#x27;ve bought two of these now and it&#x27;s the only foundation product I use anymore. I love it. It shipped quick, too.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading the reviews that I may get a fake but I wanted to try anyways, when I got mine I compared it to the fake and it was all real. No spelling mistakes or Chinese instruction! If you order it from here make sure you get it from pink galee!</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream for the summer months. I have very oily skin and this is perfect for keeping the oil from shinning through. Medium coverage. Makes skin look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I dot this on my skin , then use a makeup sponge to lightly spread all over my face. Great SPF protection to help prevent premature aging. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I will buy again and recommend to anyone who has oily skin or just wants makeup to stay on during summer months.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, prone to breakouts and very combination- sometimes flaky, sometimes, oily slick! I seem to get giant, painful, red zits sporadically and I suspect it&#x27;s because a product or my fingers inadvertantly irritated a pore from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I strated using this make-up however, I felt my overall skin condition improved. It really worked well with my fair complexion, and overall my appearance is brighter, more youthful, more moisturized and less irritated with less breakouts. I will get occasional tiny clusters of white heads, so I think this product may be a bit pore clogging, however, I regularily use gentle exfoliation and can keep that under control.</li>
            <li> Glad I decided to go with this as my first choice. I have problematic skin and am prone to breakouts every now and then. This hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all (and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months already!), and gives a good light-medium coverage that I&#x27;m extremely happy with. Another plus is that there&#x27;s a good amount of SPF so that&#x27;s gotten rid of my expensive sunscreen for now :) If only it were waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there&#x27;s a lot of people selling fakes on here, so be careful. I&#x27;ve found that Think Pretty sells authentic products and has *awesome* customer service. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried BB creams from US makeup brands and they do not compare to the ones from Korea. I have tried a couple of Korean BB creams and this is one of the best. I actually started using this in place of foundation. You will not believe the improvement in your skin until you try it for yourself. Fantastic product! This one does not come in multiple shades as other brands do, but it does blend-in nicely.</li>
            <li> As of right now I love this stuff. At the recommendations of various YouTubers I&#x27;ve checked the bottle for authenticity, and it is in fact the real thing despite the small price tag. Also at their advice I ordered the BB Creme Gold Label for the cold weather months when humidity/sweat will no longer be an issue. If you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight foundation that will protect your skin, and maybe improve sink quality over time, this may be the product for you. It goes on so nicely, and if you&#x27;re a pale-face like me it&#x27;ll match your skin tone pretty perfectly. So far it&#x27;s standing up to my usually greasy summertime face, and I keep forgetting that I&#x27;m even wearing it. I hate wearing make-up at all so this is a wonderful product if you hate wearing foundation like me, but you feel like you need a little something to brighten your face, and make you skin feel oh-so-soft. I don&#x27;t even have an oily look to my skin anymore. I would recommend this to a friend. *BEAR IN MIND, YOU MUST HAVE A PALE SKIN TONE TO PULL OFF THIS PRODUCT, IT ONLY COMES IN ONE SHADE AND IT&#x27;S MADE FOR KOREAN WOMEN* I&#x27;m a freckled, pale woman who&#x27;s skin will burn at just the thought of the sun&#x27;s rays!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this, I like it, nice color and easy to apply will recommend to my friend.</li>
            <li> I believe all the hype. This product is amazing~ Does a wonderful job of evening out my skin tone! I would like to add though, I don&#x27;t have many blemishes, scars, or the like, so I don&#x27;t require too much coverage.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical trying bb cream but decided to give it a go.  I personally do not like to wear too much foundation because I have oil skin---and by the end of the day, only bits of foundation are left making my face look blotchy and very uneven.  Upon application the cream does  have a slightly grey cast to it, but just wait a couple minutes and you are left with a dewy even-toned complection.  I finished off the look with a light dusting of blush and was amazed.  There is something about the texture and consistency of this product that is completely different than any other type of foundation I have ever used.  The product lasted through out the day and didn&#x27;t cause any breakout issues with my skin over time.  Bon voyage to foundation for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I got it nearly 9 months ago and it finally ran out sadly. I&#x27;m not sure if it really whitened my skin, but it was always super nice to apply and to wear every day. The added bonus of SPF was great too!</li>
            <li> I received this product about four weeks after I ordered it. Since I&#x27;m in Canada, it was good enough shipping time though I wish sellers would remove or lower the shipping fee for international transactions. BTW, I bought mine from Pink Gelee, it was the cheapest seller that sold to Canada and they were very courteous too (they give you a note of appreciation at your package). Anyways, I discovered BB creams online. Considering the reviews I saw, Skin79 was (and is still) one of the most highly sought BB creams due to its &#x27;effectiveness&#x27; and price. I bought it here in Amazon since it has a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that it was concealer, acne fighter, moisturizer, sunscreen, etc. etc. all in the same product. Others claimed it cleared acne and others said it was the worst BB cream they&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I am My friends told me that my acne were getting unnoticeable. For the first time in my life, a product worked in fighting this. There were times when people asked if I was wearing makeup (people are divided if it&#x27;s a cosmetic or not) so I just said no, maybe this is because I was too sleepy and applied it incorrectly. A week ago, our school walked for three hours for a cancer research charity event and the next day, we went to church, also by walking. I noticed that I didn&#x27;t get a sunburn nor a tan (which is a good thing for me and I got sunburns in the same event last year and the year before last year). I was convinced that it was the BB cream that did this. The BB cream was kinda greasy at first but it loses the greasiness as you spread it out even more. It doesn&#x27;t cover all blemishes and scars but it will cover mostly some of them. Wrinkles are another issue. It claims to remove wrinkles but mine didn&#x27;t. However, it did minimize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I don&#x27;t like however are I have to remove it everyday (I use Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser), it seems like it&#x27;s sometimes causing acne (or it might not, probably its my sleeping pattern and nutrition), it doesn&#x27;t fights other skin problems (like wrinkles, moles, and scars), it&#x27;s too hard to get off your hands (since I use my hands to apply it on my face), sweating can make them disappear, and they can get into your clothes and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for only a month, and I still don&#x27;t know if it benefits me. If this BB cream will soon either change (fight/benefit) blemishes, acne, and acne scars, I will update this review. As for now, thank you Skin79 and the sellers for making this product available to people not in Korea and I will definitely try other Skin79 products.</li>
            <li> This is good. Very popular but the product does sell it-self. I was given this buy my friend who was raving about it.  I ended up buying my own. Go get it.</li>
            <li> Tis BB creme is not bad, at least better than my ex Garnier BB creme. But I was expecting a better product by reading other comments about it on the internet. The mate finish is not strong enough to me, I still need to apply powder after the application. After that the color blends in to my very fair skin and lets a very natural finish.</li>
            <li> My Mom was looking for one and I gave her mine.  She loves it and thanks me for getting it for her.  I have got to buy another for myself lol.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the product. Sorry for the late review but I have been very busy. Anyways It came on time and I had excellent service.</li>
            <li> Light, even coverage. Doesn&#x27;t break you out. Has SPF and keeps skin moisturized. What else can you ask for? After 3 months of use I&#x27;m doing my best to get everyone I know to try Skin79 BB creams because they really do end up having a positive effect on your skin. It&#x27;s not super dramatic, and it&#x27;s not overnight... but after 3 months I can honestly say my skin looks better now at 33 then it did at 25. It&#x27;s just so much less splotchy and dull that I seriously wish I had tried this stuff sooner. Even my Mom has noticed enough of a difference in my skin to jump out of her comfort zone and order some of her own in hopes of achieving similiar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of products get a lot of useless hype and we all know nothing is a miracle cure.. but this product actually does what it promises. It helps smooth over imperfections and works to nourish/repair you skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell or feel cakey and it blends beautifully. Plus it&#x27;s ridiculously affordable...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total win all the way around.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about the BB cream, but this is actually the best product. I would certainly by this again - too bad I can´t get it in Europe :-(</li>
            <li> this product dried out my skin even though I mixed it with moisturizer.  I was horrified to see my reflection in the mirror after wearing it for 6 hrs...my face looked dried and cakey like that of elephant skin!  my skin also became bumpy because it was making me break out and I RARELY get pimples!  Total waste of money.  I should have gone to Sephora and test some samples before buying.  I was so disappointed after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li> this product works well in covering up blemishes, but i have a dark complexion and it makes my skin look unnaturally white and then you can see the difference between my natural skin color near my scalp and then where i started to put on this bb cream</li>
            <li> the best bb cream ever and its authentic!i sooo love this and will never go back to my old moisturizer!thanks pinkgelee</li>
            <li> I gotta admit this stuff is fake I just got it this week n yess I notice on the packaging it has soo many signs dat tell u is fake but the product it self aint soo bad thats the only reason I decided to keep it</li>
            <li> I must say, after days of researching different BB creams and watching every video review on the planet, I am pleased that I picked this one. It is truly a fantastic product. I have been using it for about two months and I am about to purchase my second bottle. I still have about half of my original bottle left, but I want to have another on reserve before my other one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally set out to buy the Smashbox BB cream after hearing so much hype on it. Of course that opened my eyes to the dozens of different BB creams offered, and of course I wanted to choose the best one. I took several factors into consideration: price, ingredient/product quality, and of course how it looks. The Skin79 BB cream is a third of the price of the Smashbox, and it works better than more expensive foundations I have used over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian with a light tan/olive complexion that tends to be oily in my t-zone. The cream goes on pale, but after a few minutes it oxidizes to my skin tone. A dime or nickel sized amount is all it takes, and I spread it around with my fingers. I have used foundation brushes, but I prefer using my hands as I think my skin always looks cakey after using a brush. After it oxidizes it is still about a shade lighter than my skin tone, but I finish it with a slightly darker powder and the difference is hardly noticeable. And of course in the winter when my skin is more pale, I think there will be no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this BB cream does much for oil control, but then again I was not expecting it to miraculously halt my skin&#x27;s natural processes. I simply blot my face every 4 hours or so, and I am all set. The BB cream stays looking flawless all day. It evens out my skin tone, and it moisturizes decently. I will sometimes put a couple dots of moisturizer on trouble areas before applying BB cream, but it is usually not necessary. Also, some people use it as a primer under foundation, but even on my worstskin days the BB cream is ample coverage. It practically makes me glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously love this stuff. It is yet another gem that Korea has shared with the world.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this BB Cream after seeing the hype over bb creams in America. As being someone who aspires to travel one day, it goes without saying that I am interested in just about every culture outside of the US&#x27;s borders (no offense to my own country :P) and have always loved Europe and Asia. Due to this, I have seen how we have Americanized a lot of things and I was afraid the BB Creams we have begun to make would be no exception to that rule. So, I did my research and decided to get an actual product from Asia instead of our Americanized bb creams (which to my knowledge are overpriced tinted moisturizers). Although I have not used the product very much as of yet, I would just like to say that if you are considering purchasing this from this seller to be very assured that this is genuine. The BB cream I received came earlier than predicted AND is a real SKIN79 product. I did a lot of research on how to tell fakes from real bottles, and this (to the best of my knowledge) is most definitely real. So go ahead and purchase and jump on this BB bandwagon. :)</li>
            <li> Good schtuff! Nice coverage, nice light feeling on the skin. However, it kinda makes your skin look ever so slighty grayish, but it&#x27;s nothing a little bronzer or setting powder can&#x27;t fix :)  Shipping was fast and the product was so well packaged that it was probably bullet-proof. Oh! And the product was genuine (which I know is a huge concern for us Amazon shoppers) trustworthy seller :) WHOOP WHOOP</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I felt compelled to tell my story. I&#x27;m a fair redhead with pale skin &amp; pinkish undertones however I have lots of warm color as well from all of my freckles. I have a hard time finding the right face makeup because it&#x27;s either too warm or too pink. Plus I don&#x27;t want to cover my freckles because, well, I love them! So, after hearing about BB cream from a friend, I found this cute pink bottle on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, I tried it all over like a foundation. I found that it was too thick for all over but the color was perfection. So, I mixed it with my face lotion (Oil of Olay: Complete Daily Defense All Day Moisturizer with Sunscreen SPF30 Sensitive Ski(Love it- but buy it at Costco for a great deal in 2 pack))and put all over my face. Then I put extra under my eyes and chin like a concealer and pat into skin with fingertips. Wow- my skin is extremely soft, never gets sunburned, and never gets acne- EVER! Plus, it makes me look well rested, it doesn&#x27;t hide my freckles and it evens out my skin tone underneath the freckles. This stuff is amazing! If you are interested in the rest of my routine, I finish off my very natural look with Bare Minerals foundation in Fairly-Medium all over and add some Bare Minerals Warmth in the summer. Sounds like a lot of work but it literally takes me 2-3 minutes from start to finish. Everything is so light feeling, my skin looks flawless and I&#x27;m getting complements all the time.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle lasts a really long time because you don&#x27;t need that much. 1 1/2 pumps in the morning lasts all day. The shipper had a really long estimated time of shipment but then had it ready early and sent it to me within a couple weeks of ordering. Seriously, I&#x27;m never going back to liquid foundation, liquid concealer or tinted moisturizer again! Plus, the price is just right. One more note, my mom bought this as well, but she is a tan brunette and the color was just slightly too light for her as an all-over foundation. But it looked great for spot treatment under her eyes to brighten her face. \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; really does just mean \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; and it truly works.  If you are still unsure about buying this product- you need to just do it. You and your skin will be very happy! :)</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of their products.. It works wonders for my skin and I no longer wear foundation.. My skin is olive.. I&#x27;m Pakistani and this product is perfect for my skin color</li>
            <li> This is a COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT!  It isn&#x27;t the real BB cream from Skin 79. Don&#x27;t buy it! It made me break out horribly and I never break out.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, some people seem to like the counterfeit product because it does still work as a foundation but it is a fake product from China which means there is no regulation on what chemicals are going into the product. You could be killing yourself by using it. DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find anything else this good for this price range. My skin is smoother, looks healthier, and feels great. I love that I can just smooth one pump on my face and go without spending forever on makeup. I have alot of red undertones, rosacea, and psoriasis. This covers and smooths very well and the added moisture helps keep my skin condition under control. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several BB creams and this is my hands down favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds a soft focus look to my skin, and is a great shade on my fair skin.  I am fortunate to have good skin so most days can just use this BB cream.  I can layer foundation over this only where I need it--nose and cheeks--and have a more finished look as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have pretty dry skin and am in my 40&#x27;s (plus live in the desert) so I do put moisturizer underneath it.</li>
            <li> The BB cream matched my skin tone perfectly, I can put it on just problem areas or over my whole face, it doesn&#x27;t matter it just blends really well.  Super light, I don&#x27;t feel cakey after I put it on.  My skin is pretty sensitive and prone to acne.  I tried this cream on a section of my face first and when I didn&#x27;t break out I used it every day, I noticed that the pores on my nose which is where I have a lot of black heads shrunk significantly. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream!  I even stopped buying my bare minerals and just use this.  My face has been so soft since I started using it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but its ways better than drugstore bb creams.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for lazy days that i don&#x27;t want to wear so much makeup, just to even out the skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this bb cream, would recommend if ur looking for a bb cream that actually works.</li>
            <li> love this product. I am a fair skin woman 60 year sold .This product makes my skin  even looking/ No need to add foundation but the blash</li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable, the shipping was fast, and the product is awesome! It&#x27;s unlike regular bb creams you find in the drugstores because it has more of a medium to full coverage. It has no smell to it which is nice. It has lots of nice benefits that drugstore bb creams don&#x27;t have like whitening agents that fade dark spots. At first it has a gray tint to it, but if you let it sit for 5 minutes it will adjust to your skin tone. Although this bb cream may not work for darker skin tones. Overall, great product and awesome service!</li>
            <li> This BB Cream doesn&#x27;t seem to work as it&#x27;s advertised for my typical Asian skin tone(fair). It appears to be too grayish on my face. I wish that I could return it, but it&#x27;s been opened and used 2 times :(</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I&#x27;ve never been into applying foundation all over my face or understood how to do it but this product makes it so easy. I just apply all over with a brush and it blends right into my skin. If it looks a bit greyish when you first apply, don&#x27;t worry - it will change color to match your skin in a couple minutes. A little bit goes a long way, so do not apply a large amount.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail the other day. It arrived A LOT sooner than I expected, which was awesome. I used it almost as soon as I received it, I was so excited to try it. I was disappointed to find that it&#x27;s darker than I expected. I almost feel like I ordered the wrong product, since so many of the reviews mention that it&#x27;s supposed to be such a light-colored product. It&#x27;s too dark for my skin; I simply can&#x27;t use it. I only used it the one time, and didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions, so that&#x27;s something. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it seems like a great product for people with somewhat darker skin than mine.</li>
            <li> After hearing about this makeup I was skeptical.  I was also worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work with my skin type/age range.  I am close to 40 and have fair combination skin.  I had been using 3 different products for my foundation.  One lighter color-changing foundation, one heavier foundation on top and then concealer on that if needed.  Now this is all I need!  The coverage is awesome, it definitely minimizes pores which is especially noticeable in the creases of my nose.  It doesn&#x27;t get flaky or clumpy or rub off easily, yet it blends well.  I would always get a makeup crease between my eyebrows with other makeup.  With BB Cream, no more makeup crease!  It lasts all day and I don&#x27;t have to touch it up.  I only need to use concealer in extreme cases now, which is hardly ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does start out gray when I first put it on, but after a while the color changes and looks very natural on me.  I also use coconut oil underneath it and at first my face is shiny, but within 30 minutes or so, the coconut oil soaks in and the makeup turns matte on me.  I do not use powder, and don&#x27;t feel that I need to.  It stays put without powder, and yet is still pliable enough that I could blend more in, if I accidentally wiped some off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this stuff!  I am buying more now just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  I bought mine from Pink Gelee and from everything I have read about detecting fakes, this looks like the real deal.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this.  I can&#x27;t say how it will do with other skin types, but for me, I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I dont know if I used this product in a wrong way, but I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference, neither better nor worse than before</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural looking, good coverage, and actually I have had NO breakouts at ALL since switching to the Skin 79 BB&#x27;s. I have this and also the Gold Label.. You can use both together and I like to put this on chin and around nose where I used to get blemishes. Then use the VIP Gold BB for forehead, surrounding eye area and cheeks to add hydration and natural coverage of imperfections where I dont break out... this one is great for keeping sebum production down. I havent had any blemishes since switching to this cream. I think its amazing.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this product, it made me break out so I was forced to stop using it. Otherwise, I liked the medium coverage and brightening effects on the the face.</li>
            <li> I have a medium/dark skin tone since im Peruvian and when I first put on this product I was kind of scared since it made me look really white and ashy. After a few minutes the whiteness went away and I ended up with perfectly smooth skin. I am totally in love with this BB cream and I cant leave the house with out it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. And even works for tab skin like mine I was shocked. It does take time for it to adjust on your face to match your skin tone but other than that it does so wonders! Everyone tells me my face looks so soft and clear. I just love this product. And it ships so fast like no joke. But it&#x27;s your decision to buy it. I would(:</li>
            <li> I love using this product other than buying the american ones coz the ingredients of it and like i love it</li>
            <li> I have normal/combination skin that tends towards dry in the winter. I also have some pigmentation issues, acne scarring and some rough patches on my face. My skin is tone is cool toned and pale. When I first started using this, I noticed that the coverage was medium/light depending on how you apply and how much you apply. You will probably need to use a concealer to cover any trouble areas. This product after maybe a few days of use started to diminish the look of my red areas and really hydrated the rough and dry areas on my face. It has a wonderful finish as well; very youthful and dewy. It is not so dewy that I looked oily, but I sometimes have to apply a bit of powder mid-day on my T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want a fuller coverage for date nights or special occasions I like to mix this BB Cream with one of my normal foundations and it works great!</li>
            <li> not that bad it can use as a foundation for your face nothing else i use it two times sice i brought it its tooo strong for my sensitive skin cool</li>
            <li> Bb cream was exactly what i expected...light weight and medium coverage. Package came in less than a week. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just decided to find put what all this BB Cream is about. I researched reviews for the best Bb Cream for ouly/acne prone skin and based on reviews, chose this one to try. I LOVE it. This is my second day using it and it feels so great and goes on creamy (i use my fingers). I would definitely buy this again. I recieved two samples with it as well that also went on great and actually matched my skin a little better. Anyway, I brush on powder foundation lightly and went it lasted all day! I only put 4 stars because ghere wasn&#x27;t a color choice.  However, the samples I received were different shades.</li>
            <li> I love the bb creams from skin79... The only negative is that it gives a shiny look, but it can be easily corrected with bloat powder!</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream. It&#x27;s not oily and works well for my combination skin. It lights my skin color. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, therefor it did not work on me, and on top of that broke me out, really bad. It might not have been the product that broke me out, it might be the fact it made me oily and cause me to break out due to the oils and makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting around with BB creams this past summer, but SKIN79&#x27;s Pink Label is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon application, I can immediately see a difference in my skin with minimized pores and evened-out skin tone. It looks natural and feels light on my skin. It has a scent, but it&#x27;s slight and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant about ordering this product since I&#x27;m pretty tanned, and most of my friends use BB cream to maintain a pale-white skin tone. However, it blends very well with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are wondering: I bought mine from Vurea, which admittedly is pricier than the others, but has an Amazon fulfillment. I was not disappointed. It came with 2-day shipping (well, I have Amazon prime), and best of all, the product was authentic, and the cream was taken from a new batch, due to expire in Nov 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this site (a Little Makeup Box blog) to determine if my product was legit or not, and everything checks out!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Blends really well with my oily skin.  Doesn&#x27;t look greyish.  Can apply blush, bronzer or translucent powders and it all works well with this cream.  Definitely will buy again.  Such a great price to include shipping.</li>
            <li> I received my product a few days ago and was anxious to try it right away. I knew that I was taking a risk buying it from Korea... but the cost was not so much so I just had to bite the bullet and do it. You see, here&#x27;s the thing. I am close to 60, spent from 15 to 42 as a model while going to school to get multiple degrees, raising kids as a single parent, and hiding the very oily skin that I had to work with all the time to manage breakouts. A while back, the makeup I used for about 40 years left the market and is not made anymore. I tried everything with no success. Something had to shift. I started researching BB creams in the US. Not so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some BB creams make your skin like an oil slick, in such cases as mine, and even go on oily. But I was lucky with this one. Not only did it cover my flaws, self-adjust to my deep olive skin tone, hide my sags and bags, but it completely controlled my oily skin. My goal was to find a BB cream that was good for my skin but looks like an air brushed finish like I had as a model. I found it! It does all I wanted and so much more. I will be ordering again! You can&#x27;t tell I have anything on but it looks fantastic as if I have perfect skin! I&#x27;m sold. I have used it every day and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Now many months later, I still absolutely LOVE this product. The result gets better and better and my skin keeps improving! I get a lot of compliments all the time on my skin. LOVE THAT!</li>
            <li> I am completely head over heels with this BB cream. For about four months earlier this year, my skin had been absolutely horrible. It was breaking out constantly, then drying out, then breaking out again, and I couldn&#x27;t seem to tame it no matter what I did.    Then I stumbled upon: [...]. (This website is amazing and has all kinds of great information about all kinds of beauty products.)Anyway, I read about Skin79&#x27;s BB cream in this article: [...] and took a good look at all the different BB creams out there and decided to try the hot pink one.    This stuff has really transformed my skin. It behaves now! It is clear, never dries out, and has a very natural, healthy look with this BB cream on. I LOVE IT. You will not be sorry if you buy it if your skin is combination/dry like mine.    Go check out the article listed above and take a look at all the different BB creams to find the best one for your skin type! OR, if you want to try Skin79&#x27;s brand (which I highly recommend) they have a chart here:[...] where you can take a look at all the different BB creams they make and for what skin types. GOOD STUFF!!!</li>
            <li> It Is A very good product , the right shade and got to me in no time . love it . :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and I got hooked by trying the samples....it does what it says. The reason I have to take away one star is because it contains 3 different parabens, as well as BHT, butyl acetate, and a few other not-so-good ingredients. Unfortunately, you don&#x27;t see the ingredient list until you receive the product (full size; sample size is in Korean only). The Amazon site does not publish an ingredient list. If they took those away, this would be a perfect product. Like I said, this product does what it says, so I give it 4 stars, minus one for the bad chemicals. Ordering from Pink Gellee was a good experience, and I&#x27;m hoping to be able to return the product for one without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE -- February 9th, 2013: Just wanted to add that the company would NOT let me return an opened product....disappointing. I&#x27;m still using it daily 4 months later (it lasts!) b/c I really do love the air-brushed look it gives my skin, but again, won&#x27;t be re-purchasing because if the \\&quot;bad chemicals\\&quot; it contains. Looking for a healthier version.</li>
            <li> Let me start by say this is the first time I ever used a bb cream. I did not ever where any kind of coverup or foundation in my life. I am 35 yrs old but look very young. I have suffered with oily skin all my life. I did not apply lotion on my skin for many years because it always made my face oily and then would break out. As I hit my early 30s I notice my face had got dull and my pores bigger. I tried many products out the for my pore problem and it just never work. I had read in a magazine that bb cream not only was good for pores but your over all skin care. I did some researh and read that american bb creams were to oily and you need to apply face powder.That made me nerves.So I did a check one life for the best bb cream and pink came up. At first I was alittle nerves because of all the makeup in the cream,but I was wrong. This is the best face cream I have ever used in my life.My skin is brighter and most of all my pores are getting small.I am so glad I ordered tis product . My skin is looking good now not shady. Pink is the best</li>
            <li> I am Native American and this stuff evens my skin tone and makes my skin silky smooth. I have super sensitive skin and worried this would make me break out, but I have been using it for 4 weeks now and can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this. I dot my nose, forehead, chin, and cheeks and blend. I then spot treat by patting it in problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WIll not use anything else from now on :)</li>
            <li> First of all, the package came in really on time, and it was packed securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time that i&#x27;ve ever purchased this product. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, so I can&#x27;t say if it works for me, but I did try putting a little bit on my wrist. It smells so nice. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this for my mom. If I see any improvement on my skin, I&#x27;ll go back and post another review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to foundation! I love this BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;Pros; it looks completely natural, never cakey.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very smooth and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;Blends like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;Great benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Very hygienic, because of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;Has alot of product in package.&lt;br /&gt;Travel safe.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting. (about 6 to 7 hours)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons; It smells a little bit like sunscreen and flowers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little gray, but the gray tint fades once it oxidizes.&lt;br /&gt;It only comes in one color.&lt;br /&gt;Very light coverage (but can be used with concealer for extra coverage)</li>
            <li> The coverage was ok, not as good as other products I have used but it was a good light coverage. It did, however, cause me to breakout horribly on my forehead. I tend to have slightly sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, but my breakouts are hormonal and only happen along my jawline. So I wasn&#x27;t too happy when I woke up after about 3 days of use to find that I now have to battle acne on my forehead too! Within a day or 2 of stopping use the bumps went away completely. Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
            <li> I am sure am going to purchase other pieces of this product ... this is the first time I try such a good foundation. Morover this is my first time to put a cream that doesn&#x27;t make my face shine ... and it covers the spots in a good way!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It covers my acne scars and pores making my skin look smooth and air brushed. I still use concealer under my eyes and finish it off with e.l.f. HD powder. It lasts all day with a nice matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any skin improvements like the other reviewers but I am still very pleased!</li>
            <li> When the product came, I tested it on the back of my hand. I was worried about the gray color that other reviewers mentioned. The product definitely is gray, but once it is blended into your skin, it&#x27;s totally fine. The coverage was pretty good. I din&#x27;t use it on my face (I&#x27;ll tell you why in a second), but comparing the back of one hand to the other, there was a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the problem was the fragrance. It os VERy strong. Like I said, it was on my hand and it was STILL overpowering - even hours later. The fragrance is kind of a generic lotion fragrance...maybe like Vaseline intensive care, but STRONG, as I may have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I can&#x27;t use the product. I can&#x27;t even imagine how the smell would be if it was right on my face. I think I&#x27;ll try to give it away.</li>
            <li> I used BB cream from Clinique because I love their facial products. My friend has this brand and told me to try it because I wanted one to give me a little better coverage and to feel better on my face. I am not disappointed, I will be buying again and will not be using a different type of cream. They have a lifelong user from me.</li>
            <li> I never leave any reviews for products but I feel that I really need to brag about this one. Its awesome! It goes on evenly and it doesnt make your face look cakey like other brands do. I have received so many compliments since I started using it. Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t adjust as it claims. It&#x27;s just a one color fits all, I feel like if my skin just absorbs the product and that&#x27;s why my color shines through. I have a yellow undertone to my skin, I&#x27;m Hispanic, 24 yr old, n this did not match my skin. I am breaking out, which i do when i switch anything on my face. I have acne prone skin n this seems to irritate my skin. U will need to use an oil absorbing powder on top of this. I used bronzed on top to help my skin look more like me. Product is a medium coverage.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break my face out. The tint has a grey hue, which makes my skin tone dull looking, overall it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Within two days my face at red itchy patches that took a week to heal. I had to use prescription steroid cream to heal it. I would say for oily skin this might be and OK product, but for dry or combination skin, forget it. The Maybeline one works great for half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to BB cream but this has definitely improved the texture of my skin compared to just using moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve always stayed away from other brands because I&#x27;m Filipino and have a lot of yellow in my skintone so I have a hard time matching makeup products.  This one advertises a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; agent which is popular amongst pale skinned Asians.  Still, the creme itself comes out a muddy-clay color and takes a while to blend into my skin.  I like all the nutrients because it has drastically improved my skin, but after 3 months it hasn&#x27;t done anything to keep my oily skin under control.  But I got this for a steal so it was definitely worth trying, maybe I&#x27;ll explore their other products to see if they have anything to specifically target my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I had bought this for myself but after using it it broke me out and made me oily.I had gave it to my mom to try and she loved it . it has very light coverage so if you have acne or anything you want to cover up this won&#x27;t do the job.If you have dry/normal skin and have no blemishes this would work for you .</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great with my light skin. Make sure when you put it on dont use very much. A little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> When you first apply it has a grey tinge to it but after I rubbed it in it matched my skin perfectly. I have very oily skin and normally I can&#x27;t wear BB creams or even foundation without breaking out. This stuff is perfect. It didn&#x27;t break me out and my face didn&#x27;t get oily even after wearing it all day outside (I live in Florida). The coverage is so good that I didn&#x27;t need foundation either. If your concerned about the whitening effect, don&#x27;t be. I am caucasian with pale skin and the whiting effect seemed to only even out my skin. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used foundation or anything like that in the past so I decided to buy this after seeing so many great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a medium-light, combo/oily skinned, Asian teenage female. The cream is mostly suited for light light medium. (A few shades lighter than me...but I still use it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Controls oil..for a while (Coming from a person with really oily skin by the end of the day!)&lt;br /&gt;- No one will notice that you are wearing anything on your face&lt;br /&gt;- Not cakey AT ALL unlike most foundations (This is one main reason why I like it so much)&lt;br /&gt;- SPF!!!&lt;br /&gt;- Smooth texture on skin&lt;br /&gt;- Consistency may be thick at first, but it spreads on very lightly&lt;br /&gt;- Coverage is not too light, not too heavy (Perfect for me because I have light acne scars)&lt;br /&gt;- Smells cute (Doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals and stuff)&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t clog pores (Or at least I don&#x27;t think it did!)&lt;br /&gt;- Anti-wrinkle properties (I don&#x27;t know about this yet because I&#x27;m only 17.)&lt;br /&gt;- Primer&lt;br /&gt;- Evens out my skintone&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use container&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Only one shade (Medium skinned people, don&#x27;t use this...you may need to apply another darker powder foundation above it)&lt;br /&gt;- Color tends to fade away (After 5 hours or so, the cream just matches in with my regular skin color)&lt;br /&gt;- Oil control is alright (I start oiling after 2 hours or so... which is reasonable...because my skin is stubborn. I still have to use blotting sheets though.)&lt;br /&gt;- MAY clog some of larger pores so BE SURE YOU WASH THAT STUFF OFF COMPLETELY!!! (Use those clarisonic cleansers or similar)&lt;br /&gt;- It has parabens... and some other ingredients that are a bit ~questionable~ (I don&#x27;t know how I feel about this...)&lt;br /&gt;- If applied on dry skin (like right after you wash your face), it may look a bit weird... so moisturize before you apply it&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t know how much I have left because the container isn&#x27;t clear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; *** Also, BEWARE of fakes being sold on here or anywhere else!!! I bought mine from NEVERPRICE, and it is AUTHENTIC!  ***</li>
            <li> I am a mid-twenties Caucasian F with combination skin. Have had issues with adult-onset acne and have been battling it for a few years.  Now that I feel like I have it reasonably under control, I set out to find an alternative to foundation, as I felt sure use of heavy make-ups (no matter the brand) was contributing to my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, this BB cream is great.  I do agree with other reviewers who say it has too much of a &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; tone to it.  Even once you pat it on and blend it, it still carries a hint of a gray.  Maybe for a naturally darker-complected person it would be perfect.  Otherwise, it really does work to even skin tone and give your complexion a healthy, dewy look.  Not only is the cream itself smooth and even, it also seems to help smooth and even out your natural skin during the day while you wear it.  When I rinse it off with warm water at night, I notice my skin is moisturized and dark spots have lightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- I can sleep in it without breaking out&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t look cakey and unnatural in sunlight&lt;br /&gt;- I prefer it infinitely to foundation&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to improve my skin rather than harm it&lt;br /&gt;- A very small amount goes a looonggg way&lt;br /&gt;- Price is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Grayish tone&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly greasy to the touch (but can be set with powder easily)&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t stay put maybe as well as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I haven&#x27;t had a single skin reaction, and I believe it to be genuine product. I love the coverage and the way it goes on my skin. It goes on feeling more like a moisturizer than a foundation. It gives a beautiful finish and nice medium coverage. It does go on just a little gray to begin with but in just a few minutes it blends nicely. I told my mother in law about it and she just got her order in today. The only reason I took off one star is that I do find that by the end of the day it definitely needs some touching up but I have yet to find a foundation that doesn&#x27;t! I do feel my skin looks more uniform and some of the blotchiness I had has calmed down. I like to think that it&#x27;s helping my wrinkles but I am not really sure on that! haha. I do think that it does a better job of not settling into lines and wrinkles like other products I have used. I will keep using this product and might even try some of the other Skin79 versions of BB cream.</li>
            <li> Said enough about the product but I add: it truly works! All positive that had been written above is true for my skin. Even my mother asked me to order it for her, so it works perfectly the same way for the skin over 40 as it does for the skin around 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was even faster than was expected. Besides, i got little free-try of SKIN79 BB Cream VIP Gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely recommend it to anybody and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching all of the different BB creams listed on Amazon and having been disappointed with a BB cream from a well known cosmetic company quite frankly did not know what to expect.  I noted the large number of positive reviews for Skin 79 Pink Label and decided to give it a try.  I was absolutely delighted.  It is light and easy to apply and a little seems to go a long way.  The coverage is good enough to reduce the appearance of minor imperfections such as old acne scars and uneven skin tone.  I wore it on a winter vacation to Hawaii instead of sunscreen most days with a large floppy hat without any problems.  I am 56 years old of Scandinavian ancestry and found that the tone was just fine. I have noticed that my as I have used it for the past two months, the unevenness in my skin tone is lessened and smaller wrinkles are less noticeable. I asked my husband what he thought of my complexion after using the product and he felt that my skin looks brighter.  What I also noticed about this product unlike the regular liquid foundation that I had always used, is that it does not turn orangey during the course of the day or cause your skin to get overly shiny.  All in all I am most satisfied.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;nice texture&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t feel heavy/absorbs into skin nicely&lt;br /&gt;stays put, even when sweating&lt;br /&gt;keeps my very oily skin under control (I used to blot my face every 20 minutes, no joke, now it&#x27;s only about once every hour or 2)&lt;br /&gt;good base for foundation&lt;br /&gt;covers redness and minor imperfections&lt;br /&gt;does NOT make me break out&lt;br /&gt;not too expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;too light for certain skintones (I mix mine with Lancôme 24hr foundation to get the right color)&lt;br /&gt;settles into fine lines and wrinkles (i make sure to not put any around my laugh lines)...but it&#x27;s supposed to reduce wrinkles eventually?&lt;br /&gt;not to be used for &amp;#34;full coverage&amp;#34; - my freckles and acne still show through, which is why I mix with foundation</li>
            <li> I love BB cream, because it replaces foundation and concealer (at least for me)... but I have been using this product for a very long time now (at least 1 year) and it hasn&#x27;t done anything amazing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous!!!!! Firstly, I have oily/acne prone skin and still suffer from breakouts in my mid 20s and I have tried everything from proactive to expensive full coverage makeup to try to fix/cover my acne and scarring. This product has blown my mind. It&#x27;s thick enough to provide full coverage but it&#x27;s not heavy. I do have to say it looked grayish going on but blended beautifully to match my light olive skin. After my first use I was impressed by how amazing it feels when you put it on! I have used $100+ creams that didn&#x27;t feel so luxurious on my skin. Immediately, my skin felt soft &amp; silky AND looked amazing like I had perfect skin without makeup!!! Impressive, right? Well it gets better! After washing my face that night I noticed my skin felt like I just got a facial and the more I used it, the more benefits I noticed! After just two weeks I can already see that my old acne scars are disappearing right before my eyes and my skin is supple and clearer than its been since puberty!!! Best product I have ever used by far!!!!!</li>
            <li> The moment I got it, it covered my blemishes and made my skin feel really light. It&#x27;s not at all heavy like foundation but recently I noticed that the cream won&#x27;t come out from the pump anymore. Maybe, it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s winter and everything is clumped up but for those looking to invest in this beware!</li>
            <li> It is quite amazing. Better than what I expected. I think I will continue using it in the future. lol</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this cream or something else but as soon as I started using it, my acne cleared up.  I&#x27;ve had acne all of my life too!  It&#x27;s been amazing.  It goes on a little light for my skin tone so I mix it with another BB that&#x27;s darker.  This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> It takes something spectacular to make me write a review, and this product falls in that category. I had heard about this on a radio commercial and thought I would research it a bit. I came on Amazon and thought I would try the Pink Label Triple Function. I am 54 years old and STILL get acne breakouts, to say I have combination skin is a cop out. I am caucasion,and have been a Sun worshipper at times throughout my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you need to &amp;#34;Pat&amp;#34; it on. It will go on gray but blend in with your own skin tone. (Mine is white,white, could you be anymore white). It covers all the little broken veins that are starting in my cheeks, undereye circles, blemishes what have you. I have huge pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for 14 days now. I can&#x27;t find my pores. My skin feels like it did when I was 30. I have beginning wrinkles that are becoming invisible. I am a Pet Groomer and I wear makeup everyday to protect my skin from Hair, germs, flying poo, what have you. My face does not itch anymore when I do cats. I take it off at night with a mild cleanser and my face looks almost as good as when I had it on. I have used Lancome for 15 years. This beats it by miles. I tried some on my 77 year old Mother and after just wearing it one day, she begged me to order some for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold. I don&#x27;t even care what&#x27;s in it. It&#x27;s working and at my age, thank God something does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> After using this BB cream twice, I think it&#x27;s pretty good. The color is a good match for my skin. Im a more Yellowstone skin color. I like it better than the Misha BB cream I have, This one has a very settle essence, not strong compared to the Misha. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily even though I have combo skin. Overall, it&#x27;s a good BB cream. The price is low compared to american brand bb cream. The only thing I wish it had a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> I saw such great reviews I had to try this BB cream. Other BB creams and concealers left my skin dry, gave little coverage, and were expensive. I just use this in the under eye and nose area and it gives nice coverage.  To apply I pat on and let it sit, it seems like it takes a few minutes to absorb, and then I smooth with a cosmetic sponge. It looks a liittle gray at first, but blends nicely. I finish my nose area with a little mineral foundation and very light powder. For the price this is a great deal and product. The container has a pump and it looks nice, unlike other products in tubes. I have found that since I gotten a little older that less is more, as far as make up goes, and this reaaly works for me.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about which products I put on my skin and do a lot of research before buying any product. I had heard about BB creams and thought they were the same as the tinted lotion foundations. Boy was I wrong and so glad too! The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. They also added two sample packets one was this product and the other was the gold. I tried the pink first and was really happy with it but wish I had tried the gold first because I liked it even better on my skin. However the pink is awesome too so I am completely happy with it. I guess we each have to find what works best for our skin type. The pink looks beautiful on my skin (I am fair skinned w/ blonde hair &amp; blue eyes) and i can tell after just 5 uses that it&#x27;s actually improving the condition of my skin. It looks very light, natural, and gives a flawless appearance. The pink gives a little heavier coverage whereas the gold is a little lighter coverage. They both are awesome and I will continue to use Skin79 BB creams. Thamks:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a make up artist and work for a very well known cosmetics company which also has a beauty balm of sorts. I LOVE this product. Great coverage, great wear, and amazing finish. This product feels light on the skin, and manages to wear well through the work day.&lt;br /&gt;People have also commented on how my skin has improved and looks more radiant since I have been wearing this product.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that I do not have to use a gross amount of the product in application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wear a moisturizer and transparent powder on top to help with wear. I also use a brush that is a combo of natural and synthetic hairs. I have dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this in high hopes. I thought it may replace my foundation. However, I found it is juat a tinted moisturizer, it cannot cover the red sports at all. simply wast money.</li>
            <li> I have given up liquid foundation completely. I use this, which gives very light coverage. And I use bare minerals powder foundation over it and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> My favorite product. I was using Fit Me by Maybelline, and I had really bad breakouts with it, but it&#x27;s cleared up ever since I started using BB Cream. It makes my skin look so nice. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I thought that this product sounded too good to be true and I was right.  The look was alright, it was convenient not to have to use my sunscreen along with this or moisturizer/etc.  I&#x27;m paying for having tried this for a week.  Broke me out!  Skin is still *in recovery mode*.  Granted, I do have very sensitive skin.  The look was ok, not great.  Made me moire oily than usual  after a few hours...  Regret trying this.</li>
            <li> nice bottle ,and very even, not oily, i tried so many BB cream, and this one ,skin79 is on my top list</li>
            <li> First of all this product came really fast!&lt;br /&gt;But let me tell you a little it about my skin type so you can decide to b this based on if you have similar skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am light to fair skinned, Caucasian, and I have always had mild to moderate acne with some days no breakouts. I&#x27;m 27 and have been through cystic pimples as well as white heads and blackheads. The point is I have acne scars on my cheeks. I also have visible pores in my t zone and tend to be on the oily side.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other bb creams but haven&#x27;t cared for them, from garnier, to brands sold out sephora, they haven&#x27;t wowed me and are on the expensive end.&lt;br /&gt;This does have a gray tint to it as others have said and it was a bit of a turn off, but I read from others that you just have to blend it in which is true. After I blended it, I found that it matched my skin pretty well actually. I almost felt as if I didn&#x27;t even need additional foundation, but I do like full coverage for my acne scars so it&#x27;s a good set up for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I also thought it was creamy, soft and light. I didn&#x27;t feel like I had some heavy product on my face, and it also didn&#x27;t make my face oily or shiny,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product to see what kind of improvements I will see in my skin. I will try to update this in a few weeks if I start noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I should have known, the price was too good to be true. If you go out to the product&#x27;s website it will show you how to tell if your product is a fake. Specifically, the sticker of authenticity will show a grey \\&quot;watermark\\&quot; in the background once compromised. This was a very good fake with no other obvious \\&quot;tells\\&quot; outside of the sticker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-20s with slightly oily skin that occasionally breaks out. This works wonderfully! My skin is fair, and this adjusted well to my skin tone. It provides some coverage (more than a tinted moisturizer, less than a foundation). I usually apply powder once about halfway through the day, but other than that, I don&#x27;t notice shine. Also, it shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I like how the product applies, but I wish it was more pigmented for I am of a naturally tan skin tone. Sender responded to my order immediately, I would say they are dependable.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks, I&#x27;m seeing major improvements in my skin.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t melt away in the southern humidity. My only warning, do not use it with coconut oil, it wouldn&#x27;t adhere and just started peeling.  Will definitely be trying the other types in the line.</li>
            <li> It has a good coverage without feeling stuffy. Quite light weight for my oily/combination skin. It matches my skin tone pretty well, although whitens my face. You don&#x27;t need a lot to apply the entire face/neck.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! AMAZING! I will never use another foundation or cream. This is it for me :) It provides full coverage without feeling caked on. Lasts all day long. My skin never brakes out with this foundation. Need I say more? BUY this!!</li>
            <li> Well since I am a light latina this BB cream blends in perfectly with my skin and it is not a knock off its just great.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Blends very well, has 3 products in one. Will certainly purchase this product again, do not have to use much at all! Thank you, L.C.</li>
            <li> Saw this product recommended on several beauty blogs and tried a sample before buying the big bottle. Definitely for fair skin only. Goes on ashy but oxidizes to match your skin tone after a few minutes. Does not leave my oily t-zone too shiny. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Korean BB cream that I have used.  It&#x27;s perfect for my skin (fair Asian).  I have sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t give me any problems.  I never liked wearing foundations because I don&#x27;t like the make up look.  I love the fact that this cream doesn&#x27;t make your face look like made up.  I tried on one side of the face and I see the difference!  It makes my skin looks smoother and more flawless.  I have read some reviews that people have gotten fake BB creams from Amazon.  I am so glad that I bought from Tokyo Japanese outlet. This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> In brief:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a&lt;br /&gt;  fair to medium complexion with yellow undertones&lt;br /&gt;  not too many imperfections (this is not a concealer)&lt;br /&gt;  NOT sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;and don&#x27;t care about parabens and such get this. It&#x27;s a value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, on to my review. I agree with most 5 star reviews written here. I used it avidly for a month and here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s a dream to put on&lt;br /&gt;  Actually blends to match your tone within reasonable limits (it is slightly grayish on me so I tend to put small amounts on so that it can oxidize properly)&lt;br /&gt;  For being oily when it goes on, it actually controls oil pretty well (your face won&#x27;t have a perfect matte finish all day but you won&#x27;t be extremely shiny either).&lt;br /&gt;  It stays on&lt;br /&gt;  It is really convenient&lt;br /&gt;  It has 15 natural ingredients!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it has some problems, so I decided to give up using it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It feels too oily at first (and if you slap on too much before running out the door you will feel gross for a couple of hours)&lt;br /&gt;  I had some problems with it after a couple of uses and my face completely dried up. I used it on top of Clinique moisture surge and it worked better. (I have combination towards oily skin)&lt;br /&gt;  Because of the oily consistency I noticed I occasionally get pimples on hot days (It doesn&#x27;t let your face breath so go figure)&lt;br /&gt;  It contains about 40 un-natural products including Triclosan, parabens and BHT&lt;br /&gt;  It smells- i.e. it contains perfume-it&#x27;s really girly and I guess it could be pleasant, I just don&#x27;t like it because I feel cheap wearing it (think Victoria&#x27;s Secret type vanilla-y smell or Bath and Body Works- if you smell like that you&#x27;ll like this)&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t see a considerable improvement in my skin (well, since I had to peel off the dead skin after it dried my face, I had soft skin for 2 weeks, but again, indirectly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, obviously, I was not expecting an all natural, vegan friendly, packaged in 100% recycled plastic product. I placed it at overpriced drug store level. The main issue I have with it is that I started reading the ingredients list when I got it, and by being so excited I saw so many natural extracts, I just went ahead and tried it. You can imagine how my excitement disappeared when I reread that list a few days later to figure out what was causing my skin to freak out. So, I hate to break it to you but all the \\&quot;traditional korean ingredients\\&quot; are pure gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 3 stars? Because I tried all of the western and most of the Korean more expensive BB creams and this one does its job the best: best coverage without looking like foundation.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write review but I have to let people know how great this BB cream is. I am almost 20, Asian, oily skin with blemishes here and there (not that bad but not great either). I did my research (battling between Skin 79 Hot Pink and Missha&#x27;s) before purchasing this. I use my hand to apply this and I think the result is great; it have a medium coverage that mildly cover up my acne scars and brighten up my face. It&#x27;s a small bottle but for me, I only have to use half a pump to cover up my entire face, a full pump if I want to pile it up (doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference i.m.o). Ever since I got this I uses it every day, so easy to apply and it just look so natural! I love it!</li>
            <li> It really didn’t fit my skin , although I was so excited to try it . My skin is mixed ,  BUT it start to break out after the 2nd day. I didn’t want to try it longer because I usually don’t break out with foundations easily ,  so I was surprise and stopped using it . WASTE OF MONEY .</li>
            <li> I obviously ordered the pink label bb cream but when i got the package, to my disappointment, they sent me the orange one. I would have returned it but i was not going to deal with shipping it back and not be sure of getting a refund since they couldn&#x27;t even send me the right bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So of course i tried the orange bottles bb cream and I have to say it was bad. Made my face look gray and colorless and even waiting for it to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t help. I even tried to cover it up with my normal foundation and it was still gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, especially this seller.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I received today and OMG I am so happy! I tried it on and wow it does really work with my skin. I love it how it blends with my skin and makes my face look whiter and my face appears glowy. I love this bb cream so far. I hope that I will never RUN out haha because if i do, then I will have to restock!! I can see a total difference on my face. I can&#x27;t wait to fully try it out with my make up on too!!Love this so much! SO GLAD that I bought it!!</li>
            <li> it is really good . I love it . it is worth to buy.A lot of my friends use it</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the gold one after reading all the great reviews. I have light to medium color skin with yellow under tones. This made me look Gray and ashy and i waited all afternoon for this to normalize, nope....I looked like I had sunscreen on and anemic! Not a good look. Disappointed in my purchase. May be people who left reviews have light pale skin? Dont know but I wont wear it.</li>
            <li> ive used the etude house bb cream and though id try this one but it doesnt justice like etude house.</li>
            <li> After hearing about how much better Korean BB Creams were than Western ones, I decided I needed a Skin79 BB. I like to read reviews before I buy any product, online or not, and I was bummed to learn that a lot of people had come across fake BB Creams that made them break out. I dedicated weeks to watching Youtube video and reading about how to tell the difference between the real and fake bottles/packaging. I wasn&#x27;t savvy enough (or at all) in Korean to navigate their official site, so I turned to Amazon and eBay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews for Pink Gelee&#x27;s product say theirs were fake, but I emailed the shop owner with my concerns, placed the order, and took a leap of faith. A week later, it was in my mailbox and I was swatching it on my hand and slathering on my face. The consistency is awesome and the coverage is amazing. It&#x27;s initially not as grey as everyone makes it out to be, but it fades to match your skin tone (for lighter skinned individuals) in no time. I ran the package through every test I could think of, just waiting for a slip up from the manufacturer. Waiting for it to be fake: Color of the box, perforated side, spelling mistakes, font size/boldness, pump style, how easily the letters scratch off, barcode placement, &amp;#34;void&amp;#34;/seal of quality sticker: it all passed. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. If you&#x27;re reading these reviews because you&#x27;re looking for the real deal, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was also nice enough to include samples of Heynature BB Black Diamond Moist Tightening Blemish Base and Aqua Brightening Gel. I haven&#x27;t tried either of them out yet, but I was happy they were included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I am head over heels in love with this BB Cream and will absolutely be back here to repurchase when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve permanently switched from my tinted moisturizer to this BB cream. It&#x27;s a perfect match to my skin color. It&#x27;s not too greasy and it&#x27;s also a great base if you do decide to use makeup over it. I also have sensitive skin and this BB cream hasn&#x27;t caused any blemishes. Some days I just wear this cream and go without makeup and friends have told me they can&#x27;t tell the difference. I hope they never stop selling this product b/c I&#x27;m a lifer now.</li>
            <li> Review the information on how to tell if this product is real or fake, and you will see it is a fake.  Like others have said, how can they, and so many other sellers, sell this product at a price so cheap?  We have a real one bought from the company&#x27;s website and they are different as is the packaging.</li>
            <li> This BB cream certainly does a great job of evening skin tone and hiding blemishes.  I&#x27;m very white though, and I think that it would have been a better match if it were just a bit lighter.  Can&#x27;t match every one all the time ;)</li>
            <li> Saw some reviews and had much higher hopes for this.  It is a little grey so is not as great as could be, but it does make skin feel soft and is ok for a light coverage.</li>
            <li> I have read the rumors about this being a fake product. I don&#x27;t think this is a fake.  I was using it pretty heavy.  My theory is if a little bit is good than mass quantities must better.  Yes, that has gotten me into tons of trouble many times but will I learn!! No.  Anyway, it made my face very red the same as Retina cream use to do.  I now use it lightly and don&#x27;t really get the redness but it has made a difference in fading any spots and fine lines.  I absolutely hate foundation. This is not like that. You don&#x27;t feel it on at all. It doesn&#x27;t look fake. It just blends right in and does its thing.&lt;br /&gt;If you are concerned about wrinkles I have to say that I have had interesting results from the inside out.  Look at this chart on Chinese face reading: http://www.positivehealth.com/article/chinese-oriental-medicine/chinese-face-reading-for-health&lt;br /&gt;I use acupuncture a lot. Skin problems is kidney issues. Who knew! As we have been treating that I noticed wrinkles go away. I notice some show up with pretty deep groves in which now I know there is a health issue going on. Especially if it is an &#x27;over night wrinkle&#x27;.  Over all I look way younger than I am. I would say all this is why.  If I&#x27;m not going to acupuncture I use this tea to help: http://orientalwellness.tk/  I get amazing results with this.  Especially for sinus and asthma. What I like about Chinese medicine is it is &#x27;balanced&#x27; There will not be side effects or lack of energy. This was all just a side note to skin observations.&lt;br /&gt;The product, to repeat myself, is good Does that it says.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research about bb creams. i got great reviews about this one and decided to try it out. Thought maybe the ones more expensive has better ratings and better works. But decided to try it out this one even the price is less than others. And i cannot be happier with my decision. I was so pleased with this product, i will order it again. very pleasant smell, blends so beutifull, color just vanishes leaving your skin smooth and even toned. It does not have complete coverage but this is excellent for everyday use. I even used on my full coverage powder just to get some natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the product i will be recomending.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily t zone and this seemed to make it worse. I was hoping that since everyone seemed to say this was a bit matte that it would help. I know this is not meant to be an oil control type of product but the fact that it made it worse is weird. It did make my face white in strange way, i didn&#x27;t particularly like it. I am fairly light so it&#x27;s not that it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone (in fact it did very well) it&#x27;s just it made my face a bit strange looking in my opinion. I will say it does feel very light on the my face, i did have to wear powder over it though and blush to kind of make everything blend in nicely. I didn&#x27;t get any weird reaction to it like some people did which is good. But i&#x27;m just not a fan. I feel like I could&#x27;ve bought something way cheaper than this and it would&#x27;ve done just fine. This product really does absolutely nothing for me. I will not be buying again. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because I like the way it feels on my skin, very light and also shipping was amazingly quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for her birthday and she loves it!!!  I&#x27;m planning on getting her a second bottle just in case the price goes up when she runs out of her bb cream.</li>
            <li> I want to be so in love with this product. I have fair skin and the color corrects perfectly to my tone. I can&#x27;t believe how much product is in the package. Only half a pump is enough to cover the whole face + neck. There is no smell to it (something I prefer) and the coverage is light to medium, which is what BB&#x27;s should be. This BB is much better than the U.S &amp;#34;brands&amp;#34; (which are just tinted moisturizers). The only problem is that it seems to break me out on my forehead and chin area. I used process of elimination for all my products, and unfortunately this is the culprit. Once I get my face back to normal I may try again. Or may end up trying Mischa B</li>
            <li> The product makes my skin look dewey, gives medium coverage, and feels really comfortable. I&#x27;m asian and have medium tone combination skin. So glad I went with this product! Really great buy and I think will work well for Asians who have light-medium skin tones</li>
            <li> PROS: I like this creme much more than the Missha M. Although the SPF is lower it&#x27;s coverage is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: SPF a bit low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being burned with fake BB Cremes before, I get a bit worried ordering this from Amazon. I bought it from seller earlybirdstart and it&#x27;s the real stuff so I&#x27;ll probably stick with this seller if buying from Amazon (unless I see guarantees else where that it is genuine).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mineral powder foundation for many years but at age 60 wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t settle in my fine lines and creases after a few hours. I have combination normal/oily skin, still prone to occasional blemishes, and quite oily in the humid summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched a you-tube video, but the first time I used a bit too much and didn&#x27;t let it dry between layers. It became visible in my creases after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I used slightly less than a pea-sized amount, dotted it on &amp; lightly spread it. I let that dry and applied again, using even less. I found that by very lightly pressing it into my skin with my hands or a fine, dry makeup sponge it melted right into my skin. When completely dry, I could see it evened out my color and covered large pores on my nose. Then I brushed on a bit of Everyday Minerals Finishing Dust to set it. Wonderful results! No glow but not perfectly matte either. BTW I also used Neutrogena Naturals Multivitamin Nourishing Moisturizer underneath it all - letting that dry before I started and the BB went on smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it when temps were in the 80&#x27;s and humid and am delighted that my shiny break-through (normally happens within a couple of hours) never did occur. Although it felt a bit oily when first applied, after it completely dried it was fine. And I like the softer look on my aging skin better than the dry look I got from mineral makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complexion is fair with neutral undertones and my natural hair color is/was medium auburn. I found this BB cream suits my coloring well, without adding any pink tones. I love that it covers so well without looking like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup. I highly recommend this it!</li>
            <li> I tried both this and MISSHA M Perfect Cover (No 21), and I&#x27;ve been told by multiple people that this one looks better. It matched my skin tone well, blended in nicely, and had a dewy, brightening finish.</li>
            <li> Love the product! I like that it leaves my face feeling soft and it is not heavy at all on my face</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;darker&amp;#34; korean skin.  I don&#x27;t tan but I&#x27;m not bleached white.  It matches well.  It&#x27;s very matted so I do finished it with a powder to add depth to my face and contour.  It doesn&#x27;t make me breakout or anything.  It don&#x27;t feel very heavy and it goes on well.  I little goes a very long way.  I have medium coverage and covers a pimple fairly well I just dab a little on the spot and let it sit and dry a little before i blend.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the cream itself, but the container?  Not so much.  The tiny little dispenser clogged very early on, and would squirt out in odd directions (small enough not to cause a mess, but wasteful for sure).  I managed to keep it operating for about 1/3 of the container, and then it just plain stopped.  Today, there was \\&quot;surgery\\&quot; to remove the parts, and though it was not easy, I managed to transfer the rest (using a small paintbrush and a lot of patience)into another container, wasting some that had dried out from when it got clogged, but still salvaging a decent amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cream, it&#x27;s pretty decent stuff, but the ordeal to get to it has not been much fun.</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream. It makes my skin looks, feels smoother and it&#x27;s very light, almost feeling like I&#x27;m not wearing it at all. The only thing is that after I apply my skin feels a bit dry, not sure why, perhaps I need to use more moisturizer underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Seller SeoulGlamour, 5-star for fast delivery. I received the item about a week before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who doesn&#x27;t like using her credit card online.&lt;br /&gt;Her skin does look noticeably nicer now! I&#x27;m no skin care expert, however.</li>
            <li> very good quality. i like the fact that this bb cream does not make your skin look too white like other bb creams i tried.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff did an excellent job evening out my skin tone while I was wearing it and after I took it off.  Excellent for very oily skin.  The only other BB cream I have used is Garnier and Skin79 is, by far, a superior product.  It went on lighter than Garnier and left my skin feeling less greasy.  Also, I like the dispenser, not just because it looks nice in your medicine cabinet, but it also does a good job controlling how much product is dispensed.  With BB cream, you only need a few tiny dabs to cover your whole face.  If you have oily skin, this is the BB cream for you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on anything elce this actually feels good to wear and makes skin so soft. deffitonley going to buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. I am fair skinned for those of you that are familiar with the BareMinerals foundation i wear the shade \\&quot;Fairly Light\\&quot; and this BB cream matches my skin EXACTLY, even better than my foundation. It is a little bit thick but i have dry skin as well so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I would say this delivers light-medium coverage. I apply one layer all over my face with my fingers and then i will take a little bit more and tap it onto places i need a little more coverage. I really like that this has \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; benefits because i have lots of old acne marks. On a good skin day i can wear just this with a little blush and mascara for a flawless everyday look. Really happy with this BB cream i like it much better than the new drugstore ones that have recently come out like the ones by Maybelline and Loreal. They just aren&#x27;t as creamy as this one is. I am on my second bottle of this and plan on repurchasing when i start to run out again. I really like the pump on the bottle as well as the fact that you don&#x27;t even need to use and entire pump to cover your face, maybe about half. Lasts for months!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about three days now and I&#x27;ve already seen improvement in my skin tone and blemishes.  I&#x27;m using this with the face cleanser so that may have something to do with it as well.  The product is great.  You need less than a pump (which ends up being way less than dime size) to cover your entire face.  Though I wasn&#x27;t looking for a liquid foundation type of moisturizer it actually feels more like a moisturizer/base than a foundation.  It does look grey when you first apply it but with the addition of your own personal face powder it evens out well.  I have a naturally oily face and this product doesn&#x27;t make it more oily and actually controls some of it.  I&#x27;ve even skipped my usual face base because this product serves the same purpose even better.  Overall, I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend it to my other olive-toned friends.  I would like to see this product untinted so folks with different skin tones can use it.  I&#x27;m pretty fair now because it is winter, but I get pretty dark in the summer and would be disappointed if the tint doesn&#x27;t blend as well with my natural skin tone in the summer.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product. It makes your skin super soft and just melts in with your skin. So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge changes in my skins natural appearance, but when it&#x27;s on your skin you look luminous! Your skin practically glows! I would recommend setting it with a powder though, since it&#x27;s super creamy and has a tendency to kind of slide around. But that&#x27;s not really a big deal since most people use powders over their foundations anyways. The only thing I dislike about it is that it only comes in this one colour! If your kind of close to this colour, but it&#x27;s still a little too light (like me) you can just put a darker powder over it and it&#x27;s fine. But I can&#x27;t just wear it by itself:( Oh well! I still love it and will definitely be purchasing this again! Waaaaaaaay better than any BB Creams or tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve seen at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I paid total of $13.87, bought it from seoulglamour, shipped from Korea, it look exactly the same as the smaller one I bought in the Korean store in CA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a base with Baremineral, the combination gives a flawless natural look on my fair skin.  I tried it on back of my hand which is a shade darker, it blended in well, made the skin look smoother.  It feels light and keep the makeup in place, even when I sweat.  I think every female needs to find the perfect BB cream for herself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been super into make up. I buy concealers, foundation, blush, eye shadows, lip glosses etc. I used to never leave the house without some concealer and foundation on, because I was uncomfortable with my uneven skintone and some spots. This product looks great on my skin, and the color matches quite well. I have not used concealer or foundation in over a month now, and don&#x27;t see myself going back. It doesn&#x27;t cover 100% if you have acne or dark spots, so I could imagine myself wearing other make up for a photo shoot or a big occasion where lots of pictures would be taken. But other than that, this is all I need!! A little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0020ZEA40 SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream Triple Function ( Pink Label ) SPF25 PA++ 40g]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product just i love it</li>
            <li> This cream helped to fade years worth of acne scars! A must have as a primer or wear it alone as a tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much for me to add concerning the basics of this product: similar to a tinted moisturizer but with a \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; (tone balance) effect that provides slight to moderate natural looking coverage that&#x27;s best for light skin tones. This particular BB Cream is supposed to have sebum control and help minimize the look of wrinkles. It basically gives your face a photoshopped veil that covers minor imperfections. My favorite feature is that it barely (if at all) looks like you are wearing anything. If your coloring isn&#x27;t in line with asian skin, it will be more noticeable though. I am white with fairly pale skin. Skin79 states this product is not oil free but is non-comedogenic (this is not mentioned on their website but a representative on their facebook page confirmed). I&#x27;m not sure I buy that. If I use it regularly my skin issue do flare up. Granted, it can hide blemishes but it ultimately is only causing problems. But if I only use it here and there, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> US versions cannot hold a candle to this brand. If you want bb cream, this is the real deal, hands down, look no further.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a BB cream since the hit the U.S. I ordered this because of the high reviews. As other posters stated it is THICK. Almost like a paste, which makes it very difficult to blend. The cream just sat there, and made it feel like the skin couldn&#x27;t breathe. So I added a dab of moisturizer, which helped it blend easier, yet took away any chance at coverage. And then had to dust powder over to combat the shine from combining products.  My skin looked a little different. yet nothing that amazed me. Drugstore products do the same without the higher price tag. The packaging does work well, fits nice in the bathroom cabinet, &amp; doesn&#x27;t leak. Just wish what was inside was a little better. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Let my preface this by saying I have light skin, I usually wear the third lightest shade when choosing powders and foundations.  It is said that this will \\&quot;oxidize\\&quot; to your skin tone, and it does to a degree, but not enough.  I still have to use quite a bit of bronzer to look natural.  I just don&#x27;t personally care for the white face/darker body look.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this has lightened some dark spots and freckles on my face after about a month&#x27;s use.  I can&#x27;t say with any certainty that this did not break me out, because I think it did cause some blackheads in places I usually don&#x27;t get when I used it on a close to daily basis.  I have backed off to occasional use (2x week) and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  This is supposed to control sebum but after 6 hours I have a shiny t zone, so I am fearful it won&#x27;t hold up very well during the summer here in Texas, but I guess that remains to be seen.  Overall I like it but I am not sure I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> First let me tell you the type of skin I have:&lt;br /&gt;-Oily in the Tzone particular&lt;br /&gt;-Large pores on my nose&lt;br /&gt;-Excessive Sebum&lt;br /&gt;-Light olive tone&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. Its amazing! It starts off with a grey tone to it but give it a minute or two on your skin and it will blend to your tone. It smooths the texture of my skin especially my large pores. It controls the oils on my skin and gives me a matte yet healthy finish. It lasts for the whole day I have had it on for 12 hours or more. It does rub off easily, the up side to that is that is washes off easily too, it doesn&#x27;t leave residue in your pores or on your skin. Now its coverage is light to medium. You can apply a thin layer for days you don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage. Then on days you need more you can apply two thin layers to get that extra coverage. My skin is noticeably healthier. Everything from the texture, oil, and dark spots have evened out. The product lasts awhile I had my last bottle for two months or more. One down side is that its hard to tell when you are running low because of the bottle. Over all its great. It works for me, I wear it everyday. I have tried other BB creams, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I chose this bb cream because I was looking for a more affordable alternative to my $50 foundation for days when I don&#x27;t need it. Since trying it, I have been opting to use it instead of foundation on a regular basis! I have light combination skin that needs moisture and oil control at the same time. I just apply the BB cream like I would a moisturizer and brush on a translucent powder and I&#x27;m good to go. It provides light coverage with a dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems with break outs from this product, and I have acne prone skin. My skin loves it and so do I!</li>
            <li> It has such a pale undertone.. i&#x27;m very white, but i have a yellowy undertone and this just makes my face look grey</li>
            <li> i bought a hot pink bb cream from skin79northamerica and when they were sold out of this product, i decided to check amazon and i did end up purchasing a bottle. when i got it, the packaging looked identical to the one i bought from the skin79 site. so i was happy when i thought i bought the legit bb cream at very good price. but when i used it, it was awful. the color was lighter, the consistency of the cream was runnier than the original and it didn&#x27;t smell anything like the real bb cream. Also, when i applied it to my face, it didn&#x27;t blend well at all, there were streaks. Overall, i did not like this product at all. i don&#x27;t think this is the real skin 79 hot pink bb cream. the packaging was identical to the real skin 79 bb cream though.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, i really like the real skin 79 hot pink bb cream that i bought on the skin79nothamerica website and i don&#x27;t like the one sold on amazon, i do believe that it&#x27;s fake. sorry.</li>
            <li> The product did not work and did not last. I have oily skin/prone to acne and it made me break out.  I would apply it in the morning and my makeup on top and in a couple of hours my face was oily. It did not whiten skin and does not look like a fresh look. I didnt really like it.  I don’t really recommend this, don’t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop using this. I feel like I signed a deal with the devil - in exchange for perfect skin, you have to keep buying this BB cream forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried other BB creams from the drugstore but everyone kept saying that they were only tinted moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a superthick incredible cream for my face that makes me look 5 years younger. I gave it to my mother in her 40s and she said it made her feel like she was my age again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for several weeks and saw a big improvement in my skin. It looks lighter, cleaner, and no more breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference I have VERY oily skin and this was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did make sure to scrub my face every night because I think the thickness of the cream could cause breakouts if you get lazy and don&#x27;t remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the extra effort!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible and covers so much better than maybelline BB cream I had used. It goes on thicker and adjusts to your skin color, it stays on all day for me too...no touching up.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the bargain hunters on babycenter for this amazing find! :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a BB cream but was wary of the quality of mainstream US brands. I found this as a high-rated alternative &amp; am so glad I gave it a try. It&#x27;s just the right coverage without feeling too heavy &amp; makes my skin look nice when I don&#x27;t want to wear tons of makeup. Super blendable &amp; color matches perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than foundation.  My skin has never felt better.  I used it only a few times and bought more.  But be advised that they have  a fake  one that does not  meet t the standards of the real bb cream.  I received this within a week, thanks amazon.  I hope you will continue selling this product.  I have never been complimented as much as I have wearing this awesome bb cream.  Thanks!  Kudo&#x27;s to Skin79. I found my beauty secret.  Look for authenticity guarantee, to know  it&#x27;s the real stuff.  Loving it!</li>
            <li> The foundation is gave me skin smooth and moisturizer all day but I can&#x27;t use it cuz the color was too dark and they don&#x27;t have different color.</li>
            <li> I went with Korean brand BB cream as I tried 2 brands of American BB cream. The 2 I tried were Garnier and Loreal Youth code that I both purchased on Amazon. Along with this one I also purchased the Pink version of Skin79 BB cream. The 2 Korean BB creams were better in terms of texture, fragrance and end results. I had better coverage, felt like the cover matched better and didn&#x27;t notice any fragrance unlike the Garnier, which had a pretty strong medicine-y odor. The Korean BB creams also seemed to moisturize and smoother application, the Garnier &amp; Loreal seemed to dry out as the day went on so my face would look pretty shiny end of day. They also had a gunky application in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never wear make up but what I am pretty good about is putting on daily moisturizer/spf. BB cream is a great way for me to neutralize my skin tone without going the full blown make up route especially as I get older. A little product goes a long way and at first when you put it on, it seems too white but it definitely blends in after a little bit. To set it, I used the Skin79 Oriental Smooth Sun BB pact powder. I love that there is SPF, just can&#x27;t really figure out how SPF derived since no real ingredient list since it&#x27;s foreign product. The 2 Skin79 BB Creams (Pink &amp; VIP) are great but the main difference to me seems to be coverage. The Pink Bebesh creams gives you more sheer coverage if you want the more natural look while The VIP seems to be thicker coverage, perhaps more foundation in the components? So take your pick, I was perfectly happy with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used for about a week now. The 2 American BB creams I tried for a couple of months now before I stopped using.</li>
            <li> I ordered this BB Cream and the Gold Label, as well, by the same company. I had seen some videos on YouTube of Asian women using both of them, and, as an Asian woman myself who is knew to the world of BB Creams, wanted to try each. This one is my general go-to BB Cream for every day use. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a bit lighter and sheerer than the Gold Label, though it goes on just as smoothly and easily. It&#x27;s not as grey, either, so it wasn&#x27;t as surprising when I first used it. It provides good coverage - but my skin is generally tame with a bit of redness around the nose. So if you need more than just a general evening of your skin tone, I would recommend using the Gold Label as I felt like it was heavier. I love this BB Cream, and I can never go back to just using foundation!</li>
            <li> just love this product..leaves skin soft...good coverage...great with or without foundation....good to use alone during the spring and summer... a must have</li>
            <li> I have been using SKIN79 Triple Function BB cream for three months. I have tried every type of foundation out there (liquid, powder, mineral, mousse), looking for something that covers my acne scars and freckles. Most of the other products I tried wouldn&#x27;t cover enough so I&#x27;d have to really pack it on. Others were just too sheer to get any coverage at all. All too often, my makeup would look great once I put it on but at the end of the day my skin would be oily-looking on my T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon BB cream after looking into Asian beauty secrets. I love how it nourishes your skin and provides SPF 25. As far as I know, it only comes in one shade. It looks sort of gray when it comes out of the bottle but then it adjusts to my skin tone. I have very fair skin and it matches perfectly. However, I&#x27;m not sure if people with darker skin tones will be able to use this.&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my face with cleanser and follow with my lotion which has SPF 30. I apply the BB cream with my finger tips, putting a little more on my under eye circles and acne scars. It has a smooth, non-greasy feel to it and it soaks in nicely. At the end of the day, my face has a matte finish and doesn&#x27;t look oily anymore!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very happy with the product and I will be ordering it again once I run out. (I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for 3 months and haven&#x27;t run out yet. A little does go a long way).</li>
            <li> ....because then this would be a five star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I&#x27;ve accumulated a drawer full of foundations and tinted moisturizers in hopes of finding the right product for my face. I&#x27;m only 21! I&#x27;ve got the yellow undertones (NC20/25) light/medium skin that gets oily on the t-zone but is fairly normal/sometimes dry everywhere else. At my age, I can&#x27;t afford the more expensive brands of makeup that have a wider range of colors that work for me. My favorite was probably bare escentuals but the cost was too high after adding up the foundation, concealer, mineral veil, and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered a sample pack of skin79&#x27;s bb creams (pink, gold, orange, snail) and wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with any of them. Maybe they were really old samples, I will never know. Pretty much gave up on them and continued filling a drawer with drugstore make up that was too pink, oily, drying, or over oxidizing. I even tried many of the new American bb creams but it was like, one would have SPF but too greasy, one wasnt greasy but had no SPF. So last week I was looking through that drawer and found a different sample packet of bb cream. It was missha perfect cover (no idea what color) and I slapped it on thinking, why not? that little sample lasted me three days and I really liked it, but since I wasn&#x27;t sure of the color, I ordered skin79 pink label on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been wearing the pink skin79 for 5 days and I have seen an amazing difference in my skin. It&#x27;s smoother, softer, and more even. I was worried the first two days because of how pale it looked after application and even after it oxidized it still looked somewhat pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does have a very slight pink undertone which I have found only noticeable in certain lighting conditions. I managed to fix this by using a slight brushing of e.l.f. Bronzing powder in &amp;#34;sun kissed&amp;#34; and got my yellow tones back (along with a really nice glow)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin had been breakingout before (stress, hormones) and so far the blemishes haven&#x27;t been popping up, the old ones are shrinking away, and the dark spots/scars are fading! My t-zone is far less oily throughout the day than before this bb cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is probably best for those with neutral skin tones but works pretty well for yellow. I love that it comes in a pump bottle, less than $20, really fast and easy to apply without the need of a brush, and has SPF in it. I try to stay out of the sun but that&#x27;s hard to do when you have to drive back and forth to school in California during rush hours. My face and arms got significantly darker after getting my driver&#x27;s license :P so now my face doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning while I squint at all the other cars in traffic, with the sun in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this so much, I ordered the travel size so I have it with me at all times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big foundation wearer, but my niece who is the queen of make-up suggested I go for this BB cream since it offered coverage, SPF and some lightening. She let me try hers (after ordering it from Amazon herself) on my hand and I was impressed with the overall look to my skin. It looks a little muddy and gray going on but soon blends perfectly. After about a month I can say it works well and only a dab or two is needed. I blend with a sponge and used this for photos at a wedding. I think it helped improve my middle aged skin and I liked that it didn&#x27;t have a strong odor of perfume but what little smell it did have faded quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought all three to try and match my skin tone and this one is perfect I love it it even helped me get rid of broken capillaries around my nose, such a generous amount too will last me for months!</li>
