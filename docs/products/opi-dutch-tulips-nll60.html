            <li>I love OPI nail polish.  </li>
            <li>i love the color.</li>
            <li>I loved the color so much that I still to this day remember the shade name.  </li>
            <li>Chipped really easy</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t chip easily!</li>
            <li>Great summer red color.</li>
            <li>This is one of the colors that makes OPI fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is a great color for your hands or toes, have received several compliments!</li>
            <li>I came across this shade in a local salon and had to have a bottle of my own!</li>
            <li>Polish is true to color.</li>
            <li>The color is cheery and bright but a little more red than the picture on this site.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a reddish pink, not too bright but not too light either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice mix of red and coral.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy this again!</li>
            <li>I first saw this on a lady in the nail salon.  </li>
            <li>This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve bought from this seller, and as soon as it&#x27;s low, i will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I have a HUGE OPI collection and this is a polish I continually go back to.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.....</li>
            <li>This is pretty remarkable because I spend days swimming in the ocean and usually polish doesn&#x27;t last once the finish gets worn off by sand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>and so far this color/formula has not chipped or peeled AT ALL!</li>

            <li> I have used this color since the beginning of this summer for pedicures. I usually get a pedicure every 3 to 4 weeks and so far this color/formula has not chipped or peeled AT ALL!

The color is cheery and bright but a little more red than the picture on this site. It&#x27;s a nice mix of red and coral. I would certainly buy this again!</li>
