            <li>Oh, for us palies the quest for the perfect tan</li>
            <li>I really impressed my wife.  </li>
            <li>Service was great!</li>
            <li>Even using it on my face worked great!</li>
            <li>ONE OF MY FRIENDS HAD BEAUTIFUL TAN.I</li>
            <li>AND LOOKS BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li>I use it 3 times a week and people are always asking me where did you go to get that great tan.</li>
            <li>Love it!!The seller was great too!  </li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S love! :?)</li>
            <li>Try their spray - it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>(my wrists &amp; ankles got kind of orangey)</li>
            <li>but it feels nice and spreads evenly.</li>
            <li>I first bought this at Target &amp; loved it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a quick color fix, and it can safely be applied every 8 hours if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more I used, the darker the orange got.  </li>
            <li>the color was more tan rather than orange</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it better, but I do recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>:) YOU ARE NOT ORANGE OR STREAKY</li>
            <li>YOU WILL LOVE IT:)</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Lovely.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to apply evenly to avoid streaking - as it probably already says in the instructions on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>When applied with a mitt it is easy not to create tan lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it instead of tanning for two and a half years and it looks awesome</li>
            <li>Could not find this at Brand X and Brand Y super stores, but found it at Amozon!  </li>
            <li>The price and value from Amazon is fantastic and I will buy again.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s amazing return policy as this is surely going back...</li>
            <li>It should be bright white.  </li>
            <li>The pump makes it just easy to put on as body lotion which means I use it more regularly.  </li>
            <li>Double pack arrived ok.  </li>
            <li>first time I used it, it made me very streaky</li>
            <li>The Hawaiian sun is WAY too intense, but I did&#x27;t want to walk around looking like a tourist for our whole tour so decided to invest in a \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; tan! :?)</li>
            <li>Too much work.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s cheap, but in this case it&#x27;s definitely, you get what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li>I have used this product, purchased from local pharmacies, for several years and really liked it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave any tanning effects and the lotion looked different than the bottle I originally purchased at target.</li>
            <li>Maybe other products are better but the 2 bottles I received were defective</li>
            <li>It wipes off easily when you towel dry off after a shower and comes off while you shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, even without the streaks the color is far too orange and isn&#x27;t really gradual at all.</li>
            <li>However, this is an older formulation of the product.</li>
            <li>It is strong at first then after a few hours it diminishes.</li>
            <li>I applied the color mid-afternoon and the full color developed by the next morning by the way.</li>
            <li>normally this product works well.</li>
            <li>So I went to the store and bought this new spray on tan stuff - what a nightmare that stuff is.</li>
            <li>The color stays with you for about 3 days and then new application is recommended.</li>
            <li>It is ovbious the seller got a hold of some very old product and tried to pawn it off as new.</li>
            <li>I am not new to sunless tan lotion application and pretty much mastered the skill of applying it in circular motions to prevent streaking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the product was not as abrasive as most other sunless tanners, but it did still have a similar odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion must have been old!</li>
            <li>This builds a nice subtle natural looking tan over time.</li>
            <li>I had a tan going from the old batch, ordered some new lotion, and now have no tan at all.</li>
            <li>The bottles were a different color than normal and had an older design on the front.</li>
            <li>Also, it didn&#x27;t really work at all, so I can only assume it was old product that has become ineffective over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d steer clear and get this somewhere else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s early spring</li>
            <li>I think it might have been old &amp; expired.</li>
            <li>By checking lot number, they said this shipment was from 2005, which made it 8 years old.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the newer product.</li>
            <li>The key to success it exfoliating very well before you apply the lotion in addition to applying carefully.</li>
            <li>The plastic bottle was older with an older design on the outside, not like the current design.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena, please bring back the old lotion product that works.</li>
            <li>Just be aware you aren&#x27;t going to get a glowing dark tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;5/9/12 - Edit to add that after sending this back I ordered directly from Neutrogena as I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  </li>
            <li>The creme was white (as it should be) and it actually works just like normal.</li>
            <li>I started out as being very pale light white, and then only went orangish.  </li>
            <li>(I know another person who used this product, who started with a bit of a base tan already, and she tanned with it beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is from an older supply like some over the other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>I am a military wife and live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I had a couple small spots around my knees and ankles that got a little darker than the rest, but all in all, I like this product so much that although I can&#x27;t find it in the PX or commissary, I decided it was worth</li>
            <li>This product came bundled two to a package, so it was a really good deal, but now I&#x27;m wondering if they were unloading a bad batch???     </li>
            <li>The color is not too bad, but what is good about the color if you look like a leopard.</li>

            <li> This product was old, I mean very old.</li>
            <li> dried quickly (within 10 minutes) but still felt wet to the touch for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Does not take long to dry.</li>

            <li> I have never had problems with any products from Amazon for the past several years in which I have been a regular customer.  </li>
            <li> The creme was brown (previous product was white) and it didn&#x27;t work at all....  </li>
            <li> When I ordered it online through Amazon Health and Beauty for Less I expected it to be the same product I have always used.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this same product in stores, saw it on-line, thought I would save a little money</li>
            <li> But nevertheless I ended up with a lot of ugly streaks in places where I am sure I massaged it in well.</li>
            <li> The next few times I used it after that, the color evened out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years and decided to order from Amazon because I was having trouble buying in a local store.  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I really love this Build a tan, it works slowly so it doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I also got wicked streaks on the backs of my legs and blotches on ankles and feet despite being VERY careful applying it.</li>
            <li> I, by the way, am a VERY pale blonde gal. :?)</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottles the lotion was dark brown.  </li>
            <li> It sprays everything in sight, not just your arm or leg, drips down your legs -</li>
            <li> Not sure what I was thinking purchasing this online, other than I could not find the item in any stores.  </li>
            <li> I have used plenty of sunless tanners before so I shouldn&#x27;t have much trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off the shelf from brick and mortar stores for a few years, and I know what it looks like and how it performs.</li>
            <li> I did put quite a bit of effort not to miss a spot and go in circular motions everywhere, a few times.</li>
            <li> Not happy--a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> The bottles I received were apparently years old (there was no expiration date) and looked and smelled terrible!  </li>
            <li> The product was clearly past its prime, even the bottle was brown!  </li>
            <li> You have to have some serious skills in applying this product.</li>
            <li> It has a bad smell to it, and the color is different than the newer versions.</li>
            <li> but i wasted my money on a useless product.  </li>
            <li> It was dark brown in color (normally white), smelled horrible &amp; did not work.</li>
            <li> I ignored all the previous bad reviews (duh) and took a chance on ordering this.  </li>
            <li> This product is completely useless and may be even criminal.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong! :?)</li>
            <li> I am VERY DISAPPOINTED.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that Amazon could sell something so beyond shelf life.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself looked murky brown and had a horrible stench.  </li>

            <li> This sunless tanner turned me orange.  I started out as being very pale light white, and then only went orangish.  The more I used, the darker the orange got.  (I know another person who used this product, who started with a bit of a base tan already, and she tanned with it beautifully.  She wasn&#x27;t orange at all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dried quickly (within 10 minutes) but still felt wet to the touch for a few hours.  It wipes off easily when you towel dry off after a shower and comes off while you shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the tanner before I went to sleep and the next day the color was there already.  It&#x27;s great for a quick color fix, and it can safely be applied every 8 hours if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, it made me very streaky (that may be my fault though, I may not have applied it evenly).  The next few times I used it after that, the color evened out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product was not as abrasive as most other sunless tanners, but it did still have a similar odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the color was more tan rather than orange I&#x27;d like it better, but I do recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, purchased from local pharmacies, for several years and really liked it. But the batch I ordered this summer online didn&#x27;t work at all for me. Did the formula change? I had a tan going from the old batch, ordered some new lotion, and now have no tan at all. This product came bundled two to a package, so it was a really good deal, but now I&#x27;m wondering if they were unloading a bad batch???     So I went to the store and bought this new spray on tan stuff - what a nightmare that stuff is. It sprays everything in sight, not just your arm or leg, drips down your legs - I had a huge dark brown patch on my foot the next morning and two dark streaks down my leg! Oh, for us palies the quest for the perfect tan is frought with difficulties! Neutrogena, please bring back the old lotion product that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this product for years. I like the fragrance. It is strong at first then after a few hours it diminishes. The color stays with you for about 3 days and then new application is recommended. The price and value from Amazon is fantastic and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is completely useless and may be even criminal.It doesnt work AT ALL!  Its discolored and makes no difference to the skin shade  I have requested that Amazon stop these people from selling it</li>
            <li> I have purchased this same product in stores, saw it on-line, thought I would save a little money but it was a total waste of money.  This product did not work at all- I do not know if it is out of date or what but i wasted my money on a useless product.  I will continue to buy it locally where I know it works.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY FRIENDS HAD BEAUTIFUL TAN.I WAS LIKE HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE SUN. SHE&#x27;LIKE NO THIS SUNLESS TANNER. I TRIED IT DRIES 5 MINUTES AND LOOKS BEAUTIFUL:) YOU ARE NOT ORANGE OR STREAKY AT ALL.. BYE IT YOU WILL LOVE IT:)</li>
            <li> Maybe it is from an older supply like some over the other reviewers have said. I thought it would be comparable in quality to their micromist spraytan. Not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of sunless tanners before so I shouldn&#x27;t have much trouble. It&#x27;s early spring so I thought I&#x27;d try this one since it&#x27;s \\&quot;building\\&quot; a tan- which implies that it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange in one shot, but it does. I also got wicked streaks on the backs of my legs and blotches on ankles and feet despite being VERY careful applying it. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, even without the streaks the color is far too orange and isn&#x27;t really gradual at all. I applied the color mid-afternoon and the full color developed by the next morning by the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off the shelf from brick and mortar stores for a few years, and I know what it looks like and how it performs. the bottles I got from this vendor had BROWN lotion which I&#x27;ve never seen. Usually it&#x27;s white. The bottles were a different color than normal and had an older design on the front. Also, it didn&#x27;t really work at all, so I can only assume it was old product that has become ineffective over time. normally this product works well.</li>
            <li> Could not find this at Brand X and Brand Y super stores, but found it at Amozon!  I really impressed my wife.  Service was great!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love it.  When I ordered it online through Amazon Health and Beauty for Less I expected it to be the same product I have always used.  The plastic bottle was older with an older design on the outside, not like the current design.  When I opened the bottles the lotion was dark brown.  It should be bright white.  I threw it in the garbage, I do not even want to handle it for returning.  I am VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I have never had problems with any products from Amazon for the past several years in which I have been a regular customer.  DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a moisturizer for me.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it smells horrible.  Other than that, I would purchase it again and recommend to others that are looking for a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This builds a nice subtle natural looking tan over time. When applied with a mitt it is easy not to create tan lines. Does not take long to dry.</li>
            <li> You have to have some serious skills in applying this product. I am not new to sunless tan lotion application and pretty much mastered the skill of applying it in circular motions to prevent streaking. But this one is something else. I did put quite a bit of effort not to miss a spot and go in circular motions everywhere, a few times. But nevertheless I ended up with a lot of ugly streaks in places where I am sure I massaged it in well. The color is not too bad, but what is good about the color if you look like a leopard. I had to reapply this lotion 3 times to repear all the streaks. Too much work. I know it&#x27;s cheap, but in this case it&#x27;s definitely, you get what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter.  When she opened the interior packaging, one of the bottles had exploded and leaked the lotion all over.  What a mess!</li>
            <li> This lotion must have been old! It didn&#x27;t leave any tanning effects and the lotion looked different than the bottle I originally purchased at target. Not happy--a waste. Maybe other products are better but the 2 bottles I received were defective</li>
            <li> I first bought this at Target &amp; loved it! The color of it isn&#x27;t orange as long as you don&#x27;t over do it! (my wrists &amp; ankles got kind of orangey) It isn&#x27;t streaky &amp; the color shows up after a couple hours, it does stink though. But when I bought the Build a Tan from here it didn&#x27;t work! It wasn&#x27;t the same, the bottle was different looking &amp; the lotion was a brownish color instead of white. I think it might have been old &amp; expired. It was a waste of money! Buy it from the store!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and decided to order from Amazon because I was having trouble buying in a local store.  The bottles I received were apparently years old (there was no expiration date) and looked and smelled terrible!  This makes me think twice about ordering on-line.  I will definitely not order any Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.  The pump makes it just easy to put on as body lotion which means I use it more regularly.  I believe it gives my legs a bit of color but color does not get darker with repeated applications.  Not a smell that I notice.  Just be aware you aren&#x27;t going to get a glowing dark tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.  Still a bit orangey as all of this type of product is but it feels nice and spreads evenly.</li>
            <li> Called Neutrogena because color of lotion was brown instead of white. By checking lot number, they said this shipment was from 2005, which made it 8 years old. Neutrogena said product has shelf life of 24 months.  Amazon gave me credit for all bottles, which I disposed of. Very disappointed that Amazon could sell something so beyond shelf life.</li>
            <li> I ignored all the previous bad reviews (duh) and took a chance on ordering this.  Double pack arrived ok.  The creme was brown (previous product was white) and it didn&#x27;t work at all....  I called Neutrogena and gave them the lot number from the bottle and it was manufactured in 2005. Lovely.  Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s amazing return policy as this is surely going back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/9/12 - Edit to add that after sending this back I ordered directly from Neutrogena as I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  The creme was white (as it should be) and it actually works just like normal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend. It arrived promptly, which was a plus. However, this is an older formulation of the product. It has a bad smell to it, and the color is different than the newer versions. Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the newer product. I&#x27;d steer clear and get this somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Smelly. Try their spray - it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve used it instead of tanning for two and a half years and it looks awesome</li>
            <li> I really love this Build a tan, it works slowly so it doesn&#x27;t look fake. I use it 3 times a week and people are always asking me where did you go to get that great tan. Love it!!The seller was great too!  I received it in 3 days.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I am a military wife and live in Hawaii. The Hawaiian sun is WAY too intense, but I did&#x27;t want to walk around looking like a tourist for our whole tour so decided to invest in a \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; tan! :?)I bought this thinking that it probably wasn&#x27;t going to work well and I would end up orange. I was wrong! :?) The key to success it exfoliating very well before you apply the lotion in addition to applying carefully. I had a couple small spots around my knees and ankles that got a little darker than the rest, but all in all, I like this product so much that although I can&#x27;t find it in the PX or commissary, I decided it was worth it buy it online and pay shipping to Hawaii! THAT&#x27;S love! :?)Even using it on my face worked great! I, by the way, am a VERY pale blonde gal. :?)</li>
            <li> This product was old, I mean very old. It was dark brown in color (normally white), smelled horrible &amp; did not work. Since I had already bought the product I tried to use it for a week, my legs were as white day 7 as they were on day 1. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is ovbious the seller got a hold of some very old product and tried to pawn it off as new. I would never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will.  Be sure to apply evenly to avoid streaking - as it probably already says in the instructions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I was thinking purchasing this online, other than I could not find the item in any stores.  It was a total waste of money.  The product was clearly past its prime, even the bottle was brown!  The lotion itself looked murky brown and had a horrible stench.  Save your money!</li>
