            <li>It makes my hair sounds better without that oily feeling.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I shared results and recommended it to many of my family and friends.</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34; green&amp;#34; fragrance, which quickly absorbs into the air as does the oil into my hair.</li>
            <li>While this oil helps with frizz and shine, it tends to go from needing more to too much quickly, which is uncommon with my course blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>This oil is super, and provides nutrients to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>smell good help my damage and dry hair  </li>
            <li>The scent is not as pleasant as some of the other oils I have; however, it is acceptable.  </li>
            <li>Its light , but very greasy.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s worth it for this oil.</li>
            <li>I would say it is worth trying.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer, has shine and the falling out has been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>and my hair getting longer faster than before I like it very much</li>

            <li>You do have to shampoo at least twice to remove all oily residue but your hair will still feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li>, it is light, works well as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>and it was much healthier.</li>
            <li>I like this one better because the smell is much lighter and there is a lot of shine like the other one.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great product for black hair; can&#x27;t speak on other hair types.</li>
            <li>Oil is not thick but watery.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for daily use, or as a hot oil treatment for steaming.</li>
            <li>It would help to have a better cap on the bottle that you can get a small amount from than just unscrewing the cap.  </li>
            <li>Makes my daughter hair soft</li>
            <li>Leaves you hair soft.</li>
            <li>Have not deep oil treatment yet but love the smell and everyday conditioning</li>
            <li>I normally buy the regular Amla hair oil not the gold one.</li>
            <li>It also is a pure oil and prevents dry scalp and dandruff.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a different base, but I am enjoying the product and the smell is lovely.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Oil is not thick but watery. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Its light , but very greasy.I haven&#x27;t use it long enought to know if it help with growth .</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know why this is advertised as amla oil. Of course  it has amla in it (5th ingredient down) but man oh man talk about everything but the kitchen sink. Paraffium, Bhts, canola oil, etc. And it made my hair brittle. This is a miss</li>
            <li> Makes my daughter hair soft</li>
            <li> Have not deep oil treatment yet but love the smell and everyday conditioning</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is the best product that I have used in years...my hair is thick (or was; it has thinned with age). My hair is wavy and natural, but over the years it has been dry and dull. It also was coming out, a lot. The ends were dry and brittle. I noticed an immediate difference the first time I used it. My hair is much softer, has shine and the falling out has been significantly reduced. I was so excited that I shared results and recommended it to many of my family and friends. I think it is a great product for black hair; can&#x27;t speak on other hair types. I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great Product and oil works wonders for your hair, skin and nails. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This product seem to be ok, I like it.  However, I did notice that my braids were getting a little thicker and it has kept down the flaking. I also mix it with another hair product (grease) to put it on my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, reordered, works well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This oil is super, and provides nutrients to the scalp.  It also is a pure oil and prevents dry scalp and dandruff.</li>
            <li> I am South Asian, so this oil was a staple in my house. My mom used to use it and would apply it for my sisters and I. This oil does wonders for the hair. It softens it, makes it silky, and fixes damaged hair. I like applying it and leave it in overnight then wash it in the morning. You do have to shampoo at least twice to remove all oily residue but your hair will still feel great afterwards. My hair is always the shiniest once I&#x27;ve washed it after using the oil. I&#x27;ve reconnected this to my friends too and one of them who had really bad split ends said she doesn&#x27;t have split ends anymore because of this.</li>
            <li> I really love this oil. I have never written a review about a product before but I feel like it&#x27;s worth it for this oil. I am AA with very thick hair. I experience a lot breakage with my hair because I wear braids a lot. When I took my braids down and put this oil in it my hair immediately felt different. I lost less hair then I normally did. I use this on my daughters hair and it works great on her hair as well. I put it in my hair every night and it even helps with the texture of my hair making it more manageable. I would say it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! This gave my hair  strength and elasticity. I saw a reduction in breakage during a time where my hair is very delicate and prone to damage, as I am transitioning to natural hair. I would recommend this for daily use, or as a hot oil treatment for steaming. Great product!</li>
            <li> I like this.  It helps with the dryness that comes with the hair conditioning pack that I do every other week.  I gave it the 4 stars because it does have the mineral oil in it that is not so good for us.  I wish it had a different base, but I am enjoying the product and the smell is lovely.  It takes the itch away from the dry scalp that lasts for a couple of days after the conditioning henna treatment.  I do not know if I will purchase it again though.  Will look for one w/o mineral oil.</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for my hair.  :)</li>
            <li> I normally buy the regular Amla hair oil not the gold one. I like this one better because the smell is much lighter and there is a lot of shine like the other one. The biggest difference I noticed is that it is not as dark in color so if you want a hair darkener, the original Dabur Amla hair oil is best for you.</li>
            <li> I like it, it is light, works well as far as I can tell. not greasy at all. Try for yourself.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it will help with in terms of my hair, only time will tell. No strong smell, thankfully. Hopefully it helps with shedding and thickness.</li>
            <li> Five stars !It is really a good oil. It makes my hair sounds better without that oily feeling. Also it dose not make my hair darker.</li>
            <li> This product contained mostly glycerin and mineral oil.  Alma oil was the last and least ingredients contained.  This product caused breakouts in my face and ruined my pillowcases. I will stick to EVOO, I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> smell good help my damage and dry hair  and my hair getting longer faster than before I like it very much I will buy it again</li>
            <li> What a wonderdul discovery! I love the &amp;#34; green&amp;#34; fragrance, which quickly absorbs into the air as does the oil into my hair. It leaves hair shiny and nourished. Love, love, love it! Thank you.</li>
            <li> While this oil helps with frizz and shine, it tends to go from needing more to too much quickly, which is uncommon with my course blonde hair.  It is very difficult to get to the scalp without creating a greasy scalp.  It would help to have a better cap on the bottle that you can get a small amount from than just unscrewing the cap.  I will keep working with it.  The scent is not as pleasant as some of the other oils I have; however, it is acceptable.  For just shine and frizz control, and not scalp moisture, I would recommend a dry spray oil.</li>
            <li> The packing was great . I loved the smell it made my hair feel great without any oily feeling. After using it I did moticed some thickness and it was much healthier. I will definetly purchase it again</li>
            <li> I heard about it.  I am still trying it give another month or so to be sure</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. Leaves you hair soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is not overly oily and a little goes a long way. It works very well on curly hair even if it is thin.</li>
