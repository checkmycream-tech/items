            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I have the driest feet and most cracked and callused feet ever!</li>
            <li>After one night the difference was amazing.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase two more</li>
            <li>Now if they would make them with the toes open to help keep your feet cooler, they&#x27;d be perfect!</li>
            <li>Ordering 2 more pair...</li>
            <li>These worked OK, but they are not like the gel socks for women.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that the gel would be more resilient, and that you would just add more oil or lotion.</li>
            <li>On the other hand they fit my size 11 feet perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product is the first of its kind I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>smells amazing and really nourishes my feet</li>
            <li>Comfortable and provides the moistening effect I was looking for</li>
            <li>My boyfriend wore these four times and they are now filled with holes.</li>
            <li>plus they dont look all womanly and you dont feel emasculated while wearing them around the house lol.</li>
            <li>Even if you put shoes on over these, you still feel like you&#x27;re walking in light snow or sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like you could ever get these clean, and they don&#x27;t soften your feet.</li>
            <li>When you first put these on, they feel cool and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I started to dance (okay, the dancing is an embellishment), but seriously, these things are amazing!  </li>
            <li>These socks for men where knit fabric on the outside, with nice non-skid pads on the bottom, but had a silicone-type lining.  </li>
            <li>These wear out pretty quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While these socks keep your feet very warm and you must be VERY careful walking in them, they do help more than other products my husband has tried.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have overly hot or sweaty feet.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s tried so many products for his dry, cracked heels, but hasn&#x27;t had much success.</li>
            <li>With that being said, and reading the other reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first night was quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I had very dry, cracked, peeling feet and these socks made them about 75% better after wearing them one night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a man but got these because I have long feet and thought gel socks for women wouldn&#x27;t fit me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure these help anything but cause my feet to sweat and the rubber lining acts as a mini sauna cooking my feet in their own sweat...</li>
            <li>This is a huge improvement for him, so as long as they help, I&#x27;ll keep buying them!</li>
            <li>; they&#x27;re comfortable to wear, and after one night I noticed a difference in my dry foot skin, and cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t see how anyone could wear them longer than half an hour, or wear them more than once</li>
            <li>Pretty darn nice little feet covers!!!  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been able to buff off more dry, hard callous off his heels, and his heels have not split &amp; bled since he&#x27;s been using them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>My feet were a little better each time, but it was still like walking on stumps.</li>
            <li>These socks are exactly as advertised, but they did not help my dry heels very much</li>
            <li>The lining made the socks very warm and my husband complained that it felt like his feet were wet.</li>
            <li>really was kind of skeptical, but ive tried lotions and everything under the sun for my cracked feet.</li>
            <li>They last quite a while when worn primarily at night, and I will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>They were a little difficult to get one at first, but they feel great on the feet.</li>
            <li>The rubber pads on the outside give you the confidence you can walk in them, but your feet will slip inside on the rubberized &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;... After 2-4 uses, they smell like a gym sock and old folks home because you can&#x27;t wash them...</li>
            <li>Very flimsy and not much heel cushion.</li>

            <li> Very flimsy and not much heel cushion.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not completely sold on these.</li>
            <li> There had been a sudden, very wet snow</li>
            <li> For dry heels, I got a prescription from a Dermatologist for a cream which is 10% Urea in 12% Ammonium Lactate.  </li>
            <li> So, for dry heels, I recommend you see a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> now and my heel cracks have healed, the dry skin is now supple again.  </li>
            <li> He put me in a chair, and wrapped my wet feet in a towel and placed them on a sandstone that had been warmed on our coalstove.</li>
            <li> When he grabbed them the next afternoon, he found A LOT of dead skin inside them</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> My feet do feel wet by the morning</li>
            <li> but when I take off the socks my feet aren’t wet at all.  </li>
            <li> also had the constant feeling that I was going to move too aggressively and rip the gel in the socks, and eventually after a few weeks of on and off use, the gel does weaken and break.</li>
            <li> Much less dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had similar socks in the past that felt tight on my toes, but these feel like they have a little extra room.</li>
            <li> I have scar tissue other places, does this gel come in other applications?</li>
            <li> This is a top-quality product, for not much more than a pair of regular socks.</li>
            <li> My poor feet were so dry and cracked I could barely walk.</li>
            <li> At least for now I am no longer embarrassed to wear flip flops out in public.</li>
            <li> I sat there for a half hour, steaming, and by the time I could feel my feet they had started to cook.</li>
            <li> It took awhile for them to dry...and he actually complained that he had to wait so long before he could wear them again.</li>
            <li> Sadly as soon as I stop wearing the dry feet issue is back within a few days.  </li>
            <li> You will not be let down by this purchase!</li>
            <li> These socks did what they claimed, and improved the condition of the dried prehistoric riverbed that was my feet.</li>
            <li> I have 10.5 size and was a little small.</li>
            <li> Since I am too lazy to slather lotion all over my feet every day I gave this a try.  </li>
            <li> not for men sizes, and slip and fall , not safe to wear.</li>
            <li> The 1st time he wore them he was a little skeptical, but said his heels did feel a little softer after about an hour of wear.</li>
            <li> ....sorry!), and complained that he couldn&#x27;t wear them because of the skin.</li>
            <li> If I could give this negative stars, I would.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just hot and awful.</li>
            <li> The gel does make it a little awkward walking around, as you slide around on the gel in the sock.</li>
            <li> and I think they also made my athlete&#x27;s foot worse.  </li>
            <li> They do feel a bit weird and squishy when you walk with them on</li>
            <li> I had him turn them inside out and rinse them with cold water.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about this product</li>
    </ol>

            <li> love it! smells amazing and really nourishes my feet</li>
            <li> These socks are exactly as advertised, but they did not help my dry heels very much and I think they also made my athlete&#x27;s foot worse.

            <li> Comfortable and provides the moistening effect I was looking for</li>
            <li> December before last, I came home with feet that were absolutely blue. There had been a sudden, very wet snow and I had needed to get out of the car twice to remove big branches from the road. When I got home my husband had to literally peel my socks and shoes off my feet. He put me in a chair, and wrapped my wet feet in a towel and placed them on a sandstone that had been warmed on our coalstove. I sat there for a half hour, steaming, and by the time I could feel my feet they had started to cook. Over the next year or so, I have tried various things-soaks, creams, pumice...you name it, I have been there. My feet were a little better each time, but it was still like walking on stumps. I ordered these gel socks as just another try. They came yesterday. I ft home at 5:15 p.m., by 5:30 they were on my feet, and I was in bed. I woke up at 1 in the morning, and removed them. My feet are feet!!!!!! I figure I can wear them -the socks, every night for the next month, and then buy another pair. Hey, Upper Canada? I have scar tissue other places, does this gel come in other applications?</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of these for my husband. He&#x27;s tried so many products for his dry, cracked heels, but hasn&#x27;t had much success. The 1st time he wore them he was a little skeptical, but said his heels did feel a little softer after about an hour of wear. He then put them on when he went to bed that night, but said he took them off after about 3 hours. Again, he noticed a softening of his heels. When he grabbed them the next afternoon, he found A LOT of dead skin inside them (yeah, gross....sorry!), and complained that he couldn&#x27;t wear them because of the skin. I had him turn them inside out and rinse them with cold water. It took awhile for them to dry...and he actually complained that he had to wait so long before he could wear them again. I decided to purchase two more so he would always have a pair when he wanted to wear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these socks keep your feet very warm and you must be VERY careful walking in them, they do help more than other products my husband has tried. He&#x27;s been able to buff off more dry, hard callous off his heels, and his heels have not split &amp; bled since he&#x27;s been using them. This is a huge improvement for him, so as long as they help, I&#x27;ll keep buying them! Now if they would make them with the toes open to help keep your feet cooler, they&#x27;d be perfect!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wore these four times and they are now filled with holes. Unwearable now.</li>
            <li> These wear out pretty quick. Husband got one use out of them before gel started coming off in clumps.</li>
            <li> really was kind of skeptical, but ive tried lotions and everything under the sun for my cracked feet. im on em all day... and simple as just wearing them is... it helps... im not one for wearing socks to bed.. but i&#x27;ve gotten used to it. plus they dont look all womanly and you dont feel emasculated while wearing them around the house lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a man but got these because I have long feet and thought gel socks for women wouldn&#x27;t fit me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work beautifully; they&#x27;re comfortable to wear, and after one night I noticed a difference in my dry foot skin, and cracked heels.  I&#x27;ve been using them for 3 weeks or so now and my heel cracks have healed, the dry skin is now supple again.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Wore them one time and the inside gel was falling apart.  Returned them for a refund.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it works.</li>
            <li> works and feels great</li>
            <li> Garbage, sweaty feet, falls apart DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> If I could give this negative stars, I would. When you first put these on, they feel cool and comfortable. But I can&#x27;t see how anyone could wear them longer than half an hour, or wear them more than once -- I woke up with feet so sweaty that they were wrinkled like they&#x27;d been in the bath. I don&#x27;t feel like you could ever get these clean, and they don&#x27;t soften your feet. They&#x27;re just hot and awful. And I don&#x27;t have overly hot or sweaty feet. I tried them three nights just in case I wasn&#x27;t used to them - same each time. I will never wear them again.</li>
            <li> After a couple uses the gel started losing out of the sock in the sock started pilling up. These got returned. On the other hand they fit my size 11 feet perfectly.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about this product</li>
            <li> Not sure these help anything but cause my feet to sweat and the rubber lining acts as a mini sauna cooking my feet in their own sweat... Add some lotion and have a slippery nightmare... Don&#x27;t even try to walk in them... The rubber pads on the outside give you the confidence you can walk in them, but your feet will slip inside on the rubberized &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;... After 2-4 uses, they smell like a gym sock and old folks home because you can&#x27;t wash them... It&#x27;s suggested to simply &amp;#34;rinse&amp;#34;... No soap... Gross...</li>
            <li> Wish they were in a MANs size</li>
            <li> This product is the first of its kind I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m very pleased and will buy again. Wearing these overnight made a big difference for me.</li>
            <li> I have the driest feet and most cracked and callused feet ever! With that being said, and reading the other reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first night was quite enjoyable. My feet were refreshed and softened the next morning. Ever since, it seems they just make my feet sweat throughout the night and will end up causing athlete&#x27;s feet.. So, I&#x27;m not completely sold on these.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Very flimsy and not much heel cushion.</li>
            <li> Pretty darn nice little feet covers!!!  Skin feels great - not just in morning, but also every moment that these are worn.&lt;br /&gt;Packed nice, arrived nice.  Im very happy.  Ordering 2 more pair...</li>
            <li> These worked OK, but they are not like the gel socks for women.  Women&#x27;s gel socks are knit with the gel infused in the fabric.  These socks for men where knit fabric on the outside, with nice non-skid pads on the bottom, but had a silicone-type lining.  The lining made the socks very warm and my husband complained that it felt like his feet were wet.</li>
            <li> Since I am too lazy to slather lotion all over my feet every day I gave this a try.  They do feel a bit weird and squishy when you walk with them on so I only wear them to bed.  After one night the difference was amazing.  Sadly as soon as I stop wearing the dry feet issue is back within a few days.  My feet do feel wet by the morning but when I take off the socks my feet aren’t wet at all.  Since I never wear socks to bed it does take a bit to get used to.  I just hope they last a while before they stop working.  At least for now I am no longer embarrassed to wear flip flops out in public.</li>
            <li> The interior lining began to fall apart after three use.</li>
            <li> They are well made and work well. I have 10.5 size and was a little small.</li>
            <li> These socks did what they claimed, and improved the condition of the dried prehistoric riverbed that was my feet. They were a little difficult to get one at first, but they feel great on the feet. The gel does make it a little awkward walking around, as you slide around on the gel in the sock. Even if you put shoes on over these, you still feel like you&#x27;re walking in light snow or sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had the constant feeling that I was going to move too aggressively and rip the gel in the socks, and eventually after a few weeks of on and off use, the gel does weaken and break. I was hoping that the gel would be more resilient, and that you would just add more oil or lotion. They last quite a while when worn primarily at night, and I will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> My poor feet were so dry and cracked I could barely walk. I was looking for men&#x27;s slippers and stumbled across these socks. I was hesitant as the picture makes them look like they&#x27;re pair of socks with a plush liner, which is the last thing I needed. I wanted to keep in moisture and not wick it away. Hobbled to the mailbox, opened the box, took them out, and put them on... my feet were instantly in heaven. I started to dance (okay, the dancing is an embellishment), but seriously, these things are amazing!  The smell of the gel is not overpowering or girly. These things are a spa treatment for your feet. This is a top-quality product, for not much more than a pair of regular socks. You will not be let down by this purchase!</li>
            <li> not for men sizes, and slip and fall , not safe to wear.</li>
            <li> These are great. The entire inside of the sock is coated in oil releasing gel. I had very dry, cracked, peeling feet and these socks made them about 75% better after wearing them one night. I wear a size 13 and these fit perfectly. I&#x27;ve had similar socks in the past that felt tight on my toes, but these feel like they have a little extra room. I highly recommend them.</li>
