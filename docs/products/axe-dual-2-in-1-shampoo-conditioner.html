            <li>this is GREAT AXE is amazing!</li>
            <li>It smells really good, too, as with all Axe Products.</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>Now it DOES make your hair smell good for a time, and the two-in-one is a time saver, but the quality of the conditioner is not the best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the color which looks like melted gold!</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo...works well</li>
            <li>Smells great, works as a great cleansing shampoo, and adds a bit of conditioning if your hair is feeling a bit too dry.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve got a winning combo.  </li>
            <li>Great wash, no complaints really.</li>
            <li>Great price ... fast shipping. ..</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>..am pleased with it....</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t quit touching my hair.</li>
            <li>Six more words were required.</li>
            <li>Since it is 2 in 1 shampoo, it makes my hair feels more smooth and \\&quot;moisturized\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s push button flip top cap works really well for one-handed use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product before, but this was a really good deal in a package of three especially since I have 3 sons!</li>
            <li>Great Product, now I&#x27;m off to experimenting with other Axe products,...</li>
            <li>excellent shampoo - this is my second or third purchase.  </li>
            <li>Love the thick gel, love the fragrance, and love the packaging!  </li>
            <li>This has got to be my favorite so far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 2-in-1, and I rarely, if every, use conditioner since I&#x27;ve started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that would clean my hair, make it smell good, and also leave it feeling extra soft.</li>
            <li>I used to use Shampoo and Conditioner that was fairly generic, and decided I needed something better.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this as long as it is available!</li>
            <li>I have short gray hair, and it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>&quot; or my hair is \\&quot;REALLY SOFT!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Thanks Axe</li>
            <li>He really likes that it&#x27;s 2 in 1, loves the scent.</li>
            <li>wash and rinse one time and then ready to go.....</li>
            <li>its really a trade off, time vs efficiency.</li>
            <li>I think it is better than those which are \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot;, if you would like soft feel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>To begin with, I&#x27;m not really a hair guy, and I&#x27;m not really an Axe guy, but I liked their body gel, so I thought I&#x27;d give their two-in-one Shampoo and Conditioner a try.  </li>
            <li>Alternate between this and your other favorite Axe brand shampoo</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Axe products for a long while now and all their Shampoo has worked very well.</li>
            <li>this is a product that really works well, men your ladies and other people around will like it</li>
            <li>I wear the classic look and this stuff rocks when I add my other  hair products (like American Crew and Redken)  along with blow drying.  </li>

            <li> Then I switched to Axe Shampoo and Axe Conditioner (separate), but that took way too long in the morning.</li>
            <li> This comes with enough for a a few months, especially if you dont shower everyday (every other day?).</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have even tried this except for the fact that it came in a gift set along with other Axe products I use.</li>
            <li> I guess the only thing is you have to store the bottles till you get to them, but really it doesn&#x27;t go bad.</li>
            <li> hair was a lot softer, and with less split ends (girlfriend&#x27;s opinion) when I used separate shampoo and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> For those of us that like a little conditioner once in a while</li>
            <li> I usually shampoo twice everyday, this has made my hair \\&quot;irresistable\\&quot; and I get girls telling me</li>
            <li> No more dropping the cap in the tub.</li>
            <li> but hate that super thick oily buttery feeling that some of them leave on our hair...</li>
            <li> It beats all of the fancy salon shampoos I have tried and this Axe is significantly less expensive than those.</li>
            <li> I think you canâ€™t go wrong if you buy it here!</li>

            <li> I used to use Shampoo and Conditioner that was fairly generic, and decided I needed something better. Then I switched to Axe Shampoo and Axe Conditioner (separate), but that took way too long in the morning. To fix that problem I switched to this product and it works great. It smells really good, too, as with all Axe Products. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> this is GREAT AXE is amazing! this cleans hair and makes it smell awesome! and also try AXE gell its works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Axe products for a long while now and all their Shampoo has worked very well. This has got to be my favorite so far! I usually shampoo twice everyday, this has made my hair \\&quot;irresistable\\&quot; and I get girls telling me I \\&quot;Smell Nice\\&quot; or my hair is \\&quot;REALLY SOFT!\\&quot;. This comes with enough for a a few months, especially if you dont shower everyday (every other day?). Great Product, now I&#x27;m off to experimenting with other Axe products,... Trying \\&quot;Heat\\&quot; next! 5/5</li>
            <li> For those of us that like a little conditioner once in a while but hate that super thick oily buttery feeling that some of them leave on our hair... this is the ticket!  Smells great, works as a great cleansing shampoo, and adds a bit of conditioning if your hair is feeling a bit too dry.  Alternate between this and your other favorite Axe brand shampoo and you&#x27;ve got a winning combo.  Love the thick gel, love the fragrance, and love the packaging!  It&#x27;s push button flip top cap works really well for one-handed use in the shower.  No more dropping the cap in the tub.</li>

            <li> Good price.  Smells good and I like all in one shampoos.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would clean my hair, make it smell good, and also leave it feeling extra soft. Look no further folks, this is it! I will continue to buy this as long as it is available! Thanks Axe</li>
            <li> Great wash, no complaints really. I guess the only thing is you have to store the bottles till you get to them, but really it doesn&#x27;t go bad. It&#x27;s like storing toilet paper, you&#x27;ll get to it eventually.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Love the color which looks like melted gold! doesn&#x27;t leave you with glitter all over your thankfully!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband when purchasing the Axe SPF hair cream.  He really likes that it&#x27;s 2 in 1, loves the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before, but this was a really good deal in a package of three especially since I have 3 sons!</li>
            <li> Great price ... fast shipping. .. but 1 of the bottles busted and leaked during shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s a 2-in-1, and I rarely, if every, use conditioner since I&#x27;ve started using this shampoo. I wash my hair daily with it and it&#x27;s great. It beats all of the fancy salon shampoos I have tried and this Axe is significantly less expensive than those. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo...works well..am pleased with it....&lt;br /&gt;Easy wash and rinse one time and then ready to go.....&lt;br /&gt;Like the Axe products..</li>
            <li> excellent shampoo - this is my second or third purchase.  I have short gray hair, and it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> this is a product that really works well, men your ladies and other people around will like it too!!!buy today</li>
            <li> Girls flocked from 3 states after using this.  They won&#x27;t quit touching my hair. Six more words were required. Nailed it.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This product is awesome!  Can&#x27;t believe the volume and lift it gave my hair.  I wear the classic look and this stuff rocks when I add my other  hair products (like American Crew and Redken)  along with blow drying.  Makes my hair look fuller and thicker than before.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have even tried this except for the fact that it came in a gift set along with other Axe products I use.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I&#x27;m not really a hair guy, and I&#x27;m not really an Axe guy, but I liked their body gel, so I thought I&#x27;d give their two-in-one Shampoo and Conditioner a try.  Now it DOES make your hair smell good for a time, and the two-in-one is a time saver, but the quality of the conditioner is not the best.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was a lot softer, and with less split ends (girlfriend&#x27;s opinion) when I used separate shampoo and conditioners.  But this stuff does work, and work fast.&lt;br /&gt;So its really a trade off, time vs efficiency.</li>
            <li> Buy it here! This product is a very good value and a good brand. I think you canâ€™t go wrong if you buy it here!</li>
