            <li>I ordered these as they are the same as the ones used in the hospital and are very good.  </li>
            <li>I purchase the product to make sure he stays clean and protected from problems wiht urinary and bowel incontinence.</li>
            <li>Does a wonderful job in providing a barrier so the skin does not break down.</li>
            <li>OK, talking about \\&quot;incontinence cream cloths\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the most appetizing thing in the world.</li>
            <li>I do wish there were more than 8 in the refill packs but other than that they are a great product.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>These help keep him clean and irritation free.</li>
            <li>YOU FEELING  CLEAN.</li>
            <li>This product is soft, fragrance is nice which is good for washing her private area.  </li>
            <li>glad that I purchase these b/c sanitation is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TO NICE AND CLEAR.  </li>
            <li>this has made a tremendous difference in my &amp;#34;sweaty places&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The are soft, smooth, and easy on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>These are so gentle on sensitive skin and leave you feeling so very clean!</li>
            <li>These cloths are the best we&#x27;ve used and cut down extensively on the need for creams and ointments for my wheelchair bound husband.</li>
            <li>The wipes are large, washcloth-sized and come wet with really good, skin soothing ingredients like dimethicone.</li>
            <li>We have tried everything else on the market (and some not), and nothing is even half as good as Comfort Shield.  </li>
            <li>Also, we love Amazon and don&#x27;t get out of the house much, either, so ordering Comfort Shield through Amazon was a natural.  </li>
            <li>Excellent soft thick and durable.</li>
            <li>They are great for that, but I&#x27;d use something else for cases where simple cleaning is enough.</li>
            <li>After using the cloth, it is important to wash your face with appropriate facial cleansing soap and moisturize as normal.</li>
            <li>Very gentle indeed.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and multiple allergies and the solutions in most wipes irritate me, but not these, plus they are incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>My first dissatisfaction with Amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I put the cloth in hot water b/c</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>We used This product for the first time at the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in West Orange , NJ for the first time.</li>
            <li>tHEY ARE SUPER THICK ALMOST LIKE REAL CLOTH, NICE CLEAN SCENT, MOIST &amp; SOOTHING, AIDS IN MEDICATING</li>
            <li>The wipes are incredibly soft, feel like a super luxe microfiber washcloth.</li>
            <li>really like a disposable wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>These have really helped prevent rashes in the patient that I care for.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin, creates a barrier.</li>
            <li>These cloths work very well.</li>
            <li>Really like using this.</li>
            <li>I really like these a lot.</li>
            <li>But Comfort Shields really work.</li>
            <li>They are soft and leave a clean, clear barrier to wetness.  </li>
            <li>These worked very well to keep my \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas clean and protected while it was impractical to keep proper hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cream impregnated cleaning cloth is much easier to use, and works quite well, particularly around the buttock area after bowel movements.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, but we cut them in half for an even better value.</li>
            <li>cut them in half :)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone with any level of incontinence.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and the supplier, PharmaFrag.</li>
            <li>If you will use all 32 within a couple of weeks, they probably won&#x27;t dry out in the original container, depending on the humidity level in your home.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing to the skin, not harsh on damaged skin.</li>
            <li>Wipes are gentle on sensitive skin and preferable to cloth washcloths for perineal care as they are so soft and include barrier cream.  </li>
            <li>They are far superior than any other wipe I have ever previously used.</li>
            <li>Great for thoroughly cleaning the entire underside for a female when one cannot shower due to surgery or other reasons.</li>
            <li>These are so soft.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product b/c I was looking for a disposable wash cloth that I use on my 99 yrs old grandma.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them now for 1&amp;1/2 weeks and his bottom is completely healed.</li>
            <li>Completely removes residue from lotions with ease.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my elderly mom, they are thick and are not drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Use to be carried by Acme Supermarkets and Rite Aid Pharmacies, but hard to find now (Rite Aid replaced them with a similar product of their own that I understand they just dis-continued for some reason known only to them.)</li>
            <li>The plastic box comes tightly shrink wrapped so the cloths inside are not dried out when you get them (except, perhaps, for the first few at the very top which feel slightly less moist than the rest).</li>
            <li>My husband is disabled and I try to make him as comfortable as possible.</li>
            <li>These wipes are big and heavy, which feels good, but the cream leaves a wetness and slick feeling that doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I was given some of these in the hospital after surgery and was amazed at the high quality and the fact that they had no irritating chemicals but are just wet enough and well lubricated enough to thoroughly clean with no irritation, no matter how firmly one wipes.</li>
            <li>, DOES NOT IRRITATE MY 89 YEAR OLD MOM EVEN WITH REPEATED DAILY USE!</li>
            <li>These wipes really help prevent rashes due to incontenence or &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s sellers are charging WAY too much for these and you can find them at another major online retailer at one half to one quarter the price at the time of this writing.</li>
            <li>These Comfort \\&quot;Personal Cleansing Incontinence Care Washcloths\\&quot; were provided to my by the hospital when I was bedridden and recovering from major surgery.</li>
            <li>I first learned of these when my father was in the hospital, they are expensive but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Cloths large enough to cut in half for each use!</li>

            <li> one goes a long way they are helpful</li>
            <li> supplies for a local nursing home were running low, so I purchased these with other products to donate to the center.</li>
            <li> We used this on my relative with severely irritated and red skin rash secondary to being in diaper.</li>
            <li> They clean extremely well, and the thin layer of protection they leave behind does not make one feel wet or irritated.</li>
            <li> i think they should use less lotion  or cleaning  solution</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed to see that this is available at Walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li> less than Amazon!  </li>
            <li> Personal Cleansing, Ultra-Thick Disposable Washcloths, 32 ea]] for general cleansing of the sick or convalescing when a shower or bath isn&#x27;t possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cloths are like very thick non-woven polyester, at least 3 times as thick as any previous wipe I have used.</li>
            <li> the cloth is too cold to use on her when bathing her private</li>
            <li> Wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these only if you are in need of something for bad irritation or skin breakdown.  </li>
            <li> This is a very hard to find item that is used in hospitals.  </li>
            <li> POOR BUY FOR THE MONEY</li>
            <li> My son is 3 yrs old and suffers from horrible diaper rashes.</li>

Personal Cleansing, Ultra-Thick Disposable Washcloths, 32 ea]] for general cleansing of the sick or convalescing when a shower or bath isn&#x27;t possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT...CLEANS, PROTECTS, AND DEODERIZES.  I DISCOVERED IT 6 MTS AGO AND WILL USE NOTHING ELSE...BEST PART, DOES NOT IRRITATE MY 89 YEAR OLD MOM EVEN WITH REPEATED DAILY USE!</li>
            <li> These are so soft.  I love them.  I do wish there were more than 8 in the refill packs but other than that they are a great product.</li>
            <li> I have used these for several years now, for incontinence, and have no skin break-down and no odor problems at all.  We have tried everything else on the market (and some not), and nothing is even half as good as Comfort Shield.  Also, we love Amazon and don&#x27;t get out of the house much, either, so ordering Comfort Shield through Amazon was a natural.  Imagine my shock, then, to find the same product in the local drugstore for $8 (EIGHT dollars!) less than Amazon!  I use three boxes a month, so that&#x27;s about $300 (THREE hundred!) bucks a year.  Nope.  Not gonna do it anymore.  My first dissatisfaction with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I never knew they had such a product like this so I ordered it to give it a try. I am basically housebound so I rely on Amazon for a lot of my needs but I was disappointed to see that this is available at Walmart for half the price. The wipes are great. They do everything they claim to do. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> My husband is bed bound and in the last stages of Lewy Body Dementia.  I purchase the product to make sure he stays clean and protected from problems wiht urinary and bowel incontinence. The product is excellent for maintaining a clean and protected skin surface. I have found nothing better.</li>
            <li> Helps keep skin healthy &amp; as a mature age person, this product is a great help.  Wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Barrier Cream Cloths are also great to remove makeup, even waterproof mascara...After using the cloth, it is important to wash your face with appropriate facial cleansing soap and moisturize as normal.</li>
            <li> I chose this product b/c I was looking for a disposable wash cloth that I use on my 99 yrs old grandma.  This product is soft, fragrance is nice which is good for washing her private area.  I put the cloth in hot water b/c the cloth is too cold to use on her when bathing her private area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that I purchase these b/c sanitation is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;caregiver4gma</li>
            <li> I have used these cloths for almost 2 years now and they are the perfect size, thickness, and wetness to do the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> These wipes really help prevent rashes due to incontenence or &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34;.  The wipes are large in size and a good thickness...really like a disposable wash cloth.  The great feature is that they leave an invisible layer or barrier to project the skin from wetness.  These have really helped prevent rashes in the patient that I care for.</li>
            <li> If you need incontinence cloths these are the ones. Gentle on the skin, creates a barrier. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> This product worked as advertised.  We would buy it again without hesitation.  I would say you can trust the advertised function.  This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY THE CLOTHS COAT YOUR SKIN.  THEY TURN SORE AND  RED SKIN TO NICE AND CLEAR.  THEY LEAVE YOU FEELING  CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Because of issues with colitus&lt;br /&gt;from time to time.  I thought I would&lt;br /&gt;try these.&lt;br /&gt;Like them and they are so big&lt;br /&gt;I cut them in half :)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone with any level of incontinence. Not only for cleansing, but SHIELD helps prevent skin irritations. I use at bedtime and when I dress for the day and have for several years. Cloths large enough to cut in half for each use! Good buy.</li>
            <li> Good product that will not fall apart in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use to be carried by Acme Supermarkets and Rite Aid Pharmacies, but hard to find now (Rite Aid replaced them with a similar product of their own that I understand they just dis-continued for some reason known only to them.)</li>
            <li> Used this daily as a caregiver.</li>
            <li> Like this product because it  does  leave you with the cleanliness and comfort that regular tissues  doesn&#x27;t. It is very soothing to the skin, not harsh on damaged skin. I will continue to use Comfort Shield Cloths because they work so well for me.</li>
            <li> POOR BUY FOR THE MONEY</li>
            <li> These great cloths are wonderful for anyone with incontinence or frequent bowel movements following abdominal surgery.  Soothing and protective. Reasonably priced, but we cut them in half for an even better value.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It makes my skin feel clean and smooth. The barrier cream does not feel greasy.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These wipes are amazing for dealing with skin affected my incontinence. The wipes are incredibly soft, feel like a super luxe microfiber washcloth. The wipes are large, washcloth-sized and come wet with really good, skin soothing ingredients like dimethicone. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> supplies for a local nursing home were running low, so I purchased these with other products to donate to the center.</li>
            <li> These cloths work very well. This is my third time purchasing from this company. I ordered two packs and would have ordered more but they were out of stock. I recommend this product and will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Wipes are gentle on sensitive skin and preferable to cloth washcloths for perineal care as they are so soft and include barrier cream.  They are larger than baby wipes so you use fewer.</li>
            <li> this has made a tremendous difference in my &amp;#34;sweaty places&amp;#34;.  it doesn&#x27;t just work for incontinence, it does an excellent job for sweat irritation as well.  highly recommend</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my totally bed ridden elderly father who has Altzheimer&#x27;s. I prefer this product to a tube of aloe type cream (which is what we got from the hospital on discharge). This cream impregnated cleaning cloth is much easier to use, and works quite well, particularly around the buttock area after bowel movements. It also does an excellent job of preventing skin irritation and rashes in sensitive areas. The plastic box comes tightly shrink wrapped so the cloths inside are not dried out when you get them (except, perhaps, for the first few at the very top which feel slightly less moist than the rest). I highly recommend the product and the supplier, PharmaFrag. My order was delivered correctly and on time.</li>
            <li> Product found in hospitals. Helps with personal care</li>
            <li> These wipes have prevented skin breakdown on my mother in law who is incontinent. I am ordering more. No odor and leaves a nice coating of skin protectant.</li>
            <li> My son is 3 yrs old and suffers from horrible diaper rashes. I have tried everything under the sun. My mother told me about these as they use them in the hospitals. I decided to try it and it works wonders. It began to heal and protect his bottom within 2 days!!!! I&#x27;ve been using them now for 1&amp;1/2 weeks and his bottom is completely healed.</li>
            <li> I was given some of these in the hospital after surgery and was amazed at the high quality and the fact that they had no irritating chemicals but are just wet enough and well lubricated enough to thoroughly clean with no irritation, no matter how firmly one wipes. I have very sensitive skin and multiple allergies and the solutions in most wipes irritate me, but not these, plus they are incredibly smooth. They clean extremely well, and the thin layer of protection they leave behind does not make one feel wet or irritated. They are far superior than any other wipe I have ever previously used. Great for thoroughly cleaning the entire underside for a female when one cannot shower due to surgery or other reasons. I have continued to buy them to use as regular wipes for a final cleansing, but cut each in 1/4 for economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloths are like very thick non-woven polyester, at least 3 times as thick as any previous wipe I have used. The manufacturer sells another similar cloth just for bathing. Be sure you get the incontinence version (this one) if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides: If you want to only use them occasionally, you should seal the wipes in an airtight container. If you will use all 32 within a couple of weeks, they probably won&#x27;t dry out in the original container, depending on the humidity level in your home. These ARE NOT flushable. Amazon&#x27;s sellers are charging WAY too much for these and you can find them at another major online retailer at one half to one quarter the price at the time of this writing.</li>
            <li> Really like using this.</li>
            <li> These are so gentle on sensitive skin and leave you feeling so very clean! I would definitely recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> I first learned of these when my father was in the hospital, they are expensive but well worth it.  very pleased</li>
            <li> My husband is disabled and I try to make him as comfortable as possible. These help keep him clean and irritation free.</li>
            <li> The cloths are wonderful. He had used them in the hospital and I am so glad I can order them .</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it. I love this product for my elderly mom, they are thick and are not drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as they are the same as the ones used in the hospital and are very good.  Will order more.</li>
            <li> Great, durable product.</li>
            <li> Excellent soft thick and durable. Completely removes residue from lotions with ease. We used this on my relative with severely irritated and red skin rash secondary to being in diaper. These wipes made it very easy to remove the creams we used to help heal rash without having to use any sort of force. Very gentle indeed.</li>
            <li> This is a very hard to find item that is used in hospitals.  Not inexpensive but certainly a good product.</li>
            <li> I really like these a lot. I use these on my elderly Mother. Does a wonderful job in providing a barrier so the skin does not break down. Would Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These wipes are big and heavy, which feels good, but the cream leaves a wetness and slick feeling that doesn&#x27;t.  I would recommend these only if you are in need of something for bad irritation or skin breakdown.  They are great for that, but I&#x27;d use something else for cases where simple cleaning is enough.</li>
            <li> We used This product for the first time at the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in West Orange , NJ for the first time. My wife was hospitlized there for 3 months. The product was the best! I continued to use it when she came home over 4 months ago.</li>
            <li> OK, talking about \\&quot;incontinence cream cloths\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the most appetizing thing in the world. But Comfort Shields really work. The are soft, smooth, and easy on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And anybody could have use for this product, even if they don&#x27;t have an incontinence problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I did.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> helpful a bit greasy  i think they should use less lotion  or cleaning  solution one goes a long way they are helpful</li>
