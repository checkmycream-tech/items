            <li>It is very soft, flexible and lightweight to wear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the first one I bought last year and the elastic and gel have held up well.</li>
            <li>No leaks or problems so far....</li>
            <li>I get frequent throbbing headaches and one of the things that helps give me relief are these Elast-Gel Sinus Masks.</li>
            <li>It not only relaxes me and helps relieve my pain but the combination of hot and cold together just feels so good</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps to get rid of my dry eye issues.</li>
            <li> Keep it in the freezer; works wonders on my migraines, especially if you get feverish like I do at the onset.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use these products, I lie down in bed with my heating pad on my back and my Elasto-Gel masks over eyes, forehead, and neck.</li>
            <li> I keep them in the freezer and whenever I feel the need to lie down due to my pain, I place one mask over my eyes, one mask on my forehead, and then I place one mask around the back of neck.</li>
            <li> I am recovering from brain surgery, and I needed a cold pack I could secure on parts of my head.  </li>
            <li> The product is what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I am a big believer in hot and cold therapy.</li>
            <li> I followed suit with other reviewers and ordered another</li>
            <li> I have purchased other brands that just don&#x27;t measure up.</li>
            <li> I have purchased ten masks within the past year</li>
            <li> The gel is thick enough to retain heat for 15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> very comfy but doesn&#x27;t stay cold very long</li>
            <li> Unlike masks with beads or rice, I can use this sitting up while listening to guided meditations, or while lying down on my side since the gel doesn&#x27;t fall to the bottom of the mask like the beads do.</li>
            <li> Five stars hands down!</li>
            <li> For anyone who suffers from pain or chronic pain, I highly recommend this form of therapy.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t have gotten through these past few years without these products.</li>
            <li> I have only used the mask cold</li>
            <li> It only stays cold for about 20 mins and it takes about 2 hours to chill again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 next week, and I&#x27;ve had TERRIBLE MIGRAINES since I was 5 years old.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a gel, it doesn&#x27;t get way too cold like ice or other cold packs.  </li>
            <li> not like the 3x10 3lb cold wrap, which usally lasts at least one hour.</li>
            <li> I just wished that it held the cold longer.</li>
            <li> I also use it cold, but not as often.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay cool for more than an hour even if you&#x27;ve left it in the freezer for the reccomend amount of time</li>
            <li> Great relief for eye strain or headache.  Ice packs don&#x27;t fit well on your eyeballs!  No leaks or problems so far....</li>
            <li> I love this gel mask. I use it for everything, my wrist, my migraines, my knee. Wherever I can attach it I use it. I like that it can stay in the freezer in it&#x27;s ziplock bag and still be flexible when you need to use it. The material allows the mask to be used straight out of the freezer without hurting your skin by direct contact.</li>
            <li> I love this mask so much for my Migraine&#x27;s, that I bought two!</li>
            <li> I am a professional headache sufferer who is avoids the pharma route as much as poss.  These little dandies really do the job!  You can adjust the tension with the velcro strap at the back of the mask.  I followed suit with other reviewers and ordered another so there is always one in the freezer.  Much better than popping pills.</li>
            <li> The mask is great, but I wish the temperature would hold for more than about 30-45 minutes</li>
            <li> Comfortable to wear, yet it seems to cool down too soon.  Seems to only stay warm for about six minutes..not like the 3x10 3lb cold wrap, which usally lasts at least one hour.</li>
            <li> This is a must for my migraine headaches!  this is my 2nd one.  Fits well.</li>
            <li> The product is what I expected.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps to get rid of my dry eye issues.</li>
            <li> very comfy but doesn&#x27;t stay cold very long</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  I am recovering from brain surgery, and I needed a cold pack I could secure on parts of my head.

Because it&#x27;s a gel, it doesn&#x27;t get way too cold like ice or other cold packs.  It is nice and soft, so I can go to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the freezer and use it in the morning to relieve sinus inflammation and puffy eyes.  It is very soft, flexible and lightweight to wear.  I have purchased other brands that just don&#x27;t measure up. I replace this brand only when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I have severe sinus problems. I get relief when I put the heated mask on.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I bought two and sleep with one on every night. I just wished that it held the cold longer.</li>
            <li> I love these! The gel is thick enough to retain heat for 15 minutes or so. Unlike masks with beads or rice, I can use this sitting up while listening to guided meditations, or while lying down on my side since the gel doesn&#x27;t fall to the bottom of the mask like the beads do. I also use it cold, but not as often. I ended up buying one for work, one for my mom, and a pair for home so I can keep one in the freezer and have one for heat. I&#x27;m still using the first one I bought last year and the elastic and gel have held up well.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye mask I have ever purchased! It is so comfortable and forms nicely to wherever I use it whether it is over my eyez, the back of my neck or even my knee. The elestic velcro strap is nice and it does not get tangled and pull my hair like many other mask straps have. I have only used the mask cold but I am planning on getting another to use for heat.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has constant sinus headaches.  He loves it and I&#x27;m glad he doesn&#x27;t have to keep popping Tylenols pills to get rid of his headache.  Note: It only stays cold for about 20 mins and it takes about 2 hours to chill again.  SO BUY TWO and save yourself the frustration!</li>
            <li> This mask really helps when I have migraines. I bought 2 so I could swap them in and out of the freezer!</li>
            <li> Elasto-Gel Products are the best of the best. I have been suffering from Chronic Pain for years and I couldn&#x27;t have gotten through these past few years without these products. I get frequent throbbing headaches and one of the things that helps give me relief are these Elast-Gel Sinus Masks. I have purchased ten masks within the past year and I not only use them for my eyes but for my forehead and neck as well. I keep them in the freezer and whenever I feel the need to lie down due to my pain, I place one mask over my eyes, one mask on my forehead, and then I place one mask around the back of neck. I am a big believer in hot and cold therapy. Everytime I use these products, I lie down in bed with my heating pad on my back and my Elasto-Gel masks over eyes, forehead, and neck. For anyone who suffers from pain or chronic pain, I highly recommend this form of therapy. It not only relaxes me and helps relieve my pain but the combination of hot and cold together just feels so good and so soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the sinus mask, Elasto-Gel makes other great products for the back, hands and feet, and neck. These are wonderful products and I highly recommend to anyone and everyone searching for pain relief. Five stars hands down!</li>
            <li> Keep it in the freezer; works wonders on my migraines, especially if you get feverish like I do at the onset. I&#x27;m 36 next week, and I&#x27;ve had TERRIBLE MIGRAINES since I was 5 years old.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> love this! have used it straight out of the freezer and it helps tremendously with sinus puffiness and headaches; but left it next to my bed and found that the cooling gel is still soothing after it&#x27;s been sitting out for days! I actually ended up sleeping in this morning with this on--it was soothing and blocked out the light--really nice.</li>
