            <li>I cut my own hair and their hair clippers have done an excellent job.</li>
            <li>What a great buy at 28.80 screaming deal.</li>
            <li>great item to use in house and on the go.</li>
            <li>worked great for what I used it for my mustache</li>
            <li>Very nice product, works great.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing set, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li>All of the rest are top notch very happy.</li>
            <li>Great for the price for sure!</li>
            <li>For the price, this is about as good as it gets, but remember to oil the trimmer blade</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband who loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good set to trim all head hair - beards, nose and ears.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price</li>
            <li>Wahl is usually a good brand, but not this model.</li>
            <li>and they make a good product and this follows suit.</li>
            <li>Does the job and holds a charge well plus has a good deal of attachments .</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more like a docking type station but still happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Everything you need to take care of just about any kind of unwanted hair on your body.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works fine but just dont expect all the accessories to be good.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have so many options in one package.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using this for awhile now, still kicking strong!  </li>
            <li>Good product and quick service.</li>
            <li>My Remington shaving system has worked over 5 years, recharges in no time, and works much better.</li>
            <li>He is already in love.</li>
            <li>Changing blades, switching to nose trimmer can be challenging.</li>
            <li>Sometimes reliable is much more important than some fancy pants tech that breaks!</li>
            <li>I was more concerned about the unruly sideburns</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work better on the chin as he gets more hair.</li>
            <li>So I would say it&#x27;s ok for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend and everything works okay besides the shaving head for his face.</li>
            <li>great item and fast shipping</li>
            <li>All attachments work great, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space and my husband loves it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I believe I will be quite pleased with this for years to come.</li>
            <li>Would have been able to do 5 stars but the noise level makes it an inefficient all in one.</li>
            <li>Rather spend the money on a better quality unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>probably would have had better luck if I ponied up the additional money and bought a trimmer from there PRO Line.  </li>
            <li>As a consumer I would gladly pay for an item of this quality if it came with all the trimming accessories.</li>
            <li>okay as a trimmer.</li>
            <li>and it worked better than this one.</li>
            <li>I have been a customer of Wahl products for many years.</li>
            <li>I would have to tap the trimmer in my hand to get the motor to get some more &#x27;kick&#x27; to it.</li>
            <li>Stan could have been designed much better.</li>
            <li>Given the price, however, I can&#x27;t find too many complaints.</li>
            <li>This one is much better.</li>
            <li>it is very portable and easy to use and does a great job</li>
            <li>Funny how its made for ladies and does things twice as good as something made for men.</li>
            <li>It has more attachments, is rechargable, and is more accurate as well.</li>
            <li>This works great so far.</li>
            <li>This works great so far.</li>
            <li>have no problems so far works great.</li>
            <li>&quot; A very quick spritz with Wahl blade care</li>
            <li>so I thought this trimmer would be easy to hold to do an even controlled job on the sideburns.</li>
            <li>Yet many that shave regularly, seem to be happy with it.</li>
            <li>Sturday and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I find the attachments easy to change</li>
            <li>The interchangeable accessories attach quite easily and the guards make for easy trims.  </li>
            <li>Although the power isn&#x27;t that strong (I didn&#x27;t want to buy anything</li>
            <li>For the price and what he needs it&#x27;ll be fine for a year or so.</li>
            <li>Great set, solid and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The attachment heads broke on the very first use!</li>
            <li>The battery life seems great so far, and it does exactly what I need it to do!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: 14 months later, this trimmer is still working great.</li>
            <li>A device like this should be easy to clean and rust resistant.</li>
            <li>I could only use the trimmer and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I liked the screened attachment for shaving so much that I replaced my Braun shaver with a WAHL shaver.  </li>
            <li>Pieces are easy to change out, and to clean.</li>
            <li>This is a great groomer for daily trims.</li>
            <li>For the price, you can find far superior &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Nice size, includes various attachments for a variety of uses, has a nice stand to organize everything, and seems sturdy.</li>
            <li>The attachments are very useful.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I wasn&#x27;t just able to buy a new battery.  </li>
            <li>Not that easy if your in a hurry to do a quick clean up.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I was spoiled with my original trimmer.</li>
            <li>When I go in and get my haircut, my stylist likes to pull out his Wahl and give me a clean up trim.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know who designed the tray to hold the attachments but some of them doesn&#x27;t fit right or don&#x27;t fit in the slot at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li>This is a good quality unit and has enough power to do what the needs.</li>
            <li>This happened even after a full charge.</li>
            <li>The holder is very flimsy but if you can live with that you are good to go.</li>
            <li>This thing is almost as loud as the Oster Classic 76 that I use to cut my hair, that may bother some, but it was a good sign to me...sounded strong and powerful.</li>
            <li>I have a really Li-Ion Wahl full size clipper that has performed flawlessly for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, comfortable to hold, and recharges nicely.</li>
            <li>You are better off spending more money and get one that does not have all the individual heads.</li>
            <li>Kind of cheap- all the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; little parts, comb etc are more for a toy doll.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works good as long as you don&#x27;t use the attachments that are included.</li>
            <li>you use it the first time!</li>
            <li>biggest beef with this is the tray, it&#x27;s great to have everything in the tray, but several of the items just don&#x27;t fit correctly and therefore fall out on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>On to the detail trimmer smooth as expected, it&#x27;s nice to have two eyebrows again.</li>
            <li>and it takes more than a day to charge completely.</li>
            <li>Well built, powerful.</li>
            <li>It would also be really great if you could just plug the trimmer into the tray and have it charge, but instead (and my old norelco was the same way)</li>
            <li>I mean you make the perfect groomer and decide you just don&#x27;t have it in you to use some of that engineering skill to create a tray that actually REALLY holds the attachments?  </li>
            <li>they kind of snap into the open end of the hand held unit, but they don&#x27;t quite go in right, but somehow connect????  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be better off with a straight razor and a decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Good luck trying on the other attachments.</li>
            <li>Replacement was better, but Charge doesnt seem to hold full power long,  have to use it plugged in.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Whal, you simply can&#x27;t stop thinking creatively after you make the groomer.</li>
            <li>Works well for basic trimming, the shaver is okay.</li>
            <li>Pay the extra money for a better quality kit.</li>
            <li>My husband has owned these for years, but this is the first time we have had issues from the get go.</li>
            <li>Battery life declined rapidly and couldnt work for more than 2 min off charger only 3 months into owning.</li>
            <li>First non-great experience with a Wahl product</li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>What I do like is that the length guards seem more durable than my last brand.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a week or so (use it only 1-2 minutes per week to keep sideburns/nose and ear hair under control).  </li>
            <li>It is a good basic kit and he uses it to shave his head as well as his facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Second wahl I&#x27;ve purchase within six months does not keep a good charge even when plugged in constantly.</li>
            <li>My disappointed was abated a good deal when I discovered how easily II was able to return it for another one.  </li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I bought a Remington Model MB-4040 which gives a better cut and has a powerful (a little noisy) motor.</li>
            <li>Smooth fast grooming of the gross places...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very thorough when it comes to cleaning my clippers and hair</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very well.</li>
            <li>Motor sounds cheap battery dies out in the middle of use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t deny that it is useful and the quality is crystal clear</li>
            <li>Really wish I could return it because I just gave it to him</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always well groomed thanks to the Wahl 9855-300 Groomsman Pro All-in-one Rechargeable Grooming Kit.  </li>
            <li>Being a Wahl, I expected more.  </li>
            <li>Ouch, so much for the self sharpening blades claim.</li>
            <li>The trimmers work really well</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t hold charge very well</li>
            <li>Very well-built and works very well.</li>
            <li>The heads can be tricky to replace at times, but over all really like this product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and quality product as described.</li>
            <li>My old Wahl groomer finally died after many years of faithful service.</li>
            <li>It feels very cheap due all of the plastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product so far, however the blade is REALLY sharp and I have nicked myself several time while using it.</li>
            <li>Should have paid more attention to the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>My old walhl works better than this new one,trimmer head is to slow other attachments work great</li>
            <li>I guess we are moving on to a much higher quality razer, my son wants to try the trimmers with the three spinning parts, like his dads old one.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have special facial hair.  </li>
            <li>so strong my son would loose control anyway), he uses it plugged in, so</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found for whatever reason that using this one just as a razor gives a much more uneven cut than I expected, and tends to pull more than you I would expect given its size, etc.  </li>
            <li>Kinda hard to swap out the different heads, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as powerful compared to other Wahl rechargeable products I&#x27;ve owned, but it is more versatile with the different attachments.</li>
            <li>I clicked the button and the motor buzzed with the initial charge from the factory, it seemed adequate.</li>
            <li>had the older groomsman and had no complaints about that one</li>
            <li>They had me send in the charger, main body and blades.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I happen to have a similar power adaptor.</li>
            <li>Main unit, and attachments, are well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I think it is an ok travel trimmer or back up for infrequent use, but for daily use it did not hold up.    </li>
            <li>It is although a high quality razor and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a very good job cutting hair evenly.</li>
            <li>It was nice while it lasted but going to have to go for a more expensive one that will last longer.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have a great experience with this groomer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many similar razors to this and agree that this model is powerful (and unlike some other reviewers I&#x27;ve found at least some of the attachments to be worthwhile)</li>
            <li>The motor isn&#x27;t very powerful, and yes - I did oil the clipper head to see if helps - not much.  </li>
            <li>So I returned it, didnt seem to want a new one</li>
            <li>The new one does not have this issue.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed after about three months of using it, the battery charge would not last.  </li>
            <li>The moter barely has the strength to trim a beard and the batteries drain much quicker than advertised and takealmost  24 hours to recgarge.</li>
            <li>4 stars because it&#x27;s good enough for now, but Im not sure about the future.</li>
            <li>I actually like my previous trimmer better that I got for Christmas 6 years ago, and it was a cheaper brand.  </li>
            <li>There are so many beard trimmers out there, it&#x27;s just hard to choose.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended The Groomsman Pro when my old trimmer died.</li>
            <li>Next I tried the foil shaver and while it isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, it worked very well and didn&#x27;t pull at all.</li>
            <li>Got this trimmer for my 14 year old son.</li>
            <li>Second thing I noticed is the so called stainless steel blades are a joke.  </li>
            <li>His Wahl is almost silent and very well made.  </li>
            <li>You can tell as soon as you open the package that this trimmer is built very well.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the fact I have to uncrew the clipper to attach the other tips it is a possibility to lose parts.</li>
            <li>My first thought was \\&quot;heavy, feels really solid\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Until now personal grooming products were made cheaply, striving to be $10.00 or less.  </li>
            <li>If you buy both the large blade and small trimmer with tax and shipping you can buy a whole new kit at WalMart</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how long the charge really lasts.</li>
            <li>My husbands 30 year old rotary shaver does a better shave, but the popup blade is broken.</li>
            <li>Talk about a major let-down.  </li>
            <li>the heads are a little diffcult to change other than that i am really enjoying using this wahl clipper.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my facial hair trimmer, it&#x27;s simply not strong or precise</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, it&#x27;s a very decent trimmer when it comes to completely trimming some sparse bits of hair down</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay charged very long like an older model I had.</li>
            <li>The bare clipper went though my 3 day stubble with ease.</li>
            <li>...so low that when I went to trim my beard, the hair would stop the motor completely.</li>
            <li>The only down side is the comb - it&#x27;s sharp and cuts skin easily.</li>
            <li>Two of the three cutting heads just don&#x27;t fit in right.</li>
            <li>I was really let down.  </li>
            <li>Like some other reviewers have said, the motor would run on high and then all the sudden rev on low</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does the job and holds a charge well plus has a good deal of attachments .</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more like a docking type station but still happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Everything you need to take care of just about any kind of unwanted hair on your body.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works fine but just dont expect all the accessories to be good.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have so many options in one package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using this for awhile now, still kicking strong!  </li>
            <li> Good product and quick service.</li>
            <li> My Remington shaving system has worked over 5 years, recharges in no time, and works much better.</li>
            <li> He is already in love.</li>
            <li> Changing blades, switching to nose trimmer can be challenging.</li>
            <li> Sometimes reliable is much more important than some fancy pants tech that breaks!</li>
            <li> I was more concerned about the unruly sideburns</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work better on the chin as he gets more hair.</li>
            <li> So I would say it&#x27;s ok for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and everything works okay besides the shaving head for his face.</li>
            <li> great item and fast shipping</li>
            <li> All attachments work great, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space and my husband loves it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I believe I will be quite pleased with this for years to come.</li>
            <li> Would have been able to do 5 stars but the noise level makes it an inefficient all in one.</li>
            <li> Rather spend the money on a better quality unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> probably would have had better luck if I ponied up the additional money and bought a trimmer from there PRO Line.  </li>
            <li> As a consumer I would gladly pay for an item of this quality if it came with all the trimming accessories.</li>
            <li> okay as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> and it worked better than this one.</li>
            <li> I have been a customer of Wahl products for many years.</li>
            <li> I would have to tap the trimmer in my hand to get the motor to get some more &#x27;kick&#x27; to it.</li>
            <li> Stan could have been designed much better.</li>
            <li> Given the price, however, I can&#x27;t find too many complaints.</li>
            <li> This one is much better.</li>
            <li> it is very portable and easy to use and does a great job</li>
            <li> Funny how its made for ladies and does things twice as good as something made for men.</li>
            <li> It has more attachments, is rechargable, and is more accurate as well.</li>
            <li> This works great so far.</li>
            <li> This works great so far.</li>
            <li> have no problems so far works great.</li>
            <li> &quot; A very quick spritz with Wahl blade care</li>
            <li> so I thought this trimmer would be easy to hold to do an even controlled job on the sideburns.</li>
            <li> Yet many that shave regularly, seem to be happy with it.</li>
            <li> Sturday and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I find the attachments easy to change</li>
            <li> The interchangeable accessories attach quite easily and the guards make for easy trims.  </li>
            <li> Although the power isn&#x27;t that strong (I didn&#x27;t want to buy anything</li>
            <li> For the price and what he needs it&#x27;ll be fine for a year or so.</li>
            <li> Great set, solid and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The attachment heads broke on the very first use!</li>
            <li> The battery life seems great so far, and it does exactly what I need it to do!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: 14 months later, this trimmer is still working great.</li>
            <li> A device like this should be easy to clean and rust resistant.</li>
            <li> I could only use the trimmer and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I liked the screened attachment for shaving so much that I replaced my Braun shaver with a WAHL shaver.  </li>
            <li> Pieces are easy to change out, and to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great groomer for daily trims.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can find far superior &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Nice size, includes various attachments for a variety of uses, has a nice stand to organize everything, and seems sturdy.</li>
            <li> The attachments are very useful.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I wasn&#x27;t just able to buy a new battery.  </li>
            <li> Not that easy if your in a hurry to do a quick clean up.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I was spoiled with my original trimmer.</li>
            <li> When I go in and get my haircut, my stylist likes to pull out his Wahl and give me a clean up trim.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know who designed the tray to hold the attachments but some of them doesn&#x27;t fit right or don&#x27;t fit in the slot at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li> This is a good quality unit and has enough power to do what the needs.</li>
            <li> This happened even after a full charge.</li>
            <li> The holder is very flimsy but if you can live with that you are good to go.</li>
            <li> This thing is almost as loud as the Oster Classic 76 that I use to cut my hair, that may bother some, but it was a good sign to me...sounded strong and powerful.</li>
            <li> I have a really Li-Ion Wahl full size clipper that has performed flawlessly for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, comfortable to hold, and recharges nicely.</li>
            <li> You are better off spending more money and get one that does not have all the individual heads.</li>
            <li> Kind of cheap- all the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; little parts, comb etc are more for a toy doll.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works good as long as you don&#x27;t use the attachments that are included.</li>
            <li> you use it the first time!</li>
            <li> biggest beef with this is the tray, it&#x27;s great to have everything in the tray, but several of the items just don&#x27;t fit correctly and therefore fall out on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> On to the detail trimmer smooth as expected, it&#x27;s nice to have two eyebrows again.</li>
            <li> and it takes more than a day to charge completely.</li>
            <li> Well built, powerful.</li>
            <li> It would also be really great if you could just plug the trimmer into the tray and have it charge, but instead (and my old norelco was the same way)</li>
            <li> I mean you make the perfect groomer and decide you just don&#x27;t have it in you to use some of that engineering skill to create a tray that actually REALLY holds the attachments?  </li>
            <li> they kind of snap into the open end of the hand held unit, but they don&#x27;t quite go in right, but somehow connect????  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be better off with a straight razor and a decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Good luck trying on the other attachments.</li>
            <li> Replacement was better, but Charge doesnt seem to hold full power long,  have to use it plugged in.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Whal, you simply can&#x27;t stop thinking creatively after you make the groomer.</li>
            <li> Works well for basic trimming, the shaver is okay.</li>
            <li> Pay the extra money for a better quality kit.</li>
            <li> My husband has owned these for years, but this is the first time we have had issues from the get go.</li>
            <li> Battery life declined rapidly and couldnt work for more than 2 min off charger only 3 months into owning.</li>
            <li> First non-great experience with a Wahl product</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> What I do like is that the length guards seem more durable than my last brand.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a week or so (use it only 1-2 minutes per week to keep sideburns/nose and ear hair under control).  </li>
            <li> It is a good basic kit and he uses it to shave his head as well as his facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Second wahl I&#x27;ve purchase within six months does not keep a good charge even when plugged in constantly.</li>
            <li> My disappointed was abated a good deal when I discovered how easily II was able to return it for another one.  </li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought a Remington Model MB-4040 which gives a better cut and has a powerful (a little noisy) motor.</li>
            <li> Smooth fast grooming of the gross places...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very thorough when it comes to cleaning my clippers and hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very well.</li>
            <li> Motor sounds cheap battery dies out in the middle of use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t deny that it is useful and the quality is crystal clear</li>
            <li> Really wish I could return it because I just gave it to him</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always well groomed thanks to the Wahl 9855-300 Groomsman Pro All-in-one Rechargeable Grooming Kit.  </li>
            <li> Being a Wahl, I expected more.  </li>
            <li> Ouch, so much for the self sharpening blades claim.</li>
            <li> The trimmers work really well</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold charge very well</li>
            <li> Very well-built and works very well.</li>
            <li> The heads can be tricky to replace at times, but over all really like this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and quality product as described.</li>
            <li> My old Wahl groomer finally died after many years of faithful service.</li>
            <li> It feels very cheap due all of the plastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product so far, however the blade is REALLY sharp and I have nicked myself several time while using it.</li>
            <li> Should have paid more attention to the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> My old walhl works better than this new one,trimmer head is to slow other attachments work great</li>
            <li> I guess we are moving on to a much higher quality razer, my son wants to try the trimmers with the three spinning parts, like his dads old one.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have special facial hair.  </li>
            <li> so strong my son would loose control anyway), he uses it plugged in, so</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found for whatever reason that using this one just as a razor gives a much more uneven cut than I expected, and tends to pull more than you I would expect given its size, etc.  </li>
            <li> Kinda hard to swap out the different heads, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as powerful compared to other Wahl rechargeable products I&#x27;ve owned, but it is more versatile with the different attachments.</li>
            <li> I clicked the button and the motor buzzed with the initial charge from the factory, it seemed adequate.</li>
            <li> had the older groomsman and had no complaints about that one</li>
            <li> They had me send in the charger, main body and blades.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I happen to have a similar power adaptor.</li>
            <li> Main unit, and attachments, are well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I think it is an ok travel trimmer or back up for infrequent use, but for daily use it did not hold up.    </li>
            <li> It is although a high quality razor and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a very good job cutting hair evenly.</li>
            <li> It was nice while it lasted but going to have to go for a more expensive one that will last longer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have a great experience with this groomer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many similar razors to this and agree that this model is powerful (and unlike some other reviewers I&#x27;ve found at least some of the attachments to be worthwhile)</li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t very powerful, and yes - I did oil the clipper head to see if helps - not much.  </li>
            <li> So I returned it, didnt seem to want a new one</li>
            <li> The new one does not have this issue.  </li>
            <li> First thing I noticed after about three months of using it, the battery charge would not last.  </li>
            <li> The moter barely has the strength to trim a beard and the batteries drain much quicker than advertised and takealmost  24 hours to recgarge.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it&#x27;s good enough for now, but Im not sure about the future.</li>
            <li> I actually like my previous trimmer better that I got for Christmas 6 years ago, and it was a cheaper brand.  </li>
            <li> There are so many beard trimmers out there, it&#x27;s just hard to choose.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended The Groomsman Pro when my old trimmer died.</li>
            <li> Next I tried the foil shaver and while it isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, it worked very well and didn&#x27;t pull at all.</li>
            <li> Got this trimmer for my 14 year old son.</li>
            <li> Second thing I noticed is the so called stainless steel blades are a joke.  </li>
            <li> His Wahl is almost silent and very well made.  </li>
            <li> You can tell as soon as you open the package that this trimmer is built very well.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the fact I have to uncrew the clipper to attach the other tips it is a possibility to lose parts.</li>
            <li> My first thought was \\&quot;heavy, feels really solid\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Until now personal grooming products were made cheaply, striving to be $10.00 or less.  </li>
            <li> If you buy both the large blade and small trimmer with tax and shipping you can buy a whole new kit at WalMart</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how long the charge really lasts.</li>
            <li> My husbands 30 year old rotary shaver does a better shave, but the popup blade is broken.</li>
            <li> Talk about a major let-down.  </li>
            <li> the heads are a little diffcult to change other than that i am really enjoying using this wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my facial hair trimmer, it&#x27;s simply not strong or precise</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, it&#x27;s a very decent trimmer when it comes to completely trimming some sparse bits of hair down</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged very long like an older model I had.</li>
            <li> The bare clipper went though my 3 day stubble with ease.</li>
            <li> ...so low that when I went to trim my beard, the hair would stop the motor completely.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the comb - it&#x27;s sharp and cuts skin easily.</li>
            <li> Two of the three cutting heads just don&#x27;t fit in right.</li>
            <li> I was really let down.  </li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers have said, the motor would run on high and then all the sudden rev on low</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just with my hair, the short guard is too short and the long guard leaves the hair just long enough to curl back up and tickle my nose</li>
            <li> The first blade is dull and needs to be unscrewed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> The new one arrived a few days later</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I&#x27;m still not sure which attachment goes where because none of them really seem like they belong in any of the positions.  </li>
            <li> But some close-up footage actually showing the process would have been gone a long way towards learning the process.</li>
            <li> You are forced to charge it first.  </li>
            <li> Only other downside is that the unit is not very wide.</li>
            <li> The trimmer heads are also not as user friendly as my last brand, which just twisted on and off.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a little loud but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this trimmer as being very high quality, but it will probably do the job at least on the sideburns for a while.</li>
            <li> surprisingly loud for such a small unit.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t expected that the duration of the battery would be so short</li>
            <li> The nose clipper tends to pull your hair if you have long nose hair.</li>
            <li> if your not careful will change on you mid-trim, woops looks like I have to shave down the goatee to make everything even again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has unruly, uneven sideburns and gets a handful of 1/4 inch long hairs on his chin and above the upper lip.</li>
            <li> Works well, rather powerful little sucker.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this one is that it doesn&#x27;t keep charge very long.  </li>
            <li> when you take the front to clean it is difficult to re-attach</li>
            <li> Ten dollars shipping, for a $22.00 item, just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not very much power or battery</li>
            <li> The only down side is it took forever to get here.</li>
            <li> This one helped me realize how dull my old one was</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon (guess I didn&#x27;t look hard enough), so I bought it at my local superstore.</li>
            <li> Even after days of charging, when I initially flip the switch, the motor sounds \\&quot;bogged down.\\</li>
            <li> Not what I expected out of Wahl.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to push on the blade itself with your finger</li>
            <li> Was looking to save some $ by not replacing my relatively-pricey Norelco Philips when it died after a few year, but I should have spent the extra.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with WAHL quality head cutting products for consumer &amp; animal.  </li>
            <li> Son found it a bit uncomfortable on his several days old stubble, but we did not expect it to be used in that application so were not surprised.</li>
            <li> For the price, other shavers are splash-proof or water resistant, this device is not.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the stand for it makes no sense</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t do much other then trim nose hair and in and around the ears--</li>
            <li> NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> I emailed Wahl prior to there post on my complaint.  </li>
            <li> Only 1 complaint...</li>
            <li> It also boggs down when using it, even when it&#x27;s plugged in.  </li>
            <li> Even the company engineer&#x27;s YouTube video did a poor job of showing how to perform these basic functions - not particularly intuitive.</li>
            <li> It worked less than six months and worked no longer.</li>
            <li> Hate the stupid stand it comes in, but other than that, this is the perfect groomer for everyday or weekly upkeep.</li>
            <li> Whether this is plugged in or charged there is little power.</li>
            <li> Its a little louder then the unit I sent in.  </li>
            <li> This one is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They pop off and on, it just takes a few minutes to figure out how since there are no instructions on that.</li>
            <li> Finally found a grooming kit with some muscle behind it.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and when the battery does go dead you can&#x27;t plug this unit it and run it off the outlet.  </li>
            <li> It should not be that much trouble to go from</li>
            <li> The power adaptor cannot charge the clipper after a few months.</li>
            <li> charge cable does not fit the tray to plug into the groomer</li>
            <li> when the trimmer is plugged in, there is not a light to tell it is charging, charged, dead, etc.</li>
            <li> Although it does its job as far as hair removal, it is extremely cumbersome when it comes to exchanging cutting heads.</li>
            <li> I had whal clippers for cutting hair in high school and college</li>
            <li> The trimmer blade seems stained in one small place.</li>
            <li> I love the idea, but the motor on the clipper was just terrible.</li>
            <li> The blades are weak and cut inconsistently resulting in an uneven trim or buzz.  </li>
            <li> Cannot be used for that unless you are hard of hearing.  </li>
            <li> reason for this late review was I decided to try and buy a replacement blade for this unit.  </li>
            <li> It is time consuming and confusing.</li>
            <li> Your forced to keep in plugged in 24/7 if you want to make it through a trim.</li>
            <li> The little comb and brush are weird, the base doesn&#x27;t really have indentations that fit/</li>
            <li> For me, the WAHL shaver shaves closer than the Braun, much less expensive -- as are the replacement screen &amp; blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After eight months of use the larger blade become useless, instead of cutting hair it was pulling it out....</li>
            <li> Heads are very hard to pop on and off.</li>
            <li> you have to plug in a cord directly to the trimmer, which isn&#x27;t real bad, but it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> It was very weak even when fully charged.</li>
            <li> Only had it for 4 months broken already !!!!</li>
            <li> this is a useless product and i will not recommend anyone to buy this</li>
            <li> Just be prepared to put the attachments in a drawer or something because the tray is useless.  </li>
            <li> sorry manny mejia</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> But, it is difficult to change the attachments and not convenient.</li>
            <li> The tray attachment is somewhat useless for me; however, I did not buy this for the tray.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Wahl products.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to change the heads and does not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> What a weird thing this is....</li>
            <li> It certainly is a weird thing.....</li>
            <li> Very poorly designed.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments will NOT stay in the tray.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This was disappointing.</li>
            <li> nothing thats crazy.  </li>
            <li> Any moisture, even when using the supplied cutting oil causes the blades to rust.  </li>
            <li> A disappointment from an established brand.</li>
            <li> how bad can it be?&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Bad.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when it arrived to discover that the charger would not sufficiently plug into the unit.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the base that holds all the parts.  </li>
            <li> they fall out of the base all the time.  </li>
            <li> A+ if not for the completely pathetic tray for all the attachments.  </li>

            <li> A friend recommended The Groomsman Pro when my old trimmer died. I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon (guess I didn&#x27;t look hard enough), so I bought it at my local superstore. My first thought was \\&quot;heavy, feels really solid\\&quot;. I clicked the button and the motor buzzed with the initial charge from the factory, it seemed adequate. I tossed it on the charger for about 7 hours and when I came to try it, I switched it on. This thing is almost as loud as the Oster Classic 76 that I use to cut my hair, that may bother some, but it was a good sign to me...sounded strong and powerful. The bare clipper went though my 3 day stubble with ease. Next I tried the foil shaver and while it isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, it worked very well and didn&#x27;t pull at all. On to the detail trimmer smooth as expected, it&#x27;s nice to have two eyebrows again. Now for the attachment that always disappoints...the ear/nose attachment. It really works! Smooth fast grooming of the gross places...no pulling or pain! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 14 months later, this trimmer is still working great. The only two things I&#x27;ve noticed are:&lt;br /&gt;1. The trimmer blade seems stained in one small place. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. I&#x27;m very thorough when it comes to cleaning my clippers and hair accessories.&lt;br /&gt;2. Even after days of charging, when I initially flip the switch, the motor sounds \\&quot;bogged down.\\&quot; A very quick spritz with Wahl blade care and it buzzes like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the money, I&#x27;m still very very happy.</li>
            <li> This is Great!!! Product</li>
            <li> Great quality &amp; Christmas gift</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, it&#x27;s a very decent trimmer when it comes to completely trimming some sparse bits of hair down but I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my facial hair trimmer, it&#x27;s simply not strong or precise enough- I&#x27;d be better off with a straight razor and a decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to my expectations.  The battery life seems great so far, and it does exactly what I need it to do!</li>
            <li> this is a useless product and i will not recommend anyone to buy this&lt;br /&gt;if you remove the charging even for 1 day,it will stop working and u have to wait for another 24 hours for this to get charged again.</li>
            <li> This unit would get a 5-Star A+ if not for the completely pathetic tray for all the attachments.  Whal?  What were you thinking?  I mean you make the perfect groomer and decide you just don&#x27;t have it in you to use some of that engineering skill to create a tray that actually REALLY holds the attachments?  Talk about a major let-down.  If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect groomer, this is it.  Just be prepared to put the attachments in a drawer or something because the tray is useless.  None of the attachments actually sit in their places.  As a matter of fact, I&#x27;m still not sure which attachment goes where because none of them really seem like they belong in any of the positions.  I was really let down.  Whal, you simply can&#x27;t stop thinking creatively after you make the groomer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very well. Not what I expected out of Wahl.</li>
            <li> Bought this set as a gift for my husband. It worked less than six months and worked no longer. While it did work, it was so/so in performance. I would not recommend this to anyone. My Remington shaving system has worked over 5 years, recharges in no time, and works much better. Funny how its made for ladies and does things twice as good as something made for men.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged very long like an older model I had. Motor sounds cheap battery dies out in the middle of use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t deny that it is useful and the quality is crystal clear but I didn&#x27;t expected that the duration of the battery would be so short and it takes more than a day to charge completely.</li>
            <li> Not quite as powerful compared to other Wahl rechargeable products I&#x27;ve owned, but it is more versatile with the different attachments.</li>
            <li> Well built, powerful.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is an excellent product.  But I would tell you to look in your backyard for a comparable deal.  With that said the versatility, quality, and reliability of this trimmer is off the charts.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, works great. Seller shipped promptly and it came in great condition.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is about as good as it gets, but remember to oil the trimmer blade *before* you use it the first time! It does not come oiled from the factory!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who loved it. After 3 months of use it stopped working and blades were rusty (no it&#x27;s not rusty because of water). It was nice while it lasted but going to have to go for a more expensive one that will last longer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  It is a good basic kit and he uses it to shave his head as well as his facial hair.  He&#x27;s used it 3-4 times with no complaints.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on prime day for my husband! He is already in love. Great product.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product. It felt like it was ripping the hair off my face. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> My old walhl works better than this new one,trimmer head is to slow other attachments work great sorry manny mejia</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good set to trim all head hair - beards, nose and ears. The only down side is the comb - it&#x27;s sharp and cuts skin easily.</li>
            <li> Works well for basic trimming, the shaver is okay.</li>
            <li> This works great so far. I have not any problem with it until now. The tray is tacky though. it has lots of power and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> The first blade is dull and needs to be unscrewed to be replaced. Good luck trying on the other attachments. Pay the extra money for a better quality kit. This one is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Changing blades, switching to nose trimmer can be challenging. It is quiet, comfortable to hold, and recharges nicely.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this item 5 stars, but had initial difficulty figuring out how to connect/disconnect/change trimmer heads. This was after removing and disassembling the trimmer head and having to figure out how to reassemble it. Even the company engineer&#x27;s YouTube video did a poor job of showing how to perform these basic functions - not particularly intuitive. He explained it well enough - probably. But some close-up footage actually showing the process would have been gone a long way towards learning the process.</li>
            <li> The attachment heads broke on the very first use! My husband has owned these for years, but this is the first time we have had issues from the get go. If I still had the packaging I would return it. Wahl shouldn&#x27;t change design just for the sake of change. Sometimes reliable is much more important than some fancy pants tech that breaks!</li>
            <li> I feel I should explain, if there was an adjustable guard or one between the ones they offer, I would have given them 5 stars no problem. It&#x27;s just with my hair, the short guard is too short and the long guard leaves the hair just long enough to curl back up and tickle my nose LOL ! Mechanically, grip, stand, everything is great!</li>
            <li> For the price, you can find far superior &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; groomers that don&#x27;t suffer the setbacks of this Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, the tray is miserable! It sounds like a nit-pick, but I assure you, attachments will go spilling all over your countertop the moment you reach for the shaver. Plus, cord constantly yanks the entire tray around when you try to plug the shaver in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device itself is underpowered and I found that it pulled at the hairs on my face, even the relatively short ones. Snapping the flimsy attachments on can prove bothersome, but it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the fact that the blades RUSTED, is what warrants the one-star review. For the price, other shavers are splash-proof or water resistant, this device is not. Not in the slightest. Despite thoroughly drying the metal blades after cleaning them and using the included thimble of oil, they rusted. Unacceptable. A device like this should be easy to clean and rust resistant.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> There are so many beard trimmers out there, it&#x27;s just hard to choose. After going through some of the highest rated, decided to get this one. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Wahl has always ben a quality product so that is why I bought this. Heads are very hard to pop on and off. You are better off spending more money and get one that does not have all the individual heads. I put the one head on and threw the rest away so that I would not be tempted to try again and get aggravated. The shaver works fine but just dont expect all the accessories to be good.</li>
            <li> Only had it for 4 months broken already !!!! Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the fact I have to uncrew the clipper to attach the other tips it is a possibility to lose parts. Should&#x27;ve been some sort of flip function to attach. It is although a high quality razor and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> This was disappointing. It was very weak even when fully charged. Wahl is usually a good brand, but not this model.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to. I&#x27;m happy with the product so far, however the blade is REALLY sharp and I have nicked myself several time while using it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for awhile now, still kicking strong!  I have to keep it plugged into the wall constantly because it seems to die if I don&#x27;t...  Other than that, this thing is still working well.  Great for the price for sure!</li>
            <li> returned it as to the battery will not charge.</li>
            <li> Although it does its job as far as hair removal, it is extremely cumbersome when it comes to exchanging cutting heads.</li>
            <li> Good product and quick service.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend. Doesn&#x27;t do a very good job cutting hair evenly. Battery life declined rapidly and couldnt work for more than 2 min off charger only 3 months into owning. Now cuts out on me now and then, again I&#x27;m only 3 months into owning.</li>
            <li> Got this trimmer for my 14 year old son. He has unruly, uneven sideburns and gets a handful of 1/4 inch long hairs on his chin and above the upper lip. As for the foil blade, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get close enough, still leaves stubble.I do wonder if this is because there aren&#x27;t enough hairs to grab. My husbands 30 year old rotary shaver does a better shave, but the popup blade is broken. I was more concerned about the unruly sideburns so I thought this trimmer would be easy to hold to do an even controlled job on the sideburns. And it seems to do so. Although the power isn&#x27;t that strong (I didn&#x27;t want to buy anything so strong my son would loose control anyway), he uses it plugged in, so I can&#x27;t say how long the charge really lasts. I don&#x27;t see this trimmer as being very high quality, but it will probably do the job at least on the sideburns for a while. Maybe it will work better on the chin as he gets more hair. For the price and what he needs it&#x27;ll be fine for a year or so. So I would say it&#x27;s ok for a beginner. Yet many that shave regularly, seem to be happy with it. 4 stars because it&#x27;s good enough for now, but Im not sure about the future. Oh, yeah, and lastly, you don&#x27;t have to take anything apart or unscrew anything to change the different trimmers. They pop off and on, it just takes a few minutes to figure out how since there are no instructions on that. Just be careful not to push on the blade itself with your finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE two months later. NOT worth the money. Whether this is plugged in or charged there is little power. My son realized it suddenly runs quieter and weaker. The only part that will even get any facial hair is the tiny size trimmer. It&#x27;s a shame my 4 star vote only lasted 2 months. I guess we are moving on to a much higher quality razer, my son wants to try the trimmers with the three spinning parts, like his dads old one. Now I hope I can find a good one on sale to make up for buying this Wahl trimmer!</li>
            <li> My son loves it, does everything it claims to</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and everything works okay besides the shaving head for his face. Really wish I could return it because I just gave it to him but the 30 days is up.... So it will probably just go into the trash</li>
            <li> Had to get an immediate replacement as it seemed to only run at 20% power despite being fully charged.  Replacement was better, but Charge doesnt seem to hold full power long,  have to use it plugged in.  First non-great experience with a Wahl product but this IS a budget version from what I can gather.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have so many options in one package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only item which leaving it out would improve the review is the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it is a great product that can be keep out on the sink.</li>
            <li> Even the \\&quot;long\\&quot; guard cuts too short. Whal sells longer guards but not for their trimmers. If this is for maintaining a longer beard then do not buy. It seems I will have to buy him a hair clipper.</li>
            <li> to change the heads, you have to use a screwdriver and take it apart to make a change.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it didnt seem to charge and it wouldnt work if it wasnt charging. So I returned it, didnt seem to want a new one so I ordered another kit. had the older groomsman and had no complaints about that one</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> I had whal clippers for cutting hair in high school and college and they make a good product and this follows suit. Does the job and holds a charge well plus has a good deal of attachments .</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Nothing fancy but works well, I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anybody.The holder is very flimsy but if you can live with that you are good to go. Only other downside is that the unit is not very wide.</li>
            <li> TRAY IS TERRIBLE!!!  nose clipper pulls hair and the body of the entire shaver is not contoured to properly shave your face.  I sent it back to Wahl.  I think i will stick with my Remington.</li>
            <li> Finally found a grooming kit with some muscle behind it.  Yes it&#x27;s a little loud but nothing thats crazy.  It feels like it could trim a tree(NOT recomended).  Some say the coating on the shaver collects hair because it&#x27;s a non-slip rubber coating but I have never had the problem.  Maybe I have special facial hair.  Lol.  Would recomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I could only use the trimmer and it does a great job. But, it is difficult to change the attachments and not convenient.</li>
            <li> the heads are a little diffcult to change other than that i am really enjoying using this wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> Best grooming kit I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  The attachments are very useful.  I&#x27;m always well groomed thanks to the Wahl 9855-300 Groomsman Pro All-in-one Rechargeable Grooming Kit.  Sturday and easy to use.  The tray attachment is somewhat useless for me; however, I did not buy this for the tray.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Wahl products.</li>
            <li> great item and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Being a Wahl, I expected more.  I actually like my previous trimmer better that I got for Christmas 6 years ago, and it was a cheaper brand.  What I don&#x27;t like about this one is that it doesn&#x27;t keep charge very long.  It also boggs down when using it, even when it&#x27;s plugged in.  It feels very cheap due all of the plastic.  I also don&#x27;t like the base that holds all the parts.  Maybe I was spoiled with my original trimmer. The trimmer heads are also not as user friendly as my last brand, which just twisted on and off. What I do like is that the length guards seem more durable than my last brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother for his bday. He says it great he can shave and trim and he likes that he can run it under the faucet. The only down side is it took forever to get here.</li>
            <li> Hate the stupid stand it comes in, but other than that, this is the perfect groomer for everyday or weekly upkeep.</li>
            <li> All attachments work great, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space and my husband loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an all-in-one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another product that I had for years but would no longer charge.  I was disappointed when it arrived to discover that the charger would not sufficiently plug into the unit.  This appeared to be a quality assurance issue.  My disappointed was abated a good deal when I discovered how easily II was able to return it for another one.  The new one arrived a few days later and I imagine the two crossed paths at UPS.  The new one does not have this issue.  This one helped me realize how dull my old one was so I&#x27;m glad I wasn&#x27;t just able to buy a new battery.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the stand for it makes no sense what so ever but I never intended to use it.  I find the attachments easy to change and I believe I will be quite pleased with this for years to come.</li>
            <li> surprisingly loud for such a small unit.  Especially when trying to trim the ears.  Cannot be used for that unless you are hard of hearing.  The interchangeable accessories attach quite easily and the guards make for easy trims.  Would have been able to do 5 stars but the noise level makes it an inefficient all in one.</li>
            <li> I bought this  Wahl kit on the recommendation from my hair stylist three years ago to go with WAHL.  First thing I noticed after about three months of using it, the battery charge would not last.  Your forced to keep in plugged in 24/7 if you want to make it through a trim. Oh, and when the battery does go dead you can&#x27;t plug this unit it and run it off the outlet.  You are forced to charge it first.  Second thing I noticed is the so called stainless steel blades are a joke.  Any moisture, even when using the supplied cutting oil causes the blades to rust.  After eight months of use the larger blade become useless, instead of cutting hair it was pulling it out.... Ouch, so much for the self sharpening blades claim. The third issue I found with this kit is changing out the blade attachments.  Not that easy if your in a hurry to do a quick clean up.  Also the adjustable attachment if your not careful will change on you mid-trim, woops looks like I have to shave down the goatee to make everything even again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I though about the warranty but they won&#x27;t cover the blades and you have to send them the unit on your dime.  Ten dollars shipping, for a $22.00 item, just not worth it.  Rather spend the money on a better quality unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for this late review was I decided to try and buy a replacement blade for this unit.  Guess what you can&#x27;t find them anywhere accept through Wahl.  If you buy both the large blade and small trimmer with tax and shipping you can buy a whole new kit at WalMart cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would have had better luck if I ponied up the additional money and bought a trimmer from there PRO Line.  Oh, well a lesson well learned.&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to post an update.  I emailed Wahl prior to there post on my complaint.  They had me send in the charger, main body and blades.  Two weeks later I got an upgraded retail package, which had the nose trimmer and shaver attachment included.  So far so good.  Its a little louder then the unit I sent in.  I will say one thing Wahl came through on the warranty.  My only suggestion to Wahl; create a retail package for your commercial units.  When I go in and get my haircut, my stylist likes to pull out his Wahl and give me a clean up trim.  His Wahl is almost silent and very well made.  As a consumer I would gladly pay for an item of this quality if it came with all the trimming accessories.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with WAHL quality head cutting products for consumer &amp; animal.  Until now personal grooming products were made cheaply, striving to be $10.00 or less.  I couldn&#x27;t find a quality nose &amp; ear hair trimmer -- until now.  This product exceeded all my expectations.  I liked the screened attachment for shaving so much that I replaced my Braun shaver with a WAHL shaver.  For me, the WAHL shaver shaves closer than the Braun, much less expensive -- as are the replacement screen &amp; blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for grooming kit that is not a toy -- this is it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had my money back! This trimmer works good as long as you don&#x27;t use the attachments that are included. You will need to&lt;br /&gt;take the trimmer apart to install the attachments. It is time consuming and confusing. It should not be that much trouble to go from&lt;br /&gt;trimming your beard to trimming your nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Great set, solid and easy to use. Pieces are easy to change out, and to clean. The stand is not great though, the pieces dont&#x27; really fit that well in it.</li>
            <li> The power adaptor cannot charge the clipper after a few months. Luckily, I happen to have a similar power adaptor. A disappointment from an established brand.</li>
            <li> Everything you need to take care of just about any kind of unwanted hair on your body.  The trimmers work really well and I suppose if I wanted to I could even use it as a hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest beef with this is the tray, it&#x27;s great to have everything in the tray, but several of the items just don&#x27;t fit correctly and therefore fall out on a regular basis.  It would also be really great if you could just plug the trimmer into the tray and have it charge, but instead (and my old norelco was the same way) you have to plug in a cord directly to the trimmer, which isn&#x27;t real bad, but it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Very Solid product, lots of power and holds a charge well.  Main unit, and attachments, are well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Will not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the cut and all of the features.  Just wish you didn&#x27;t have to unplug the cord and reset it in its grove every time you use it.  I thought it would be more like a docking type station but still happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This works great so far. The tray is tacky though, nothing you&#x27;d want to display. Also noteworthy, its only about 6\\&quot; tall, I thought it would be larger...</li>
            <li> have no problems so far works great. i don&#x27;t know who designed the tray to hold the attachments but some of them doesn&#x27;t fit right or don&#x27;t fit in the slot at all. if this is a deal breaker then don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Very poorly designed.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments will NOT stay in the tray.&lt;br /&gt;The charge cable does not fit the tray to plug into the groomer&lt;br /&gt;which makes the tray useless.&lt;br /&gt;Just okay as a trimmer. Not very much power or battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Replaced a cheaper one that I have had for 6 years and it worked better than this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  This is a good quality unit and has enough power to do what the needs.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold charge very well</li>
            <li> I have been a customer of Wahl products for many years. I cut my own hair and their hair clippers have done an excellent job. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have a great experience with this groomer. I love the idea, but the motor on the clipper was just terrible. Like some other reviewers have said, the motor would run on high and then all the sudden rev on low...so low that when I went to trim my beard, the hair would stop the motor completely. This happened even after a full charge. I would have to tap the trimmer in my hand to get the motor to get some more &#x27;kick&#x27; to it. Also didn&#x27;t like how it doesn&#x27;t have a charging light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 2 stars because I like the idea, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust this product. It has a 5 year warranty which I took advantage of. I received a brand-new replacement for the faulty one, but will be giving it away. I bought a Remington Model MB-4040 which gives a better cut and has a powerful (a little noisy) motor.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to swap out the different heads, but it works great.  It seems durable and made well.  I would buy it again</li>
            <li> You can tell as soon as you open the package that this trimmer is built very well. The power off the clipper is the best I have ever seen. All of the attachments are awesome but watch out for the nose clipper. The nose clipper tends to pull your hair if you have long nose hair. All of the rest are top notch very happy. What a great buy at 28.80 screaming deal.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a POS!!!  It is difficult to change the heads and does not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> The moter barely has the strength to trim a beard and the batteries drain much quicker than advertised and takealmost  24 hours to recgarge.</li>
            <li> great item to use in house and on the go. it is very portable and easy to use and does a great job</li>
            <li> This is a great groomer for daily trims. Son found it a bit uncomfortable on his several days old stubble, but we did not expect it to be used in that application so were not surprised.</li>
            <li> Second wahl I&#x27;ve purchase within six months does not keep a good charge even when plugged in constantly. This is the same issue I had with the one I bought in October of 2014.</li>
            <li> *UPDATE* this trimmer broke after 3 months of use. I think it is an ok travel trimmer or back up for infrequent use, but for daily use it did not hold up.    I purchased this as a gift. Nice size, includes various attachments for a variety of uses, has a nice stand to organize everything, and seems sturdy. Only 1 complaint...when the trimmer is plugged in, there is not a light to tell it is charging, charged, dead, etc.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing set, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Very well-built and works very well. Stan could have been designed much better. Two of the three cutting heads just don&#x27;t fit in right.</li>
            <li> worked great for what I used it for my mustache</li>
            <li> The blades are weak and cut inconsistently resulting in an uneven trim or buzz.  The only reliable attachment is the nosehair remover.  After around 9 months, the unit stopped working entirely.</li>
            <li> What a weird thing this is....I never know if I&#x27;m attaching the different blade thingies correctly...they kind of snap into the open end of the hand held unit, but they don&#x27;t quite go in right, but somehow connect????  The little comb and brush are weird, the base doesn&#x27;t really have indentations that fit/hold the blade attachments when not in use...they fall out of the base all the time.  It seems to me that maybe I got a unit that isn&#x27;t/wasn&#x27;t built to be a production model and they just put all of these non-fitting things together in a box and sent it off to me.  It certainly is a weird thing.....</li>
            <li> Bought this just before my marriage. Works well, rather powerful little sucker. The heads can be tricky to replace at times, but over all really like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many similar razors to this and agree that this model is powerful (and unlike some other reviewers I&#x27;ve found at least some of the attachments to be worthwhile) but I&#x27;ve found for whatever reason that using this one just as a razor gives a much more uneven cut than I expected, and tends to pull more than you I would expect given its size, etc.  Given the price, however, I can&#x27;t find too many complaints.</li>
            <li> Kind of cheap- all the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; little parts, comb etc are more for a toy doll.  Really can&#x27;t do much other then trim nose hair and in and around the ears-- but hey that&#x27;s why I bought it,  did not expect to give myself a haircut or anything.</li>
            <li> Should have paid more attention to the other reviews.  I have a really Li-Ion Wahl full size clipper that has performed flawlessly for a few years now.  Thought &#x27;hey, it&#x27;s a Wahl - how bad can it be?&#x27;  Bad.  The motor isn&#x27;t very powerful, and yes - I did oil the clipper head to see if helps - not much.  It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a week or so (use it only 1-2 minutes per week to keep sideburns/nose and ear hair under control).  Was looking to save some $ by not replacing my relatively-pricey Norelco Philips when it died after a few year, but I should have spent the extra.</li>
            <li> My old Wahl groomer finally died after many years of faithful service. This one is much better. It has more attachments, is rechargable, and is more accurate as well. And a steal at the price. Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and quality product as described.</li>
            <li> when you take the front to clean it is difficult to re-attach</li>
