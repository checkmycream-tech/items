            <li>received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I received this product for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>i purchased this item at a fraction of the cost in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>the fun colors are great for kids and teens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far, Great DETANGLING BRUSH !!!</li>
            <li>Nice and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>so I am so glad to have found this brush.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a free or discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review of this product.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;seriously magic.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this MyBesty-Detangler Detangling Brush from Longglory Gifts for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one.</li>
            <li>School mornings will also go so much more smoothly when it starts again.</li>
            <li>and I remember the pain and the tears I had as a kid when my mom would brush my hair, and even now my hair tangles so easily.</li>
            <li>The shape of the brush makes it easy to hold and the bristles do indeed work through the tangles without pulling out hair.  </li>
            <li>this will work perfect for me if they made the bristles a little softer.  </li>
            <li>But fortunately I was given the chance to review this and I, and my daughter are so thankful.</li>
            <li>it did not work Great on my daughters dry hair...</li>
            <li>this brush works really great for detangling but when using it, i felt that it was hard on the scalp, i have to make sure i hold it lightly against my head.  </li>
            <li>Overall satisfied!</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>A+ super fast.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, but the shape of it ends up making my wrist hurt.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>This brush is great for thick hair!</li>
            <li>We used it on both wet and dry hair to see if it works just as great on both  circumstances.</li>
            <li>it seems like it works better on wet hair.</li>
            <li>This brush really works well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>My daughter has really curly hair and this comb does the trick.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter has long hair that tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush to anyone considering purchasing it.</li>
            <li>She took it everywhere with her the rest of the day to show it off, like a new toy.</li>
            <li>The only brush my 5 year old, with long fine tangling hair, will use.</li>
            <li>great for detangling but a little hard on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at how well this brush works.  </li>
            <li>I brushed her very tangled hair today and she didn&#x27;t even wince, not once.</li>
            <li>She inherited my sensitive head</li>
            <li>it still hurts my 9yr and 4yr old.</li>
            <li>She has long hair that easily becomes a tangled mess and&lt;br /&gt;brushing</li>
            <li>Given that my daughter has swimming lessons and swim team this summer her hair is getting a lot more dry and tangled than usual</li>
            <li>I used it on my 4 year old daughter last night and it was</li>

            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at how well this brush works.  I have very thick hair. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... it did not work Great on my daughters dry hair... it seems like it works better on wet hair. She she still hurts. But just noticed it works best if you brush the hair from bottom to top. I start on the lower bottom</li>
            <li> This brush really works well. My granddaughter no longer screams when I brush her hair!  Good value.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush. Wish I had bought it years ago. Earlier this summer my daughter and I had a discussion about cutting her hair because she cries whenever I try to brush it and she has trouble brushing it herself. She ended up with a horrible mat this summer and I had to take her in to see my friend who is a hairdresser to get the mat out. I&#x27;ve considered getting a brush like this before but I&#x27;ve never heard great things about them and usually they have bad reviews. But fortunately I was given the chance to review this and I, and my daughter are so thankful. I brushed her very tangled hair today and she didn&#x27;t even wince, not once. She took it everywhere with her the rest of the day to show it off, like a new toy. She inherited my sensitive head and I remember the pain and the tears I had as a kid when my mom would brush my hair, and even now my hair tangles so easily. Given that my daughter has swimming lessons and swim team this summer her hair is getting a lot more dry and tangled than usual so I am so glad to have found this brush. School mornings will also go so much more smoothly when it starts again. I highly recommend this brush! I received this product at a free or discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review of this product. I was not compensated in any way. I will be adding photos when my camera&#x27;s battery charges again.</li>
            <li> it still hurts my 9yr and 4yr old. : ( the brush is nothing they advertise. delivery was  A+ super fast.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! my daughter doesn&#x27;t fight me to brush her hair anymore.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has long hair that tangles very easily.  I&#x27;ve spent hours, as has she in fighting with the tangles in her hair.  The MyBesty-Detangler Brush works excellent.  The shape of the brush makes it easy to hold and the bristles do indeed work through the tangles without pulling out hair.  This is a wonderful product and the fun colors are great for kids and teens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I have a detangling brush for my daughter and it works great. So when I was offered this MyBesty-Detangler Detangling Brush from Longglory Gifts for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one. I wanted to have a spare brush in case one of them disappeared or got lost. Well wouldn&#x27;t you know it, my daughter just happened to lose her hair brush and this one showed up literally the next day. We used it on both wet and dry hair to see if it works just as great on both  circumstances. Well I can honestly say, there were no tears from my cry baby!!! I definitely recommend this MyBesty-Detangler Detangling Brush from Longglory Gifts for you or your daughter.</li>

            <li> I love it! I used it on my 4 year old daughter last night and it was&lt;br /&gt;seriously magic. She has long hair that easily becomes a tangled mess and&lt;br /&gt;brushing it is seriously a nightmare always resulting in screaming and&lt;br /&gt;tears. Last night, she just let me brush and brush and then she made me sit&lt;br /&gt;down so she could brush my hair. Thanks so much! This is going to be our go to&lt;br /&gt;for years to come for sure! I received this product for my honest and unbiased review.</li>

            <li> This brush works great for me! I have long, thick hair, and usually have to use a lot of detangiler spray to make my hair manageable. This brush works by itself! I haven&#x27;t had to use any spray and it feels good on my scalp. I wish I had bought one a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but the shape of it ends up making my wrist hurt. I always seem to the loose it&#x27;s grip too, and so it&#x27;s not the  ideal brush.</li>

            <li> I recently started growing my hair long and one of my biggest issues was brushing out the multitude of knots in my hair.  I used to find myself in tears practically yanking my hair out trying to brush it through. Once I found this brush however those days, thankfully, are over! I am a little person as well and the fact that these brushes are on the smaller side helps me keep a firmer grip while combing.  I highly recommend this brush to anyone considering purchasing it.</li>
            <li> It works well. little pointed.</li>
            <li> great for detangling but a little hard on the scalp.  this brush works really great for detangling but when using it, i felt that it was hard on the scalp, i have to make sure i hold it lightly against my head.  as long as i am careful running it though my head, i noticed that my hair is really shiny and less frizzy.  this will work perfect for me if they made the bristles a little softer.  i purchased this item at a fraction of the cost in exchange for an honest review.</li>
