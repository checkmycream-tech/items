            <li> The hair is thin at the ends so make sure to use 4 bundles if you are getting a long length!</li>
            <li> It has very thick bundles, 3 is enough for a full sew in</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it had a slight stench upon receipt but other than that I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> very little shedding will be ordering again my new summer hair</li>
            <li> single cause</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package I could smell that it had been processed, and it was jet black, so obviously it had been colored ..</li>
            <li> If u are looking for big tight curls this is your hair...</li>
            <li> Other than that, if your looking for curly texture, i recommend this hair.</li>
            <li> i received my hair the next day and the bundldes are extremly thick..</li>
            <li> Few things though... just like the other reviews the hair does smell, like it&#x27;s been stored for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> I might lighten it, its a little to dark compared to the rest of my hair..</li>
            <li> the only thing wrong is not that long</li>
            <li> hair has s little smell about it</li>
            <li> also think the bundles can be a little ticker</li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t be fooled, a few of the reviews says this hair is kinky.</li>
            <li> but it really does have a bad scent .i</li>
            <li> The bundles were thick.  </li>
            <li> I was overall disappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell is bad, but after one wash it faded a little.</li>
            <li> but it was typical beauty supply hair :(</li>
            <li> Buy this hair a little fearful.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this hair, I read all the reviews and was very skeptical about the smell everyone spoke about.</li>
            <li> And it tangles and sheds :(</li>

            <li> Been ordering from this company for the past 2 years and their service is excellent! Never was dissatisfied, and came in very early in the mail. I love curly hair so that fact I can afford it and have it last a whole year is amazing and saves me tonnnns of money on synthetic wigs. One thing I will have to say is I do feel like this hair is processed so if you bleach it, do it with caution that it may effect the texture of the hair. Other wise, this human hair is my number fav and this company is #1 in my contact list in the future.</li>
            <li> Just received the hair. It&#x27;s gorgeous and has a soft texture. I got a pair of lashes with the hair as well. There&#x27;s a smell to it, but I am sure that once I wash it, it will be gone. Will post pictures once it&#x27;s installed. Anyone have any pictures of the hair installed?</li>
            <li> This hair is everything I expected it to be and more!!!! I am very pleased!!! My order arrived on time, the quality is EXCELLENT!!!! I have no complaints!!!! Just had it installed!!!  I am one satisfied customer!!!</li>
            <li> It started out good, but I died it and it kept tangling up had to have it removed after one week</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package I could smell that it had been processed, and it was jet black, so obviously it had been colored .. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be super high quality but it was typical beauty supply hair :( And it tangles and sheds :(</li>
            <li> Its good hair I just don&#x27;t like the puffy look so I give it a 3.</li>
            <li> The hair was just okay. The edges I did not like and it also tangled. I was overall disappointed. The highlight was that it arrived quick;y outer appearance is nice but high maintenance.</li>
            <li> My hair is supposed to be here at 8pm I&#x27;m hoping is what I expect after reading the lovely reviews !❤️</li>
            <li> The product looked nothing like the posting.  The hair felt like it was full of wax.  They also did not provide postage for return shipping never again.</li>
            <li> So I luv the hair..it reminds me more of a kinky curly however... If u are looking for big tight curls this is your hair...I will say.&lt;br /&gt;The hair has s little smell about it but once I washed it the smell was much better..</li>
            <li> Great hair! Curl pattern is nice especially when damp. It has very thick bundles, 3 is enough for a full sew in</li>
            <li> Before I bought this hair, I read all the reviews and was very skeptical about the smell everyone spoke about. So I took a chance and ordered the hair and I must say it was the best decision I made. Yes the hair had a smell but I could care less after feeling how soft and beautiful the hair was. I washed the hair and that took care of the smell. The hair is so beautiful. I installed it in and immediately fell inlove. There is not one day that goes by without someone telling me how much they love the hair. I&#x27;ve never gotten this many comments about my hair like I do. All I do is put mousse on the hair and I&#x27;m good to go. Plus the hair blends in with my hair after I braid my leave out. I am really glad I bought this hair and I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this hair! Get 3 bundles in the same length</li>
            <li> Great hair quality. Its been about a week since installed and it hasnt shes much which is a huge plus. The only negative is that it had a slight stench upon receipt but other than that I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> One month down still looking good</li>
            <li> Great hair not as long as it says it is</li>
            <li> Love the hair . Excellent quality I only wish they sold it single cause I needed one more bundle</li>
            <li> Love this hair I bleached it &amp; it still holds a curl pattern very little shedding will be ordering again my new summer hair</li>
            <li> Soft and full. The smell is bad, but after one wash it faded a little. The hair doesn&#x27;t shed or tangle. The curl pattern is amazing and it was still there after washing it.</li>
            <li> very nice hair i love the packaging very professional</li>
            <li> i purchased my hair on monday and chose next day shipping.. i received my hair the next day and the bundldes are extremly thick.. i have not even put the hair in yet and i love the texture and the thickness of the bundles, however i have a big head (lol) and i love big full hair so i ordered another 3 bundles to reach the look i am going for.. i will post pictures and another review as soon as i have it sewn in tomorrow!!! i cant wait!!! :))))))</li>
            <li> I received this hair just in time for me to use it , and it is fantastic! I will definately be doing business with you in the future ! Thank you</li>
            <li> i used it but it really does have a bad scent .i also think the bundles can be a little ticker</li>
            <li> Loved the hair ! It arrived quickly, had a scent to it but that&#x27;s normal when you buy unprocessed Virgin hair. I washed, bleached and dyed the hair and it came out lovely! Cannot wait to get it installed tomorrow!</li>
            <li> Great hair,last longer than most expensive weaves. I will definitely continue to purchase my hair from this company.</li>
            <li> The hair is very beautiful and soft. It didnt  shed when i ran my hands through it which was a plus. The bundles were thick.  I will definitely buy this hair again.</li>
            <li> Buy this hair a little fearful. but it took three weeks I have installed it and it seems natural to me spectacular. I washed and conditioned and is gorgeous. the only thing wrong is not that long</li>
            <li> Good Hair!! Make sure to wash and condition the hair before you install it! The hair is thin at the ends so make sure to use 4 bundles if you are getting a long length! Overall, this is good hair if you are looking for something quick, lightweight and easy!</li>
            <li> I really like the hair, it takes to color really well. but I just can&#x27;t seem to get rid of the smell. if it weren&#x27;t for the smel it would get 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Love the hair.  It&#x27;s super soft.  I get compliments every time I have it installed.  I&#x27;ve used it for a vixen and a full head sewn in.  Everyone asks me for the info so they can purchase it! Few things though... just like the other reviews the hair does smell, like it&#x27;s been stored for an extended period of time.  A good wash and air dry eliminates that.  Once you straighten it the original curl does return as defined.  Also don&#x27;t be fooled, a few of the reviews says this hair is kinky. ..IT IS NOT. If you have type 4 hair I wouldn&#x27;t order this unless you plan on going with a no leave out.  Otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love the hair. Its so soft. I might lighten it, its a little to dark compared to the rest of my hair.. The only problem is, i have no clue what to do with the hair I decided to leave out. Other than that, if your looking for curly texture, i recommend this hair.</li>
