            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Pretty Feet and Hands is an excellent, mild yet effective efoliant.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to friends and have enjoyed using it myself for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure the reason it worked 20 years ago</li>
            <li>because it included some magical toxic chemical</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re all the better because of</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Then wash your face again and you will be able to feel and see the difference.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
            <li>but i wasnt sure if it was my skin or the product flaking.</li>
            <li>I had more cleaning to do.</li>
            <li>I purchased 3 bottles of this version of the product more than a year ago.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>So glad you carry it.</li>
            <li>a strong hydroxy cream  </li>
            <li>but I strongly urge you to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I know the product works because I used it years ago and at first I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Excellent product to remove dead skin</li>
            <li>Still, a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>They state on the bottle that the air space is needed at top so it can be shaken to the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Was the original found to be toxic?</li>
            <li>1/3 full.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this product and it seemed as though for the most part a decent item.</li>
            <li>Had used this product for years(mostly in the summertime when feet become calloused and dry from wearing flip flops) and loved it.</li>
            <li>stuff was like a weak scrub at best, my feet still have callouses.  </li>
            <li>Your face will be cleaner and super smooth, ready for moisturizer and/or makeup.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>WHEN YOU PUT IT ON, RIGHT AWAY WHEN YOU START RUBBING IT ONTO YOUR FEET</li>
            <li>Did not help very much at all</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do a think but run and most definitely  </li>
            <li>I have a skin problem on my elbows, so I looked on line to find Pretty Feet and Hands.</li>
            <li>this makes my face smooth and soft, esp.</li>
            <li>first of all, all three walmarts in my area carry this product 5 dollars and some change.  </li>
            <li>i used it many times 7-8 years ago when it came in a blue bottle with a good-housekeeping seal-of-approval.  </li>
            <li>I have used Pretty Feet &amp; Hands since the &#x27;60s or &#x27;70s</li>
            <li>So I read the directions (should of done that first) and saw that it said to shake well before use.</li>
            <li>Make sure you put it on dry skin</li>
            <li>Nothing is better than this for removing dry and calloused skin.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I found the Pretty Feet &amp; Hands of years past (in the blue bottle) to be very effective.</li>
            <li>Obviously not the original formula.</li>
            <li>but this is more like runny mess.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only 30% as effective and 3 times more expensive than the old school product from the 1990&#x27;s - in my opinion.</li>
            <li>New package and possibly new formula does not work.</li>
            <li>This is a classic for maintaining soft feet.</li>
            <li>AND I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>Item was a gift for a friend that looked all over to find this product, so I surprised her.  </li>
            <li>not like the old product I use to get years ago, didn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li>Nothing like old formula.  </li>
            <li>I opened the bottle and saw that it was only half full, and noticed that it looked like sugary milk.</li>

            <li> not like the old product I use to get years ago, didn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> Nothing like old formula.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s sent in a plastic bottle that is marked 3 Fluid oz.</li>
            <li> not enough to make the softness last for a long enough time.</li>
            <li> I use AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy to breakdown the dead skin (especially, feet along with hands, knees, and elbows); then, while my skin is damp I exfoliate the dead skin with Pretty Feet &amp; Hands.</li>
            <li> which indicates how long the product has been around.</li>
            <li> removes dried skin and makes feet and hands soft.  </li>
            <li> I ordered again(this time only1 bottle) and the new product worked no better.</li>
            <li> Just wash your face, dry it, and rub some of this product all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;Dead</li>
            <li> using it for 40 yrs, even in humid climate, not 2 much hands feeb face ect.</li>
            <li> I looked on my bathroom floor and saw nothing but a big mess!</li>
            <li> but this is not the same product that was produced in years past.</li>
            <li> I use every other day and you no longer can tell that my elbow have a skin problem.</li>
            <li> and I refused to do the other foot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product has changed recently or what</li>
            <li> I feel like it only got a little of the dead skin off....</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago, but it seems different than years ago, to the negative.</li>
            <li> it still works just not as well and amount of product in bottle has gone down and the price up.  </li>
            <li> Received a half used bottle and had to throw it away.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to just give it a try with the mess and all</li>
            <li> Actually, the one I did seemed a little worse than the other one.</li>
            <li> It has gotten expensive over the years but you only need a little to use and will go a long way.</li>
            <li> The price does goes up some &amp; the consistency is a little thinner than it used to be</li>
            <li> YOU CAN FEEL THE DEAD SKIN RUBBING OFF.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t take any dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I remember about 20 years ago using this product and all this dead skin&lt;br /&gt;sloughed</li>
            <li> removing dead skin,  i use on face everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get the heavy callouses off my feet.</li>
            <li> It  will take off a lot of dead skin</li>
            <li> but if you have heavy  built up callouses it does nothing.</li>
            <li> , I rubbed it on my feet and it seemed like dead skin was coming off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find in stores here.</li>
            <li> not sure if it was  out dated</li>
            <li> slowly rub as it dries and flakes off, if it doesnt u used 2 much,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently, I told my wife, &amp;#34;it must have been a bad match&amp;#34; and threw 3 bottles into the trash.</li>
            <li> I have used this to exfoliate my face for approximate 25 years.  </li>
            <li> Why the change to a poor quality formula?</li>
            <li> Very thin liquid  </li>
            <li> It is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I thought it was very expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Even then, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pretty Feet and Hands is an excellent, mild yet effective efoliant.  I would recommend this product to friends and have enjoyed using it myself for many years.</li>
            <li> I have used this to exfoliate my face for approximate 25 years.  I love it.  Keep it away from your eyes, however.</li>
            <li> Make sure you put it on dry skin and you will have to work it in for a while before you start to see any results. Even then, I was disappointed.I was expecting the same product that you could find in the stores years ago but somewhere along the line they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT. WHEN YOU PUT IT ON, RIGHT AWAY WHEN YOU START RUBBING IT ONTO YOUR FEET YOU CAN FEEL THE DEAD SKIN RUBBING OFF. HASN&#x27;T CAUSED ANY ADVERSE REACTIONS AND I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> This is a total rip off. It&#x27;s sent in a plastic bottle that is marked 3 Fluid oz. The bottle is &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; 1/3 full. They state on the bottle that the air space is needed at top so it can be shaken to the right consistency. Maybe you&#x27;re getting an 1oz of product for $10. I won&#x27;t bother to return it. I know the product works because I used it years ago and at first I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Just don&#x27;t like being fooled.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. There is nothing in this product that would make skin roll off. Used as directed but this is not the same product that was produced in years past.</li>
            <li> It was alright...I feel like it only got a little of the dead skin off....not enough to make the softness last for a long enough time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product a while back and it was great for hands and feet but this is more like runny mess.  Didn&#x27;t do a think but run and most definitely  didn&#x27;t take any dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I remember about 20 years ago using this product and all this dead skin&lt;br /&gt;sloughed off my feet and left them looking and feeling AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was like a weak scrub at best, my feet still have callouses.  (gross but true)&lt;br /&gt;Now grant it, I&#x27;m sure the reason it worked 20 years ago&lt;br /&gt;was because it included some magical toxic chemical&lt;br /&gt;that literally ate the skin off your feet&lt;br /&gt;and probably caused all sorts of complications.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re all the better because of it&#x27;s omission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money,  mix some salt and coconut oil together&lt;br /&gt;and scrub away.</li>
            <li> Not received as of yet however I use this product and it works well anywhere on the body. I use it for my arms and face. It has gotten expensive over the years but you only need a little to use and will go a long way. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a classic for maintaining soft feet. It&#x27;s not easy to find in stores here. The price does goes up some &amp; the consistency is a little thinner than it used to be but it still works well.</li>
            <li> Item was a gift for a friend that looked all over to find this product, so I surprised her.  She&#x27;s tickled!  I&#x27;m delighted that she received this items so &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34;.  Job well done.</li>
            <li> using it for 40 yrs, even in humid climate, not 2 much hands feeb face ect. slowly rub as it dries and flakes off, if it doesnt u used 2 much,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then a strong hydroxy cream  i i  u get a il sting . removing dead skin,  i use on face everyday.</li>
            <li> I took and used this product when I was a teen. I have a skin problem on my elbows, so I looked on line to find Pretty Feet and Hands. I am so glad that I did. I use every other day and you no longer can tell that my elbow have a skin problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to remove dead skin</li>
            <li> this makes my face smooth and soft, esp. after that chemical peel last week... I needed this to help get rid of the peeling skin.  My coworkers just ordered it bc my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> first of all, all three walmarts in my area carry this product 5 dollars and some change.  also, i have to agree with others when they say that this product has changed.  i used it many times 7-8 years ago when it came in a blue bottle with a good-housekeeping seal-of-approval.  it still works just not as well and amount of product in bottle has gone down and the price up.  yeh, go figure.</li>
            <li> Great ...been looking for this for quite awhile. Glad I found it</li>
            <li> not like the old product I use to get years ago, didn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> Very thin liquid  not sure if it was  out dated or it is just the way it comes  Did not help very much at all</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I not only use it on my hands and feet, but I also use it on my face!  Just wash your face, dry it, and rub some of this product all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;Dead skin will just rub off.  It is amazing.  Then wash your face again and you will be able to feel and see the difference.  Your face will be cleaner and super smooth, ready for moisturizer and/or makeup.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter who loves this product.  You will not be disappointed.  I will probably be ordering this again</li>
            <li> I bought this to get the heavy callouses off my feet. It  will take off a lot of dead skin but if you have heavy  built up callouses it does nothing. Salt or sugar and olive oil will accomplish the same thing and moisturize at the same time. I thought it was very expensive for what it is. I won&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
            <li> Nothing like old formula.  It&#x27;s only 30% as effective and 3 times more expensive than the old school product from the 1990&#x27;s - in my opinion. Would not recommend, you can get similar performing lotions from any walmart or drug store.</li>
            <li> it does not work like it use to</li>
            <li> Still, a fantastic product. I have used Pretty Feet &amp; Hands since the &#x27;60s or &#x27;70s (NOTE: This ages me. ..Who cares?) which indicates how long the product has been around. As well, it truly foes what it is advertise to do. I use AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy to breakdown the dead skin (especially, feet along with hands, knees, and elbows); then, while my skin is damp I exfoliate the dead skin with Pretty Feet &amp; Hands.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and it seemed as though for the most part a decent item. I dont have callouses or anything just some rought skin from not taking care it my feet during the winter. I opened the bottle and saw that it was only half full, and noticed that it looked like sugary milk. So I read the directions (should of done that first) and saw that it said to shake well before use. I shook and shook and shook and finally was convinced that it had thickened up. Nope, I turned it to pour some in my hand and it was like melted ice cream; it was running everywhere! So I decided to just give it a try with the mess and all, I rubbed it on my feet and it seemed like dead skin was coming off but i wasnt sure if it was my skin or the product flaking. It took FOREVER to finish getting this stuff off and I refused to do the other foot. But it still wasnt over. I looked on my bathroom floor and saw nothing but a big mess! Ice cream and flakes everywhere! I had more cleaning to do. The next day I decided to compare my feet to one another since I only did one- no difference. Actually, the one I did seemed a little worse than the other one. I&#x27;m not sure if this product has changed recently or what but I strongly urge you to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Never got a chance to use it.  Received a half used bottle and had to throw it away.  Will never order again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but not seen it in the stores.  The lotion makes my feet feel like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> removes dried skin and makes feet and hands soft.  been using this for years. Nothing is better than this for removing dry and calloused skin.</li>
            <li> thank god for this product.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Had used this product for years(mostly in the summertime when feet become calloused and dry from wearing flip flops) and loved it. It worked then - it no longer works as promised. I&#x27;ve tried it on 3 different occasions unsuccessfully. New package and possibly new formula does not work. I would not buy again nor would I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Obviously not the original formula. I found the Pretty Feet &amp; Hands of years past (in the blue bottle) to be very effective. I purchased 3 bottles of this version of the product more than a year ago. It did not seem to work. Recently, I told my wife, &amp;#34;it must have been a bad match&amp;#34; and threw 3 bottles into the trash. I ordered again(this time only1 bottle) and the new product worked no better. Why the change to a poor quality formula? Was the original found to be toxic? It is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love it.  So glad you carry it.</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago, but it seems different than years ago, to the negative.</li>
    </ol>
