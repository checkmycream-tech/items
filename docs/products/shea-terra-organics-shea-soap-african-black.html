            <li>I was impressed :)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any good results by now, but we will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>It is rather abrasive, so create a good lather in your hands and then apply to your face.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this company and their products.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is way more drying that the bar</li>
            <li>its ok wouldnt purchase again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on of the best african soap</li>
            <li>However, I love the way that it works.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the sink before or after my shower and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has been getting clearer and more even.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>made my skin tone even and has given me a beautiful, soft and glowing complexion.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT I&#x27;M VERY SENSITIVE TO ANY THING ON HAIR AND SKIN</li>
            <li>This product has worked great for me so far.  </li>
            <li>Maybe later I will se good results!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, fair skin.  </li>
            <li>so I only leave it on for about 1 minute, but it still works great.</li>
            <li>This step is important.  </li>
            <li>It was kind of a nice ceremonious thing back when I just had my toddler, but now I can&#x27;t be bothered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was kind of a nice ceremonious thing back when I just had my toddler, but now I can&#x27;t be bothered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin cleared up, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it had nothing to do with this product, it was hormonal acne</li>
            <li>My skin cleared up, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it had nothing to do with this product, it was hormonal acne</li>
            <li>and my skin is super healthy right now.</li>
            <li>I used it as directed and my skin looks clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it would be better for older skin?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 03.15.2013: I&#x27;m pretty ready to call this stuff magic.</li>
            <li>My husband has started to use this too, his back was broke out more in the summer months from sweat, but I can tell a huge difference with him using it.</li>
            <li>My first impression rating of 3 stars was pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li>My first impression rating of 3 stars was pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li>I now only use this this, Rose Water and 45spf sunscreen with moisture</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fun for him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been asked several times what kind of foundation I use because it \\&quot;hides [my] pores</li>
            <li>It does leave a major film on my face which is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this stuff (like BP and AHA) makes your skin extra sensitive to sunlight, but to be sure always slap on your favorite non-clogging SPF</li>
            <li>Our results to pass on...throw it in the trash as fast as you can!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s slowly doing a great job.</li>
            <li>Within the first couple of weeks it&#x27;s pulled blackheads out, shrunk my pores, and stopped full zits completely.</li>
            <li>My mom is very picky about what she uses on her face, so when she told me how much she liked the Shea Terra Authentic African Black Soap, I was so relieved.  </li>
            <li>I notice that if I use it too many days in a row my skin will become porous and dry.</li>
            <li>I CAN&#x27;T USE ANY HAIR SPRAY, CONDITIONERS ,ARGAN OIL, CERTAIN SHAMPOOS  </li>
            <li>I generally make a lather, smooth it around, lightly working it into my problem areas and then rinse after ten seconds.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used AHA products before you can expect a similar experience, it seems to dissolve the top layer of dead tissue, leaving very smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks DC</li>
            <li>and makes my face extra smooth.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li>AND THIS REALLY DID WORK  </li>
            <li>This has really helped my problem skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it...smells just like homemade soap.</li>
            <li>This way it doesn&#x27;t get used up too fast and each piece lasts about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and leave it on for longer now, my face doesn&#x27;t burn when I leave a mask on for a whole sixty seconds now.</li>
            <li>This soap really stops My Acne and The oil</li>
            <li>I rinsed and my hand was still covered in eye shadow and felt really filmy from the soap.  </li>
            <li>I really just don&#x27;t have time for leaving it on for 5 minutes and washing again.  </li>
            <li>I really just don&#x27;t have time for leaving it on for 5 minutes and washing again.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this stuff last year, because I&#x27;d read so many reviews about how it helped clear skin.</li>
            <li>I cut the bar in half and then in about 1/4&amp;#34; pieces (it was very easy to cut).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for more natural alternatives to help my onset of adult acne, so I purchased this along with another brand that&#x27;s of a more raw composition.</li>
            <li>A better use for this soap would be for your feet, you could probably exfoliate the toughest callouses with this sharp brick of soap.</li>
            <li>I have black soap with ash, but this is more uniform large grit that really can&#x27;t be used directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>I love the black soap bar soap.</li>
            <li>I keep going on little shopping sprees on their website and this is one of my favorite items.</li>
            <li>The first lather barely budged the eye shadow (something to be said for the eye shadow there!)  </li>
            <li>I immediately stopped using it and after a while my skin returned to &#x27;normal.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I use this and the liquid Rose Hips and African Black Soap</li>
            <li>I am a new user, but I can tell the difference already.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little harsh, yes, but very effective.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel overly drying and my skin feels very soft after using.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this soap, seriously.</li>
            <li>At first my acne kind of ebbed, but after a couple of weeks there was this onset of acne that was worse than anything I had ever encountered in my life!</li>
            <li>I will only use Shea Terra products because I trust that everything is pure.  </li>
            <li>nothing worked to clear them up.</li>
            <li>Since I started using, it has helped to clear the acne as well as the blemishes associated with it.  </li>
            <li>and this product has completely cleared up my skin, reduced the size of my pores,</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>This soap deep cleans very well</li>
            <li>and I use it on my head nearly every day.</li>
            <li>I can rub the bar directly on my head without any discomfort.</li>
            <li>I use it with my mia sonic brush and put argon oil on after a natural astrigent.  </li>
            <li>Beware if you have sensitive skin, like me.</li>
            <li>Even using it as gently as I can possibly manage, I feel like I&#x27;m peeling my skin off.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting that, but pleasantly surprised given my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I used the raw bar that I ordered shortly after and that seems to work better for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now 6 months pregnant, so it could just be the hormones, but I will continue to use the black soap and see how things develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really need to use a heavy duty moisturizer with this, it is very drying.  </li>
            <li>When I started out using this product, I was in the midst of an acne breakout (recent history of adult acne).  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t really notice anything happening in the way of microdermabrasion either.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this at night time to wash my face and my acne has slowed down and dried significantly.</li>
            <li>This was not what I expected, it dries out my skin and doesn&#x27;t clear up my complexion.</li>

            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> I use this at night time to wash my face and my acne has slowed down and dried significantly.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected, it dries out my skin and doesn&#x27;t clear up my complexion.</li>
            <li> I can only use this product once or twice a week, but it helps clear all the mess out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I cut the first bar that I got in half and gave half to my friend and she LOVES it.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this soap, I washed with another soap, used eye moisturizer, face moisturizer 2 other products and alternating products.  </li>
            <li> But when I use it every other day or every second day it exfoliates my face the way even my apricot wash with exfoliating beads doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> You might not want to use it to shave your legs with in winter if your skin is really really dry.</li>
            <li> so when you set it back down it&#x27;s going to leave a mark in your shower/</li>
            <li> I purchased the African Black bar soap and it works.</li>
            <li> The African Black Soap and Rosewater with Glycerin work well together.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps with the small acne breakouts that I occasionally get.</li>
            <li> Because, she has very dry skin</li>
            <li> Just lightly using it to scrub my legs produced long, painful scratches that took a week to finally disappear.</li>
            <li> (you really need to be careful not to get it even near your eyes at this point because it stings like crazy) then rinse and wash again, scrubbing with the palms of your hands and rinsing immediately.  </li>
            <li> I also use their raw african black soap and their Deep Pore liquid black soap.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my SO&#x27;s psoriasis since Black Soap is supposed to be good for skin problems, unfortunately it is so packed with sharp debris that we are unable to use it at all.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff! I can&#x27;t say enough good about this soap, seriously. You might not want to use it to shave your legs with in winter if your skin is really really dry. That&#x27;s the only negative thing I can think of. I have melasma on my face from birth control pills this stuff helps a ton! I use it and a hydroquinone cream (off the shelf Walmart). I did stop taking the pill, but it remained on my face...this soap helps to fade it. I use this too for acne. My back breaks out, not a lot but just 2 maybe here &amp; there...not anymore. My husband has started to use this too, his back was broke out more in the summer months from sweat, but I can tell a huge difference with him using it. And it got rid of those bumps on the back of your arms between your elbow &amp; shoulder. Mine weren&#x27;t noticeable but I could feel them to the touch.</li>
            <li> I will only use Shea Terra products because I trust that everything is pure.  I use this soap as directed leaving it on for 5 minutes - then I use my Clarisonic all over my face before washing it off.  I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this product has completely cleared up my skin, reduced the size of my pores, made my skin tone even and has given me a beautiful, soft and glowing complexion.  I also use their raw african black soap and their Deep Pore liquid black soap.  I love all of their products and they are truly miracle workers!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this company and their products. I keep going on little shopping sprees on their website and this is one of my favorite items. I cut the first bar that I got in half and gave half to my friend and she LOVES it. I use this and the liquid Rose Hips and African Black Soap and my skin is super healthy right now. Sign up for their newsletter and they send out a coupon once or twice a month for 20-30% off.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all of the glowing reviews for my son age 14 and daughter age 18.  We&#x27;ve been battling acne for years, especially with my son, and have tried everything from organics to LED to benzoyl peroxide, to the oil method...nothing worked to clear them up. So I was anxious to try this &#x27;miracle soap&#x27;. Our results to pass on...throw it in the trash as fast as you can! It ruined their skin! We have gone from some breakout areas to horrendous all-over...and we are way past the &#x27;purge&#x27; period because I was determined to stick it out. I kept expecting to see improvement any day...never happened and now we are stuck with how to counteract the extreme damage.</li>
            <li> I purchased the African Black bar soap and it works. I have bad sores on my face and it is clearing it up Got it at Amazon  Thanks DC</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and she loves it!!!  My mom is very picky about what she uses on her face, so when she told me how much she liked the Shea Terra Authentic African Black Soap, I was so relieved.  Because, she has very dry skin I also gave her&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Heritage Rosewater &amp; Glycerin&amp;#34; as a toner.  The African Black Soap and Rosewater with Glycerin work well together.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed and my skin looks clean and refreshed. I didnt expect the results.  Prior to using this soap, I washed with another soap, used eye moisturizer, face moisturizer 2 other products and alternating products.  I now only use this this, Rose Water and 45spf sunscreen with moisture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three months now.  I have very sensitive, fair skin.  I notice that if I use it too many days in a row my skin will become porous and dry. But when I use it every other day or every second day it exfoliates my face the way even my apricot wash with exfoliating beads doesn&#x27;t and makes my face extra smooth.  Warning - this bar of soap requires a coaster.  When you make the lather it&#x27;s brownish black so when you set it back down it&#x27;s going to leave a mark in your shower/sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses this soap all over.  He says it looks like he&#x27;s washing with tar or mud and that&#x27;s fun for him. He doesn&#x27;t report any change to his skin, but I guess boys don&#x27;t notice those details.  He&#x27;s not complaining so it must not be drying his skin out like it does mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been sharing this bar for about three months and I would say we&#x27;ve only used about 1/16th of it, so that&#x27;s favorable.</li>
            <li> I use this at night time to wash my face and my acne has slowed down and dried significantly.</li>
            <li> Dried out my face a bit but I like it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap.  Makes my face feel so clean and fresh.  Definitely helps with the small acne breakouts that I occasionally get. Would definitely highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> THIS IS STILL THE BEST FACE, HAIR WASH I HAVE EVER USED IN YEARS LIKE I SAID BEFORE I HAD ISSUES  WITH MY SKIN WENT TO GET MEDICAL HELP TRIED ALL KINDS OF PRODUCT  AND NOTHING SEEMED TO WORK  BUT THIS DID I HAVE NO MORE ISSUES AND IF I GET ANY SORES ON MY HAIR THIS EVEN WORKS, GREAT PRODUCT I&#x27;M VERY SENSITIVE TO ANY THING ON HAIR AND SKIN I CAN&#x27;T USE ANY HAIR SPRAY, CONDITIONERS ,ARGAN OIL, CERTAIN SHAMPOOS  JUST ABOUT ANYTHING AND THIS REALLY DID WORK  THANK YOU SHEA TERRA FOR A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I could immediately feel it getting rid of the impurities in my skin! Amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for more natural alternatives to help my onset of adult acne, so I purchased this along with another brand that&#x27;s of a more raw composition. At first my acne kind of ebbed, but after a couple of weeks there was this onset of acne that was worse than anything I had ever encountered in my life! I immediately stopped using it and after a while my skin returned to &#x27;normal.&#x27; I used the raw bar that I ordered shortly after and that seems to work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is way more drying that the bar I now use, and I still don&#x27;t understand why my acne got worse with Shea Terra&#x27;s bar.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my problem skin. My skin is sensitive so I only leave it on for about 1 minute, but it still works great.</li>
            <li> I lather and use with my clarisonic.  It has helped my complexion with texture and breakouts on my chin.  It doesn&#x27;t feel overly drying and my skin feels very soft after using.</li>
            <li> I have black soap with ash, but this is more uniform large grit that really can&#x27;t be used directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great for me so far.  I am a new user, but I can tell the difference already.  I feel cleaner and it&#x27;s all organic!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any good results by now, but we will continue to use it.  Maybe later I will se good results!</li>
            <li> used it on my body instead. its ok wouldnt purchase again but like that i tried it for myself.. didnt notice any marks disappearing prob needed to use it longer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on of the best african soap</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended to me and I used it as soon as it came for it&#x27;s skin benefits and would purchase it again!</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected, it dries out my skin and doesn&#x27;t clear up my complexion. Maybe it would be better for older skin?</li>
            <li> This soap deep cleans very well and I use it on my head nearly every day. I use it on my face maybe twice per week so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin. It is rather abrasive, so create a good lather in your hands and then apply to your face. I can rub the bar directly on my head without any discomfort. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it...smells just like homemade soap. I cut the bar in half and then in about 1/4&amp;#34; pieces (it was very easy to cut). This way it doesn&#x27;t get used up too fast and each piece lasts about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff has saved my skin! I used to have really bad chin acne when I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve been fighting break outs in my twenties too. I just bought this stuff last year, because I&#x27;d read so many reviews about how it helped clear skin. I gotta say, it&#x27;s make the break outs non existing! My skin has never been clearer!</li>
            <li> The soap is very messy, so I don&#x27;t recommend for use in the shower (makes it dirty).  However, I love the way that it works.  I use it in the sink before or after my shower and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has been getting clearer and more even.  When I started out using this product, I was in the midst of an acne breakout (recent history of adult acne).  Since I started using, it has helped to clear the acne as well as the blemishes associated with it.  I would recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know a microdermabrasion could be in a bar of soap. This is amazing stuff. I even got my fianc&amp;eacute; to use it!!</li>
            <li> I can only use this product once or twice a week, but it helps clear all the mess out of my skin.  I use it with my mia sonic brush and put argon oil on after a natural astrigent.  I have not had a pimple in 10 years.</li>
            <li> I love the black soap bar soap. Makes my skin feel really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month or so since I started using this stuff. I&#x27;ve had hormonal acne off and on for years, tried BP, the oil cleansing method, dietary changes, everything. I can&#x27;t believe I never found out about this stuff before now. It&#x27;s a little harsh, yes, but very effective. Beware if you have sensitive skin, like me. DO NOT follow the instructions; the box says to leave the lather on like a mask for a few minutes. My skin stings if I leave it on for even 60 seconds. I generally make a lather, smooth it around, lightly working it into my problem areas and then rinse after ten seconds. If you&#x27;ve used AHA products before you can expect a similar experience, it seems to dissolve the top layer of dead tissue, leaving very smooth skin. Within the first couple of weeks it&#x27;s pulled blackheads out, shrunk my pores, and stopped full zits completely. It&#x27;s not magic. But it&#x27;s slowly doing a great job. I don&#x27;t know if this stuff (like BP and AHA) makes your skin extra sensitive to sunlight, but to be sure always slap on your favorite non-clogging SPF moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 03.15.2013: I&#x27;m pretty ready to call this stuff magic. I&#x27;ve been asked several times what kind of foundation I use because it \\&quot;hides [my] pores so well!\\&quot; I use it every day and leave it on for longer now, my face doesn&#x27;t burn when I leave a mask on for a whole sixty seconds now.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my SO&#x27;s psoriasis since Black Soap is supposed to be good for skin problems, unfortunately it is so packed with sharp debris that we are unable to use it at all. Just lightly using it to scrub my legs produced long, painful scratches that took a week to finally disappear. Even using it as gently as I can possibly manage, I feel like I&#x27;m peeling my skin off. A better use for this soap would be for your feet, you could probably exfoliate the toughest callouses with this sharp brick of soap.</li>
            <li> This soap really stops My Acne and The oil</li>
            <li> 2/6/2013:  I have sensitive, acne prone, dry skin.  I am currently pregnant and having terrible breakouts.  I have to stay away from things like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, etc. so I thought I would give this a try.  I don&#x27;t feel any sort of tingling, my face isn&#x27;t red after using this, I have no reaction to it, even leaving it on for 5 min.  I was not expecting that, but pleasantly surprised given my sensitive skin.  On the other hand, I don&#x27;t really notice anything happening in the way of microdermabrasion either.  It does leave a major film on my face which is not my favorite.  I really need to use a heavy duty moisturizer with this, it is very drying.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements in my skin, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks.  I use it every other day.  I&#x27;ll check back in a couple of months with an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;3/19/2013:  I have been using this soap at night on days when I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so about 3-4 times a week.  I follow the instructions and lather up, leave it on for 5 min (you really need to be careful not to get it even near your eyes at this point because it stings like crazy) then rinse and wash again, scrubbing with the palms of your hands and rinsing immediately.  The second rinse helps get rid of some of the filmyness.  This step is important.  In fact I had been testing cream eye shadows on the back of my hand and decided to use this soap to try to wash it off.  The first lather barely budged the eye shadow (something to be said for the eye shadow there!)  I rinsed and my hand was still covered in eye shadow and felt really filmy from the soap.  I washed again and rinsed immediately and everything came off- everything!  I was impressed :)  I have been using this for almost 2 months now and just in the last week or so my face seems to be clearing up.  I am now 6 months pregnant, so it could just be the hormones, but I will continue to use the black soap and see how things develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;8/11/13:  I decided to ditch this soap.  I don&#x27;t really have anything bad to say about it, but nothing great either.  My first impression rating of 3 stars was pretty accurate.  My skin cleared up, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it had nothing to do with this product, it was hormonal acne :/  Now that I have a newborn I really just don&#x27;t have time for leaving it on for 5 minutes and washing again.  It was kind of a nice ceremonious thing back when I just had my toddler, but now I can&#x27;t be bothered.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  it doesn&#x27;t work for me, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product.E&lt;br /&gt;8/11/13:  I decided to ditch this soap.
