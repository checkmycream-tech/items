    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But I am very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The directions are not the best.  </li>
            <li>The strips remove hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Seriously so great!!!</li>
            <li>These are the best wax strips I have used to date.</li>
            <li>and I thought those were awesome.</li>
            <li>These wax straps work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!!</li>
            <li>They are perfect and work well and are very easy to do!</li>
            <li>Great wax strips, used for the legs, not mine but the women in the family seem to like it a lot.</li>
            <li>These wax strips are great.</li>
            <li>The post-wax oil wipes are very effective at cleaning the wax residue off, and also moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li>It successfully took away skin but not hair</li>
            <li>Easy to use, really wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Had a rash under armpit for 5 days, did not feel good glade</li>
            <li>This product came in good speed by the seller.</li>
            <li>good as I thoughtbut</li>
            <li>The after wax wipes are good too for getting the wax</li>
            <li>it works good.  </li>
            <li>Once I did that, the strips work like magic for me!</li>
            <li>Afterwards, do treat the skin area gently with aloe or what works best when your skin is a bit inflamed.  </li>
            <li>All you do is cut the strip to the size you need, rub your hands together with the strip in between and two warm wax strips you get.</li>
            <li>Handy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li>These are the best because they do a very good job, don&#x27;t take any time to prepare, and don&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li>Also the cleanup is very easy.</li>
            <li>I have used wax strips made from Sally Hansen, Veet, and Nad&#x27;s, and these Nad&#x27;s strips are by FAR the best of the three.  </li>
            <li>These are the best wax strips I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>By far the best self waxing kit EVER!!</li>
            <li>I have a good amount of hair to wax there, but the hairs are thinner, more fine than the hair on my lower legs.</li>
            <li>even better when this was included as one of the prime products</li>
            <li>I thought I would try one leg waxing and one leg using Sally Hansen hair remover to see which one worked better.</li>
            <li>In my chest, I broke out with many pimples that I panicked I was going to have scars.</li>
            <li>Works OK for face but not legs</li>
            <li>it came out most stayed.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Nair wax, my favorite brand).</li>
            <li>I have tried so many...</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Not great..but not completely awful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>And make sure to read the manual.  </li>
            <li>I have very easy pull out hair, fine.</li>
            <li>But on the bright side I found a new product I love!</li>
            <li>These are pretty good wax strips.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin, and great clean up wipes included.</li>
            <li>Very clean results and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to work with compared to the Nads you paint on with a applicator.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>It not only takes the hairs off, and happily leave your skin intact.</li>
            <li>so easy clean up in the shower.</li>
            <li>As far as home waxing strips go, these are really good.</li>
            <li>Remove the strips with a quick strong pull.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hurt as much as the Sally Hansen ones, and pull out more hair if used correctly (put on and rub with the way the hairs grow, pull skin taut and pull off the strip quickly against the way the hair grows).</li>
            <li>I like waxing over shaving because the hair does not grow as quick but its a timely process.</li>
            <li>These strips do an adequate job of removing body hair - if you use the correct technique.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin but does a great job at the same time.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly</li>
            <li>is SO MUCH CHEAPER than salon waxing (probably even cheaper than buying the wax pot), much quicker, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>None were this economical.  </li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s not painless, but I thought totally worth it to not shave every day.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these waxing strips as the price was pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These strips also have a pleasant scent and are less prone to leaving wax residue (which was a problem with Sally Hansen and Veet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And yes you can successfully reuse a strip a few times by folding it together (wax side facing) and warming it with your hands.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of getting the heavier dark hairs.  </li>
            <li>I love these because they are easy to cut into four smaller strips (the normal size of the Veet ones)</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of dry, flaky skin, it will not work as effectively.</li>
            <li>Make sure the area is clean and VERY dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several brands of wax strips and these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I followed directions exactly as box directed.</li>
            <li>I used this product when it first came out.</li>
            <li>to have better luck next time.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever removed ALL of the hair from an area was with these strips.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too hurt when first time try it.</li>
            <li>The oil pads were more than enough to remove any residues.</li>
            <li>and I followed directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would add to it is more post-wax soothing oil.</li>
            <li>They can also be cut easily with scissors in case you prefer smaller strips.  </li>
            <li>, it heats up in your skin and you can spread it out  over a large area like your legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been buying this at my local grocery store, was super ecstatic when found this at amazon at a cheaper price!</li>
            <li>These work and like all Nad&#x27;s products I&#x27;ve tried, clean up is easy with a little soap and water.  </li>
            <li>The Kava wipes before hand really do help cut the sting.</li>
            <li>The strips do not leave much of a residue anyway.</li>
            <li>They come with pre and post wax wipes, and both are really soothing.</li>
            <li>What is that really?</li>
            <li>so I really get 80 strips in a pack.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt too much and it lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li>Have to use the whole box to get results, I&#x27;ll stick with razors.</li>
            <li>It is helpful if your skin is free of oils or lotions prior to using this product.</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad, but i wish it took out more hair in one rip because it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>Simple, clean and a lot cheaper than the aesthetician.</li>
            <li>First - I have had my legs waxed professionally for years, so there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>But the main reason I really like these is because they are soft.</li>
            <li>Still painful, but these are the best wax strips we&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that is a downer is that the hair has to be pretty long fit them to work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave and normally use tweezers.</li>
            <li>It looks like I found new ones.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive like I do.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and did exactly as it said and after just using one strip it made the skin red, sore, and even bruised me.</li>
            <li>If your hair it super course or if you aren&#x27;t use to waxing, you might have to do what I did and go to a professional the first few times for your skin to get used to waxing.</li>
            <li>I have very fine textured and none to very little amount of body hair in the normal areas you would wax such as bikini line and under arms.</li>
            <li>If you are doing more than a half leg, I would go professional, or any other body parts also professional the first time.</li>
            <li>I cut each large piece in strips and use it for unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional waxing services and also tried a variety of hair removal products.  </li>
            <li>Works well and results last much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>Does not work completely.</li>
            <li>Sometimes these are available on the subscribe and save option, which will save you a few cents.</li>
            <li>Also, this popped up as a potential add on to get free shippiing of my other product.  </li>
            <li>Removes two single hairs only if your lucky and Burns your skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>With the same dollar amount, one can purchase a whole microwavable wax tun and strip kit, which can be used to wax twice the amount possible with Nad&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Tried on armpits and it barely took any hair off.</li>
            <li>They are so simple to use and leaves no mess at all.</li>
            <li>Very fast way to wax without mess.  </li>
            <li>These will not remove stubble, and on occasion they will leave a wax residue behind which is easily removable with the included towelettes.</li>
            <li>It is true that you put it on and a small amount goes a long wait</li>

            <li> These will not remove stubble, and on occasion they will leave a wax residue behind which is easily removable with the included towelettes.</li>
            <li> It is true that you put it on and a small amount goes a long wait</li>
            <li> Hair was long enough that you can see I needed waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> if you understand that you don&#x27;t want to keep it on you skin for long enough for it to get warm/soft, and have the guts to pull it hard and fast in the opposite direction of the hair growth  </li>
            <li> Not only were there few hairs on the strip, but it left a lot of wax residue in my ear.  </li>
            <li> I got about 2-3 uses out of every strip, and it took 8 single strips out of 20 to do both of my thighs (from my bikini line to my knees).This</li>
            <li> This was a mess left and didnt even work at all.</li>
            <li> While I do still occasionally have remaining hair after waxing with Nad&#x27;s strips, this is far less common than with Sally Hansen or Veet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And wow.. it hardly removes any hair.</li>
            <li> I read so many bad reviews for veets body wax strips and Sally Hansen&#x27;s stuff, so I decided to buy this from Target just to try out.</li>
            <li> The paper allows you to use the same strip a few times, unlike the plastic strips.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste.</li>
            <li> Pull opposite of hair growth while firmly pressing against skin.</li>
            <li> It is less messy than traditional heated wax products(microwavable</li>

            <li> I was skeptical when I opened up the package, but they really work!</li>
            <li> Sadly it is getting harder to find reasonable price Nair products.</li>
            <li> these is minimal mess.</li>
            <li> It seemed like wax grabbed enough hair when I was rubbing the strip while it was stuck on my skin, yet it hardly removed any hair.</li>
            <li> When I was trying to use it, it was really difficult because EVERYTHING got really sticky.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these for anyone who is tired of shaving or is dissatisfied with other hair removal methods.</li>
            <li> I now have a few little scars where it had ripped my skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Took out some hair but left a lot behind.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sally Hansen wax strips for the past few years</li>
            <li> These strips were bigger than I expected, so they were awkward to use in the underarm and bikini areas.</li>
            <li> The post-wax strips got it right off, but it was still annoying.</li>
            <li> it was hard to get of the existing wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a hard time warming the strip, I follow the directions, but did not remove all the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is often hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard on the skin and reddens it a bit</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hardly any pain and sticky wax, but remember, with any product, you have to know how to use it.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions correctly, but the results were a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of home waxing products, pre waxed strips, kits and the thick waxes you pull off without any strips.</li>
            <li> I have tried other wax options, and I think because maybe I may be sensitive to beeswax, I got a horrible reaction.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer noted, it also leaves behind a waxy residue which is hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I wound up cutting them in half and that helped.</li>
            <li> did not work for me used under arm pit hairs remained and it burned my skin badly not happy at all</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad for three days as we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> (PAINFUL) .&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wax strips are painful, and did not work.</li>
            <li> It did remove some and wasn&#x27;t terribly painful, so I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been buying this at my local grocery store, was super ecstatic when found this at amazon at a cheaper price! even better when this was included as one of the prime products</li>
            <li> When I was trying to use it, it was really difficult because EVERYTHING got really sticky. I thought I would try one leg waxing and one leg using Sally Hansen hair remover to see which one worked better. I used one wax strip and it left my leg sticky, made my leg red for a couple of days, and made that part of my leg skin start peeling. I just ended up using the hair remover on both legs. I definitely will not buy this again. But on the bright side I found a new product I love!</li>
            <li> I have very fine textured and none to very little amount of body hair in the normal areas you would wax such as bikini line and under arms. I don&#x27;t shave and normally use tweezers. I thought this would be faster. However, this product removed NOTHING. Waste of money. Would not rec. to a friend or buy again.</li>
            <li> This item did not work for me. Had a rash under armpit for 5 days, did not feel good glade I only di one arm pit.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions correctly, but the results were a big disappointment. I used this for my arms and chest. This wax made me have numerous red bumps in my arms. In my chest, I broke out with many pimples that I panicked I was going to have scars. Thankfully, the pimples and red marks healed in one month. I have tried other wax options, and I think because maybe I may be sensitive to beeswax, I got a horrible reaction.</li>
            <li> Took out some hair but left a lot behind. Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands of wax strips and these are my favorite. They don&#x27;t hurt as much as the Sally Hansen ones, and pull out more hair if used correctly (put on and rub with the way the hairs grow, pull skin taut and pull off the strip quickly against the way the hair grows).</li>
            <li> I tried to use these strips on the hairs in my ears.  I cut the strips to a smaller size and did as the instructions stated.  Not only were there few hairs on the strip, but it left a lot of wax residue in my ear.  I guess I need to leave this to the professionals.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t grip well enough. Works OK for face but not legs</li>
            <li> (PAINFUL) .&lt;br /&gt;Worst wax strip ever . Removes two single hairs only if your lucky and Burns your skin. It hurt so bad for three days as we&#x27;ll it was hard to get of the existing wax.&lt;br /&gt;-messy&lt;br /&gt;-burned&lt;br /&gt;-hurt like hell&lt;br /&gt;-don&#x27;t buy these</li>
            <li> Had a allergic reaction to the Nads Body Was Strips, 20 count. Would not buy Nad&#x27;s again. Please place ingredient on package.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these waxing strips as the price was pretty cheap.  But I am very happy with my purchase.  I&#x27;ve had professional waxing services and also tried a variety of hair removal products.  None were this economical.  The directions are not the best.  But hair removal isn&#x27;t rocket science.  Make sure the area is clean and VERY dry.  Pull the skin area as taunt as you can. Cut the strips into smaller pieces so you can handle the ouch.  Remove the strips with a quick strong pull.  Repeat and go again. And yes you can successfully reuse a strip a few times by folding it together (wax side facing) and warming it with your hands.  Afterwards, do treat the skin area gently with aloe or what works best when your skin is a bit inflamed.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product came in good speed by the seller. I followed directions exactly as box directed. I have very easy pull out hair, fine. I pulled the strips as directed from my skin and it pulled nothing out . No hair came off onto the strip at all! I tried other areas underarm, bikini line, and leg. Instead of taking hair (which ,again, it didnt even take one at all from either of the three areas) it left the sticky wax substance on the application area. I could not remove this substance for hours and hours. Attempting every shower, soak, and even tried reading online tricks and other reviews for help on the sticky removal. This was a mess left and didnt even work at all. Never again will i get Nads body or facial wax strips</li>
            <li> I had bought this product from a store. I followed the directions. It not only took some of my hairs off... It also took off some of skin as well. I now have a few little scars where it had ripped my skin. If you have very sensitive like I do. I suggest Sugar Waxing. It not only takes the hairs off, and happily leave your skin intact. They have a tutorial on Youtube on how to make it with stuff just lying in your kitchen. It&#x27;s just sugar, salt, water, and lemon juice. ^_~V</li>
            <li> I used this product when it first came out. I like the gel instead. It is true that you put it on and a small amount goes a long wait, it heats up in your skin and you can spread it out  over a large area like your legs.&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t have a hard time warming the strip, I follow the directions, but did not remove all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;some of it came out most stayed. Hair was long enough that you can see I needed waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to have better luck next time. I bought 3 boxes, then I would let you know.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!  Very fast way to wax without mess.  The strips remove hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> did not work for me used under arm pit hairs remained and it burned my skin badly not happy at all</li>
            <li> As far as home waxing strips go, these are really good. The paper allows you to use the same strip a few times, unlike the plastic strips. They come with pre-waxing numbing towelettes that work well enough and post-waxing oil towelettes.</li>
            <li> I have used wax strips made from Sally Hansen, Veet, and Nad&#x27;s, and these Nad&#x27;s strips are by FAR the best of the three.  Before I discovered Nad&#x27;s, I used the other 2 brands, and I was used to having stray hairs remain after waxing.  The first time I ever removed ALL of the hair from an area was with these strips.  While I do still occasionally have remaining hair after waxing with Nad&#x27;s strips, this is far less common than with Sally Hansen or Veet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips also have a pleasant scent and are less prone to leaving wax residue (which was a problem with Sally Hansen and Veet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for my legs, underarms, and bikini area, and they have worked well in each area.  They can also be cut easily with scissors in case you prefer smaller strips.  I would definitely recommend these for anyone who is tired of shaving or is dissatisfied with other hair removal methods.</li>
            <li> This is often hard to find in stores.  I cut each large piece in strips and use it for unwanted facial hair.  It&#x27;s a bit hard on the skin and reddens it a bit but it does the job efficiently and well.</li>
            <li> These are the best wax strips I&#x27;ve found so far.  Water soluble, so easy clean up in the shower. Gentle on the skin, and great clean up wipes included.</li>
            <li> fairly easy to use. Does a good job of getting the heavier dark hairs.  The Kava wipes before hand really do help cut the sting. That said, it&#x27;s not painless, but I thought totally worth it to not shave every day.</li>
            <li> good as I thoughtbut it&#x27;s too hurt when first time try it.</li>
            <li> This product comes with 20 wax strips, enough for both arms, and 4 calming post wax oil pads. It is less messy than traditional heated wax products(microwavable Nair wax, my favorite brand). Also the cleanup is very easy. The oil pads were more than enough to remove any residues. The strips do not leave much of a residue anyway. The only drawback would be the price for the amount of product one receives. With the same dollar amount, one can purchase a whole microwavable wax tun and strip kit, which can be used to wax twice the amount possible with Nad&#x27;s. Sadly it is getting harder to find reasonable price Nair products.</li>
            <li> These did what I needed them to do, and they didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. They come with pre and post wax wipes, and both are really soothing. These strips were bigger than I expected, so they were awkward to use in the underarm and bikini areas. I wound up cutting them in half and that helped. I also had a couple of issues where the wax came off the strip and just stuck to my skin. The post-wax strips got it right off, but it was still annoying. Overall, I&#x27;d buy them again, but only because it&#x27;s cheaper than going to a salon (and I don&#x27;t have to be pant-less in front of a stranger!).</li>
            <li> Works well and results last much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! By far the best self waxing kit EVER!! I have tried so many...I can&#x27;t even...this is the only one that works. All you do is cut the strip to the size you need, rub your hands together with the strip in between and two warm wax strips you get. Seriously so great!!!</li>
            <li> This wax strips are painful, and did not work. I would suggest not using these for your bikini area. I read the instructions and did exactly as it said and after just using one strip it made the skin red, sore, and even bruised me. Tried on armpits and it barely took any hair off.</li>
            <li> These are the only waxing strips that have ever worked for me. They are so simple to use and leaves no mess at all. No residue on my skin and gets all the hair up. If your hair it super course or if you aren&#x27;t use to waxing, you might have to do what I did and go to a professional the first few times for your skin to get used to waxing. Once I did that, the strips work like magic for me!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean up. The after wax wipes are good too for getting the wax but I still like to wash with so</li>
            <li> I read so many bad reviews for veets body wax strips and Sally Hansen&#x27;s stuff, so I decided to buy this from Target just to try out. And wow.. it hardly removes any hair. It seemed like wax grabbed enough hair when I was rubbing the strip while it was stuck on my skin, yet it hardly removed any hair. It removed only about 10%..... What is that really? I kept on using strips and it just irritated my skin. It was a total waste.</li>
            <li> I love these because they are easy to cut into four smaller strips (the normal size of the Veet ones) so I really get 80 strips in a pack.</li>
            <li> I like waxing over shaving because the hair does not grow as quick but its a timely process. It doesn&#x27;t hurt too much and it lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> Have to use the whole box to get results, I&#x27;ll stick with razors.</li>
            <li> Still painful, but these are the best wax strips we&#x27;ve found.  Very clean results and easy to use.  It helps to heat each set of strips up before pulling them apart and applying them.  15 seconds in the microwave or we sit by a heater.</li>
            <li> easy to work with compared to the Nads you paint on with a applicator.</li>
            <li> NO! This product does Not work. I used it on my underarms and I followed directions exactly.  It pulled a time bit of my hair off (maybe 8%) &amp; some of my Skin. Guess who&#x27;s underarm is bleeding &amp;#62;. &amp;#60;  It wasn&#x27;t alot of blood just a dot, but Still (~_~). I am so Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> These works so well!!!!!! Love the product.</li>
            <li> Leaves sticky residue after use. Does not work completely.</li>
            <li> These strips do an adequate job of removing body hair - if you use the correct technique. These will not remove stubble, and on occasion they will leave a wax residue behind which is easily removable with the included towelettes. The big pluses for me are a) relatively low cost; b) no skin irritation; c) ability to re-use a strip (I&#x27;ve used one up to four times before it begins to lose its stickiness). It is helpful if your skin is free of oils or lotions prior to using this product. If you have a lot of dry, flaky skin, it will not work as effectively. Sometimes these are available on the subscribe and save option, which will save you a few cents.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, really wonderful product.  Haven&#x27;t ever had a problem and I&#x27;ve been using them for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. It is gentle on the skin but does a great job at the same time. The only thing I would add to it is more post-wax soothing oil.</li>
            <li> First - I have had my legs waxed professionally for years, so there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Used correctly, these work well.  I would not recommend this for someone who has never had a waxing before.&lt;br /&gt;But if you understand that you don&#x27;t want to keep it on you skin for long enough for it to get warm/soft, and have the guts to pull it hard and fast in the opposite direction of the hair growth  it works good.  If you are doing more than a half leg, I would go professional, or any other body parts also professional the first time.</li>
            <li> They are perfect and work well and are very easy to do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of home waxing products, pre waxed strips, kits and the thick waxes you pull off without any strips. These are the best because they do a very good job, don&#x27;t take any time to prepare, and don&#x27;t make a mess. (Have you ever spilled a jar of melted wax?)</li>
            <li> Great wax strips, used for the legs, not mine but the women in the family seem to like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Not great..but not completely awful. It seemed to break the hairs off, rather that actually remove the roots fully. It did remove some and wasn&#x27;t terribly painful, so I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> These work really well.</li>
            <li> These are the best wax strips I have used to date. Simple, clean and a lot cheaper than the aesthetician.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good wax strips. They are pre-waxed so these is minimal mess. The only thing that is a downer is that the hair has to be pretty long fit them to work.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sally Hansen wax strips for the past few years and I thought those were awesome. This time when I ran out, I thought I would give the Nad&#x27;s wax strips a try. I&#x27;m really glad I did. It looks like I found new ones. The strips may not be packaged like the Sally Hansen with different sizes, but you can still cut them into whatever shape you&#x27;d like. But the main reason I really like these is because they are soft. There&#x27;s hardly any pain and sticky wax, but remember, with any product, you have to know how to use it. Pull opposite of hair growth while firmly pressing against skin.</li>
            <li> These wax straps work perfectly. And make sure to read the manual.  One strip (separated) works 100% 5 times before it even comes close to disguarding!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take all the hair off. I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> This product in my experience cannot be used on the face or other tender areas. It successfully took away skin but not hair and I now have red abrasion marks on my face everywhere I applied the product. In addition, the same effect happened on my husband&#x27;s skin on his chest area. Like another reviewer noted, it also leaves behind a waxy residue which is hard to get off. I can think of no reason to buy this product since it hurts and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad, but i wish it took out more hair in one rip because it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> These work and like all Nad&#x27;s products I&#x27;ve tried, clean up is easy with a little soap and water.  Also, this popped up as a potential add on to get free shippiing of my other product.  Handy.</li>
            <li> These wax strips are great. I have always used the regular Nad&#x27;s waxing gel in the white pot, but my local drugstore has stopped carrying it. I bought this product from amazon, specifically for waxing the hair on my thighs. I have a good amount of hair to wax there, but the hairs are thinner, more fine than the hair on my lower legs. I was skeptical when I opened up the package, but they really work! I got about 2-3 uses out of every strip, and it took 8 single strips out of 20 to do both of my thighs (from my bikini line to my knees).This is SO MUCH CHEAPER than salon waxing (probably even cheaper than buying the wax pot), much quicker, and very easy to use. The post-wax oil wipes are very effective at cleaning the wax residue off, and also moisturizing the skin. Highly recommended, I will definitely repurchase. The only thing is, I tried a strip on my lower leg &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well with coarser hair, so one star off for that.</li>
            <li> These did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly and I&#x27;m loving it</li>
    </ol>
