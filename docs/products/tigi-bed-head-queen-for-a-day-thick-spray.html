            <li>It is great to spray in your roots or to just spray all over.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell too.  </li>
            <li>Hair is remarkably fuller.</li>
            <li>and my hair is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this product.</li>
            <li>I loved the way the product felt when used.  </li>
            <li>Very light, but pleasant.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this spray!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I gave it a try anyway and love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It has a nice grapefruit perfume.</li>
            <li>but you get kind of use to it</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work well alone for my very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I guess that did the trick because it smells fine now!</li>
            <li>You can find it in salons but Amazon has it at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it makes your hair noticeably thicker.</li>
            <li>It gives me a ton of volume and makes me look like I have a lot more hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and use it every day - have for probably 5 years or more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Plus is a much better product that I have tried to date.</li>
            <li>(Although I&#x27;m always searching for the next best thing.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get more of that blow-dryed tousled look.</li>
            <li>I swear by it!  :)</li>
            <li>It was ok</li>
            <li>but I found &amp;#34;Superstar&amp;#34; which works better.  </li>
            <li>I just love volume.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from frangrencenet, so order from them if you want free samples!</li>
            <li>Without products any kind of hair band, clip, etc will slide right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>However it still works so I easily got over it.</li>
            <li>and also the longer you use the can, the smell is not as strong.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that is shoulder length.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do anything for my fine, medium-long hair</li>
            <li>Helps with fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I read previous reviews of people saying its perfect for fine hair which made me nervous.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have fine hair</li>
            <li>It also came with a free compact mirror.</li>
            <li>I decided to shake the can more vigorously thinking maybe its been sitting for awhile and just needed to be mixed good.</li>
            <li>A good tip is to use the blow dry lotion as well, to make the result even better.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t significant but it is noticeable.  </li>
            <li>i have really thinned out hair because i get lots of layers cut all the way up to my crown for volume, and this spray makes it look like i have more hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re even true to their arrival date.</li>
            <li>I have used many bed head products and thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for any hair and makes my hair look thick and voluminous!</li>
            <li>This is a great spray for women with fine thin hair that need some lift.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t add much body, and it was sort of oily looking on my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>If I want more lift And volume, I just spray a little more and section off the sides.</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly as ordered right on time.</li>
            <li>I appreciated how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my hair is very fine and flat at my roots, but has volume at the end.  </li>
            <li>and I tried giving it the benefit of the doubt and using it for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Sexy Hair Root Pump</li>
            <li>It is not a hair spray sort of smell, it smells more than it has fruity fragrances in it to try to cover up the chemically spray, but they mixed together.</li>
            <li>I love this product and having it delivered to my door is a big help.</li>
            <li>I used it on my mother who has straight flat hair and it also made her hair so much more voluminous.</li>
            <li>She is not one to care that much about fancy products but asked me what it was and where she could get it.</li>
            <li>I know almost immediately if I start drying and forgot to put it in as my hair dries way too fast.  </li>
            <li>This smelled like grape medicine and was very sticky and crunchy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend TIGI Bed Head Superstar Queen for A Day.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to have on hand for bad hair days.</li>
            <li>i ended up buying this instead of my normal tigi catwalk root booster just to switch things up.</li>
            <li>I have super fine, limp hair, and Queen for a Day totally helps me build some body into it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair very thick and nice, but I sprayed some on my ears and now they are VERY itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not happy that on my very first use of this product the nozzle broke off with just one light touch of my finger.</li>
            <li>For some reason, it does take a lot more time to blow dry with this product in than without it (even if I have other products in my hair).  </li>
            <li>I have short hair and it really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Just spay it in and your hair really does feel fuller, especially when blow drying it.</li>
            <li>The Big Sexy Hair Root Pump Plus actually gives my hair that extra lift it needs when I blow dry</li>
            <li>The box it came in contained free samples of 2 products (a wrinkle cream, and a perfume bottle) and I&#x27;m not sure why,</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li>give my hair a sticky feeling it actually makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>first it can be a little offensive</li>
            <li>DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  very sticky and just makes your hair flat and dull  there must be something better out there.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried because I have never had much luck with hair products.</li>

            <li> Anyway, the volumizer smells bad at first, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Complete waste of my $$.</li>
            <li> This stuff just did not work, and it took forever to blow dry my hair too after putting this in.  </li>
            <li> I apply this when my hair is wet (before blow dry).  </li>
            <li> I have used this thickening spray for years, but sometimes have trouble finding it locally.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> careful not to spray on skin</li>
            <li> Spray close to roots in towel-dry hair, blow dry, and whoosh!!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t sit flat and limp against my head and look lifeless.</li>
            <li> I initially thought I received an old bottle because the product smelled awful, and it&#x27;s supposed to smell sweet like candy.</li>
            <li> I spray a small amount at the roots of my wet hair in 4 sections on the crown of my head, then blow dry.</li>
            <li> It is a blowdry lotion for thick massive hair.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair lots of body without weighing it down the way that gel does.</li>
            <li> I bought two for less than half what my stylist charged me.</li>
            <li> if I want to wear my hair up, I can without it being a mess.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, and my stylist says a thick hair shaft.</li>
            <li> I used it maybe twice, wasted my money</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years since it works well for me.  </li>
            <li> And for half the price that it usually goes for at salons or even at a drug store.</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays and my hair feels thicker all day!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thin hair and used this product religiously.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was really wonky</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t track it for some weird reason, but it came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at the store, but couldn&#x27;t resist the price here!</li>
            <li> After a horrible experience with Garnier Blow Dry perfecter which caused me to loose some hair and have thinner patches, I turned to this product.</li>
            <li> It adds tons of volume to my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was dented and pump was broken off.</li>
            <li> Sad to see it go</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x60;t disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is a great spray for women with fine thin hair that need some lift. You can find it in salons but Amazon has it at a much better price.  LOVE IT!</li>

            <li> i ended up buying this instead of my normal tigi catwalk root booster just to switch things up. wonderful results! i&#x27;ve just used it once and my hair is gorgeous. i have really thinned out hair because i get lots of layers cut all the way up to my crown for volume, and this spray makes it look like i have more hair. i recommend this to anyone looking for massive volume.</li>

            <li> Great Product! I was a little worried because I have never had much luck with hair products. I have very thin hair and it pumps it up like no ones business!</li>

            <li> This is the best thickening spray around. It gives my hair lots of body without weighing it down the way that gel does.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a proffessional demonstration. I wasn&#x60;t disappointed. This product is really good! Spray close to roots in towel-dry hair, blow dry, and whoosh!! Hair is remarkably fuller. I LOVE this spray! A good tip is to use the blow dry lotion as well, to make the result even better.</li>

The Big Sexy Hair Root Pump Plus actually gives my hair that extra lift it needs when I blow dry it smooth/straight so it doesn&#x27;t sit flat and limp against my head and look lifeless. I&#x27;m able to get more of that blow-dryed tousled look.</li>
            <li> I started using this after my hairdresser used it at her salon.  It has a nice grapefruit perfume. Very light, but pleasant.  It works well with a Pureology styling gel I use. It doesn&#x27;t work well alone for my very fine hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle was dented and pump was broken off.</li>
            <li> Helps with fine hair.  Adds volume and helps me manage my hair.  Would not want to be without this product!!!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t add much body, and it was sort of oily looking on my fine straight hair. not what i was looking for at all!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a God send!!!  My thinning hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in YEARS!!!!!  I swear by it!  :)</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  very sticky and just makes your hair flat and dull  there must be something better out there. still looking for the righr one</li>
            <li> It was ok but I found &amp;#34;Superstar&amp;#34; which works better.  It is a blowdry lotion for thick massive hair.  I have short hair and it really works for me.  It is also a Bed Head product.</li>
            <li> It does thicken your hair for the time, however the one draw back is the smell----at first it can be a little offensive but you get kind of use to it and also the longer you use the can, the smell is not as strong.  I prefer unscented products , but until I find another product, it will work.</li>
            <li> I bought two for less than half what my stylist charged me. It arrived exactly as ordered right on time.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this spray. It is wonderful to have on hand for bad hair days. Will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I loved the way the product felt when used.  It has a great smell too.  Just spay it in and your hair really does feel fuller, especially when blow drying it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have very fine thin hair and this give me height and control plus volume!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t give my hair a sticky feeling it actually makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years since it works well for me.  I appreciated how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li> This product has been removed from some stores shelves for whatever reason.  My daughter has very thin hair and used this product religiously.  Bed Head makes excellant products and this meets that level.  Sad to see it go and so is my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy that on my very first use of this product the nozzle broke off with just one light touch of my finger. However it still works so I easily got over it. It dries out hair a little.&lt;br /&gt;Now the GOOD! It works wonderfully! I read previous reviews of people saying its perfect for fine hair which made me nervous. I don&#x27;t have fine hair I just love volume. I gave it a try anyway and love it! It&#x27;s perfect for any hair and makes my hair look thick and voluminous! And for half the price that it usually goes for at salons or even at a drug store. All my bed head products will be from here! They&#x27;re even true to their arrival date.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, limp hair, and Queen for a Day totally helps me build some body into it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair is very fine and flat at my roots, but has volume at the end.  The shipping was really wonky and I couldn&#x27;t track it for some weird reason, but it came faster than expected. The box it came in contained free samples of 2 products (a wrinkle cream, and a perfume bottle) and I&#x27;m not sure why, but I&#x27;m not complaining!  I ordered it from frangrencenet, so order from them if you want free samples! It also came with a free compact mirror. Anyway, the volumizer smells bad at first, but it is worth it! It is not a hair spray sort of smell, it smells more than it has fruity fragrances in it to try to cover up the chemically spray, but they mixed together. It makes my hair very thick and nice, but I sprayed some on my ears and now they are VERY itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up-&lt;br /&gt;Order from fragrence net&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to spray on skin&lt;br /&gt;Get used to the smell!</li>
            <li> I love this product and having it delivered to my door is a big help.</li>
