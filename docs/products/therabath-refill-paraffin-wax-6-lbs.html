            <li>This is a great product and such a great scent.</li>
            <li>Melted nicely, peels off easily.</li>
            <li>Lovely smell.  </li>
            <li>This wax is much better quality than what they send with the bath.</li>
            <li>and I love dipping my hands when they hurt.</li>
            <li>makes the experience even more enjoyable for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Therabath spa and ordered the peach wax for it which I love.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I bought this many times.  </li>
            <li>so wasn&#x27;t sure about melting temps.  </li>
            <li>so you can break it apart easily</li>
            <li>If you want to sprinkle it easily into your warmer with even coverage, I would suggest crumbling it in the package before opening it.  </li>
            <li>Great price, subtle scent, great quality and does the job</li>
            <li>I like this fine.  </li>
            <li>The Paraffin wax arrived quickly and in top condition.</li>
            <li>but it leaves your hands smooth.  </li>
            <li>What I received was not the original Therabath Paraffin Wax.  </li>
            <li>Lightly scented, melts quickly, and applies to hands well.</li>
            <li>Thanks:)</li>
            <li>Best value lots of wax for least cost</li>
            <li>Melts quickly</li>
            <li>and it melts quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it for others.</li>
            <li>It really seemed to help both my husband&#x27;s and my hands and feet feel hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>so you must get used to that, do remember it is not dirty</li>
            <li>I was able to pour it in and there was no mess.  </li>
            <li>and I dumped right in.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent that&#x27;s not strong.  </li>
            <li>The wax doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>The first bag I opened</li>
            <li>I am quite sure I will be ordering again in ther future!</li>
            <li>It is just right temp and much easier to deal with than the blocks of wax.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t smell like peaches (which is why I brought a scented wax in the first place); it basically makes my bathroom smell like I dropped a large burning candle in the room!</li>
            <li>It is very soothing to dip my hands in the hot wax and the aroma from the peach</li>
            <li>The hot wax is a real help to my wife&#x27;s arthritis.</li>
            <li>Bead form melts fast and the texture is creamy and soothing.  </li>
            <li>Makes chapped hands feel extra smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the nursing home that I work at, because we needed more wax and funds are tight at the moment.</li>
            <li>After trying other fragrances I enjoy the Peach Smell in this product.</li>
            <li>This is a professional grade parafin.</li>
            <li>The only thing I see that could be improved is that when I peel the wax off, its very greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes your hands so soft in such a relaxing way.</li>
            <li>so far I like it, has a different color</li>
            <li>Mild and not overwhelming and works even with some allergic clients.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Lovely smell.  Melts quickly</li>
            <li> After trying other fragrances I enjoy the Peach Smell in this product. It is not as heavy a smell as I thought it might be.  Very nice!</li>
            <li> This wax is much better quality than what they send with the bath. Leaves moisture in your hands instead of just feeling sticky after you dip. Nice smell also</li>
            <li> This is a professional grade parafin. It comes off your hands easily and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This wax smells so good to me and I love dipping my hands when they hurt. I have osteoarthritis which can cause my hands to ache if I am doing a lot of physical work such as yard work and even sewing. It is very soothing to dip my hands in the hot wax and the aroma from the peach makes the experience even more enjoyable for me.</li>
            <li> In my view, this is a good product. Lightly scented, melts quickly, and applies to hands well. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and such a great scent. The wax doesn&#x27;t get too hot. It is just right temp and much easier to deal with than the blocks of wax.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>

            <li> Love this peach scent!  Mild and not overwhelming and works even with some allergic clients.  Bead form melts fast and the texture is creamy and soothing.  Will be one of my top picks for paraffin use!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the paraffin wax refill packs. The wax comes in tiny beads so you can break it apart easily and it melts quickly. And who doesn&#x27;t like peach fragrance?</li>
            <li> I purchased the Therabath spa and ordered the peach wax for it which I love.  I use it every day to help with my arthritis in my hands and it is so soothing and helps with the pain.  Not only that but it leaves your hands smooth.  I love this product and would highly recommend it for others.</li>
            <li> The Paraffin wax arrived quickly and in top condition. It makes your hands so soft in such a relaxing way.</li>
            <li> The hot wax is a real help to my wife&#x27;s arthritis. In the colder months I use it to ease my joints and to rehydrate the skin of my hands.</li>
            <li> The paraffin wax is comparable to other waxes I have purchased for my machine.  What is not so pleasant is the aroma from the machine.  It really doesn&#x27;t smell like peaches (which is why I brought a scented wax in the first place); it basically makes my bathroom smell like I dropped a large burning candle in the room!</li>
            <li> Great. I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leave akin feeling and smelling amazing as well.</li>
            <li> Nice peachy smell, and is good for parifin waxing my hands. Especially for us that have RA</li>
            <li> so far I like it, has a different color so you must get used to that, do remember it is not dirty it is peach  [lol</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent that&#x27;s not strong.  Melted nicely.  If you want to sprinkle it easily into your warmer with even coverage, I would suggest crumbling it in the package before opening it.  The first bag I opened and I dumped right in.  When I went to brake the clumps apart, the force sent the little particles flying all over my floor.  With the secong bag I clumbled it before opening.  I was able to pour it in and there was no mess.  It really seemed to help both my husband&#x27;s and my hands and feet feel hydrated and smooth. Great product!</li>
            <li> The Product arrived promptly and is just what I was hoping for!! I am quite sure I will be ordering again in ther future! Thanks:)</li>
            <li> What I received was not the original Therabath Paraffin Wax.  The product was shipped by Candlewick and it was not the same color nor was the peach scent the same.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the nursing home that I work at, because we needed more wax and funds are tight at the moment. The peach smells heavenly, and it does a good job of retaining heat. The only thing I see that could be improved is that when I peel the wax off, its very greasy. My residents usually wipe their hands with a towel to get it off. But its very good otherwise.</li>
            <li> this paraffin wax was a great quality and smelled heavenly.  clients loved it and i loved it as well.  :)</li>
            <li> I use it all the time on my hands, its very good</li>
            <li> Nice soothing smelling wax for your paraffin home machine. Makes chapped hands feel extra smooth. Also good for hand arthritis</li>
            <li> This product was easy to get melted, pelletized works great, and the scent is pleasant without being overwhelming.  For arthritis it is very nice with the bonus of moister hands in winter.</li>
            <li> was delivered as promised and smells great!</li>
            <li> I like this fine.  I bought this many times.  The fragrant and texture is nice.  Will buy again in future.</li>
            <li> Best value lots of wax for least cost</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve refilled my paraffin with the peach scent and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Will buy from again. Great price, subtle scent, great quality and does the job</li>
            <li> Love the wax! Nice scent without being overpowering. Wax melts smoothly and feels great on the hands. It should last a long time, but I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Melted nicely, peels off easily. I use it in the revlon bath so wasn&#x27;t sure about melting temps.  Wish they had orange!!</li>
