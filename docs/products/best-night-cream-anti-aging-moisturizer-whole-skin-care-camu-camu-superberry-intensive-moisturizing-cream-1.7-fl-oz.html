            <li>I just love this whole product overall!</li>
            <li>i opened my cream and it was kind of dark brown around the rims and stuff.</li>
            <li>Here is her report: I LOVE the Live Ultimate skincare products!  </li>
            <li>The thing I love about Live Ultimate products is that my skin absorbs them so well</li>
            <li>I have used both face masks (I particularly like the scent of the coconut clay mask!)</li>
            <li>but I really really like this one.</li>
            <li>i really dont like how the cream doesnt come with a protector inside.</li>
            <li>I really like this after two months.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The cream is filled with natural ingredients to help boost natural beauty and refresh the skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that the color of the cream itself isn&#x27;t pure white, but a light beige color, almost like sand.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is natural and therefore causes no ill side</li>
            <li>I am skeptical of reviews from people who had been given the product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>CamuSuperberry&#x27;s high quality and carefully selected ingredients are all natural and potent in a luxurious cream.  </li>
            <li>It is really hard to explain how nice it is.</li>
            <li>Wow this is intense moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion is very soothing and natural.</li>
            <li>this just feels like normal tighter skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy without being too thick, and goes on smoothly and blends in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive sense of smell and this moisturizer is not obnoxious to me at all.  </li>
            <li>Shortly after my first use of the cream, I started to worry about what ingredients could possibly make this cream penetrate the skin so deeply and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I began to suspect that the natural ingredients had been manipulated into nanoparticle sizes.  </li>
            <li>As I understand it, the natural plant based ingredients come from stem cells of those plants.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels soft .This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and and it is made with organic ingredients that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t  irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>My face is soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I think it tends to brighten my skin by helping to shed old skin cells.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and youthful looking, and any Mother would be thankful to add it to her skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for this type of cream and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the use of Live Ultimate products, due to their us of natural oils, vitamins and extracts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile and it has barely made a dent in the amount in the jar.</li>
            <li>It appears that this jar will last a very long time because it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the little plastic cover you remove and throw away the first time you use a cosmetic product.</li>
            <li>It makes me wonder what sort of chemicals other products might have that bleach them to pure white.  </li>
            <li>uses plant cell technology with other natural products for a natural face lift</li>
            <li>I tried this by accident; it was intended to be a gift for my eternally optimistic 93 year old mother who is perpetually looking for a night cream that delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li>It applies like a thick moisturizer and soaks into your skin quickly.</li>

            <li> is doing exactly what it proclaims.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a night cream to use every evening, you should absolutely try this product!</li>
            <li> No real miracles here, just a nice product to use that makes my skin feel moisurized all night and also during the day when I use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> I just love this whole product overall!</li>
            <li> i opened my cream and it was kind of dark brown around the rims and stuff.</li>
            <li> Here is her report: I LOVE the Live Ultimate skincare products!  </li>
            <li> The thing I love about Live Ultimate products is that my skin absorbs them so well</li>
            <li> I have used both face masks (I particularly like the scent of the coconut clay mask!)</li>
            <li> but I really really like this one.</li>
            <li> i really dont like how the cream doesnt come with a protector inside.</li>
            <li> I really like this after two months.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The cream is filled with natural ingredients to help boost natural beauty and refresh the skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that the color of the cream itself isn&#x27;t pure white, but a light beige color, almost like sand.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is natural and therefore causes no ill side</li>
            <li> I am skeptical of reviews from people who had been given the product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> CamuSuperberry&#x27;s high quality and carefully selected ingredients are all natural and potent in a luxurious cream.  </li>
            <li> It is really hard to explain how nice it is.</li>
            <li> Wow this is intense moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is very soothing and natural.</li>
            <li> this just feels like normal tighter skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy without being too thick, and goes on smoothly and blends in quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive sense of smell and this moisturizer is not obnoxious to me at all.  </li>
            <li> Shortly after my first use of the cream, I started to worry about what ingredients could possibly make this cream penetrate the skin so deeply and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I began to suspect that the natural ingredients had been manipulated into nanoparticle sizes.  </li>
            <li> As I understand it, the natural plant based ingredients come from stem cells of those plants.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels soft .This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and and it is made with organic ingredients that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t  irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> My face is soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I think it tends to brighten my skin by helping to shed old skin cells.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and youthful looking, and any Mother would be thankful to add it to her skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for this type of cream and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the use of Live Ultimate products, due to their us of natural oils, vitamins and extracts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile and it has barely made a dent in the amount in the jar.</li>
            <li> It appears that this jar will last a very long time because it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the little plastic cover you remove and throw away the first time you use a cosmetic product.</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder what sort of chemicals other products might have that bleach them to pure white.  </li>
            <li> uses plant cell technology with other natural products for a natural face lift</li>
            <li> I tried this by accident; it was intended to be a gift for my eternally optimistic 93 year old mother who is perpetually looking for a night cream that delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li> It applies like a thick moisturizer and soaks into your skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount and it covers my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> It is thick, so you know that you are not getting too much at one time.  </li>
            <li> Within seconds of applying it, I could tell that it was dramatically different from any other face cream I had ever used  -  </li>
            <li> Also a little bit goes a long way, so this will last for quite sometime.  </li>
            <li> Live Ultimate goes on thick but does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> After it dries, a few minutes later, your face feels tighter..</li>
            <li> Not because it dried gross tighter, we all know that feeling..</li>
            <li> And this is from someone who hasn&#x27;t had luck with other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some other products with camu superberry and they never disappoint.</li>
            <li> I have used other moisturizers and they have caused breakouts.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any negative effects after using this product; my skin is definitely softer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There were a few small traces of darkness in my jar, not a big thing just an odd thing.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other products by Live Ultimate, the jar and the packaging look very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this night cream for a little less than a week</li>
            <li> During these winter months my face has become dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the night cream for a few days</li>
            <li> It works within a few applications.</li>
            <li> I have been using this night cream every night for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Camu Camu, cranberry, aloe &amp; green tea extracts help my face feel moisturized and give it a healthier feel.</li>
            <li> There is very little fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all of them are</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m between a rock a hard space.</li>
            <li> So creamy and not too thick for daytime use.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and pleasing.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and does wonders on skin.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I had a real bad sunburn on my face that ended up peeling, and this cream helped so much.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any breakouts.</li>
            <li> When I got the purchase, the box was unseal, inside the cream has a lot of seeds, chunky,and old, so disappointed with the purchase:(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fancy chrome look that makes it look like an expensive product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this 10 stars if possible. I have tried so many skin creams and had pretty much given up on finding the perfect one. I am skeptical of reviews from people who had been given the product for free in exchange for an honest review. I tried this by accident; it was intended to be a gift for my eternally optimistic 93 year old mother who is perpetually looking for a night cream that delivers what it promises. Amazon shipped it to me instead of her. So I tried it. Within seconds of applying it, I could tell that it was dramatically different from any other face cream I had ever used  -  it penetrated the skin upon contact. The scent is subtle and pleasing. The weight and feel of the cream felt non-existent, but the feeling of my skin was completely different. It felt as if it had been hydrated and nourished from the inside. I noticed immediately that my complexion looked better, as if the circulation had improved. In the morning, my skin still felt hydrated.  Shortly after my first use of the cream, I started to worry about what ingredients could possibly make this cream penetrate the skin so deeply and quickly.  I began to suspect that the natural ingredients had been manipulated into nanoparticle sizes.  I called customer service and immediately was able to speak with someone who was very knowledgeable. He clarified that the cream does not contain nanoparticles. As I understand it, the natural plant based ingredients come from stem cells of those plants. And these stem cells come from very special tissue - from the most active cells of the buds, known as meristematic cells.   The excellent customer care at Live Ultimate is outstanding.    CamuSuperberry&#x27;s high quality and carefully selected ingredients are all natural and potent in a luxurious cream.  BTW, I purchased this.....and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this creme! It smells wonderful and makes your skin SO soft and bright! It is packaged so well! I even love the container! I just love this whole product overall! I absolutely recommend it to everyone! *I received a sample to try in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion. The views in this review are completely my own!*</li>
            <li> Yes yes and more yes! I looooove this face cream. I get to test and try a lot of creams and serums but I really really like this one. For one the jar is beautiful. I love pretty health and beauty products. But its whats in it that counts! I only use a small amount and it covers my whole face and neck. Its not greasy or oily at all. You face soaks this stuff right up. Doesn&#x27;t feel tacky or sticky or greasy at all. Has a very light pleasant scent, but Im not sure what it is. I think this jar would last a couple of months. After it dries, a few minutes later, your face feels tighter.. Not because it dried gross tighter, we all know that feeling.. this just feels like normal tighter skin. My make up goes over top of it no problem at all. I love this cream and Im looking forward to continued use and results with it. So glad I was able to come across this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** My reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.&lt;br /&gt;Received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review***</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the night cream for a few days and it&#x27;s very nice and easily obsorbed by the skin and my skin feels soft .This uses plant cell technology with other natural products for a natural face lift .The cream smells wonderful spreads easily around giving you a fresh look .It definitely delivers the results ...making your skin bright .I purchased during the promotion and I am pleased to share my honest opinion .</li>
            <li> Wow this is intense moisturizer. It smells a little sweet - that&#x27;s a good thing. It is very thick and does wonders on skin. It absorbs nicely and leaves my skin feeling really good. I really love this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few small traces of darkness in my jar, not a big thing just an odd thing. The packaging it not tamper evident, and there isn&#x27;t a plastic sheet over the moisturizer inside the jar. That&#x27;s the little plastic cover you remove and throw away the first time you use a cosmetic product. It would have prevented product from getting in the threads of the cap and turning brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> This is a big hit with my wife. It feels moisturizing right away and the results in the morning are excellent and noticeable. And this is from someone who hasn&#x27;t had luck with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional observations:&lt;br /&gt;* Fragrance is natural and therefore causes no ill side effects.&lt;br /&gt;* Not greasy and does not solidify.&lt;br /&gt;* Results in no itchiness or blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night cream requested for sincere review.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great for any part of the body. It works within a few applications. It smells great and not like the &#x27;clinical&#x27; type of moisturizer. This is my favorite thing about it, the smell is mild but very appealing. Smells like.. mild fruit. It goes on light weight and does not take much to use. I use this nightly and it has become part of my beauty routine! This package arrived on time and in tact. A discount was given for my review.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I have the chance to try out this product and been satisfied and happy with it. It&#x27;s all natural and and it is made with organic ingredients that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t  irritate my skin. The cream is not greasy at all and absorbs well to skin. It has a light smell and my skin felt hydrated after application. Its a great skin care and I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I arranged for a model to test these products.  Here is her report: I LOVE the Live Ultimate skincare products!  I have used both face masks (I particularly like the scent of the coconut clay mask!) and they are lovely. The Camucomplex is so nice. It works great prior to putting on foundation. So creamy and not too thick for daytime use. The Camusuperberry creme is perfect for bedtime. My skin has never felt so soft before and smooth before!  The instant lift is nice and though it will take some time to truly test the results, it feels like it is  is doing exactly what it proclaims.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this skincare line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample product for impartial review</li>
            <li> I have only used this for 3 days but I love the texture and feel on my face.</li>
            <li> When I got the purchase, the box was unseal, inside the cream has a lot of seeds, chunky,and old, so disappointed with the purchase:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality night cream for a while now, so I quickly jumped to the opportunity to get a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes. I&#x27;m very happy to honestly let you know that this is an excellent cream! It gets absorbed very fast, leaving your skin feeling great and soft to the touch. Like a lot of other products by Live Ultimate, the jar and the packaging look very expensive. I have some other products with camu superberry and they never disappoint. If you are looking for a night cream to use every evening, you should absolutely try this product! I&#x27;ve been using it every day and I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my skin will be if I keep on using this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I have used other moisturizers and they have caused breakouts. Live Ultimate goes on thick but does not feel heavy. There were some red spots on my face the night before and by morning they were gone. I was fortunate to test this product to give my honest opinion and I would recommend it to everyone. My face is soft and clear. I love this!!!</li>
            <li> i really dont like how the cream doesnt come with a protector inside. i opened my cream and it was kind of dark brown around the rims and stuff. how do i know no one has already touched the cream inside?!?! do not like the packaging at all. besides that, the cream works fine and doesnt irritate my face at all!! I received this product for our review purposes, all opinions are our own unbiased thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great and makes skin smooth and youthful! Definitely recomend!</li>
            <li> I really like this after two months. No film or crust after use. Goes on clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week and my skin has improved greatly. My family had noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have seen a big difference in my appearance.  I had a real bad sunburn on my face that ended up peeling, and this cream helped so much. It made the burn heal and tan quickly. I will definitely buy more of this!</li>
            <li> Having good results with this. Makes skin softer and looks healthier. Easy to use and unscented.</li>
            <li> I have been using this night cream every night for a few weeks. I&#x27;ve used it some mornings as well because I like the way it feels on my face. I think it tends to brighten my skin by helping to shed old skin cells. It can&#x27;t get rid of deep wrinkles, no skin cream can. But it does provide moisture and ingredients that I think help to revitalize my skin. I&#x27;m not sure what all of them are but there are a lot like Aloe, Mango seed butter, Shea Butter, Ascorbic Acid and Cucumber Extract that I&#x27;ve used before with good results. What I like are nice steady results and looking the best I can as I get older. No real miracles here, just a nice product to use that makes my skin feel moisurized all night and also during the day when I use it in the morning. The price is reasonable for this type of cream and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is like putting silk on your skin. I&#x27;m 50 and have pretty good skin. But after using this, my skin is super smooth and feels wonderful. It is really hard to explain how nice it is. You don&#x27;t need a lot to moisturize so this will last quite awhile. It is in a beautiful jar as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile and it has barely made a dent in the amount in the jar. There is very little fragrance as well. Nothing like an added perfume. Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> There was a hair in the jar. Returned it</li>
            <li> My face looks brighter and feel refreshed and smooth! The thing I love about Live Ultimate products is that my skin absorbs them so well and I can feel the moisture right away. I have been using this night cream for a little less than a week and I am very pleased with the results! I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  I am a huge fan of antioxidants and any natural boosters for my skin and body. Camu Camu, cranberry, aloe &amp; green tea extracts help my face feel moisturized and give it a healthier feel. The cream absorbs great on my face and I feel moisturized and hydrated. The smell of the lotion is very soothing and natural. I have added this cream to my nightly routine and my face looks radiant and bright. I apply the cream after I wash my face and right before I hop into bed. I am very excited to continue to see more results and hydrate my skin with pure and natural ingredients.  I have received several compliments on my skin ever since I ordered this night cream! The cream is filled with natural ingredients to help boost natural beauty and refresh the skin. I would highly recommend the use of Live Ultimate products, due to their us of natural oils, vitamins and extracts. This is a great choice for a night cream!!</li>
            <li> This night cream feels absolutely wonderful on my skin.  It&#x27;s creamy without being too thick, and goes on smoothly and blends in quickly.  Not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t smell of chemicals and who knows what.  I have a very sensitive sense of smell and this moisturizer is not obnoxious to me at all.  I love that it&#x27;s full of organic ingredients, lots of fruits, but doesn&#x27;t smell fruity either.  It has a light, not unpleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product to review and am happy to give it a five star rating.  I haven&#x27;t found any negative effects after using this product; my skin is definitely softer.  I was surprised to see that the color of the cream itself isn&#x27;t pure white, but a light beige color, almost like sand.  It makes me wonder what sort of chemicals other products might have that bleach them to pure white.  To me, the color of this cream seems more natural, and while it could just be a marketing ploy, it worked!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b7dbcd213dc6e920ca1d79e9e12ba810]] If your mother is anything like me, I am always in search of a great Moisturizing Cream, and I am happy to have found the Live Ultimate Camu Superberry Moisturizing Cream.  I absolutely love this moisturizing cream.  It is thick, so you know that you are not getting too much at one time.  It goes on very easily and does not leave that greasy feeling on your skin.  Also a little bit goes a long way, so this will last for quite sometime.  It leaves your skin feeling soft and youthful looking, and any Mother would be thankful to add it to her skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> Closest thing to a miracle cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. In love!</li>
            <li> Just ok product is greasy at first then dries for the day</li>
            <li> During these winter months my face has become dry and dull. When I use moisturizers, it leaves my face with a greasy look and I begin to break out. So I&#x27;m between a rock a hard space. I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try a new moisturizer in exchange for my honest opinion in hopes of it working for me. Upon opening Live Ultimate&#x27;s Night Cream, I first noticed the gorgeous design of the container. It&#x27;s a fancy chrome look that makes it look like an expensive product. I was excited to dig in and give this product a try. I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer under my makeup every day and at night before bed. The moisturizer is very thick and creamy. It applies like a thick moisturizer and soaks into your skin quickly. It does not leave a greasy look and your foundation applies over it smoothly. It gives your skin a smooth appearance and leaves it moisturized all day. I&#x27;ve even noticed a reduction in my eye wrinkles. I have not experienced any breakouts. I&#x27;ve even been using this on my hands and cuticles too. It appears that this jar will last a very long time because it doesn&#x27;t take much. I really love this moisturizer and I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This has a funky smell....sort of like sour coffee, but it works good.</li>
