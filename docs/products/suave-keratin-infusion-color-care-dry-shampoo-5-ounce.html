    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>stuff is best when applied at night and let to soak all night.</li>
            <li>All in all an excellent product!</li>
            <li>Perfect for camping trips too.</li>
            <li>My hair looks best if I wash it every day, but sometimes I push it and go two days between washings.  </li>
            <li>Good price point!</li>
            <li>Smells great as well.</li>
            <li>Still, for the price it is a great product to have on hand.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>So I was happy to try this out.  </li>
            <li>Assuming you can tolerate the scent I would still give it a try it is very handy when you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>I loved the way my hair felt after using this</li>
            <li>this was quite surprising.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does a good job of cleansing my hair.</li>
            <li>34;too good to be true&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some good experiences with Suave products</li>
            <li>It took a bit, but it sucked up a good amount of the oil.</li>
            <li>is supposed to be good for color treated hair and the keratin &amp;#34;infusion&amp;#34; can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Fragrance wise, the smell is fair.</li>
            <li>Starts with a great scent, and it blends very easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been especially useful for the kids.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t expect it it&#x27;ll be a nice bonus if it does protect my color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this out on my own hair and also on my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, and there was no flaky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a product I would buy often but something nice to have on hand in case of hair emergencies.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance that is not too strong.</li>
            <li>This dray shampoo is good in a pinch but it leaves a strong aroma when you spray it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>But the end result is good; my hair looks clean and lifted.</li>
            <li>I think it did a good job of reducing the oily appearance and giving my hair a clean look.</li>
            <li>I used a very light spray at about 12 inches.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good for a quick fix when your roots are just too oily to run out of the house.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>The smells were just overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well and there are many scents to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair tends to get greasy at the roots if it hasn&#x27;t been washed in more than about 36 hours.</li>
            <li>OK, so I&#x27;m too close</li>
            <li>It made her hair about 80% better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one drawback is when spraying this, the fragrance is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>(though I think the got2be shampoo is slightly better).</li>
            <li>It might work better on lighter hair where the grayish residue would not be as noticeable.</li>
            <li>Not as good as it does right after a shower,</li>
            <li>Not the greatest dry shampoo in history.</li>
            <li>Suave&#x27;s dry shampoo is perfect for those days.  </li>
            <li>important to follow the directions:&lt;br /&gt;Shake can before &amp; during use.&lt;br /&gt;Spray on lifted sections where hair is most oily.&lt;br /&gt;Massage through roots to absorb oil</li>
            <li>I just sprayed it on the roots, gave my  hair a good brushing, and was ready to head out the door.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like about this product is the strong scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as though you will be smelling like baby powder all day, but the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>it smelled if you&#x27;re bothered by strong scents you may not like it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not as strong as  their &amp;#34;Morrocan Infusion&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is strong and chemical... I have to hold my breath while I&#x27;m spraying and walk out of the room for a minute</li>
            <li>The spray is strong and so is the smell until it disperses.</li>
            <li>They love using this between hair washes to keep their hair clean and oil free.</li>
            <li>But I tried it on my daughter to see how it worked on light brown hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>like the scent -it is clean and citrusy.</li>
            <li>I have tried some that really were lovely.</li>
            <li>I tried Big Sexy Hair and Oscar Blandi and liked both, but tested out budget-friendly Tresemme and found it did a great job for a lot less.</li>
            <li>The scent smells clean and fresh (but not overpowering), there is no powdery residue left and it does a great job of absorbing oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is pretty interesting product and would be really helpful for those days when your hair is in need of a shower</li>
            <li>It also helped with hairline perspiration during stressful times or hot weather!  </li>
            <li>from my wife&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;I have tried multiple brands of dry shampoo and have yet to be greatly impressed with any of them, this one included.</li>
            <li>So I thought this would be a great place to save a little money.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of the oil and makes the hair look fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones as far as how my hair looks</li>
            <li>The end result was worth it.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The spray and odor are absolutely worth it for the end result.</li>
            <li>But nope, I don&#x27;t feel I have a freshly washed hair.  </li>
            <li>one thing I noticed was that the scent was more overpowering than I like since I am sensitive to scents - thus</li>
            <li>This is by far the best drug store dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I tried higher priced ones first ($20.00 per can) and didn&#x27;t feel like it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a bit more time to use than I typically give to my hair (I&#x27;m a wash towel dry and pin back kind of gal)  -- for regular use it would not be for me however I can see it as being a great asset for traveling when not having easy access to showering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used higher end dry shampoos and this one holds its own at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Since I used a very light spray and I have short hair, I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For most people, a dry shampoo is not something they&#x27;ll use every day but for certain special situations.</li>
            <li>First, the warning labels against inhalation, fumes etc are on target - in all seriousness, if you have asthma or breathing/lung problems, I&#x27;d avoid this like the plague.</li>
            <li>Great product quality ingredients long lasting</li>
            <li>just pretty darn close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our first use came during a power outage and having a well</li>
            <li>Busy working moms and people on the go will love this, as I did, because there are times we have to get ready to go fast, and don&#x27;t have time to rewash and restyle our hair.  </li>
            <li>this product is okay in an emergency, but I don’t think I would use it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>Seeing good reviews on Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo (yellow &amp; silver/white can), I tried that next and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>It worked great, smelled nice, gave me a little lift at the crown &amp; roots, and let me hold a little volume without too much hairspray.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong for my taste but dissipates quickly and is a minor gripe.</li>
            <li>Strong enough that it could at first compete with your perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo smells amazing, and left my hair full of body.</li>
            <li>Suave products, in general, are very economical and work well.</li>
            <li>love dry shampoo and use it to extend my blowouts.</li>
            <li>but I do love all the Suave Dry Shampoo products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>So your hair doesn&#x27;t actually smell as strong as the air does when your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some people after a surgery can&#x27;t get ceratin areas wet and a dry shampoo is a great idea for those situations also.</li>
            <li>This Suave dry shampoo is completely different (in a good way).</li>
            <li>and I was ready to go.</li>
            <li>I just wish the scent didn&#x27;t disagree with me so much.</li>
            <li>this is absolutely the case.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m probably getting too much product on my hair</li>
            <li>So any oil build up in her hair really shows up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It sprays on and has an odor much like the cleaning duster spray cans for my keyboard.</li>
            <li>Also, I lean my head over and apply some to the underneath of my hair and brush that out very well</li>
            <li>I think I had just too much stuff in my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell that much as it just like applying a hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product a lot because it doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue after you spray it on, but my only issue was that it took care of some, but not all the oil at my roots.  </li>
            <li>The product is effective, results are long lasting, and like I said the price really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I would love to have the time to wash my hair daily, but I barely have time to jump in and out of the shower</li>
            <li>and she has to wash her hair every single day with a strong clarifying shampoo, or else her hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for a while.</li>
            <li>but still it was frustrating because it is such a great product, if only it was more invisible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised at how easily this sprayed in and brushed out of my hair.</li>
            <li>However the fragrance gets more into the air and less into the hair.</li>
            <li>When regular Keratin Infusion was out of stock, I got the Color Care version with same results - love it.  </li>
            <li>When I brushed my hair it was fuller and actually looked better than when I have shampooed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just present, although it does dissapate after awhile.</li>
            <li>Compared to other dry shampoo sprays, this is lightly scented and doesn&#x27;t gag us while using it and does not leave a strong scent to bother us during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it looks gray/white, then you massage it in a little with your hands and comb it through and the whiteness goes away (mostly).</li>
            <li>Washing every day is time consuming, so I was excited to try out this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>(I had smoothing cream, gel, mousse and hairspray...not my normal routine).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous dry shampoos and my three biggest complaints with many of them</li>
            <li>I liked how this smelled and how lightweight it was, but I would say my hair looked only slightly less greasy</li>
            <li>I personally like the smell of Pantene&#x27;s dry shampoo a bit more.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, I have grey hair.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo, like the other Suave dry shampoo products, works great for a one day touch up when you can&#x27;t shampoo.</li>
            <li>works in very well, the key seems to be to really brush it in.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length and naturally oily, particularly if I missed a day or two of not washing it.  </li>
            <li>I have waist length long hair so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying dry shampoo, and I really do like this product.  </li>
            <li>not sure how much more the keratin helped my hair, but I don&#x27;t mind having it in there.</li>
            <li>No way does this in any way comes anywhere near what a normal wash does.  </li>
            <li>have for us busy folks!</li>
            <li>It is easy to brush out and gives my hair a little texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Strike 1 - avoid if you have allergies, asthma or lung/breathing issues, chemical sensitivities or are generally sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>My hair just needs washed to make it light and fluffy again.</li>
            <li>it really helps second day hair.  </li>
            <li>I put it on my hairbrush, rather than on the roots directly, so that I didn&#x27;t get that powdery or grainy head</li>
            <li>and when I lift it back, it really seems to add</li>
            <li>I ended up having to use a lot more than I have of other brands to fluff up the greasies.</li>
            <li>was my first experience with a dry shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Oily</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried these types of products in the past, but they have all been so strongly scented.  </li>
            <li>Her hair looked like it had been doused in cooking oil, but this spray made her hair fluffy and looked clean.</li>
            <li>The whole point of dry shampoo is to absorb excess oil on days</li>
            <li>you are looking for a dry shampoo, I would recommend trying this if you don&#x27;t mind the scent or wear too much perfume.</li>
            <li>Seriously, SAME OR BETTER as the $10-20 brands, at least for me &amp; my stick-straight, lifeless hair that needs product just to hold a style or a clip.</li>
            <li>I wash my color treated hair every other day and on the day that I don&#x27;t wash, my roots tend to be pretty oily.</li>
            <li>only time I&#x27;ve had trouble with it was the day after I had used ALOT of styling products for a special occasion.  </li>
            <li>I put this on and it instantly remove the oily appearance specially near the roots.  </li>
            <li>I can see this item coming in handy when the water supply is off, on camping trips, when you are not feeling well or whenever it is difficult to get in a shower and wash your hair.  </li>
            <li>And people with certain dry skin problems may wish to skip a shower occasionally also</li>
            <li>High quality dry shampoos can break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used dry shampoo since I was in high school</li>
            <li>you have to experiment a bit to find the right amount to spray before your hair looks too dried</li>
            <li>I was looking for a dry shampoo that would work when I needed a quick fix and couldn&#x27;t run outside with wet</li>
            <li>If the powder doesn&#x27;t absorb completely, it makes it look like you have a lot of grey hair.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo has an extremely strong and unpleasant odor to me and it doesn&#x27;t really fade much after it dries.</li>
            <li>A few spritz of this and the oil is toned down and her hair gets is nice and fluffy again.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> like the scent -it is clean and citrusy.</li>
            <li> I have tried some that really were lovely.</li>
            <li> I tried Big Sexy Hair and Oscar Blandi and liked both, but tested out budget-friendly Tresemme and found it did a great job for a lot less.</li>
            <li> The scent smells clean and fresh (but not overpowering), there is no powdery residue left and it does a great job of absorbing oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is pretty interesting product and would be really helpful for those days when your hair is in need of a shower</li>
            <li> It also helped with hairline perspiration during stressful times or hot weather!  </li>
            <li> from my wife&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;I have tried multiple brands of dry shampoo and have yet to be greatly impressed with any of them, this one included.</li>
            <li> So I thought this would be a great place to save a little money.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the oil and makes the hair look fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the better ones as far as how my hair looks</li>
            <li> The end result was worth it.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The spray and odor are absolutely worth it for the end result.</li>
            <li> But nope, I don&#x27;t feel I have a freshly washed hair.  </li>
            <li> one thing I noticed was that the scent was more overpowering than I like since I am sensitive to scents - thus</li>
            <li> This is by far the best drug store dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried higher priced ones first ($20.00 per can) and didn&#x27;t feel like it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a bit more time to use than I typically give to my hair (I&#x27;m a wash towel dry and pin back kind of gal)  -- for regular use it would not be for me however I can see it as being a great asset for traveling when not having easy access to showering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used higher end dry shampoos and this one holds its own at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Since I used a very light spray and I have short hair, I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For most people, a dry shampoo is not something they&#x27;ll use every day but for certain special situations.</li>
            <li> First, the warning labels against inhalation, fumes etc are on target - in all seriousness, if you have asthma or breathing/lung problems, I&#x27;d avoid this like the plague.</li>
            <li> Great product quality ingredients long lasting</li>
            <li> just pretty darn close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our first use came during a power outage and having a well</li>
            <li> Busy working moms and people on the go will love this, as I did, because there are times we have to get ready to go fast, and don&#x27;t have time to rewash and restyle our hair.  </li>
            <li> this product is okay in an emergency, but I don’t think I would use it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> Seeing good reviews on Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo (yellow &amp; silver/white can), I tried that next and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> It worked great, smelled nice, gave me a little lift at the crown &amp; roots, and let me hold a little volume without too much hairspray.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong for my taste but dissipates quickly and is a minor gripe.</li>
            <li> Strong enough that it could at first compete with your perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo smells amazing, and left my hair full of body.</li>
            <li> Suave products, in general, are very economical and work well.</li>
            <li> love dry shampoo and use it to extend my blowouts.</li>
            <li> but I do love all the Suave Dry Shampoo products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> So your hair doesn&#x27;t actually smell as strong as the air does when your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some people after a surgery can&#x27;t get ceratin areas wet and a dry shampoo is a great idea for those situations also.</li>
            <li> This Suave dry shampoo is completely different (in a good way).</li>
            <li> and I was ready to go.</li>
            <li> I just wish the scent didn&#x27;t disagree with me so much.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely the case.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m probably getting too much product on my hair</li>
            <li> So any oil build up in her hair really shows up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It sprays on and has an odor much like the cleaning duster spray cans for my keyboard.</li>
            <li> Also, I lean my head over and apply some to the underneath of my hair and brush that out very well</li>
            <li> I think I had just too much stuff in my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell that much as it just like applying a hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot because it doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue after you spray it on, but my only issue was that it took care of some, but not all the oil at my roots.  </li>
            <li> The product is effective, results are long lasting, and like I said the price really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I would love to have the time to wash my hair daily, but I barely have time to jump in and out of the shower</li>
            <li> and she has to wash her hair every single day with a strong clarifying shampoo, or else her hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for a while.</li>
            <li> but still it was frustrating because it is such a great product, if only it was more invisible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised at how easily this sprayed in and brushed out of my hair.</li>
            <li> However the fragrance gets more into the air and less into the hair.</li>
            <li> When regular Keratin Infusion was out of stock, I got the Color Care version with same results - love it.  </li>
            <li> When I brushed my hair it was fuller and actually looked better than when I have shampooed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just present, although it does dissapate after awhile.</li>
            <li> Compared to other dry shampoo sprays, this is lightly scented and doesn&#x27;t gag us while using it and does not leave a strong scent to bother us during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it looks gray/white, then you massage it in a little with your hands and comb it through and the whiteness goes away (mostly).</li>
            <li> Washing every day is time consuming, so I was excited to try out this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> (I had smoothing cream, gel, mousse and hairspray...not my normal routine).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous dry shampoos and my three biggest complaints with many of them</li>
            <li> I liked how this smelled and how lightweight it was, but I would say my hair looked only slightly less greasy</li>
            <li> I personally like the smell of Pantene&#x27;s dry shampoo a bit more.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, I have grey hair.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo, like the other Suave dry shampoo products, works great for a one day touch up when you can&#x27;t shampoo.</li>
            <li> works in very well, the key seems to be to really brush it in.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and naturally oily, particularly if I missed a day or two of not washing it.  </li>
            <li> I have waist length long hair so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying dry shampoo, and I really do like this product.  </li>
            <li> not sure how much more the keratin helped my hair, but I don&#x27;t mind having it in there.</li>
            <li> No way does this in any way comes anywhere near what a normal wash does.  </li>
            <li> have for us busy folks!</li>
            <li> It is easy to brush out and gives my hair a little texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strike 1 - avoid if you have allergies, asthma or lung/breathing issues, chemical sensitivities or are generally sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> My hair just needs washed to make it light and fluffy again.</li>
            <li> it really helps second day hair.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my hairbrush, rather than on the roots directly, so that I didn&#x27;t get that powdery or grainy head</li>
            <li> and when I lift it back, it really seems to add</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use a lot more than I have of other brands to fluff up the greasies.</li>
            <li> was my first experience with a dry shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Oily</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried these types of products in the past, but they have all been so strongly scented.  </li>
            <li> Her hair looked like it had been doused in cooking oil, but this spray made her hair fluffy and looked clean.</li>
            <li> The whole point of dry shampoo is to absorb excess oil on days</li>
            <li> you are looking for a dry shampoo, I would recommend trying this if you don&#x27;t mind the scent or wear too much perfume.</li>
            <li> Seriously, SAME OR BETTER as the $10-20 brands, at least for me &amp; my stick-straight, lifeless hair that needs product just to hold a style or a clip.</li>
            <li> I wash my color treated hair every other day and on the day that I don&#x27;t wash, my roots tend to be pretty oily.</li>
            <li> only time I&#x27;ve had trouble with it was the day after I had used ALOT of styling products for a special occasion.  </li>
            <li> I put this on and it instantly remove the oily appearance specially near the roots.  </li>
            <li> I can see this item coming in handy when the water supply is off, on camping trips, when you are not feeling well or whenever it is difficult to get in a shower and wash your hair.  </li>
            <li> And people with certain dry skin problems may wish to skip a shower occasionally also</li>
            <li> High quality dry shampoos can break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used dry shampoo since I was in high school</li>
            <li> you have to experiment a bit to find the right amount to spray before your hair looks too dried</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dry shampoo that would work when I needed a quick fix and couldn&#x27;t run outside with wet</li>
            <li> If the powder doesn&#x27;t absorb completely, it makes it look like you have a lot of grey hair.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo has an extremely strong and unpleasant odor to me and it doesn&#x27;t really fade much after it dries.</li>
            <li> A few spritz of this and the oil is toned down and her hair gets is nice and fluffy again.</li>
            <li> I have fairly short chemically treated/colored hair if you have long similarly treated hair you wont get much use from this little bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used a dry shampoo spray to give my fine, limp hair a little &amp;#34;zhuzh&amp;#34; at the roots.  </li>
            <li> But every now and then, that just isn&#x27;t possible, so I&#x27;ve turned to dry shampoos in recent years for these off-days.</li>
            <li> build up happens quick with my hair yet daily washing just seems to make it worse</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strike 2 - avoid if you have long hair - it will leave hair totally lifeless and force you to urgently shampoo before having to go anywhere&lt;</li>
            <li> was also surprised that it did not overly weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> but I did not notice a difference with the keratin versus a regular dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> With short hair that is colored pastel, I have to use dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is dyed and I felt this dry shampoo did not further fade my color.</li>
            <li> They are using the flat iron on their long hair and they don&#x27;t wash their hair every day.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how little powdery residue this product had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shampoo is easy to apply and it does indeed reduce the oiliness of my hair, but it gives my dark hair a slight ashy, dull look.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin fine</li>
            <li> It feels stiff and I am conscious about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oscar Blandi&#x27;s dry shampoo from Sephora for a long time...</li>
            <li> I have thin, dark hair that tends to get very oily near the roots.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo has a Keratin Infusion in it</li>
            <li> But the Suave dry shampoo was a disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> noticed no difference between this and the Morroccan infusion Dry Shampoo by Suave.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, color processed hair</li>
            <li> It could be that I just don&#x27;t get the dry shampoo thing.  </li>
            <li> so I think the idea of a dry shampoo is one that will have a market.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The spray leaves my hair feeling incredibly dry and processed.  </li>
            <li> The dry spray on &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; absorbs oils to refresh your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo while it does remove some of the hair oils, has a lot of aroma/smell/scent.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind it, the quality is about on par with got2be dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I am on the fence on this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Mine is 50 year old (ie dry) thick, curly Irish hair.</li>
            <li> so on days when time is limited this is a product I can go to.</li>
            <li> I will go back to the regular Keratin Infusion once this runs low - at least until I get my hair colored again -</li>
            <li> So your color should hopefully last longer and your hair will be less damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it didn&#x27;t solve the problem like some more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used in the past have done.</li>
            <li> Her hair has such oil problems she almost needs a shower half way through the day.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions on the can and brushed my hair thoroughly after application, but even with all the brushing my hair still looks slightly grayish.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re giving you keratin in with the dry shampoo, so it&#x27;s something a little extra for your dollar.</li>
            <li> After a few “dry shampoos” I have mixed feelings.  </li>
            <li> Since there is a lot of gray there I have used baby powder before and some other dry shampoos, so it was with some skepticism that I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to transition to shampooing my hair every other day (it&#x27;s gotten really dry and brittle).</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised with Suave products lately.</li>
            <li> If you have hair like mine that becomes unmanageable, frizzy, and harder to style after a couple days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a small extra treat with the dry shampoo I&#x27;m already applying.</li>
            <li> is that later it makes my hair feel stiff.  </li>
            <li> the other Suave dry shampoo products I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found their nozzle always clogged or broke (even running under hot water did not work)</li>
            <li> the powdery residue they leave behind 2) unpleasant scents and 3) not absorbing oil effectively.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I have short thick hair.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly to cut down on visible powder in your hair.</li>
            <li> it put the can on the sink, bend down so that the nozzle points towards my hair, and then use both hands to press the button and out comes the product.  </li>
            <li> Her hair gets a greasy look all the way down to the tips.</li>
            <li> That way you have less shampoos, less blow drys, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see a less toxic formulation and then I&#x27;d recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> It still leaves it a little matte...</li>
            <li> It does give your hair a renewed look, but for me feels a bit artificial like too much hair spray.</li>
            <li> and I try to stay away from harsh products.</li>
            <li> Washing everyday just isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> I plan to get a few cans to keep on hand for my daughter.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 8 inches below my shoulders and there are times when my hairline is oily and it just has not been feasible to wash my hair, especially when I was recovering from a broken ankle.</li>
            <li> Well, nothing could have prepared me for THIS mess!</li>
            <li> If you are like me and get migraines with too much perfume, this dry shampoo can get annoying during application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on, scrunched and arranged my hair to suit me then waited until it dried and sprayed just a small amount of hair spray</li>
            <li> And strangely, the ashy looks seem to get worse as the day progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m not sure if this was just me or not but ewwww.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling oily and dirty</li>
            <li> so I ended up throwing out at least 1/2 a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Hours later I&#x27;m still getting whiffs of it and quite frankly, it&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> I was shocked actually.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s very difficult to spray and impossible to do one-handed.  </li>
            <li> preferred dry shampoo is drybar which is very expensive at $20 a pop</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than no shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sort of feel nauseated by it to the point where I needed to go wash my hair.</li>
            <li> but it does nothing but make my hair feel and look even worse.  </li>
            <li> She has thin hair</li>
            <li> It put a thin layer of powder like coating on some parts but it immediately disappear once I start combing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it became difficult to find, I switched to the Suave Infusions Keratin.  </li>
            <li> and it is awkward.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Then I tried lower priced versions (hated your smell,  Tresseme) .</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> This is laden with toxic inhalation chemicals of the worst sort.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the product. Definitely does the job. Smells great as well. I always buy 2, one for home and one for work. Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> from my wife&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;I have tried multiple brands of dry shampoo and have yet to be greatly impressed with any of them, this one included. This dry shampoo has a Keratin Infusion in it but I did not notice a difference with the keratin versus a regular dry shampoo. The bottle says that the keratin will help keep your color longer. The whole point of dry shampoo is to absorb excess oil on days you haven&#x27;t washed your hair. That way you have less shampoos, less blow drys, etc. So your color should hopefully last longer and your hair will be less damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how much more the keratin helped my hair, but I don&#x27;t mind having it in there. It&#x27;s like getting a small extra treat with the dry shampoo I&#x27;m already applying. I didn&#x27;t have any white streaks in my hair from using this. But I did vigorously shake the can before and in between sprays as instructed. What I don&#x27;t like about this product is the strong scent. It isn&#x27;t an unpleasant scent. It&#x27;s not as though you will be smelling like baby powder all day, but the smell is strong. Strong enough that it could at first compete with your perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a dry shampoo, I would recommend trying this if you don&#x27;t mind the scent or wear too much perfume. They&#x27;re giving you keratin in with the dry shampoo, so it&#x27;s something a little extra for your dollar.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Left my hair feeling oily and dirty</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo smells amazing, and left my hair full of body. I loved the way my hair felt after using this and it made my hair easier to style. The only problem is, no matter how much I brushed, shook, fluffed, and even wiped my hair, there was a white residue that was really obvious in my hair. For being a product geared towards color care this was quite surprising. My hair color was changed just by using the product! Granted it did wash out but still it was frustrating because it is such a great product, if only it was more invisible. Still, for the price it is a great product to have on hand. Use sparingly to cut down on visible powder in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised with Suave products lately. I have tried some that really were lovely. This isn&#x27;t one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love dry shampoo and use it to extend my blowouts. I have tried several brands and found almost all to work well. So I thought this would be a great place to save a little money. But the Suave dry shampoo was a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no difference between this and the Morroccan infusion Dry Shampoo by Suave.  They were both abysmal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it in and got no benefit. I ended up having to use a lot more than I have of other brands to fluff up the greasies. Then the white powder clumped and flaked everywhere. No amount of brushing would distribute it or lighten it. Luckily for me, I have grey hair. But I tried it on my daughter to see how it worked on light brown hair. You could totally see it. I could not brush it away.</li>
            <li> I wash my color treated hair every other day and on the day that I don&#x27;t wash, my roots tend to be pretty oily. I&#x27;ve tried numerous dry shampoos and my three biggest complaints with many of them are 1) the powdery residue they leave behind 2) unpleasant scents and 3) not absorbing oil effectively. This Suave dry shampoo is completely different (in a good way). The scent smells clean and fresh (but not overpowering), there is no powdery residue left and it does a great job of absorbing oil. After I spray my roots, I rub it  in with my fingers and it gives my roots lift and volume. This is by far the best drug store dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have waist length long hair so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a dry shampoo. Well, nothing could have prepared me for THIS mess! First, the warning labels against inhalation, fumes etc are on target - in all seriousness, if you have asthma or breathing/lung problems, I&#x27;d avoid this like the plague. Next, it leaves hair lifeless. Nothing like 3 feet of blah hanging on your head. It&#x27;s worse than no shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strike 1 - avoid if you have allergies, asthma or lung/breathing issues, chemical sensitivities or are generally sensitive to chemicals. This is laden with toxic inhalation chemicals of the worst sort.&lt;br /&gt;Strike 2 - avoid if you have long hair - it will leave hair totally lifeless and force you to urgently shampoo before having to go anywhere&lt;br /&gt;Strike 3 - the smell. Seriously, I&#x27;m not sure if this was just me or not but ewwww. I would NOT call this a fragrance but rather &#x27;fumes&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have dry, color processed hair and I try to stay away from harsh products. I like that this shampoo is made especially for color treated hair. This shampoo does a good job of cleansing my hair. It rinses well. It has a pleasant fragrance that is not too strong. Suave products, in general, are very economical and work well.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo.  We&#x27;ve tried these types of products in the past, but they have all been so strongly scented.  The smells were just overwhelming.  Compared to other dry shampoo sprays, this is lightly scented and doesn&#x27;t gag us while using it and does not leave a strong scent to bother us during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does what it says it will do.  It gets rid of the oil and makes the hair look fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been especially useful for the kids.  They are using the flat iron on their long hair and they don&#x27;t wash their hair every day.  They love using this between hair washes to keep their hair clean and oil free.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first experience with a dry shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Oily build up happens quick with my hair yet daily washing just seems to make it worse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how little powdery residue this product had.&lt;br /&gt;I was also surprised that it did not overly weigh my hair down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a bit more time to use than I typically give to my hair (I&#x27;m a wash towel dry and pin back kind of gal)  -- for regular use it would not be for me however I can see it as being a great asset for traveling when not having easy access to showering.</li>
            <li> I have fairly short chemically treated/colored hair if you have long similarly treated hair you wont get much use from this little bottle. This wasn&#x27;t great it smelled if you&#x27;re bothered by strong scents you may not like it. It does give your hair a renewed look, but for me feels a bit artificial like too much hair spray. Assuming you can tolerate the scent I would still give it a try it is very handy when you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest dry shampoo in history. However with the very low price and it does work quite well, makes this a total hit. With short hair that is colored pastel, I have to use dry shampoo. Washing everyday just isn&#x27;t an option. High quality dry shampoos can break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is best when applied at night and let to soak all night. Or else it can leave hair a bit white or chalky.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo has an extremely strong and unpleasant odor to me and it doesn&#x27;t really fade much after it dries. Hours later I&#x27;m still getting whiffs of it and quite frankly, it&#x27;s so bad I sort of feel nauseated by it to the point where I needed to go wash my hair. I prefer the Batiste brand. It works just as well and there are many scents to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did work for me. I sprayed it on, scrunched and arranged my hair to suit me then waited until it dried and sprayed just a small amount of hair spray and I was ready to go. I just wish the scent didn&#x27;t disagree with me so much.</li>
            <li> Suave products are a mixed bag for me. The price can&#x27;t be beat, landing this brand into the &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; category and with some of their products this is absolutely the case. This is not the case with this product. I&#x27;ve used higher end dry shampoos and this one holds its own at a fraction of the cost. The smell is a bit strong for my taste but dissipates quickly and is a minor gripe. The product is effective, results are long lasting, and like I said the price really can&#x27;t be beat. All in all an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot because it doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue after you spray it on, but my only issue was that it took care of some, but not all the oil at my roots.  My hair tends to get greasy at the roots if it hasn&#x27;t been washed in more than about 36 hours. I liked how this smelled and how lightweight it was, but I would say my hair looked only slightly less greasy - it didn&#x27;t solve the problem like some more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used in the past have done.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used a dry shampoo spray to give my fine, limp hair a little &amp;#34;zhuzh&amp;#34; at the roots.  I tried Big Sexy Hair and Oscar Blandi and liked both, but tested out budget-friendly Tresemme and found it did a great job for a lot less. Unfortunately, I found their nozzle always clogged or broke (even running under hot water did not work) so I ended up throwing out at least 1/2 a bottle.  Seeing good reviews on Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo (yellow &amp; silver/white can), I tried that next and really liked it.  When it became difficult to find, I switched to the Suave Infusions Keratin.  It worked great, smelled nice, gave me a little lift at the crown &amp; roots, and let me hold a little volume without too much hairspray.  It also helped with hairline perspiration during stressful times or hot weather!  When regular Keratin Infusion was out of stock, I got the Color Care version with same results - love it.  I will go back to the regular Keratin Infusion once this runs low - at least until I get my hair colored again - but I do love all the Suave Dry Shampoo products I have tried.  Seriously, SAME OR BETTER as the $10-20 brands, at least for me &amp; my stick-straight, lifeless hair that needs product just to hold a style or a clip.</li>
            <li> Great product quality ingredients long lasting</li>
            <li> I tried higher priced ones first ($20.00 per can) and didn&#x27;t feel like it was worth the price. Then I tried lower priced versions (hated your smell,  Tresseme) . I&#x27;ve had some good experiences with Suave products so I gave this a chance.&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent -it is clean and citrusy. It is easy to brush out and gives my hair a little texture. I do like it, but I&#x27;m not counting on it to maintain my dye job. Keratin is the last ingredient and seemingly the only difference between the color care and regular versions. Since I don&#x27;t expect it it&#x27;ll be a nice bonus if it does protect my color.</li>
            <li> It could be that I just don&#x27;t get the dry shampoo thing.  First of all, it&#x27;s very difficult to spray and impossible to do one-handed.  So all i can do it put the can on the sink, bend down so that the nozzle points towards my hair, and then use both hands to press the button and out comes the product.  OK, so I&#x27;m too close and I&#x27;m probably getting too much product on my hair but it does nothing but make my hair feel and look even worse.  No way does this in any way comes anywhere near what a normal wash does.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo, like the other Suave dry shampoo products, works great for a one day touch up when you can&#x27;t shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t leave white residue if&lt;br /&gt;used as recommended, but it does have&lt;br /&gt;some fragrance . It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just present, although it does dissapate after awhile. The fragrance is not as strong as  their &amp;#34;Morrocan Infusion&amp;#34; product. I&lt;br /&gt;have not noticed any difference in my hair&lt;br /&gt;from the &amp;#34;Keratin Infusion&amp;#34; in comparison&lt;br /&gt;with the other Suave dry shampoo products I&#x27;ve used previously. Good price point! Will likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this out on my own hair and also on my daughter&#x27;s. My hair has been bleached blonde, so I tend to not have issues with oily hair. My hair just needs washed to make it light and fluffy again. My daughter however is another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s 13 and she has to wash her hair every single day with a strong clarifying shampoo, or else her hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for a while. She has thin hair and it&#x27;s a medium brown color. So any oil build up in her hair really shows up. She doesn&#x27;t just get oily hair at the roots. Her hair gets a greasy look all the way down to the tips. So if there was any test for a product, her hair would be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She washed her hair Thursday before school, and then there was no school on Friday. So she skipped her Friday shower and on Saturday I sprayed this Suave spray into her hair to see how well it would work. It took a bit, but it sucked up a good amount of the oil. It made her hair about 80% better. I was shocked actually. Her hair looked like it had been doused in cooking oil, but this spray made her hair fluffy and looked clean. Not as good as it does right after a shower, just pretty darn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback is when spraying this, the fragrance is overwhelming. It will fill the room. However the fragrance gets more into the air and less into the hair. So your hair doesn&#x27;t actually smell as strong as the air does when your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty interesting product and would be really helpful for those days when your hair is in need of a shower but you can&#x27;t get one. Perfect for camping trips too. I plan to get a few cans to keep on hand for my daughter. Her hair has such oil problems she almost needs a shower half way through the day. A few spritz of this and the oil is toned down and her hair gets is nice and fluffy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to dandruff in the winter and I have oily roots, so I have to wash my hair every day. But every now and then, that just isn&#x27;t possible, so I&#x27;ve turned to dry shampoos in recent years for these off-days. This is one of the better ones as far as how my hair looks afterwards-- you spray it, it looks gray/white, then you massage it in a little with your hands and comb it through and the whiteness goes away (mostly). It still leaves it a little matte... you have to experiment a bit to find the right amount to spray before your hair looks too dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is strong and chemical... I have to hold my breath while I&#x27;m spraying and walk out of the room for a minute so I don&#x27;t inhale all the fumes. But the end result is good; my hair looks clean and lifted. I&#x27;d like to see a less toxic formulation and then I&#x27;d recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> For most people, a dry shampoo is not something they&#x27;ll use every day but for certain special situations. Our first use came during a power outage and having a well, we get no water when  the power goes out. Some people after a surgery can&#x27;t get ceratin areas wet and a dry shampoo is a great idea for those situations also. And people with certain dry skin problems may wish to skip a shower occasionally also so I think the idea of a dry shampoo is one that will have a market.&lt;br /&gt;The Suave version does the job and people will like it for those cases when a shower or bath is not in order.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried Dry Shampoo.  I have to say that I am on the fence about it.  If it is sprayed too close to the roots it leaves a white film on your hair.  The concept is similar to powdering a wig (thing George Washington).  If the powder doesn&#x27;t absorb completely, it makes it look like you have a lot of grey hair.  The spray leaves my hair feeling incredibly dry and processed.  It is good for a quick fix when your roots are just too oily to run out of the house.  I would not use on a daily basis though.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying dry shampoo, and I really do like this product.  Busy working moms and people on the go will love this, as I did, because there are times we have to get ready to go fast, and don&#x27;t have time to rewash and restyle our hair.  Suave&#x27;s dry shampoo is perfect for those days.  I just sprayed it on the roots, gave my  hair a good brushing, and was ready to head out the door.  Nice fragrance, and there was no flaky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must have for us busy folks!</li>
            <li> Not just for oily hair. Mine is 50 year old (ie dry) thick, curly Irish hair. And it works to help style my hair the day after a wash and style, and the day after and the day after. I would love to have the time to wash my hair daily, but I barely have time to jump in and out of the shower so on days when time is limited this is a product I can go to. If you have hair like mine that becomes unmanageable, frizzy, and harder to style after a couple days and you don&#x27;t have time to wash it. The dry spray on &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; absorbs oils to refresh your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very important to follow the directions:&lt;br /&gt;Shake can before &amp; during use.&lt;br /&gt;Spray on lifted sections where hair is most oily.&lt;br /&gt;Massage through roots to absorb oil evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Brush out product and style.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 8 inches below my shoulders and there are times when my hairline is oily and it just has not been feasible to wash my hair, especially when I was recovering from a broken ankle. Since there is a lot of gray there I have used baby powder before and some other dry shampoos, so it was with some skepticism that I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sprays on and has an odor much like the cleaning duster spray cans for my keyboard. The odor disappeared after an hour. The spray is strong and so is the smell until it disperses. The end result was worth it. When I brushed my hair it was fuller and actually looked better than when I have shampooed it.&lt;br /&gt;The spray and odor are absolutely worth it for the end result.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used dry shampoo since I was in high school and though I have used and reviewed quite a few Suave hair products lately I have been underwhelmed by most of them so I was not expecting a lot from this item.  To my surprise it did a lot to perk up my lanky, looking like it needed to be washed hair.  I can see this item coming in handy when the water supply is off, on camping trips, when you are not feeling well or whenever it is difficult to get in a shower and wash your hair.  Not a product I would buy often but something nice to have on hand in case of hair emergencies.  And I like that is is supposed to be good for color treated hair and the keratin &amp;#34;infusion&amp;#34; can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> This dray shampoo is good in a pinch but it leaves a strong aroma when you spray it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preferred dry shampoo is drybar which is very expensive at $20 a pop so i thought about getting this cheaper alternative. This dry shampoo while it does remove some of the hair oils, has a lot of aroma/smell/scent. If you are like me and get migraines with too much perfume, this dry shampoo can get annoying during application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind it, the quality is about on par with got2be dry shampoo (though I think the got2be shampoo is slightly better). My hair is dyed and I felt this dry shampoo did not further fade my color.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dark hair that tends to get very oily near the roots.  My hair looks best if I wash it every day, but sometimes I push it and go two days between washings.  Washing every day is time consuming, so I was excited to try out this dry shampoo.  After a few “dry shampoos” I have mixed feelings.  The shampoo is easy to apply and it does indeed reduce the oiliness of my hair, but it gives my dark hair a slight ashy, dull look.  I followed the instructions on the can and brushed my hair thoroughly after application, but even with all the brushing my hair still looks slightly grayish.  And strangely, the ashy looks seem to get worse as the day progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this product is okay in an emergency, but I don’t think I would use it on a regular basis.  It might work better on lighter hair where the grayish residue would not be as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oscar Blandi&#x27;s dry shampoo from Sephora for a long time...it really helps second day hair.  So I was happy to try this out.  Starts with a great scent, and it blends very easily.  I put it on my hairbrush, rather than on the roots directly, so that I didn&#x27;t get that powdery or grainy head feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works in very well, the key seems to be to really brush it in.  Also, I lean my head over and apply some to the underneath of my hair and brush that out very well and when I lift it back, it really seems to add volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time I&#x27;ve had trouble with it was the day after I had used ALOT of styling products for a special occasion.  I think I had just too much stuff in my hair and this didn&#x27;t work as well (I had smoothing cream, gel, mousse and hairspray...not my normal routine).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to transition to shampooing my hair every other day (it&#x27;s gotten really dry and brittle). I&#x27;ve started using this on the days in between shampoos to help reduce some of the oily appearance. Fragrance wise, the smell is fair. I personally like the smell of Pantene&#x27;s dry shampoo a bit more. It was easy to apply. Just shake the bottle, spray your roots and then brush and style your hair. I think it did a good job of reducing the oily appearance and giving my hair a clean look.</li>
            <li> I am on the fence on this dry shampoo.  My hair is shoulder length and naturally oily, particularly if I missed a day or two of not washing it.  I put this on and it instantly remove the oily appearance specially near the roots.  It put a thin layer of powder like coating on some parts but it immediately disappear once I start combing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that later it makes my hair feel stiff.  Instead of feeling I washed my hair, it feels I am wearing a wig and it is awkward.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell that much as it just like applying a hair spray.  But nope, I don&#x27;t feel I have a freshly washed hair.  It feels stiff and I am conscious about it.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I have short thick hair. I was looking for a dry shampoo that would work when I needed a quick fix and couldn&#x27;t run outside with wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised at how easily this sprayed in and brushed out of my hair. I used a very light spray at about 12 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It easily brushed out of my hair and removed the excess oil that had accumulated. Since I used a very light spray and I have short hair, I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I noticed was that the scent was more overpowering than I like since I am sensitive to scents - thus the four star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A functional product, will keep it on hand for &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; use.</li>
