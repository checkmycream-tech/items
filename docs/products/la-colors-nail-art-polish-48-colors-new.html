            <li>I am a beginner &amp; have already done some amazing things.    </li>

            <li>We always take our own to the salon</li>
            <li>Application was very easy to control.  </li>
            <li>Plus I read that I would be able to choose my own colors.</li>
            <li>set I bought for my own nails, as I am starting classes on nail art designing, and this set is perfect for that.</li>

            <li>I am also just so pleased with this Amazon Store - MissPinkCat from whom I ordered this collection.</li>
            <li>So many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>Having all 250 bottles in tact and not have to debate contacting the seller would have been 100% better, But I guess things happen.</li>
            <li>Also make sure to finish this nail polish off with a topcoat.</li>
            <li>My niece love the nail polishes with the many colours.</li>
            <li>My daughters and I love to get our nails done with colored tips with a stripe.  </li>
            <li>so now we will have a lot more to choose from.  </li>
            <li>My wife used them and really enjoyed them</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this set.</li>
            <li>I am in love with LA Colors Art Deco .</li>
            <li>They are mostly opaque, so it makes doing designs really easy.</li>
            <li>First let me say i love doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Im happy :) Definitely  recommended!</li>
            <li>The hairs on the brush came out easy too.</li>
            <li>All arrived in perfect condition except one bottle leaked ever so slightly in the shipping.</li>
            <li>This product is a fantastic gift for anyone that loves to paint their nails.</li>
            <li>But some were really creamy and nice to use.</li>
            <li>Recently purchased these nail polishes and I am happy with them.</li>
            <li>Now I really don&#x27;t need all these colors, but they&#x27;re nice to have.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m completely happy with this.</li>
            <li>Lots of fantastic colors.....</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>I am only mentioning this because of how wonderful they handled the whole thing.</li>
            <li>to clean, trim, condition, polish and decorate.</li>
            <li>Thanks &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaging was okay , came in one package with four seprate bags in sets of twelve and each nail polish was wrapped in paper .</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a little girl very happy for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a great gift for any young girl, teenager or adult.</li>
            <li>It was super think and globed on when you tried to use.</li>
            <li>The packaged arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>But the opacity is great and the brushes are long enough to be able to make the designs faster.</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted!</li>
            <li>There is lots of fun to be had using this collection.</li>
            <li>this was well worth it.</li>
            <li>this will be so much fun.  </li>
            <li>One of my bottles came cracked open, but other than that they are great!</li>
            <li>there is no other site place out there that has all 48 colors at such a great price.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I ordered, and right after had sent my list of colors to Kolorize and asked that I get no duplicates..</li>
            <li>Ok so I was waiting to rate this because I was not sure what I was going to do with it to be honest..</li>
            <li>Recommend for anyone that wants to do their own nails and wants to change their color frequently.</li>
            <li>Miss Pink Cat sent these in under a weeks time - 48 great and fun colors, just a little more than $1 a bottle.  </li>
            <li>In a short time she wanted to change the color on her nails or she complained that the salon didn&#x27;t have great many colors of polish to pick from.  </li>
            <li>There are exactly 48 colors</li>
            <li>I received so many different colors...</li>
            <li>The full set that LA Colors offers is included in this set.</li>
            <li>The top must have been just slightly loose.</li>
            <li>no case or anything to really keep them all together looking pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But i really like this</li>
            <li>That very night they shipped out my package..</li>
            <li>The seller even gave several nail stickers for free.</li>
            <li>All the bottles were packed very well &amp; with care.</li>
            <li>, this is a wake up call for the store to be more careful when packing their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would personally stil get this product because it is the colors that i am wanting, none of the other stuff rates high on my list, and really does anyone get teh nail stickers to really work or look good and uniform?</li>
            <li>I plan to order a few more for gifts very soon!</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and arrived earlier than amazons estimated time (which is always the goal, right?).&lt;br /&gt;However,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this set, but please understand ahead of time that you don&#x27;t get the display case for the polishes.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new tracking number as well.</li>
            <li>live in Medellin, Colombia so besides wait for</li>
            <li>some were light, some were dark, I got pastels, and some with glitter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been collecting them for about two months but wasn&#x27;t able to find half the colors at my local Dollar Tree store</li>
            <li>Keep your money and steer clear.</li>
            <li>I bought this brand of nail polish that was a gift for my wife and she is a professional in the arrangement and decoration of nails.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it completely</li>
            <li>The nail polish can get really messy so make sure when you open the nail polish to wipe of the brush</li>
            <li>Each bottle has their own little mixing ball (like all other nail polishes) to mix the polish before you use it.</li>
            <li>They are just showing you all the colors, which is fine with me as I put all my polishes, including the ones that I got today, in a small plastic tub and paint the tops of each lid</li>
            <li>They apologized &amp; they had a new one in the mail to me the next day.</li>
            <li>general es un muy buen producto así que lo recomiendo completamente,</li>
            <li>I have a 17 year old that was constantly wanting to go to the salon to have her nails done.  </li>
            <li>LA Colors is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>The fact of giving only 3 stars is that of 48 glazes that brings the kit arrived damaged 5 colors, because the containers were not secure and should think more carefully pack enamels, hopefully separate 1 by 1 to prevent breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes are thin, for doing the nail art, but it was easy to cover my nails as well, easier even because I&#x27;m challenged not to get it all over my cuticles.  </li>

            <li> the polish was half full and extremly clumpy and that does not just happen it is at least a year old</li>
            <li> One bottle came broken, sucks too because it was a nice color.</li>
            <li> But I am Not too unhappy about it because technically it is only one bottle that broke and messed up 2 others that look like they are still ok to use.</li>
            <li> Not really that big of a deal-</li>
            <li> Some of them do dry out if not used in a while, but I would expect that from any nail polish.</li>
            <li> So i finally found one that was about half price</li>
            <li> although i dont mind, the little nail decorations it shows in the picture next to the polish did not come with teh packaged.</li>
            <li> So the polishes arent new which I expect that is what I paid for and at least 7 werent even closed!</li>
            <li> I had 3  or 4 bottles almost halfway empty.</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although i have never really given any other brand of nail art</li>
            <li> TO CHOOSE FROM ONLY ONE NEGATIVE (AND THATS MINOR)</li>
            <li> Disapponted in product, even more disappointed in the customer service (or should I say...</li>
            <li> They did not ask me to return the other.</li>
            <li> There are a few minor issues.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors were very thick like it was old polish.</li>
            <li> But the order took a very long while (approximately three weeks or so) to arrive, which was a big concern.</li>
            <li> The items were very carefully packaged in little bundles of 5 with bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li> it was limited to the 3 pack, but it was all dried up  so not sure if it was an over look</li>
            <li> Also some polishes looked watered down!</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this a 4 and not a 5 is because when I went through my package I came to the L.A. Colors and one of the 3 packs was broken..</li>
            <li> However, there is one bottle missing.</li>
            <li> I came across one that really made me mad</li>
            <li> The product arrived late and two nail polish bottles where broken, spilling and drying on six other polishes.</li>
            <li> the magenta bottle had some how broken and spilled all over the package and made a mess in the pack..</li>
            <li> but it was my hard earned money</li>
            <li> And some polishes are extremely thick beyond usage.</li>
            <li> I was lookin online for all the colors of the thin nail polishes</li>
            <li> The brushes are thin, and one or two of them were damaged.</li>
            <li> Also I got a broken nail polish</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my nail obsessed daughter.  </li>
            <li> thats really expensive.</li>
            <li> The sad thing is they packed them like that because there was no spillage in the box.</li>
            <li> a try i have yet to be disappointed with this brand of nail art polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought the Shany brand and was completely disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> but I was VERY disappointed because some of the bottles were USED!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the worst thing.</li>

            <li> Merchant has never replied to my email. Disapponted in product, even more disappointed in the customer service (or should I say...lack of) following my purchase. I will never purchase from this seller again. Keep your money and steer clear. I should have paid attention to the comments left by the others before me.</li>
            <li> First let me say i love doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;Love to clean, trim, condition, polish and decorate. (almost sounds like im doing my hair)&lt;br /&gt;Although i have never really given any other brand of nail art a try i have yet to be disappointed with this brand of nail art polish.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. It was shipped quickly and arrived earlier than amazons estimated time (which is always the goal, right?).&lt;br /&gt;However, although i dont mind, the little nail decorations it shows in the picture next to the polish did not come with teh packaged. The polish all came wrapped in bubble wrap almost individually. no case or anything to really keep them all together looking pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it, but incase ur expecting more i dont want it to be a surprise to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I would personally stil get this product because it is the colors that i am wanting, none of the other stuff rates high on my list, and really does anyone get teh nail stickers to really work or look good and uniform?</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and vibrant. I&#x27;m very happy with this product :) The packaging isn&#x27;t that great. One bottle came broken, sucks too because it was a nice color. Im pretty happy though with the purchase &amp; price. Art deco is a very good company. Came with about 6 packets of the nail sticker designs, which are very cute. Im happy :) Definitely  recommended!</li>
            <li> THE BEST NAIL ART POLISHES SOO MANY BEAUTIFUL SHADES OF COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM ONLY ONE NEGATIVE (AND THATS MINOR) NO BROWN HUES IN THEIR PALLETTE EVERYTHING ELSE IS SOOOO BOMB!!!! WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT TO DEATH SOOO MANY COLORS SHINEY, METALLIC, SPARKLY AND MATTE!!!! A++++++</li>
            <li> I have a 17 year old that was constantly wanting to go to the salon to have her nails done.  In a short time she wanted to change the color on her nails or she complained that the salon didn&#x27;t have great many colors of polish to pick from.  After getting this for her, she&#x27;s decided to do her nails at home and is constantly changing the color.  Is saving me lots of money.  Recommend for anyone that wants to do their own nails and wants to change their color frequently.</li>
            <li> The product is very good for the price! I use it in my nail designs! But the order took a very long while (approximately three weeks or so) to arrive, which was a big concern.</li>
            <li> I am so completely thrilled with this purchase! The full set that LA Colors offers is included in this set. There is a rainbow assortment of glossy colors, metallics, glitters, and shimmers.  I think this would be a great gift for any young girl, teenager or adult. There is lots of fun to be had using this collection. Just go to You Tube and type in Nail Tutorials &amp; you will be inspired from many creative nail art videos. I am a beginner &amp; have already done some amazing things.    I am also just so pleased with this Amazon Store - MissPinkCat from whom I ordered this collection. The items were very carefully packaged in little bundles of 5 with bubble wrap.  All arrived in perfect condition except one bottle leaked ever so slightly in the shipping. The top must have been just slightly loose. I contacted the company to let them know &amp; almost immediately I received a response via email. They apologized &amp; they had a new one in the mail to me the next day. They sent me a new tracking number as well. I received the replacement item quickly &amp; it was in perfect condition. They did not ask me to return the other. I am only mentioning this because of how wonderful they handled the whole thing. I  want to showcase the amazing customer service they provided me. They were superb!    Also, the price can&#x27;t be beat anywhere online! I did my research &amp; this is the best deal online...anywhere!  I hope MissPinkCat never stops selling this great collection!  I plan to order a few more for gifts very soon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my nail obsessed daughter.  She loved it! Each bottle of polish came wrapped and all the colors were there.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set from HollywoodGlam and I am really impressed with all the colors that came with it. All the colors came wrapped individually in brown paper and also in bubble wrap. It appears that some of the colors look the same, but if you look above the bar code of each of them, you will notice they are not all the same.&lt;br /&gt;This set I bought for my own nails, as I am starting classes on nail art designing, and this set is perfect for that. So many colors to choose from. I have always loved doing my own nails instead of paying someone to decorate them for me and this set is PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;It does not come with the display case or the designs that appear on the side of the picture. They are just showing you all the colors, which is fine with me as I put all my polishes, including the ones that I got today, in a small plastic tub and paint the tops of each lid so I know which ones are which. The designs, I assume, they are showing what CAN be done with your nails and with this set.&lt;br /&gt;These came before the deadline that Amazon gave me and in perfect condition! I highly recommend buying this set, but please understand ahead of time that you don&#x27;t get the display case for the polishes. The display cases you can purchase separately if you want something to display your nail polishes on. There are exactly 48 colors and I am very impressed with this.</li>
            <li> Miss Pink Cat sent these in under a weeks time - 48 great and fun colors, just a little more than $1 a bottle.  The quality is great.  They&#x27;re for a Christmas gift for my teenage daughters but I know I will be using them as well.  The brushes are thin, for doing the nail art, but it was easy to cover my nails as well, easier even because I&#x27;m challenged not to get it all over my cuticles.  Application was very easy to control.  This product is a fantastic gift for anyone that loves to paint their nails.</li>
            <li> I was lookin online for all the colors of the thin nail polishes and I came across one on a differnt website and they were charging omg like almost 80 bucks!!! I was like yeahhh right thats really expensive. So i finally found one that was about half price and It was a must. They have these sold at dollar stores, not all the colors i wanted so this was well worth it. And me especialy I love making designs with my nails maybe start my own nail thing at my home lol. But i really like this there is no other site place out there that has all 48 colors at such a great price. Thanks &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> The product arrived late and two nail polish bottles where broken, spilling and drying on six other polishes. The customer service team handled it well, I was impressed with their professionalism and concern for their customers. I&#x27;m giving them 5 stars for handling it so well.</li>
            <li> I received them in a timely fashion but I was VERY disappointed because some of the bottles were USED!!! I had 3  or 4 bottles almost halfway empty. The sad thing is they packed them like that because there was no spillage in the box. Some of the colors were very thick like it was old polish. I didn&#x27;t receive all the colors. I received duplicate color on 2 of the bottles. I know it was a bargain price for the set but it was my hard earned money and you want what you pay for!!! Won&#x27;t order this again!!!!</li>
            <li> A steal for the price</li>
            <li> Ok so I was waiting to rate this because I was not sure what I was going to do with it to be honest.. I chose to buy 2 sets of 100 from Kolorize because they were selling the L.A. Art deco polishes as well.. It was all in one place. Plus I read that I would be able to choose my own colors. So I did. I ordered, and right after had sent my list of colors to Kolorize and asked that I get no duplicates.. They were prompt in getting back to me and letting me know they got my requests.. That very night they shipped out my package.. I got it with all 200 colors and no duplicates at all they were all the colors i wanted. I was Extremely happy about that and they packed them in tiny square boxes and bubble wrapped the 200 from Kleancolor.. The only reason I am giving this a 4 and not a 5 is because when I went through my package I came to the L.A. Colors and one of the 3 packs was broken.. It had a Magenta a yellow and Blue in it and the magenta bottle had some how broken and spilled all over the package and made a mess in the pack.. it was limited to the 3 pack, but it was all dried up  so not sure if it was an over look or if it was the shipping because the art bottles were not bubble wrapped. Soo cant rally tell. I was thinking about msging Kolorize about it. But I am Not too unhappy about it because technically it is only one bottle that broke and messed up 2 others that look like they are still ok to use. So I guess out of 250 bottles and only one broke it&#x27;s not the worst thing. Having all 250 bottles in tact and not have to debate contacting the seller would have been 100% better, But I guess things happen.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know or can list the colors that are part of this set? Because There are about 93 colors of the art deco polish and this set only consists of 48.</li>
            <li> One of my bottles came cracked open, but other than that they are great! Some of them do dry out if not used in a while, but I would expect that from any nail polish. The brushes are thin, and one or two of them were damaged. All in all, great for the price.</li>
            <li> My package came the earliest date. When I was unwrapping the polishes it looked like some have been used. I came across one that really made me mad the polish was half full and extremly clumpy and that does not just happen it is at least a year old so that pisses me off that she would send a paying customer a polish like that. Also some polishes looked watered down! And some polishes are extremely thick beyond usage. So the polishes arent new which I expect that is what I paid for and at least 7 werent even closed! But some were really creamy and nice to use.</li>
            <li> I need this plc to call me i sent email...it came busted and not all items advetised in package</li>
            <li> Recently purchased these nail polishes and I am happy with them. There are a few minor issues. The nail polish can get really messy so make sure when you open the nail polish to wipe of the brush well so that it doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere. Also I got a broken nail polish and I did email them they asked for proof and I sent it. They replied they would contact me today and still nothing. Also make sure to finish this nail polish off with a topcoat. Otherwise it will peel. But the opacity is great and the brushes are long enough to be able to make the designs faster. Beautiful colors as well!</li>
            <li> My niece love the nail polishes with the many colours. Thanks for making a little girl very happy for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I bought the Shany brand and was completely disappointed in it. It was super think and globed on when you tried to use. The hairs on the brush came out easy too. LA Colors is the complete opposite. Now I really don&#x27;t need all these colors, but they&#x27;re nice to have. The nail polish is made well and goes on well too. Each bottle has their own little mixing ball (like all other nail polishes) to mix the polish before you use it. The Shany brand didn&#x27;t even have that.  Overall I&#x27;m completely happy with this. The seller even gave several nail stickers for free. They packaged each bottles in bubble wrap so I didn&#x27;t get any polishes damaged. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Lots of fantastic colors.....this will be so much fun.  My daughters and I love to get our nails done with colored tips with a stripe.  We always take our own to the salon so now we will have a lot more to choose from.  Arrived quicker than expected.  Great buy!!!!  5 STARS *****</li>
            <li> The packaged arrived quickly. All the bottles were packed very well &amp; with care. However, there is one bottle missing. Counted 47 out of 48. Not really that big of a deal- people make mistakes. Otherwise, this is a fantastic deal. I would recommend this to anyone into nail art.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING IS AMAZING!! the colors, the speed of shipment, the quality &#x3D;D!! perfect! exactly what i wanted!</li>
            <li> My wife used them and really enjoyed them they were very nice, and would recommend them to anyone that does nails.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set. I received so many different colors...some were light, some were dark, I got pastels, and some with glitter. There is a color for any design you can think of. They are mostly opaque, so it makes doing designs really easy.</li>
            <li> I am in love with LA Colors Art Deco . I&#x27;ve been collecting them for about two months but wasn&#x27;t able to find half the colors at my local Dollar Tree store so when I found these on Amazon I was estatic . Shipping was fast and packaging was okay , came in one package with four seprate bags in sets of twelve and each nail polish was wrapped in paper . I was suprised to see that it came with six packs of nail polish remover with thirty-two whips in each . None of the colors came duplicated and only the brush of the color \\&quot;Dee-Lite\\&quot; came defective but NO BIGGIE it was still a great purchase . I already started creating nail designs . I totally recommend these .</li>
            <li> I bought this brand of nail polish that was a gift for my wife and she is a professional in the arrangement and decoration of nails. It came to me asking for this kit and a good time and I finally buy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Medellin, Colombia so besides wait for glazes miami reach my country must import them. The fact of giving only 3 stars is that of 48 glazes that brings the kit arrived damaged 5 colors, because the containers were not secure and should think more carefully pack enamels, hopefully separate 1 by 1 to prevent breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very good product and I recommend it completely, this is a wake up call for the store to be more careful when packing their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compré ésta marca de esmalte para uñas por que era un regalo para mi esposa y ella es una profesional en el arreglo y decoración de las uñas. Ya me venía pidiendo este kit durante ya un bueno tiempo y por fín pude comprarselos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yo vivo en  Medellín-Colombia así que a parte de esperar a que los esmaltes llegaran a miami debía importarlos a mi país. El hecho de darle sólo 3 estrellas  es que de 48 esmaltes que trae el kit llegaron dañados 5 colores, porque los envases no estaban bien cerrados y creo que deben empacar con mayor cuidado los esmaltes, ojalá separados 1 por 1 para evitar que se rompan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;En general es un muy buen producto así que lo recomiendo completamente, este es un llamado de atención para la tienda para que tenga más cuidado al empacar sus productos.</li>
