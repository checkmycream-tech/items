            <li>Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance for years.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it was unique, every department store did not carry it.  </li>
            <li>Gifted to my wife and she loved it very much.</li>
            <li>A light hand should be suitable for daytime, work and office.</li>
            <li>It is Not the original!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than wearing something everyone knows, like Chanel No. 5, for even though Chanel is iconic in fragrance fashion, it&#x27;s no longer original.  </li>
            <li>I myself love it because it is so light and airy, reminds me of a Spring day.</li>
            <li>nice and fun</li>
            <li>I had a stifling cloud of sillage: I opened my office window to get a good breeze going, for about 5 straight hours.</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite perfume and it garners me many compliments!</li>
            <li>It is not to strong and stays with me .</li>
            <li>Even sweeter than I remembered, and astringently strong.  </li>
            <li>She likes it and that&#x27;s what is important.</li>
            <li>My mother really enjoy this perfume</li>
            <li>smell kind of soapy, very \\&quot;green\\&quot; at the beginning,than the citrus-y floral notes come</li>
            <li>enjoy.</li>
            <li>and testers are available for next-to-nothing.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>It Smells really good, soft smell and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find it at such a good price on Amazon, that I purchased two bottles.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it so cheap.</li>
            <li>Gorges and rich fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is the original perfume.</li>
            <li>It is still my favorite for lite dinners and such - it is full of spice and exotic essances!  </li>
            <li>The middle notes sock it to you with rose, tuberose, jasmine, heliotrop and carnation, but it smells more like</li>
            <li>Cabotine is a very beautiful and distinctive green floral and I&#x27;ve worn it off and on since 1995, right out of college.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this perfume because it is a unique scent, whenever i put it on whether in the morning or at night i feel calm and just feel like iam putting my face in a bouquet of flowers.</li>
            <li>Good value at Amazon vs. a local distributor.  </li>
            <li>it lingers much longer and sticks better</li>
            <li>Even than though I found that sometimes it was too sweet for me, and would switch to something else for a while.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s sweet but not too sweet, and is gentler than Cabotine.  </li>
            <li>so I assumed it would smell like sweet alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more synthentic and missing warm and sexy scent.</li>
            <li>It is true that you will get</li>
            <li>I also love that it is so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>A good daytime choice for those that use scent daily.</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous, unique floral scent that stays true on your skin all day long.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy being different and lovely!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything I expected and more!!</li>
            <li>Great scent for the spring, certainly smells of &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; and white flowers.</li>
            <li>I had enough time looking for this perfume very glad I acquire power with</li>
            <li>I have been using it since it first came out and the compliments keep coming !  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light floral and very feminine, without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my scent glands  are more sensitive than they used to be or what,</li>
            <li>I believe that it IS the best kept secret.  </li>
            <li>A lovely, feminine smelling perfume that makes you feel fancy even in jeans and a t-shirt, and all for a modest price.</li>
            <li>the leftover remains after the bouquets have been delivered from a florist shop than the fresh flower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is a best kept secret.  </li>
            <li>, it is so goog, so fresh, and always, there is someone that says something about my perfume.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant smell that last long!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m basking in the beauty of it right now.</li>
            <li>The price is just right.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>It is very soft and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>Nice perfume that stays for long</li>
            <li>Traditional fragrance with unique flowers that make this perfum special!</li>
            <li>I have loved this perfume for many years and have never gotten tired of it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have worn Cabotine.</li>
            <li>and I am confident enough in it to buy the others without trying them first</li>
            <li>I love perfumes and will rotate different ones in and out, depending on my mood and the seasons.  </li>
            <li>I was first introducted to Cabotine in Martinique while on a cruise.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted and needed.  </li>
            <li>It smelled exactly how I remembered it smelled.</li>
            <li>Cabotine came on the market first, I believe.</li>
            <li>A few sprays and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>Other fragrances I love are: Chanel Allure, Kate Spade, Lucky You,</li>
            <li>If she uses it often enough she wont even have to bathe and we can conserve water which will make Algore smile and everyone want to make Algore smile!</li>
            <li>but now I use Cabotine and will continue to use for many years to come, as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li>I am so thankfull that amazon got Cabotine, I have been using this perfume for a long time, and I just love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a clean fresh sent..</li>
            <li>at ~10am, and 9 hrs later, I can still easily smell the fragrance on my arm.</li>
            <li>She also thought it was strong, but just uses 1 tiny squirt.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the EDT and think it is quite strong enough...</li>
            <li>but this time around Cabotine was just too, too much.  </li>
            <li>post fast.</li>
            <li>I have the real one</li>
            <li>Very upset with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This perfume is a real treasure to find and wear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very in your face aldehyde fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is too much going on in this fragrance</li>
            <li>I like this parfume because it enhances the lotion that I like very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks alot</li>
            <li>If you are reading this review, you already know about Cabotine, so the secret is fairly safe here :)</li>
            <li>Cabotine Parfums Gres for Women smells OK out of the bottle but loses its scent quickly.  </li>
            <li>Same quality, same exact product as the big department stores sell for 75.00$$$. Love this parfume!</li>
            <li>I received it in record time and shipping was decent.</li>
            <li>For being so inexpensive, Cabotine can compete nose-to-nose with all the pricey, high end fragrances out there.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Aside the fact that even the same perfume smell different on different women (body chemistry), and even vary on the same woman at certain times,  does people buy perfume based on originality or what smell good to you and on you?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get compliments everyday, people love the scent.</li>
            <li>It has a nice surface smell, but has an after-smell that was not nice at all.</li>
            <li>Normally companied trick you and say the Cabotine is EDP and then when you receive it its EDT but at Purfums Gres</li>
            <li>the back shelf\\&quot; lately, but reading these other wonderful reviews inspired me to put it on today...</li>
            <li>B004V4540M New - LAILA by Geir Ness EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY</li>
            <li>It has good lasting power, but sadly, I&#x27;d like the scent to dissipate quickly since I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is shipped very fast, and as same as product was posted on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>There is a lot going on &amp; it is so very loud.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but also long lasting.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s green with beautiful green flowers on the cap, I&#x27;m a red-head and one-quarter Irish.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is light and not too heavy like some perfumes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cabotine is not wildly popular because many people do not like it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I read this was a citrusy scent, but it has that old lady scent.  </li>
            <li>I think it was old material.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to waste more time and money and send it back, so I guess I&#x27;ll just have to throw them away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for almost 20 years and never got tired of this warm and honey-sweet aroma.</li>
            <li>Cabotine by Parfums Gres isn&#x27;t an expensive scent, yet it lasts, isn&#x27;t too strong, nor too sweet.</li>
            <li>Very rich, complex feminine scent that reminds me of my Gram&#x27;s garden in Spring and Summer.</li>
            <li>Bitter yet cloyingly sweet at the same time.</li>
            <li>Soft floral scent that last for the entire day...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too heavy handed at first for that reason.</li>
            <li>Can be overpowering at first and quite synthetic but the dry down is not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My favorite fragrance for years.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it was unique, every department store did not carry it.  </li>
            <li> Gifted to my wife and she loved it very much.</li>
            <li> A light hand should be suitable for daytime, work and office.</li>
            <li> It is Not the original!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than wearing something everyone knows, like Chanel No. 5, for even though Chanel is iconic in fragrance fashion, it&#x27;s no longer original.  </li>
            <li> I myself love it because it is so light and airy, reminds me of a Spring day.</li>
            <li> nice and fun</li>
            <li> I had a stifling cloud of sillage: I opened my office window to get a good breeze going, for about 5 straight hours.</li>
            <li> It is my absolute favorite perfume and it garners me many compliments!</li>
            <li> It is not to strong and stays with me .</li>
            <li> Even sweeter than I remembered, and astringently strong.  </li>
            <li> She likes it and that&#x27;s what is important.</li>
            <li> My mother really enjoy this perfume</li>
            <li> smell kind of soapy, very \\&quot;green\\&quot; at the beginning,than the citrus-y floral notes come</li>
            <li> enjoy.</li>
            <li> and testers are available for next-to-nothing.</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> It Smells really good, soft smell and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find it at such a good price on Amazon, that I purchased two bottles.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to find it so cheap.</li>
            <li> Gorges and rich fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It is the original perfume.</li>
            <li> It is still my favorite for lite dinners and such - it is full of spice and exotic essances!  </li>
            <li> The middle notes sock it to you with rose, tuberose, jasmine, heliotrop and carnation, but it smells more like</li>
            <li> Cabotine is a very beautiful and distinctive green floral and I&#x27;ve worn it off and on since 1995, right out of college.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this perfume because it is a unique scent, whenever i put it on whether in the morning or at night i feel calm and just feel like iam putting my face in a bouquet of flowers.</li>
            <li> Good value at Amazon vs. a local distributor.  </li>
            <li> it lingers much longer and sticks better</li>
            <li> Even than though I found that sometimes it was too sweet for me, and would switch to something else for a while.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s sweet but not too sweet, and is gentler than Cabotine.  </li>
            <li> so I assumed it would smell like sweet alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more synthentic and missing warm and sexy scent.</li>
            <li> It is true that you will get</li>
            <li> I also love that it is so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> A good daytime choice for those that use scent daily.</li>
            <li> Many thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gorgeous, unique floral scent that stays true on your skin all day long.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy being different and lovely!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected and more!!</li>
            <li> Great scent for the spring, certainly smells of &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; and white flowers.</li>
            <li> I had enough time looking for this perfume very glad I acquire power with</li>
            <li> I have been using it since it first came out and the compliments keep coming !  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light floral and very feminine, without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my scent glands  are more sensitive than they used to be or what,</li>
            <li> I believe that it IS the best kept secret.  </li>
            <li> A lovely, feminine smelling perfume that makes you feel fancy even in jeans and a t-shirt, and all for a modest price.</li>
            <li> the leftover remains after the bouquets have been delivered from a florist shop than the fresh flower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a best kept secret.  </li>
            <li> , it is so goog, so fresh, and always, there is someone that says something about my perfume.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell that last long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basking in the beauty of it right now.</li>
            <li> The price is just right.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> It is very soft and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume that stays for long</li>
            <li> Traditional fragrance with unique flowers that make this perfum special!</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume for many years and have never gotten tired of it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have worn Cabotine.</li>
            <li> and I am confident enough in it to buy the others without trying them first</li>
            <li> I love perfumes and will rotate different ones in and out, depending on my mood and the seasons.  </li>
            <li> I was first introducted to Cabotine in Martinique while on a cruise.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and needed.  </li>
            <li> It smelled exactly how I remembered it smelled.</li>
            <li> Cabotine came on the market first, I believe.</li>
            <li> A few sprays and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Other fragrances I love are: Chanel Allure, Kate Spade, Lucky You,</li>
            <li> If she uses it often enough she wont even have to bathe and we can conserve water which will make Algore smile and everyone want to make Algore smile!</li>
            <li> but now I use Cabotine and will continue to use for many years to come, as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> I am so thankfull that amazon got Cabotine, I have been using this perfume for a long time, and I just love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a clean fresh sent..</li>
            <li> at ~10am, and 9 hrs later, I can still easily smell the fragrance on my arm.</li>
            <li> She also thought it was strong, but just uses 1 tiny squirt.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the EDT and think it is quite strong enough...</li>
            <li> but this time around Cabotine was just too, too much.  </li>
            <li> post fast.</li>
            <li> I have the real one</li>
            <li> Very upset with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a real treasure to find and wear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very fresh&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very in your face aldehyde fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is too much going on in this fragrance</li>
            <li> I like this parfume because it enhances the lotion that I like very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks alot</li>
            <li> If you are reading this review, you already know about Cabotine, so the secret is fairly safe here :)</li>
            <li> Cabotine Parfums Gres for Women smells OK out of the bottle but loses its scent quickly.  </li>
            <li> Same quality, same exact product as the big department stores sell for 75.00$$$. Love this parfume!</li>
            <li> I received it in record time and shipping was decent.</li>
            <li> For being so inexpensive, Cabotine can compete nose-to-nose with all the pricey, high end fragrances out there.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Aside the fact that even the same perfume smell different on different women (body chemistry), and even vary on the same woman at certain times,  does people buy perfume based on originality or what smell good to you and on you?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get compliments everyday, people love the scent.</li>
            <li> It has a nice surface smell, but has an after-smell that was not nice at all.</li>
            <li> Normally companied trick you and say the Cabotine is EDP and then when you receive it its EDT but at Purfums Gres</li>
            <li> the back shelf\\&quot; lately, but reading these other wonderful reviews inspired me to put it on today...</li>
            <li> B004V4540M New - LAILA by Geir Ness EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY</li>
            <li> It has good lasting power, but sadly, I&#x27;d like the scent to dissipate quickly since I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is shipped very fast, and as same as product was posted on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> There is a lot going on &amp; it is so very loud.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but also long lasting.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s green with beautiful green flowers on the cap, I&#x27;m a red-head and one-quarter Irish.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it is light and not too heavy like some perfumes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cabotine is not wildly popular because many people do not like it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I read this was a citrusy scent, but it has that old lady scent.  </li>
            <li> I think it was old material.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to waste more time and money and send it back, so I guess I&#x27;ll just have to throw them away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for almost 20 years and never got tired of this warm and honey-sweet aroma.</li>
            <li> Cabotine by Parfums Gres isn&#x27;t an expensive scent, yet it lasts, isn&#x27;t too strong, nor too sweet.</li>
            <li> Very rich, complex feminine scent that reminds me of my Gram&#x27;s garden in Spring and Summer.</li>
            <li> Bitter yet cloyingly sweet at the same time.</li>
            <li> Soft floral scent that last for the entire day...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too heavy handed at first for that reason.</li>
            <li> Can be overpowering at first and quite synthetic but the dry down is not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> last a long time on your clothes.</li>
            <li> you just need a couple sprays to last all day long.  </li>
            <li> For me, there seems to be an odd lingering after scent that is not altogether natural or organic</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find in the US, and I&#x27;m thankful that is available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like it, lasts for a long time when I wear it.</li>
            <li> the scent is subtle and very capturing.</li>
            <li> My new fragrance, I am simply addicted already, and have only had it two weeks.</li>
            <li> Its not that my wife ever smelled bad, but when she applied this product I bought for her, she smelled better than ever.</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> it is not very strong smell, so i think it cannot keep long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cabotine for the past ten years.  </li>
            <li> I usually tire of a perfume after a few months, but I will be purchasing a second bottle.  </li>
            <li> have discovered another scent a little similiar to Cabotine.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s lost in the green notes.</li>
            <li> Peach, Plum, Cassie, Tagete, Green notes,</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Cabotine (Green) for over 30 years and am continually complimented by both men and women for its fragrance.  </li>
            <li> (heavy sillage).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The trouble is, I get over it within a couple hours</li>
            <li> I have let it mellow for a few hours</li>
            <li> Could not fine it anywhere in stores here; they never even heard of it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The green cap perhaps references the very green notes in the fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you use apply in small amounts as smell projects and lasts.</li>
            <li> and it is not much better.  </li>
            <li> People complained that the scent lasted just a few minutes, and then they couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this in the late 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone who wears it, and honestly, I never would have picked it up just because it was so inexpensive</li>
            <li> I think this is  at least 15th bottle of this perfume I&#x27;ve bought for all these years.</li>
            <li> Smells nasty, cheap and synthetic.</li>
            <li> Heavenly by Victoria Secret and others.    </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s stupid you have to write a long comment.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake or reformulated.</li>
            <li> It is a fake... explains the price.</li>
            <li> Bad smell</li>
            <li> Was disappointed</li>
            <li> The base notes are also an amalgam of vanilla, cedar, amber, musk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was downhearted as the bottle was running out, fearful that I&#x27;d never find it in the States.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife loves this.  Good value at Amazon vs. a local distributor.  Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have worn Cabotine. It has a nice fragrance. It is not to strong and stays with me .</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances. A few sprays and you are good to go. Seductive and sexy scent. I get compliments everyday, people love the scent. It is not overpowering, but it lasts all day. Give it a try. you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> She likes it and that&#x27;s what is important.</li>
            <li> Top notch service and product</li>
            <li> very nice perfume. get the eau de parfum and not the eau de toillette. it lingers much longer and sticks better</li>
            <li> I used to wear this in the late 80&#x27;s.  I liked that it was unique, every department store did not carry it.  Even than though I found that sometimes it was too sweet for me, and would switch to something else for a while.  Amazon  offered it for an amazing price, so I thought I would try it again.  I don&#x27;t know if my scent glands  are more sensitive than they used to be or what, but this time around Cabotine was just too, too much.  Even sweeter than I remembered, and astringently strong.  After 5 minutes of putting some on I was already getting a headache.  Everything I used to like about Cabotine was still there, just overpowing.  A case of too much of a good thing.  I have to admit that one of reasons I used to buy it was because of the lovely bottle.  The bottle is the same as I remember, but much bigger, 3.4 onces, which is a lot of perfume.  I reboxed it and gave it to my friend for Valentines and she loved it.  She also thought it was strong, but just uses 1 tiny squirt.  It smells nice on her, just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered another scent a little similiar to Cabotine.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004V4540M New - LAILA by Geir Ness EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY 3.4 OZ - 154526]]&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sweet but not too sweet, and is gentler than Cabotine.  And no headache.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Cabotine. So do the people who happen to be in her proximity. We are pleased to purchase it at Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cabotine for the past ten years.  I was very excited to find it at such a good price on Amazon, that I purchased two bottles.  What a huge disappointment.  I don&#x27;t know who they think they are fooling.  Well, obviously me.  The smell lasts about five minutes, then it is gone. And, it doesn&#x27;t even smell like Cabotine for those short five minutes! This is not the Eau De Parfum I was expecting.  Now I have two 3.4 ounce bottles that I don&#x27;t know what to do with. I&#x27;m not going to waste more time and money and send it back, so I guess I&#x27;ll just have to throw them away.  This is the last time I will buy any perfume from Amazon, and I&#x27;m definitely letting everyone I know know what happened to me so they don&#x27;t experience the same thing.</li>
            <li> Could not fine it anywhere in stores here; they never even heard of it.  The pricing was perfect and I didn&#x27;t have to travel miles and miles to get it. One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> If you think it is going to be like Dior Tendre Poison forget it. One use and I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for many years and the order arrived in good order.</li>
            <li> i like this smell. it is very good. it is not very strong smell, so i think it cannot keep long time. post fast.</li>
            <li> AWESOME , THANK YOU .</li>
            <li> I believe that it IS the best kept secret.  I don&#x27;t know anyone who wears it, and honestly, I never would have picked it up just because it was so inexpensive so I assumed it would smell like sweet alcohol.  It did happen to try it and had to have it.  It lasts all day and I am continually smelling my wrists.  I usually tire of a perfume after a few months, but I will be purchasing a second bottle.  I saw Cabotine Gold and Cabotine Florisme at TJ Maxx (cheap!!) and I am confident enough in it to buy the others without trying them first (there are no samples at TJM).</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because of its floral fragrance.  The fragrance stays all day&lt;br /&gt;and last a long time on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Awful. No smell. I know this fragrance well. Was disappointed</li>
            <li> It is all that matters.  AND it smells great on her.  I have 2 bottles stored for future gifts or when she runs out.</li>
            <li> Cabotine is a very beautiful and distinctive green floral and I&#x27;ve worn it off and on since 1995, right out of college.  I got so many compliments then and now.  I love perfumes and will rotate different ones in and out, depending on my mood and the seasons.  Cabotine has been \\&quot;on the back shelf\\&quot; lately, but reading these other wonderful reviews inspired me to put it on today... I&#x27;m basking in the beauty of it right now. :) The hubby likes it too.    I call it my \\&quot;Irish Girl\\&quot; fragrance, because it&#x27;s green with beautiful green flowers on the cap, I&#x27;m a red-head and one-quarter Irish.  It also smells like Spring to me, so I break it out around March and wear it through the summer.  Other fragrances I love are: Chanel Allure, Kate Spade, Lucky You, Heavenly by Victoria Secret and others.    I recommend the EDT and think it is quite strong enough...you just need a couple sprays to last all day long.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine getting the EDP (which I realized just now I did the review on), might give me a headache!  Enjoy being different and lovely!</li>
            <li> A lovely, feminine smelling perfume that makes you feel fancy even in jeans and a t-shirt, and all for a modest price.</li>
            <li> lovely fragrance I have used this perfume before</li>
            <li> I have the real one and it&#x27;s amazing. This one is not the same! It&#x27;s fake or reformulated. It&#x27;s more synthentic and missing warm and sexy scent. Very upset with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! price is great!</li>
            <li> This is my mom&#x27;s fav perfume. I was so excited to find it so cheap. It is a fake... explains the price.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I don&#x27;t know if you can still get it as it is not in the stores.  I still have some that I got from Amazon and I use it all the time.  I will have to order another bottle soon.  I like it because it is light and not too heavy like some perfumes.</li>
            <li> Its not that my wife ever smelled bad, but when she applied this product I bought for her, she smelled better than ever. If you want a great smelling wife, and who doesnt, buy this product. If she uses it often enough she wont even have to bathe and we can conserve water which will make Algore smile and everyone want to make Algore smile!</li>
            <li> Great price&#x3D; great product!!!</li>
            <li> Cabotine is one of my favorite fragrances. I&#x27;ve used it for almost 20 years and never got tired of this warm and honey-sweet aroma. I think this is  at least 15th bottle of this perfume I&#x27;ve bought for all these years. And of course I will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> It was what I was expecting good job</li>
            <li> This perfume is a real treasure to find and wear.  It is true that you will get&lt;br /&gt;plenty of compliments!! I do find that I need to spray a second time during&lt;br /&gt;the day.  May just be my chemistry with the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this perfume to all ages of women.  It&#x27;s a very fresh&lt;br /&gt;and invigorating, yet innocent type of perfume.</li>
            <li> My friend and I love this perfume. I bought this as a surprise for her birthday. She loved it !</li>
            <li> Just as I had expected...Have been a customer for some time...</li>
            <li> I like it, lasts for a long time when I wear it. The price is just right. &lt;br /&gt;For years I used to use and wear french perfumes like \\&quot;Chanel 5\\&quot;, but now I use Cabotine and will continue to use for many years to come, as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> Cabotine was a scent I wore as a teenager. It&#x27;s very in your face aldehyde fragrance. Can be overpowering at first and quite synthetic but the dry down is not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green cap perhaps references the very green notes in the fragrance. It has coriander in the top note. There is some peach and plum but it&#x27;s lost in the green notes. The middle notes sock it to you with rose, tuberose, jasmine, heliotrop and carnation, but it smells more like the leftover remains after the bouquets have been delivered from a florist shop than the fresh flower. The base notes are also an amalgam of vanilla, cedar, amber, musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is too much going on in this fragrance and it&#x27;s too heavy handed at first for that reason. I wore it during teenage but it&#x27;s too gauche for me now.&lt;br /&gt;Top Notes: Peach, Plum, Cassie, Tagete, Green notes, Coriander&lt;br /&gt;Middle Notes: Ylang-Ylang, Rose, Tuberose, Jasmin, Heliotrope, Orris, Carnation&lt;br /&gt;Base Notes: Cedar, Vetiver, Musk, Tonka Bean, Amber, Vanilla, Civet</li>
            <li> I purchased this Cabotine for a friend for her birthday. I myself love it because it is so light and airy, reminds me of a Spring day. I received it in record time and shipping was decent.</li>
            <li> It Smells really good, soft smell and it lasts all day. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price. I so recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is Not the original! Bad smell</li>
            <li> For being so inexpensive, Cabotine can compete nose-to-nose with all the pricey, high end fragrances out there.  It&#x27;s a gorgeous, unique floral scent that stays true on your skin all day long.  Every time I wear it, people say \\&quot;Wow, you smell great!  What is that?\\&quot;      It&#x27;s better than wearing something everyone knows, like Chanel No. 5, for even though Chanel is iconic in fragrance fashion, it&#x27;s no longer original.  People smell you walk by and think \\&quot;Oh, she wears Chanel.\\&quot;    Go out wearing Cabotine, and you&#x27;ll turn heads and pique curiosity.  You will definitely be asked about your perfume.  You can make it your signature scent and it will truly be your signature, because no two women will ever be wearing Cabotine in the same room, I can almost guarantee it.  Unless, of course, all these wonderful reviews we write inspire a trend!  No, let&#x27;s keep it as hushy as we can.  If you are reading this review, you already know about Cabotine, so the secret is fairly safe here :)</li>
            <li> What can I say?  I just didn&#x27;t care for this at all.  I put it on once and now don&#x27;t know what to do with the rest of the bottle.  It has a nice surface smell, but has an after-smell that was not nice at all.</li>
            <li> Same quality, same exact product as the big department stores sell for 75.00$$$. Love this parfume! Won&#x27;t get it anywhere else</li>
            <li> My second bottle because of the compliments I have received!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is shipped very fast, and as same as product was posted on Amazon.com. Lovely bottle and wonderful perfume with Made in France. I really loved it.</li>
            <li> My husband brought home a bottle of Cabotine from Paris and I just LOVE it. I was downhearted as the bottle was running out, fearful that I&#x27;d never find it in the States. SO happy that I found it here. It is my absolute favorite perfume and it garners me many compliments!</li>
            <li> Love this scent and the price.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, SMELLS GREAT, DOESN;T STAIN.  SMELL LASTS ALL DAY. WOULD BUY AGAIN, MAKES A GREAT GIFT FOR ANY AGE</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance and get many compliments.  I also love that it is so reasonably priced.  This is a winner.</li>
            <li> I like the floral scent</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mother every year. It shipped quickly and i got a great deal when i bought the Gold and Rose with it!</li>
            <li> More than 10 years I use this parfum...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for over 10 years now and for $18 Amazon just rocks!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s everything I expected and more!!</li>
            <li> I had smelt this perfume on someone about a year ago and just loved the smell. I searched for it everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find it, until I looked here. I bought it but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same and no one notices it. The price was right but smell is different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years and cannot believe that for the price of one bottle at Perfumania I bought 3!!!   If you like a light yet pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t over power this is one you should get.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume for many years and have never gotten tired of it. Its wonderful floral scent just relaxes me whenever I put it on, it always puts me in a great mood. I enjoy this perfume because it is a unique scent, whenever i put it on whether in the morning or at night i feel calm and just feel like iam putting my face in a bouquet of flowers. This perfume also makes for a perfect gift.</li>
            <li> Lovely  scent.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume that stays for long</li>
            <li> Soft floral scent that last for the entire day...A little goes along way!!!! A great buy for that special Lady</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the quality of products that I received !&lt;br /&gt;I recommend and plan to make future purchases.</li>
            <li> nice and fun My mother really enjoy this perfume</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a friends as this perfume works well with her sinus problems and it can be worn to work and not offend anyone.</li>
            <li> Cabotine by Parfums Gres isn&#x27;t an expensive scent, yet it lasts, isn&#x27;t too strong, nor too sweet. A good daytime choice for those that use scent daily.</li>
            <li> Smells OK. Not for those who suffer from perfume induced migraines. If you use apply in small amounts as smell projects and lasts.</li>
            <li> I brought this perfume for my aunt cause we has helped me with alot of problems in my life so I bought her this wonderful perfume</li>
            <li> This perfume smells sexy and feminine. I love the scent. Its a scent that last all day and the longer its on you the sexier it smells.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a best kept secret.  It isn&#x27;t particularly famous or well known, but smells heavenly.  I was first introducted to Cabotine in Martinique while on a cruise.  I received a sample vial at a perfume shop.  I get many compliments from friends and co-workers when I wear it.  The eau de parfum is a bit stronger and lasts longer than the toilette.</li>
            <li> Everything was good!it was a gift for my grandmother and she loves it.  And it&#x27;s stupid you have to write a long comment.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Cabotine (Green) for over 30 years and am continually complimented by both men and women for its fragrance.  It&#x27;s a light floral and very feminine, without being overpowering.  It is difficult to find in the US, and I&#x27;m thankful that is available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using it since it first came out and the compliments keep coming !  I use it daily and people always stop me on the street to ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.  Its an all day fragrance.</li>
            <li> My friend really likes this and has trouble finding it so I was very happy to get it for her.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and needed.  The price and the service is EXCELLENT!!</li>
            <li> A doctor&#x27;s wife wore this and she is why I ordered it. Is one of my favorites, and smells really good.</li>
            <li> I like this parfume because it enhances the lotion that I like very well.  It is very soft and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> Aside the fact that even the same perfume smell different on different women (body chemistry), and even vary on the same woman at certain times,  does people buy perfume based on originality or what smell good to you and on you?&lt;br /&gt;Frankly I do the latter, who cares if people walking by recognize the scent? By that logic all the fashion houses would be out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cabotine is not wildly popular because many people do not like it.&lt;br /&gt;It smell kind of soapy, very \\&quot;green\\&quot; at the beginning,than the citrus-y floral notes come up.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s light but also long lasting.A little goes a long way (heavy sillage).&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that before you buy it, you try it through the day because has many layers and you may not like how it evolves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have it in my perfume \\&quot;wardrobe\\&quot;,I use it as a day time springtime scent.</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this perfume.  It&#x27;s really bright, zingy, flowery, amber, sandalwood, spice &amp; tonka (vanilla) but lordy, this thing will take the paint off walls!  There is a lot going on &amp; it is so very loud.  And it goes on &amp; on &amp; on - 24 hours on my skin &amp; through the wash on clothing.  But some days, I just like this fragrance; it kicks me in the pants.  The trouble is, I get over it within a couple hours but it lingersssssssssss.  The friend who stays too long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been reformulated since the 1990&#x27;s when it was created.  So, if it smells different than you remember, that may be why.  I know women who loved this then but can&#x27;t abide it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this with CAUTION - this is a ONE spray fragrance!</li>
            <li> I am so thankfull that amazon got Cabotine, I have been using this perfume for a long time, and I just love it, it is so goog, so fresh, and always, there is someone that says something about my perfume. It will always be my favorite perfume, and it is a such a good price !!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been wearing for yrs Still love aroma</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! Delivered on time And In perfect conditions. Traditional fragrance with unique flowers that make this perfum special!</li>
            <li> Gorges and rich fragrance.  I am so pleased it got here on time and in perfect condition.  Many thanks.</li>
            <li> Gifted to my wife and she loved it very much. Very pleasant smell that last long!</li>
            <li> I read this was a citrusy scent, but it has that old lady scent.  I have let it mellow for a few hours and it is not much better.  It has good lasting power, but sadly, I&#x27;d like the scent to dissipate quickly since I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Cabotine when I was younger - in fact I still have the Cabotine tote.  During a purchase of Chanel No. 5 I found this wonderful gem, again.  It is still my favorite for lite dinners and such - it is full of spice and exotic essances!  I am very happy to have found this wonderful scent again...enjoy.</li>
            <li> Love it..It&#x27;s such a clean fresh sent..I love the way it smells on me..I get compliments every time I wear it</li>
            <li> Yuck. Smells nasty, cheap and synthetic. Bitter yet cloyingly sweet at the same time. Do not ask me how they pulled that one off. Kind of scared me off all Gres products despite the tempting price tag. Lots of lily, do not detect any nectarine or musk.</li>
            <li> the product and the care was excellent. calidad.bien packaged good, met deadlines. I recommend it 100%. without mishap. Incoming orders.</li>
            <li> My new fragrance, I am simply addicted already, and have only had it two weeks. Very rich, complex feminine scent that reminds me of my Gram&#x27;s garden in Spring and Summer.</li>
            <li> I like this. Normally companied trick you and say the Cabotine is EDP and then when you receive it its EDT but at Purfums Gres it was actually ETP. Thanks alot</li>
            <li> The perfect gift for the most special person in your life. Sophisticated and sensual. the scent is subtle and very capturing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Know the product, I get lots of complements when  wear it!</li>
            <li> Let me say that before I bought this, I was worried that there wouldn&#x27;t be enough scent. People complained that the scent lasted just a few minutes, and then they couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore. I think I have the opposite problem. I sprayed generously -- too generously-- at ~10am, and 9 hrs later, I can still easily smell the fragrance on my arm. I had a stifling cloud of sillage: I opened my office window to get a good breeze going, for about 5 straight hours. That was only 3 spritzes! I think I&#x27;m going to try 1 tomorrow. I do like the scent (it&#x27;s freshing and floral) and can see myself using this regularly.</li>
            <li> Cabotine Parfums Gres for Women smells OK out of the bottle but loses its scent quickly.  I think it was old material.  I would not reorder it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a citrusy perfume and came across this with very good reviews. For me, there seems to be an odd lingering after scent that is not altogether natural or organic It had a metallic scent or synthetic.  Not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> It is the original perfume. I absolutely loved it! It smelled exactly how I remembered it smelled. It arrived on time and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance for years.  Great price, the best place to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I had enough time looking for this perfume very glad I acquire power with another one nolo knew, wonderful promotion</li>
            <li> Great scent for the spring, certainly smells of &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; and white flowers. Quite reminiscent of a much more expensive scent by Dior, Tender Poison, which has been discontinued. Cabotine came on the market first, I believe. A light hand should be suitable for daytime, work and office. The price is a no-brainer. and testers are available for next-to-nothing. Enjoy</li>
