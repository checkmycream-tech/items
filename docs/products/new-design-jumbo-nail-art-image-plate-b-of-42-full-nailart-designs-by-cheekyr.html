            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love my cheeky plates and will not ever purchase plates elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The more detailed patterns you can not see unless you are up close.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with my stamper the first time I used it but found that if I run a course nail file over my stamper 4 or 5 times it picks the images up much better!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and very pleased with product</li>
            <li>Received quickly, fantastic product, very large images, perfect for full nails or French h tips!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for nail art!</li>
            <li>They fit all my nails.</li>
            <li>luck and enjoy</li>
            <li>The fact that I can use all of the designs as all overs or just tips is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape with it, and all it did was scratch my plates up.</li>
            <li>I love the large plates.</li>
            <li>Love the large plates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Zoya glitter polishes work awesomely, as do the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails polishes.</li>
            <li>r good but almost 4 or 5 r soooo similar.....</li>
            <li>Stamp was crisp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like them very much!</li>
            <li>The fit over the whole nail.</li>
            <li>The different designs are amazing.</li>
            <li>I have fun trying to figure out which design</li>
            <li>Many people say that the images are not etched deep enough, but never state what polish they used, mine worked fine when using the appropriate polish to stamp with.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d known this before ordering a slew of the Konad Special polishes, but I got them cheap enough</li>
            <li>The same plate is on ebay for twice the price i love it.</li>
            <li>I like the images and really want these to work, so I will keep trying and hope I can find a way to make them work!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just in love with the quality why spend x3 on konad when u can have the SAME quality for a fraction of its price.</li>
            <li>gelly sandwich style (cured gel foundation, regular polish, cured gel topcoat), and then play around with the stamps on top of my cured nails.</li>
            <li>the patterns are really pretty</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li>So far it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li>but I saw that some are having trouble getting the stamper to pick up the images right and thought maybe my review could help someone if they have this kind of problem.</li>
            <li>It arrived packaged well and the blue plastic removes from the plate easily.  </li>
            <li>I was assuming it would be a bit bigger, but it fits the nail just perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>but really the images are oversize.</li>
            <li>Much deeper than my Konad plates.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery as well</li>
            <li>I tried each image multiple times, and have only been able to get 1 of the images to transfer to the stamper.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this plate.</li>
            <li>I put a clear coat of regular polish on top once I&#x27;m done, and then I can switch it out multiple times with the wear of the gel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost every image I do use a old credit card to scrap and konad polish and konad stamper</li>
            <li>The plate itself is small and could be carried easily when traveling or going anywhere if you want to bring it along to do nails.  </li>
            <li>There are varied designs, some simple, and others more complex.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite what other reviews have said, the etching on the designs seems deep enough - I&#x27;ve experimented with the special Konad Polishes, salon polishes (Zoya, Julep, etc), as well as department store polishes.</li>
            <li>- this is such a fun little hobby.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner at this, so I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards the more simplistic designs, but have really got the hold of how to do it after reading reviews on this and other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When they arrive there is a small tear in the envelope right where the corners are busted off.</li>

            <li> A C &amp; D and love them and would recommend them to people with small natural nails or false extensions!</li>
            <li> This last order, the metal plate was warped slightly.</li>
            <li> The only problem i have is that my stamp is almost too small for some images</li>
            <li> Would buy other designs from cheeky.</li>
            <li> it sorta filed the nail down.</li>
            <li> Cheeky has yet to let me down and cheeky</li>
            <li> I like the less detailed because you can see you base coat nail  polish and the design.</li>
            <li> dont waste ur money.....</li>
            <li> The plastic edging keeps getting broken off the corners because it&#x27;s mailed in a thin bubble mailer envelope.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews about packing being bad because my plate came in 3 layers of bubble wrap and a layer of cardboard over it!</li>
            <li> I found nothing wrong with this plat at all</li>
            <li> That way if they turn out wonky I can wipe it off with non-acetone polish remover and start again without worrying about ruining my base coat.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to apply</li>
            <li> this is horrible....</li>

            <li> Fast delivery and very pleased with product</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had a problem with my stamper the first time I used it but found that if I run a course nail file over my stamper 4 or 5 times it picks the images up much better! My images are perfect now!  I normaly don&#x27;t write reviews but I saw that some are having trouble getting the stamper to pick up the images right and thought maybe my review could help someone if they have this kind of problem. Also i want you to know how great these plates are!</li>
            <li> this thing is whack....the designs r good but almost 4 or 5 r soooo similar.....AND NONE WORK!!! this is horrible....dont waste ur money..... buy MASH... they r sooo much better and worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best plates i own. The designs are etched really deeply. In fact, I mistakenly ran my nail across the plate and it was so deep it sorta filed the nail down. The only problem i have is that my stamp is almost too small for some images but really the images are oversize. The fit over the whole nail. The same plate is on ebay for twice the price i love it.</li>
            <li> I actually love this nail plate! I was assuming it would be a bit bigger, but it fits the nail just perfectly fine. The plate itself is small and could be carried easily when traveling or going anywhere if you want to bring it along to do nails.  Scraping then the design and transferring it to your nails should be very easy and nice.  The design turns out pretty neat :D I LOVE this plate!</li>
            <li> Perfect. No need to buy Konad anymore.</li>
            <li> Figures obtained good and excellent designs for yourself! I like them very much! Quality of five stars. You&#x27;ll love them!</li>
            <li> Very difficult to apply</li>
            <li> Received quickly, fantastic product, very large images, perfect for full nails or French h tips!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for nail art!</li>
            <li> Love the size of the images. They fit all my nails. I always get compliments. People ask if I used nail decals then I end up explaining about stamping. Awesomeness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, the designs are beautiful and all the designs I&#x27;ve tried so far stamp beautifully.  I would highly recommend this plate.</li>
            <li> Fun plate with lots of great designs.</li>
            <li> The images on this plate are neat designs and the size is perfect.  It arrived packaged well and the blue plastic removes from the plate easily.  But...the images are not etched deep enough.  I cannot get them to work!  I&#x27;ve tried using different polishes (Konad and regular), I&#x27;ve tried using different stampers and scrapers.  I&#x27;ve tried scraping at different angles and scraping from different directions across the image.  I tried each image multiple times, and have only been able to get 1 of the images to transfer to the stamper.  I like the images and really want these to work, so I will keep trying and hope I can find a way to make them work!</li>
            <li> I found nothing wrong with this plat at all it stamps great I&#x27;ve tried almost every image I do use a old credit card to scrap and konad polish and konad stamper I find this combo is the best and the card won&#x27;t scratch ur plates I have 8 XL plates from cheeky and I&#x27;m just in love with the quality why spend x3 on konad when u can have the SAME quality for a fraction of its price. Cheeky has yet to let me down and cheeky has become my fav stamping company!</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed with this nail plate! There are varied designs, some simple, and others more complex. I&#x27;m a beginner at this, so I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards the more simplistic designs, but have really got the hold of how to do it after reading reviews on this and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite what other reviews have said, the etching on the designs seems deep enough - I&#x27;ve experimented with the special Konad Polishes, salon polishes (Zoya, Julep, etc), as well as department store polishes. I&#x27;ve found that Zoya glitter polishes work awesomely, as do the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails polishes. I wish I&#x27;d known this before ordering a slew of the Konad Special polishes, but I got them cheap enough I&#x27;ll chalk it up to a lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been also playing around with gel nails - so I&#x27;ll do my gel nails gelly sandwich style (cured gel foundation, regular polish, cured gel topcoat), and then play around with the stamps on top of my cured nails. That way if they turn out wonky I can wipe it off with non-acetone polish remover and start again without worrying about ruining my base coat. I put a clear coat of regular polish on top once I&#x27;m done, and then I can switch it out multiple times with the wear of the gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would note (as others have as well), if you buy the stamping kits, don&#x27;t bother with the included scraper. I couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape with it, and all it did was scratch my plates up. I use an old credit card, and it&#x27;s awesome. It made all the difference between polish actually sitting in the design so the stamp could be picked up, and the image being smeared all over and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and enjoy - this is such a fun little hobby. All of my girlfriends now are having me practice my stamps on them, and are buying their own sets as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used the nail plates yet, they are a gift, however I am now on my fourth replacement order because amazon can&#x27;t properly package these things. The plastic edging keeps getting broken off the corners because it&#x27;s mailed in a thin bubble mailer envelope. When they arrive there is a small tear in the envelope right where the corners are busted off. This last order, the metal plate was warped slightly. Please figure this out amazon, as this seems like a great product, and I would love to be able to get one in perfect condition. Please send these out in a BOX next time!</li>
            <li> The different designs are amazing. I have fun trying to figure out which design I want to give a go. So far it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This plate is great the patterns are really pretty and there is a nice variety and for the price you can&#x27;t beat this deal!</li>
            <li> I love this nail plate, they all stamped perfect.</li>
            <li> Everything about this product was great! Don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews about packing being bad because my plate came in 3 layers of bubble wrap and a layer of cardboard over it! I also love the covering around the plate so I won&#x27;t cut myself with it. Many people say that the images are not etched deep enough, but never state what polish they used, mine worked fine when using the appropriate polish to stamp with. Buy this!!!</li>
            <li> I love the large plates. It has so many designs to choose from. I have bought several that I can&#x27;t decide which design to choose. I like the less detailed because you can see you base coat nail  polish and the design. The more detailed patterns you can not see unless you are up close. Love the large plates.</li>
            <li> I just got this plate yesterday and I love it.  The fact that I can use all of the designs as all overs or just tips is fantastic. And the designs are etched very deeply. Much deeper than my Konad plates.  I will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> I love my cheeky plates and will not ever purchase plates elsewhere. Such a great variety for a great price. I have plates A C &amp; D and love them and would recommend them to people with small natural nails or false extensions!</li>
            <li> Stamp was crisp and easy to use. Nice designs that I will use over and over. Would buy other designs from cheeky. Fast delivery as well</li>
