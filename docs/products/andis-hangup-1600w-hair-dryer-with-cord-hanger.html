            <li>This is a great product!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a good dryer and the convenience is wonderful.</li>

            <li>I like the size and style; it looks great in my kid&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li>Great value and excels our expectations.</li>
            <li>But for what I need it for it works just great.</li>
            <li>Tacks onto the wall very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved using these great hair dryers at hotels and thought it would be great to have one att home, and it is.  </li>
            <li>The cord hangup tab is a good idea to keep the cord out of the way.  </li>
            <li>I saw these in hotels all the time and loved the convenience.  </li>
            <li>The lower setting is good if you don&#x27;t want to disturb someone who is sleeping.  </li>
            <li>It is a good value for the money.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact it hangs up.  </li>
            <li>so bought this one when it was on sale for $7 :)  </li>
            <li>I love the size and the power.</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>Would be nice to have a cool shot too.  </li>
            <li>Works great, I don&#x27;t think it is too loud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud but it works great.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know about the longevity of a $11.00 hair dryer, but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Everything was great for a couple months then for no reason the fan went out and started smoking and getting HOT HOT HOT!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to attach to wall.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let that compact size deceive you, though, because it dries hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>This dryer was easy to install.</li>
            <li>But looks well built and easy to install.</li>
            <li>It was easy to mount on the wall, and I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice compact good looking unit.</li>
            <li>I used this model at a motel and was so impressed I wrote down the brand.</li>
            <li>it came with, but it is fine if you want to use it.</li>
            <li>Super Bargain!</li>
            <li>loud.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for short or medium length hair.</li>
            <li>This looks nice and is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I was able to remove it from the mirror by just grabbing the bracket and twisting it to the right.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for a small wall space and keeps my counter clutter free...</li>
            <li>It also does not have \\&quot;cool blast\\&quot; or whatever they call it button that allows to temporarily switch off the heat while keeping the fan running.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are very clear and it was super easy to put up!</li>
            <li>Adequate heat distribution to not harm hair.</li>
            <li>Its an excellent product, and if you are not super picky about your dryers - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great little dryer with lots of power.</li>
            <li>Great powerful little dryer.</li>
            <li>Got mine today and it is great - not as noisy and the Jerdon that I have and dried my hair</li>
            <li>I was happy to find that I could get it from Amazon just a few days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>To be honest - her hair looks the same to me regardless what dryer she uses.  </li>
            <li>It has a powerful fan with 2 levels of heat.</li>
            <li>The electrical cord is kind of short, so allow for that when hanging on the wall.</li>
            <li>I used one of these in a hotel on a recent trip and really liked it</li>
            <li>Has a lot of power for a little dryer and looks very nice and compact in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>it has been great since then, it works good, has enough power and fast air heating, has a wall mount and is small in size.   </li>
            <li>I found it to be plenty powerful, and not too hot.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty loud, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because it is very powerful and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is one of the few offered in black which best fit with my room decor.</li>
            <li>Good little hair dryer</li>
            <li>I try not to use the higher heat setting</li>
            <li>I prefer this to some of the hair dryers i have in our gym (which seems more bigger than this one)    </li>
            <li>The dryer fits into the receiver fine, but it seems that it could be anchored into the holder a little better as it feels like it might fall out if bumped.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good idea.</li>
            <li>I installed this hair dryer in our RV and it is simple and easy to Install.</li>
            <li>[it has an easy to remove cap to do this] and the thing does not get daily use.  </li>
            <li>I  just won&#x27;t try to mount it with screws because the adhesive worked very well.</li>
            <li>Very convenient....love the holder.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the cord hanger</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Quality and Fast Response/Shipping</li>
            <li>The high setting is powerful and loud.</li>
            <li>Small and compact and has good blowing action.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been a nice small hair dryer....</li>
            <li>It does dry their hair quickly, so it definetly does the job!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This little hair dryer is fantastic for the price!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right there hanging next to the mirror.    </li>
            <li>I got the new one it&#x27;s been going every day for month without any problems</li>
            <li>Lost the low heat setting in the first couple months.  </li>
            <li>just fine - I think the cord may be a little longer too.  </li>
            <li>Yes, we kept it clear of lint etc.</li>
            <li>we dont use a hair dryer very often, just needed a basic one to use about 4-5 times a week.</li>
            <li>It caught on fire before it was a year old.  </li>
            <li>It is much more convenient than having to drag my previous hair dryer out of the drawer every time I needed it.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy another of the same because it worked well and dried my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Definitely has a major defect.</li>

            <li> Definitely has a major defect.</li>
            <li> Only fault is that it only has two speeds and the heat setting is governed by the blower speed, but that is minor.  </li>
            <li> For a small hairdryer it is really convenient, stays out of the way (Just what you want) and it has lots of power for its size.</li>
            <li> It overheats on high after a little more than a minute of use - disappointing</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last very long before blew out</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair faster than I ever could with my larger hand held dryer.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so loud, my kid&#x27;s are startled each time I turn on the dryer (even with previous warning).</li>
            <li> The dryer has a long cord.  </li>
            <li> dyer is small, its not super fast</li>
            <li> The dryer itself seems to work fine, but if you want a wall-mounted one you might want to look for something a little sturdier and less frustrating to hang.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the little hook for hanging the cord up out of the way.  </li>
            <li> I held onto this after the mounting piece broke, and a few years later dragged it out when my other dryer gave out.</li>
            <li> The black is priced much less than the white.  </li>
            <li> Looks sharp hanging up.  </li>
            <li> This has happened before with other dryers</li>
            <li> Overall - I would have given it 5 stars, but had to withhold one, due to my wife&#x27;s complaint that there is no separate heat and fan control switches.  </li>
            <li> It comes with double sided thick tape and places for screws.  </li>
            <li> This is a very small dryer but with a BIG punch!  </li>
            <li> I could still mount it with one less screw</li>
            <li> We got less than a year out of this one before the sparks started flying again.  </li>
            <li> Half the time, we forget to take a hair dryer with us.  </li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom and wanted to leave the little space I had on the vanity for other things.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s terrible - loud and doesn&#x27;t dry hair very well at all</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked how much power this little dynamo has...</li>
            <li> It takes up very little space on the wall.</li>
            <li> No more messes on the counter or sink, and you never have to wonder which drawer it is in...</li>
            <li> It works well for a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but no more.  </li>
            <li> I drilled 2 small holes in a stud and bought 3&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is very small, which some might find annoying, but I like because it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> The dryer is small - not one of those fancy hairdresser models!  </li>
            <li> Not too concerned about the sparks as the heating wires over time get thin from all the heat...</li>
            <li> Dangerous product to say the least.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> didn&#x27;t last very long before blew out</li>
            <li> Looks sharp hanging up.  Small and compact and has good blowing action.  Only fault is that it only has two speeds and the heat setting is governed by the blower speed, but that is minor.  Would be nice to have a cool shot too.  The cord hangup tab is a good idea to keep the cord out of the way.  The dryer fits into the receiver fine, but it seems that it could be anchored into the holder a little better as it feels like it might fall out if bumped.  It hasn&#x27;t yet, so it might just be my imagination.</li>
            <li> Love it. Had one for years and years and finally wore it out. No clutter on the counter. Easy to attach to wall.</li>
            <li> I have always loved using these great hair dryers at hotels and thought it would be great to have one att home, and it is.  No more messes on the counter or sink, and you never have to wonder which drawer it is in...</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The instructions are very clear and it was super easy to put up! Def. recommend!</li>
            <li> Very nice, looks nice.</li>
            <li> Works great, I don&#x27;t think it is too loud. I love it.</li>
            <li> Tacks onto the wall very nicely.  It comes with double sided thick tape and places for screws.  I used the tape and haven&#x27;t had any problems in over month.    I saw these in hotels all the time and loved the convenience.  Now I don&#x27;t have to deal with dragging it out of the closet every morning.  It&#x27;s right there hanging next to the mirror.    I found it to be plenty powerful, and not too hot.  The lower setting is good if you don&#x27;t want to disturb someone who is sleeping.  The high setting is powerful and loud.</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer is fantastic for the price!  It&#x27;s speedy and I love the fact it hangs up.  The black is priced much less than the white.  Super Bargain!</li>
            <li> I try not to use the higher heat setting &#x27;cuz the noise is just too loud.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for short or medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer with lots of power. Compact size and wall mount save space. Don&#x27;t let that compact size deceive you, though, because it dries hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> we dont use a hair dryer very often, just needed a basic one to use about 4-5 times a week. so bought this one when it was on sale for $7 :)  it has been great since then, it works good, has enough power and fast air heating, has a wall mount and is small in size.   I prefer this to some of the hair dryers i have in our gym (which seems more bigger than this one)    Cant beat the $7, i dont think i have seen that price again on sale. Great product for the value.</li>
            <li> I bought this and as I attempted to mount it on the wall, the plastic part that holds the screw broke off. I could still mount it with one less screw but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good idea. The dryer itself seems to work fine, but if you want a wall-mounted one you might want to look for something a little sturdier and less frustrating to hang.  UPDATE 10/30/14: I held onto this after the mounting piece broke, and a few years later dragged it out when my other dryer gave out. I decided to use the double stick tape and mount it on the bathroom mirror, where it has been in use for two or three before it burned out yesterday.I was able to remove it from the mirror by just grabbing the bracket and twisting it to the right. I am going to buy another of the same because it worked well and dried my hair quickly. I also like that it has a short nozzle because it&#x27;s easier for me to use holding it close to my hair. I  just won&#x27;t try to mount it with screws because the adhesive worked very well.</li>
            <li> We orde our 2nd hairdryer because same spot in the bathroom-hholes already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the drer doesnt last , 1. Year</li>
            <li> Very convenient....love the holder.</li>
            <li> I love the size and the power. It&#x27;s loud but it works great.  It takes up very little space on the wall.</li>
            <li> I installed this hair dryer in our RV and it is simple and easy to Install. If you can operate a power screwdriver its a no brainer. For a small hairdryer it is really convenient, stays out of the way (Just what you want) and it has lots of power for its size.</li>
            <li> Everything was great for a couple months then for no reason the fan went out and started smoking and getting HOT HOT HOT!!! Had to unplug it to keep it from incinerating! Definitely has a major defect. Would not buy again!</li>
            <li> Great powerful little dryer.</li>
            <li> It overheats on high after a little more than a minute of use - disappointing</li>
            <li> Got mine today and it is great - not as noisy and the Jerdon that I have and dried my hair just fine - I think the cord may be a little longer too.  Don&#x27;t know about the longevity of a $11.00 hair dryer, but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Lost the low heat setting in the first couple months.  It caught on fire before it was a year old.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Overall - I would have given it 5 stars, but had to withhold one, due to my wife&#x27;s complaint that there is no separate heat and fan control switches.  It also does not have \\&quot;cool blast\\&quot; or whatever they call it button that allows to temporarily switch off the heat while keeping the fan running.  To be honest - her hair looks the same to me regardless what dryer she uses.  Its an excellent product, and if you are not super picky about your dryers - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I mounted it and it&#x27;s terrible - loud and doesn&#x27;t dry hair very well at all..now I have to unmount again.</li>
            <li> It works well for a small hair dryer. I like the knob to hold up the extra length of cord. It is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I used this model at a motel and was so impressed I wrote down the brand. I was happy to find that I could get it from Amazon just a few days after I ordered it. It has a powerful fan with 2 levels of heat.</li>
            <li> This is a very small dryer but with a BIG punch!  I was shocked how much power this little dynamo has... I can dry my hair faster than I ever could with my larger hand held dryer.  It is perfect for a small wall space and keeps my counter clutter free...Highly recomended!</li>
            <li> ****UPDATE 2nd order****&lt;br /&gt;As below, I ordered a second replacement.  We got less than a year out of this one before the sparks started flying again.  Yes, we kept it clear of lint etc. [it has an easy to remove cap to do this] and the thing does not get daily use.  How one can last 3 years and the next only a year is beyond me.  I gave them a second chance....but no more.  One spark in the eye could ruin your vision for life.  Dangerous product to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review.  It&#x27;s worked flawless until today.  My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end.  This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review.  I&#x27;m buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it&#x27;s been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can&#x27;t beat it lasting 3 years. Not too concerned about the sparks as the heating wires over time get thin from all the heat...it&#x27;s almost something you expect to happen and no one was hurt in the process.  Overall a nice compact good looking unit.</li>
            <li> This dryer was easy to install. I like the size and style; it looks great in my kid&#x27;s bathroom. I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so loud, my kid&#x27;s are startled each time I turn on the dryer (even with previous warning). It does dry their hair quickly, so it definetly does the job!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to hang in the corner of by bedroom so that looking for the hair dryer did not take longer than drying my hair. The hair dryer is one of the few offered in black which best fit with my room decor. It is very small, which some might find annoying, but I like because it doesn&#x27;t take up much space. It is pretty loud, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because it is very powerful and dries my hair quickly. I don&#x27;t really use the cord hanger it came with, but it is fine if you want to use it. The electrical cord is kind of short, so allow for that when hanging on the wall.</li>
            <li> If you only want to use a hair dryer for a couple of months than this is the hair dryer for you!</li>
            <li> Perfectly stays on wall without screws. Neatly stays in place. Adequate heat distribution to not harm hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife, it had an issue turning off after a minute of use. I contacted Amazon and it was switched out in 2 days, cost me nothing.. Amazon paid for shipping another and returning. I got the new one it&#x27;s been going every day for month without any problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dyer is small, its not super fast but it hangs up and its out of my way! I love that. My wife likes it since its out of her way once she&#x27;s done dyer her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with wall anchors and double sided tape. I didn&#x27;t use any of that. I drilled 2 small holes in a stud and bought 3&amp;#34; #8 screws to mount it.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase will recommend it</li>
            <li> Have not installed the hair dryer yet in my RV. But looks well built and easy to install. My wife can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Great value and excels our expectations. Convenient, priced right and a perfect addition to our bathroom!</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom and wanted to leave the little space I had on the vanity for other things.  This mounted easily on a wooden cabinet I had next to the vanity.  The dryer is small - not one of those fancy hairdresser models!  But for what I need it for it works just great.</li>
            <li> I used one of these in a hotel on a recent trip and really liked it so I decided to purchase one for home use. It was easy to mount on the wall, and I have had no problems with it. It works very well. It is much more convenient than having to drag my previous hair dryer out of the drawer every time I needed it. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Quality and Fast Response/Shipping</li>
            <li> We have a cabin in Tennessee that we use as our vacation home.  Half the time, we forget to take a hair dryer with us.  This has solved that problem.  The dryer has a long cord.  The cord hanger can be moved to either side when mounting but it probably isn&#x27;t even needed.</li>
            <li> This looks nice and is very convenient.  I especially like the little hook for hanging the cord up out of the way.  Has a lot of power for a little dryer and looks very nice and compact in my bathroom.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before and this is a repeat buy.  I like that the blow dryer is always there, no need to always pull it out of the drawer and plug it in.  It&#x27;s a good dryer and the convenience is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good little hair dryer</li>
