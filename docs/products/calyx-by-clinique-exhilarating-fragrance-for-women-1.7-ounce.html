            <li>I like the cut grass overtones that get mellowed by the musk and has me smelling like a sexy beast running through fields of flowers (yes, a sexy beast running through flowers!)</li>
            <li>Not too fruity, I fell in love with this scent a decade ago, love it!  </li>

            <li>I do love Calyx</li>
            <li>I have loved this light &amp; fresh scent for decades.</li>
            <li>Clean yet naturally lovely.</li>
            <li>For those who like scents that are not so strong.</li>
            <li>A sweet friend has complimented me on using this fragrance, which I have enjoyed for a number of years.</li>
            <li>The color of the liquid looks fine</li>
            <li>when Prescriptives was bought by Este Lauder, they did not purchase the cologne - thanks to you (and now Clinique), I can still enjoy my favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li>Very fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It is fresh, clean and brightens my day!</li>
            <li>This smells nothing like the original Calyx.</li>
            <li>This is a clean and feminine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Not sweet, not suffocating just the perfect amount of fragrance that is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh fragrance I enjoy.</li>
            <li>Not to sweet.</li>
            <li>I have to rate this as just ok only because it does not smell as fresh and lovely as I remember when you could buy it in the store.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what i wanted no problems getting it!you should buy it now!</li>
            <li>Hadn&#x27;t seen it in the stores for a few years,so I was happy to see</li>
            <li>Only kind I ever use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh fragance.</li>
            <li>This scent is well worth trying.</li>
            <li>Fresh with a hint of ginger.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite cologne is a grapefruit scent from England.</li>
            <li>It never fails.</li>
            <li>so I waited to find it on Amazon at a better price and finally did.  </li>
            <li>I remember when it first came out and</li>
            <li>Love this scent, it is fresh, green, citrusy and clean.</li>
            <li>Calyx doesn&#x27;t kid around, it really is an \\&quot;exhilarating fragrance\\&quot;...if you can get past the first hit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Calyx is a very spritely perfume that really packs a punch upon first spray which mellows out into a fruity sweetness as time goes on.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve actually mixed it with a light musk oil for the summer</li>
            <li>Growing up I had a friend who was one of those preteens that early on became absorbed in all-things fashion, bath and beauty.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping, exactly what I wanted New</li>
            <li>but this bottle has that hint of aging perfume smell, which Calyx tends to get pretty quick, even when kept in a dark place.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit disappointing, but I shall hope for the best the next time I order online.</li>
            <li>I visited her home frequently to socialize and within her room</li>
            <li>I was heart broken when Macy&#x27;s stopped carrying it...and on a whim...typed in Calyx on one of my many Amazon trips...</li>

            <li> Personally owning this scent is a hit or miss some days; I have to be in the mood to wear something like Calyx because the initial spray comes off as rather sour for a brief moment before your nose takes into account the rest of it.</li>
            <li> Not the same product.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little different and it doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>

            <li> I usually keep it in the car because I like how it&#x27;s smell relaxes me in traffic</li>
            <li> Blast from the past.</li>
            <li> My signature cologne for over 30 years at least.</li>
            <li> They are poor knockoffs.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t return it..</li>
            <li> Bad purchase, very disappointing, as it was a gift.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my all time, #1 fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for 20 years. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent.</li>
            <li> Look, I hear gals occasionally wear guys scents. My personal favorite cologne is a grapefruit scent from England. But there is something about the Calyx that, to paraphrase one reviewer \\&quot;smells like the summer to come.\\&quot; And it&#x27;s true. I usually keep it in the car because I like how it&#x27;s smell relaxes me in traffic but I&#x27;ve actually mixed it with a light musk oil for the summer and it sets me in a nice mood. I like the cut grass overtones that get mellowed by the musk and has me smelling like a sexy beast running through fields of flowers (yes, a sexy beast running through flowers!)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume...I was heart broken when Macy&#x27;s stopped carrying it...and on a whim...typed in Calyx on one of my many Amazon trips...and voila...there it was...and I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I did...I love this scent and it&#x27;s perfect for Spring/Summer (nice and light)...thank you Amazon...will be getting the shower gel and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy...Great price!!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend and I love it.  Not sweet, not suffocating just the perfect amount of fragrance that is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> A sweet friend has complimented me on using this fragrance, which I have enjoyed for a number of years. I feel that it&#x27;s a good value for the price. I bought this item as a gift for her and she has used and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for over 10 years.  I love it. I receive many compliments!  It is fresh, clean and brightens my day!</li>
            <li> Have loved this fragrance for over 20 years</li>
            <li> This is a clean and feminine fragrance.  I always get compliments when I wear it, and I&#x27;m glad I can find it on amazon!</li>
            <li> Only kind I ever use. Been using over 30 years. Just love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances - always loved the citrus smell. So grateful I was able to buy it again</li>
            <li> Either the quality of this perfume has seriously degraded since my last purchase of Calyx or I was shipped a knock-off.  It&#x27;s unwearable.</li>
            <li> This perfume did not have the fragrance it was supposed to have. I compared it with the same product at Macy&#x27;s. Bad purchase, very disappointing, as it was a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Calyx for years.....when Prescriptives was bought by Este Lauder, they did not purchase the cologne - thanks to you (and now Clinique), I can still enjoy my favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping, exactly what I wanted New In Box...great seller</li>
            <li> I have loved this light &amp; fresh scent for decades. I am so glad I can still get it online. It stays with you all day so no need to bathe in it.</li>
            <li> My signature cologne for over 30 years at least. People stop and ask what I am wearing! Clean yet naturally lovely. I lasts all day into the evening.</li>
            <li> I had used Calyx many years ago and enjoyed it&#x27;s fresh fragance. Once again, I am using it. It arrived on time and I reminisced about other times when I used it.</li>
            <li> The spray feature was defective but I&#x27;m still using the product.  It was a bit disappointing, but I shall hope for the best the next time I order online.</li>
            <li> The scent was just as I remember.  Hadn&#x27;t seen it in the stores for a few years,so I was happy to see&lt;br /&gt;I could get it on line. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, it is fresh, green, citrusy and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  Always have and always will.</li>
            <li> Loved it!  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent but it&#x27;s not for everyone. Women either love it or hate it. Prescriptives&#x27; Calyx line has recently been relisted after a time off the market. It&#x27;s wonderful stuff. Now I need to see if my girlfriend agrees. Will give it to her on her birthday. Check back for results.</li>
            <li> This smells nothing like the original Calyx. It was a very unpleasant scent and I immediately tossed it. Dont be fooled by these supposed Prescriptive products. They are poor knockoffs.</li>
            <li> Growing up I had a friend who was one of those preteens that early on became absorbed in all-things fashion, bath and beauty. I visited her home frequently to socialize and within her room she had her personal slew of perfumes; although I never distinctly remember seeing a bottle of Calyx in her possession this fragrance reminds me of her and those early teenage years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calyx is a very spritely perfume that really packs a punch upon first spray which mellows out into a fruity sweetness as time goes on.

            <li> Great stuff, only product my daughter uses - great Christmas gift-right size and packaging-what more can be said about a product that smells so great</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  Not the same product.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little different and it doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to say I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This was shipped very fast, was packaged well, and arrived in perfect condition. Calyx has been my favorite fragrance since it first came out, so I was very happy to see it here on Amazon for such a good price! It&#x27;s a great summer fragrance, and I&#x27;ll be wearing it  - thanks for another great deal. Amazon!</li>
            <li> I use this fragrance every day and evening.  It&#x27;s so versatile and lasts.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years and I still get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Beautifully priced and beautiful ship time. Men love it when I wear this fragrance. It never fails. Will buy from this merchant again.</li>
            <li> I selfishly bought Calyx for my wife because it smells so fresh and clean and as usual it did not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I ran out of Calyx a long time ago and live in a small town where it is not available.  It&#x27;s a pricey product so I waited to find it on Amazon at a better price and finally did.  I remember when it first came out and the advertising catch phrase is that it smelled like Green.  It is a fresh fragrance I enjoy.</li>
            <li> This scent is well worth trying. Not overpowering at all. For those who like scents that are not so strong.</li>
            <li> Came on Time!  Would Buy again!  This was exactly what i wanted no problems getting it!you should buy it now!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like I thought it would!  Too bad I can&#x27;t return it..</li>
            <li> Smells good. Blast from the past.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. Very fresh scent. Not to sweet. Receive many compliments on this perfume. Would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have to rate this as just ok only because it does not smell as fresh and lovely as I remember when you could buy it in the store. I do love Calyx but this bottle has that hint of aging perfume smell, which Calyx tends to get pretty quick, even when kept in a dark place.  The color of the liquid looks fine but something is off. I wish this product would come back in the stores.</li>
            <li> Not too fruity, I fell in love with this scent a decade ago, love it!  Fresh with a hint of ginger.</li>
