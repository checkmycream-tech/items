            <li>you have the patience to work with this color, it is BEAUTIFUL, but if you&#x27;re looking for a smooth and easy formula to work with you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I painted my nails with two coats but didn&#x27;t add a top coat to just test it out on its own.</li>
            <li>Love it nice color that goes with almost anything.  </li>
            <li>Great for this price, and totally worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very cute color, it can cheap kind of easily, but with a good top coat you should be fine.</li>

            <li>Shipping was quick, good product.</li>
            <li>The nail polish arrived quickly and was in good condition.</li>
            <li>This is my first time wearing china glaze and it is very nice.</li>
            <li>It has way more gray in it.  </li>
            <li>to do more than two coats to get the color to show more&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have to say that I absolutely love the color.</li>
            <li>I would recommend! :)</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>I love the color, doesn&#x27;t paint on the smoothest</li>
            <li>and I was able to wear it for over 9 days without chipping.</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied</li>
            <li>Hope this helped &#x3D;)</li>

            <li>It still has a light minty hue!</li>
            <li>well I used three coats to bring out the color more and a top coat for shine</li>
            <li>It seems to be more greenish.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it for now until I find something that applies better.</li>

            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be more neon, I guess?</li>
            <li>Cute color but not the color i needed to match a dress i got for easter.</li>
            <li>I love this color .</li>
            <li>I love the consistency and the way it applies.</li>
            <li>It lasts for four days with a top coat</li>

            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Yuck, however the polish still goes on smooth and leaves a nice finish.  </li>
            <li>I really love this color.</li>
            <li>i already am in love with it.</li>
            <li>It is such a wonderful spring color.</li>
            <li>im getting a lot of compliments at work :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s all in my settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beautiful color too, will definitely be buying more from this brand!</li>
            <li>Love this color , already used it and it looks great and is staying on so far !!</li>
            <li>China Glaze makes a great variety of colors at a decent price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Nice color with cool undertones.  </li>
            <li>I love this color, it matches so many of the trendy clothes out there right now.</li>
            <li>Dry time wasn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li>The color is a perfect blend of blue and green, perfect to match my Easter outfit.</li>
            <li>so it arrived safe and sound.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s popular right now.</li>
            <li>other than that its Great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great purchase though, I&#x27;m coming back for more considering that I bought it at a cheaper price rather than $6.50 (Ulta)</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick</li>
            <li>- so glad that it&#x27;s in style right now!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame since this is such a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>My journey has ended for I have found my one true love among all the nail polish bottles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m my car in below freezing temps and its still good as new.</li>
            <li>Got this in the mail pretty fast, happy about that, thus, i&#x27;m giving it two stars.  </li>
            <li>Super cute color for spring.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Love this polish, came quickly, durable</li>
            <li>I love china glaze because it dries quickly and the color lasts.</li>
            <li>but as soon as I screwed the top off it is SUPER watery.</li>
            <li>Coverage is a little streaky/runny, but after two coats, if you work with it, you can get excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly I use 2 layers.</li>
            <li>Fabulous crate and ship.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump and paints so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I bought this polish because I loved the color in the picture, but this polish goes on much more blue than is pictured.</li>
            <li>arrived within expected time and I loved the colour !</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>The color is perfect it looks like green mint ice cream!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for a friend for Christmas</li>
            <li>Not my favorite color, but still pretty.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind because I love it so much that I reapply it all the time!</li>
            <li>but it still is a pretty color. :)</li>
            <li>i was so excited to get this</li>
            <li>Re-fresh Mint is such a clear, perfect shade of watery minty aqua</li>
            <li>and it actually gives me the perfect kind of sea foam green</li>
            <li>True to color and</li>
            <li>buy it its cool</li>
            <li>Thanks or quick delivery :)</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a pure green mint with no sparkle, This is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous and mint green is one of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li>The color itself is one of the more vibrant mints I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>The color is opaque and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to purchase more further on.</li>
            <li>the shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>Product came very fast!</li>
            <li>It is definitely my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry good.</li>
            <li>This color was EXACTLY what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Really a pretty summer color !  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too !!</li>
            <li>but still pretty !</li>
            <li>This nail polish is so pretty!  </li>
            <li>it looks so pretty!</li>
            <li>It went on super smooth and I really like that.</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast, well packaged and very worth buying.</li>
            <li>I have a medium/dark skin tone, and I would have to say it doesn&#x27;t fit well with it under certain lighting.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this, I expected a bright minty color.</li>
            <li>Will find fresh  bottle elsewhere.</li>
            <li>but it is useful with some work.</li>
            <li>I am going to put a clear coat on just to make sure it won&#x27;t chip...</li>
            <li>For it&#x27;s prize, it&#x27;s been a good nail polish, though I expected the brush to be thicker to make it&#x27;s application easier.</li>
            <li>The color not crazy about china glaze</li>
            <li>It kind of goes on almost like white out.</li>
            <li>Works best when applied in thin layers.  </li>
            <li>(I always apply two coats and a clear top coat).</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more like a light blue.  </li>
            <li>, i love it so far</li>
            <li>I like the color, it is more on the blue side, and to me, doesn&#x27;t really fit the picture well, but I still like the color.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t as blue as the photo,but a nice shade of maybe teal.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price even with shipping!</li>
            <li>My right hand looks like I painted it with</li>
            <li>It was just the right color too.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s more of a pale Tiffany blue than mint, truth be told - but SO beautiful).</li>
            <li>The polish itself is very professional and doesn&#x27;t chip easily</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly and the color is unique and actually some different from what your used to good for any season really</li>
            <li>I order this nail polish and 2 others in the mint family, this one is my least favorite of the 3, however it is a beautiful color, and I am sure will get used, It is amazing how many shades of min green there are to choose from, and how hard it is to match with what its going with.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I happened to really like this color</li>
            <li>It dries super fast</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty good nail polish that can be seen as an essential to many.</li>
            <li>This color is very pretty, but much lighter than the pictures I had seen on the internet.</li>
            <li>It came more than a week earlier than expected - Which I love!</li>
            <li>Is more of an off white very light blue with a hint of creme.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this color and brand, and that is coming from a true nail polish feen.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture and was the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Re-fresh Mint is a pretty color for the spring/summer seasons.</li>
            <li>but the formula is pretty runny.</li>
            <li>Still pretty but not what was advertised.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Such a shame because  I love the color.  </li>
            <li>This is my first China Glaze buy</li>
            <li>My husband thinks it is more blue, but I see a minty gray.</li>
            <li>I ordered the mint colour which is exactly how it looks in the picture</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer more muted pastels.</li>
            <li>It Would be a pretty color for wall paint but not for nails.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color mint reminds me of spring</li>
            <li>I have nothing negative to report on this polish pretty color great price.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the color in the picture.</li>
            <li>I do need to double coat like most nail polish.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying China Glaze</li>
            <li>Exactly as described</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time purchasing &#x27;China Glaze&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color i guess, but not at all what i ordered</li>
            <li>Pretty color exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It looks really pretty</li>
            <li>Exactly what I thought.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and the color was exactly like I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Super cute on tanned feet, but I think it will be equally great after summer too; it&#x27;s pale and minty without being either too colorless or veering off into pukey &#x27;hospital green&#x27; territory.</li>
            <li>And the price was just right, so i don&#x27;t feel too much of a loss.</li>
            <li>i got a very gray color, looking more like white , i like though</li>
            <li>The price isnt that bad, the color isn&#x27;t that bright as it looks in the picture is a little more pastelle but its still beautiful on.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it dries super fast and is actually shinier than my actual top coat which I thought was cool.</li>
            <li>I still am satisfied with this color though and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>That really don&#x27;t happen very often!</li>
            <li>If you apply several coats it eventually gets darker but then it smears easily.</li>
            <li>It applies very pale but still bright.</li>
            <li>I find though that the application of the polish is very streaky and it takes some patience to achieve the amount of coverage I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The color is much lighter in person than it is in the photo.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Love it just as I expected</li>
            <li>, I love this color and it is one of my favorite shades of blue (while looking for a shade to compare it to I found celeste on wikipedia) but its not the green I saw in the picture.</li>
            <li>i really like this</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this to ever girl/woman out there that loves nail polish!</li>
            <li>Very wearable.</li>
            <li>package arrived on time and very protected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the color mint green, except it does chip easily on the nails, but overall the color is so pretty.</li>
            <li>It is creamy and clean, dries fast with a nice shine, though you may need two coats because it is a bit thin.  </li>
            <li>It was more of a pale light blue color.</li>
            <li>but it is still an OK nailpolish- would definitely order again from the same nail-polish company</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>A minimum of two coats is necessary to make this color opaque, most nails required a third coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does say Re-fresh Mint on the bottle, but the color I got is a white/gray/super light blue shade which is nowhere near this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but pretty nail polishes are like red buses.</li>
            <li>This is a very light mint green color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it this brand.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As other reviews said you need to apply 3 coats and even then it chips really easily.</li>
            <li>I love this minty green color</li>
            <li>It has more of pastel green color</li>
            <li>However, it is a gorgeous color and is opaque after two thin applications.</li>
            <li>Finally, the nail polish chips within hours of application even though I cleaned all residue off of my nails right before application.  </li>
            <li>The polish came brand new as promised.</li>
            <li>I have a new love for China Glaze, very milky and thick polish.</li>
            <li>From different brands, to different textures, I have searched high and low for an all time favorite color.</li>
            <li>It got here early but its not the color the picture shows Its really not even green but its still a good color for designs but still not what I was going for.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a shade more in the green family, its a little blue for me, but still a lovely color, though I think I&#x27;ll just use it on my toes from now on.  </li>
            <li>I decided to wear this color anyway and as soon as I applied it the minty green spring color became much more apparent and matches my expectations.</li>
            <li>I just paint my nails a white base, Then let it dry, And the stuff goes on great, Hasn&#x27;t chipped or come off for more than a week!</li>
            <li>To get a good finish, one needs to apply two to three layers of the nail polish, which means one needs at least an hour for it to get dry.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the minty green color I thought it was, but in person it is a very very light baby blue color.</li>
            <li>A little thin and requires extra coats to cover but still very happy</li>
            <li>I have to put on 2 coats for it to completely cover my nail because it leaves a few light spots, but</li>
            <li>I would recommend this color to anyone who loves soft pastels and cream finishes.</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if maybe the Polish is just old?</li>
            <li>Its ok cuz its nail polish, but totally came out as an icy blue versus a mint that this image and the name portrayed.</li>
            <li>but I put it on and its definitely a light mint green...</li>
            <li>This polish is far from the mint color pictured in the product description.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dead on mint creme which doesn&#x27;t lean blue like most mints (Essie Mint Candy Apple</li>
            <li>It looks mint green in this picture....but got it today and its more of a robins egg blue.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more minty green or grayish blue.</li>
            <li>The color is more blue green than pictured.  </li>
            <li>As  I saw it&#x27;s very fast to dry and hold few days with any problem, I won&#x27;t same more time because I like to change my nail color often.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product exept for how it is a more pale blue color then a mint green.</li>
            <li>but when i open the package is more likr a baby blue with some green in it</li>
            <li>White seems to be the new nail polish each summer.</li>
            <li>Kind of a really pale green.</li>
            <li>Their nail polish lasts forever, and it stays pretty and doesn&#x27;t go globby or anything like every other brand.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I got this product in the mail--not the color I anticipated from the graphic!</li>
            <li>Base coat and top coat needed as well, because it chips easily.</li>
            <li>It does go on a little streaky with the first coat, but is easily fixed with a second coat.</li>
            <li>Better than OPI which is starting to thin.</li>
            <li>Definitely NOT green, it&#x27;s a very muted pale blue/gray.</li>
            <li>This green looked more white than green.  </li>
            <li>pretty color and even application after a few coats.</li>
            <li>I wanted something fresh and new for spring, but I didn&#x27;t want the typical baby green you see at baby showers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy other new colors too.</li>

            <li> My journey has ended for I have found my one true love among all the nail polish bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m my car in below freezing temps and its still good as new.</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail pretty fast, happy about that, thus, i&#x27;m giving it two stars.  </li>
            <li> Super cute color for spring.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Love this polish, came quickly, durable</li>
            <li> I love china glaze because it dries quickly and the color lasts.</li>
            <li> but as soon as I screwed the top off it is SUPER watery.</li>
            <li> Coverage is a little streaky/runny, but after two coats, if you work with it, you can get excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly I use 2 layers.</li>
            <li> Fabulous crate and ship.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump and paints so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish because I loved the color in the picture, but this polish goes on much more blue than is pictured.</li>
            <li> arrived within expected time and I loved the colour !</li>

            <li> The color is perfect it looks like green mint ice cream!</li>

            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind because I love it so much that I reapply it all the time!</li>
            <li> but it still is a pretty color. :)</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get this</li>
            <li> Re-fresh Mint is such a clear, perfect shade of watery minty aqua</li>
            <li> and it actually gives me the perfect kind of sea foam green</li>
            <li> True to color and</li>

            <li> Thanks or quick delivery :)</li>

            <li> but still pretty !</li>
            <li> This nail polish is so pretty!  </li>
            <li> it looks so pretty!</li>
            <li> It went on super smooth and I really like that.</li>
            <li> It arrived super fast, well packaged and very worth buying.</li>
            <li> I have a medium/dark skin tone, and I would have to say it doesn&#x27;t fit well with it under certain lighting.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I expected a bright minty color.</li>
            <li> Will find fresh  bottle elsewhere.</li>
            <li> but it is useful with some work.</li>
            <li> I am going to put a clear coat on just to make sure it won&#x27;t chip...</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s prize, it&#x27;s been a good nail polish, though I expected the brush to be thicker to make it&#x27;s application easier.</li>
            <li> The color not crazy about china glaze</li>
            <li> It kind of goes on almost like white out.</li>
            <li> Works best when applied in thin layers.  </li>
            <li> (I always apply two coats and a clear top coat).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more like a light blue.  </li>
            <li> , i love it so far</li>
            <li> I like the color, it is more on the blue side, and to me, doesn&#x27;t really fit the picture well, but I still like the color.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t as blue as the photo,but a nice shade of maybe teal.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price even with shipping!</li>
            <li> My right hand looks like I painted it with</li>
            <li> It was just the right color too.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s more of a pale Tiffany blue than mint, truth be told - but SO beautiful).</li>
            <li> The polish itself is very professional and doesn&#x27;t chip easily</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly and the color is unique and actually some different from what your used to good for any season really</li>
            <li> I order this nail polish and 2 others in the mint family, this one is my least favorite of the 3, however it is a beautiful color, and I am sure will get used, It is amazing how many shades of min green there are to choose from, and how hard it is to match with what its going with.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I happened to really like this color</li>
            <li> It dries super fast</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty good nail polish that can be seen as an essential to many.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty, but much lighter than the pictures I had seen on the internet.</li>
            <li> It came more than a week earlier than expected - Which I love!</li>
            <li> Is more of an off white very light blue with a hint of creme.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this color and brand, and that is coming from a true nail polish feen.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture and was the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Re-fresh Mint is a pretty color for the spring/summer seasons.</li>
            <li> but the formula is pretty runny.</li>
            <li> Still pretty but not what was advertised.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Such a shame because  I love the color.  </li>
            <li> This is my first China Glaze buy</li>
            <li> My husband thinks it is more blue, but I see a minty gray.</li>
            <li> I ordered the mint colour which is exactly how it looks in the picture</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer more muted pastels.</li>
            <li> It Would be a pretty color for wall paint but not for nails.  </li>
            <li> Pretty color mint reminds me of spring</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to report on this polish pretty color great price.</li>
            <li> It is exactly the color in the picture.</li>
            <li> I do need to double coat like most nail polish.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying China Glaze</li>
            <li> Exactly as described</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time purchasing &#x27;China Glaze&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color i guess, but not at all what i ordered</li>
            <li> Pretty color exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It looks really pretty</li>
            <li> Exactly what I thought.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the color was exactly like I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Super cute on tanned feet, but I think it will be equally great after summer too; it&#x27;s pale and minty without being either too colorless or veering off into pukey &#x27;hospital green&#x27; territory.</li>
            <li> And the price was just right, so i don&#x27;t feel too much of a loss.</li>
            <li> i got a very gray color, looking more like white , i like though</li>
            <li> The price isnt that bad, the color isn&#x27;t that bright as it looks in the picture is a little more pastelle but its still beautiful on.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it dries super fast and is actually shinier than my actual top coat which I thought was cool.</li>
            <li> I still am satisfied with this color though and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> That really don&#x27;t happen very often!</li>
            <li> If you apply several coats it eventually gets darker but then it smears easily.</li>
            <li> It applies very pale but still bright.</li>
            <li> I find though that the application of the polish is very streaky and it takes some patience to achieve the amount of coverage I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The color is much lighter in person than it is in the photo.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it just as I expected</li>
            <li> , I love this color and it is one of my favorite shades of blue (while looking for a shade to compare it to I found celeste on wikipedia) but its not the green I saw in the picture.</li>
            <li> i really like this</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this to ever girl/woman out there that loves nail polish!</li>
            <li> Very wearable.</li>
            <li> package arrived on time and very protected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the color mint green, except it does chip easily on the nails, but overall the color is so pretty.</li>
            <li> It is creamy and clean, dries fast with a nice shine, though you may need two coats because it is a bit thin.  </li>
            <li> It was more of a pale light blue color.</li>
            <li> but it is still an OK nailpolish- would definitely order again from the same nail-polish company</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> A minimum of two coats is necessary to make this color opaque, most nails required a third coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does say Re-fresh Mint on the bottle, but the color I got is a white/gray/super light blue shade which is nowhere near this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but pretty nail polishes are like red buses.</li>
            <li> This is a very light mint green color.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it this brand.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As other reviews said you need to apply 3 coats and even then it chips really easily.</li>
            <li> I love this minty green color</li>
            <li> It has more of pastel green color</li>
            <li> However, it is a gorgeous color and is opaque after two thin applications.</li>
            <li> Finally, the nail polish chips within hours of application even though I cleaned all residue off of my nails right before application.  </li>
            <li> The polish came brand new as promised.</li>
            <li> I have a new love for China Glaze, very milky and thick polish.</li>
            <li> From different brands, to different textures, I have searched high and low for an all time favorite color.</li>
            <li> It got here early but its not the color the picture shows Its really not even green but its still a good color for designs but still not what I was going for.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a shade more in the green family, its a little blue for me, but still a lovely color, though I think I&#x27;ll just use it on my toes from now on.  </li>
            <li> I decided to wear this color anyway and as soon as I applied it the minty green spring color became much more apparent and matches my expectations.</li>
            <li> I just paint my nails a white base, Then let it dry, And the stuff goes on great, Hasn&#x27;t chipped or come off for more than a week!</li>
            <li> To get a good finish, one needs to apply two to three layers of the nail polish, which means one needs at least an hour for it to get dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the minty green color I thought it was, but in person it is a very very light baby blue color.</li>
            <li> A little thin and requires extra coats to cover but still very happy</li>
            <li> I have to put on 2 coats for it to completely cover my nail because it leaves a few light spots, but</li>
            <li> I would recommend this color to anyone who loves soft pastels and cream finishes.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe the Polish is just old?</li>
            <li> Its ok cuz its nail polish, but totally came out as an icy blue versus a mint that this image and the name portrayed.</li>
            <li> but I put it on and its definitely a light mint green...</li>
            <li> This polish is far from the mint color pictured in the product description.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dead on mint creme which doesn&#x27;t lean blue like most mints (Essie Mint Candy Apple</li>
            <li> It looks mint green in this picture....but got it today and its more of a robins egg blue.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more minty green or grayish blue.</li>
            <li> The color is more blue green than pictured.  </li>
            <li> As  I saw it&#x27;s very fast to dry and hold few days with any problem, I won&#x27;t same more time because I like to change my nail color often.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product exept for how it is a more pale blue color then a mint green.</li>
            <li> but when i open the package is more likr a baby blue with some green in it</li>
            <li> White seems to be the new nail polish each summer.</li>
            <li> Kind of a really pale green.</li>
            <li> Their nail polish lasts forever, and it stays pretty and doesn&#x27;t go globby or anything like every other brand.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I got this product in the mail--not the color I anticipated from the graphic!</li>
            <li> Base coat and top coat needed as well, because it chips easily.</li>
            <li> It does go on a little streaky with the first coat, but is easily fixed with a second coat.</li>
            <li> Better than OPI which is starting to thin.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT green, it&#x27;s a very muted pale blue/gray.</li>
            <li> This green looked more white than green.  </li>
            <li> pretty color and even application after a few coats.</li>
            <li> I wanted something fresh and new for spring, but I didn&#x27;t want the typical baby green you see at baby showers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy other new colors too.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and usually done in 1-2 coats, typical China Glaze</li>
            <li> Looks minty and light green in picture, but in person it is a very pale blue.&lt;br /&gt;Looks minty and light green in picture, but in person it is a very pale blue.</li>
            <li> I added two pictures to hopefully help better show the color despite the poor lighting (If I could give it three-and-a half stars I would).</li>
            <li> I needed a green nail polish and was very surprised to get a blue!</li>
            <li> the sample picture, the color appears to be  a creamy and soft looking mint color, but in my experience the color had softer blue undertones rather than the minty green</li>
            <li> Go out to DG (Dollar General) and buy the Sally Extreme wear Mint Sorbet.</li>
            <li> in nearly looked grayish white with just a small hint of what looked like blue.</li>
            <li> Guess it was just sitting around too long and faded.  </li>
            <li> I will probably keep ordering this china glaze color because it took me a long time to find this one color.</li>
            <li> The color is different then what I expected.</li>
            <li> But it keeps not as long as I want.</li>
            <li> I pushed forward though, the first coat was the most difficult; it went on streaky and dried slowly.</li>
            <li> Only lost a star because the formula was pretty thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely thick but still manages to apply very streaky.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped very carefully with lots of packing peanuts for protection and it arrived even earlier than scheduled.</li>
            <li> but the dry time...</li>
            <li> I was looking at several different mint green colors and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> It looks sort of pale, almost white, in indoor lighting, and the formula started to chip after only a day.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with another China Glaze color, the color is very light with a white base and is too watery so it pools in your cuticles and sides of your nails.</li>
            <li> and I had absolutely no issues with the seller or the product.</li>
            <li> its the lighter almost like a blue instead of the green color I was looking to purchase.</li>
            <li> be careful with your purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had that sort of problem with CG polishes before.</li>
            <li> I see blue, then neon green, then mint, then</li>
            <li> Not going through the trouble of sending it back though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pale grayish blue color.</li>
            <li> It is a very pale grey-ish blue, nothing like the picture at all.</li>
            <li> Though I can&#x27;t help to be a tad disappointed, I&#x27;m excited to use it!</li>
            <li> In the picture the color looks brighter but when i got it is was a dull blue.</li>
            <li> and now im angry because the color in the picture is nothing like the real bottle....</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use a base coat and a top coat</li>
            <li> does take longer to dry than the usual polish...somewhat disappointing, but worth it if you have the time and patience.</li>
            <li> Shelf Life is very limited -- Keep the cap tight and you will still have it dried and sticky in 6 months -</li>
            <li> also slightly streaky</li>
            <li> I had already read comments from previous buyers and i thought &amp;#34;heck</li>
            <li> I do see the seafoam green/mint green there, no doubt about it, but also when it&#x27;s dark</li>
            <li> It takes FOREVER to dry, goes on streaky (even after 3 coats it does not look uniform) and thick.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t really the same color, like almost at all :(</li>
            <li> I am a little dissaponted</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was a dirty white color not this robins egg/Tiffany blue.</li>
            <li> Product came within a few days of ordering, shipped in a padded envelope in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> And it goes on in uneven streaks.</li>
            <li> Not as green as it looks though</li>
            <li> green</li>
            <li> it looks  green in the product photo</li>
            <li> but is not as green as in the picture</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this polish because I thought the color would be mint green.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a color that could apply for all year round</li>
            <li> Nothing close to mint green.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble and money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately this polish dries very slowly, I waited for approximately 45 minutes before doing anything that could potentially damage my nails, and even after waiting for so long a nail was smudged when I changed my shirt.</li>
            <li> I would not have bought it in a store because the color looks dull in the bottle, however after putting two coats on your nails</li>
            <li> Requires at least two coats.</li>
            <li> It does not go on evenly need to put on at least four applications to cover all the patches.  </li>
            <li> this sucks.</li>
            <li> This nail polish has a really thick formula.</li>
            <li> polish was too thick.  </li>
            <li> it arrived, I decided to do my nails and noticed that the formula was fairly thick.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I was expecting a minty green color (as the name of the polish and coloring in the picture suggests), but it was a very pale blue.</li>
            <li> its awful for someone like me since i&#x27;m pretty impatient.</li>
            <li> house paint its so thick, just to get an even coat, not good.  </li>
            <li> but overall it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately what I received was a grayish nail polish with the slightest hint of green.</li>
            <li> Disappointed but might use it in the future or give it to my neice</li>
            <li> but it is very dull.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this.</li>
            <li> When you put it on, do a silver or white base coat.</li>
            <li> The color i recieved is a grayish dirty green.</li>
            <li> Applies thinly, so be generous with the amount you use for each nail.</li>
            <li> NOT happy.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting a minty green nail polish for my sister-in-law and was disappointed when I received it.  </li>
            <li> Either it was a bad bottle or the brand sucks.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s dragging horribly will be sending it back tomorrow.</li>
            <li> The nail polish also dries a weird matte like finish.  </li>
            <li> and honestly I&#x27;m not very impressed with the formula.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if it reacted weird with the polish or what</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this polish.</li>
            <li> When It arrived, i opened the package to a weird looking grayish color.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed since after sitting for a day or two</li>
            <li> It comes on a grey nasty colors.</li>
            <li> Awkward.</li>
            <li> but when I apply (even when I use a base coat) it leaves a disgusting green tint on my nails.</li>
            <li> Ugly color.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t paint your nails within 8 hours of sleeping with this polish, you&#x27;ll wake up with those infuriating bedsheet creases over your manicure!</li>
            <li> Tragically disappointed</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in the color I received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with this item.</li>
            <li> HATE IT.</li>
            <li> Ugly and highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Wrong color!!!</li>
            <li> This, this is just terrible for China Glaze..</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is definitely not mint.  It has way more gray in it.  I still use it but it is very dull.</li>
            <li> I was looking at several different mint green colors and decided on this one.  It looks exactly like the picture and was the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This was not the color i was expecting but it is still an OK nailpolish- would definitely order again from the same nail-polish company</li>
            <li> White seems to be the new nail polish each summer. This is a very light mint green color. Perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> Super cute color for spring.&lt;br /&gt;Have to do more than two coats to get the color to show more&lt;br /&gt;But other than that its Great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous color but when I apply (even when I use a base coat) it leaves a disgusting green tint on my nails. Doesn&#x27;t come off for days. I scrub it with baking soda and lemon juice to get it off but it takes about a week.</li>
            <li> I wanted something fresh and new for spring, but I didn&#x27;t want the typical baby green you see at baby showers.&lt;br /&gt;This color is creamy, the color is well saturated and looks great with just a shiny top coat, a matte coat or glitter coats.</li>
            <li> China Glaze makes a great variety of colors at a decent price in my opinion. Re-fresh Mint is a pretty color for the spring/summer seasons. I find though that the application of the polish is very streaky and it takes some patience to achieve the amount of coverage I was looking for. I would recommend this color to anyone who loves soft pastels and cream finishes.</li>
            <li> the colour is amazing...but the formula is pretty runny. also slightly streaky but thats not too distracting. but the dry time...ugh!! its awful for someone like me since i&#x27;m pretty impatient.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t look this bright, it is a darker greener color.  Still pretty but not what was advertised.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I absolutely love the color. It&#x27;s gorgeous and mint green is one of my favorite colors. I painted my nails with two coats but didn&#x27;t add a top coat to just test it out on its own. It chipped after two days and on the fourth day, it tore off part of my nail. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, came quickly, durable, it&#x27;s Kind of a vintage mint color in person. Highly recommend it this brand.</li>
            <li> This green looked more white than green.  Guess it was just sitting around too long and faded.  Not happy with this.</li>
            <li> Love the color mint green, except it does chip easily on the nails, but overall the color is so pretty.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! I love china glaze because it dries quickly and the color lasts.</li>
            <li> Great color. Showed up well. True to color and the shipping was very fast! Great quality nail polish and went on VERY SMOOTH. I would highly recommend. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Product came within a few days of ordering, shipped in a padded envelope in bubble wrap. Coverage is a little streaky/runny, but after two coats, if you work with it, you can get excellent coverage. Great color, very pretty. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product. I would recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Ugly color. Looks nothing like the color swatch shown. Definitely NOT green, it&#x27;s a very muted pale blue/gray. Don&#x27;t Buy!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and great quality. Arrived on time and I had absolutely no issues with the seller or the product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the color but something is wrong with this polish I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s out of date or what but it&#x27;s dragging horribly will be sending it back tomorrow. Such a shame because  I love the color.  Will find fresh  bottle elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I been looking for a color similar to this since the summer but came across this... Love it nice color that goes with almost anything.  It lasted on my nails for about a week then it started to chip but overall it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Go out to DG (Dollar General) and buy the Sally Extreme wear Mint Sorbet. It looks how the bottle looks! This, this is just terrible for China Glaze.. It comes on a grey nasty colors. HATE IT.</li>
            <li> Love it!  What more can I say?  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I expected a bright minty color. Unfortunately what I received was a grayish nail polish with the slightest hint of green. Luckily, I happened to really like this color so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss.</li>
            <li> nice color. covers well</li>
            <li> Loved the color matches many outfits</li>
            <li> This color was EXACTLY what I was looking for! Couldn&#x27;t find it at Ulta or Target so I am very glad that I found it here! I tried it out and it looks fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I love the color, doesn&#x27;t paint on the smoothest but it is useful with some work. Requires at least two coats.</li>
            <li> Love it so much! Gorgeous color</li>
            <li> Got so many compliments on the color! The quality was great and it arrived before predicted!  I accidently left it out I&#x27;m my car in below freezing temps and its still good as new.</li>
            <li> Love the color!!! It dries super fast and I was able to wear it for over 9 days without chipping. It was delivered promptly as well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price even with shipping! The color is amazing! It is creamy and clean, dries fast with a nice shine, though you may need two coats because it is a bit thin.  I am going to put a clear coat on just to make sure it won&#x27;t chip... This is my first China Glaze buy and I am completely satisfied &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I received this polish and for some reason the color is NOT the same as the picture stated. It is a much lighter, duller shade of green. Almost like a stick of gum. I don&#x27;t know if maybe the Polish is just old?</li>
            <li> When you get this item, it&#x27;s not the same color as it is in the bottle. When you put it on, do a silver or white base coat. It looks way prettier on than in the bottle, so don&#x27;t judge when you get it. Great for this price, and totally worth it. I love it! Also, just something to keep in mind when you buy nail polish, China Glaze is the best brand out there. Their nail polish lasts forever, and it stays pretty and doesn&#x27;t go globby or anything like every other brand. Hope this helped &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Waaay lighter than pictured</li>
            <li> This color is not what you get when you recieve the order. its the lighter almost like a blue instead of the green color I was looking to purchase. BUT ITS OKAY..</li>
            <li> The polish I received looks NOTHING like the color pictured! The color i recieved is a grayish dirty green. Ugly and highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Yeah, so it may not be the color you thought it would be, but that happens. My husband thinks it is more blue, but I see a minty gray. Its all in the eye of the beholder. On the plus side, it dries super fast and is actually shinier than my actual top coat which I thought was cool. It went on super smooth and I really like that. Arrived quickly, and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s prize, it&#x27;s been a good nail polish, though I expected the brush to be thicker to make it&#x27;s application easier. To get a good finish, one needs to apply two to three layers of the nail polish, which means one needs at least an hour for it to get dry.</li>
            <li> Love this color , already used it and it looks great and is staying on so far !! Really a pretty summer color !  Shipping was fast too !!</li>
            <li> I ordered the mint colour which is exactly how it looks in the picture but as soon as I screwed the top off it is SUPER watery. And it goes on in uneven streaks. As other reviews said you need to apply 3 coats and even then it chips really easily. Disappointed</li>
            <li> I order this nail polish and 2 others in the mint family, this one is my least favorite of the 3, however it is a beautiful color, and I am sure will get used, It is amazing how many shades of min green there are to choose from, and how hard it is to match with what its going with.</li>
            <li> LOVE the color! Needs 2-3 coats to be bright/vibrant! Lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Tried to use this nail polish several times.  It does not go on evenly need to put on at least four applications to cover all the patches.  The nail polish also dries a weird matte like finish.  Finally, the nail polish chips within hours of application even though I cleaned all residue off of my nails right before application.  It&#x27;s a shame since this is such a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> Product came very fast! The color is perfect it looks like green mint ice cream! I originally bought this for a friend for Christmas but I ended up keeping it for myself! I am very pleased and it was the perfect price</li>
            <li> This nail polish has a really thick formula. It&#x27;s still manageable though. The color itself is one of the more vibrant mints I&#x27;ve seen. Personally, I prefer more muted pastels. Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty good nail polish that can be seen as an essential to many.</li>
            <li> Ok so when I first opened the package and saw this bottle I was so disappointed.. in nearly looked grayish white with just a small hint of what looked like blue. I decided to wear this color anyway and as soon as I applied it the minty green spring color became much more apparent and matches my expectations. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting a minty green nail polish for my sister-in-law and was disappointed when I received it.  It Would be a pretty color for wall paint but not for nails.  The color is much lighter in person than it is in the photo.  I sent it back.</li>
            <li> I love this color. Perfect for the spring and summer time.</li>
            <li> I love China Glaze and it actually gives me the perfect kind of sea foam green aka Mint color i always wanted.  The price isnt that bad, the color isn&#x27;t that bright as it looks in the picture is a little more pastelle but its still beautiful on.  I will probably keep ordering this china glaze color because it took me a long time to find this one color.</li>
            <li> This color is definitely lighter than it looks here but I absolutely love it. It still has a light minty hue! Beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish because I loved the color in the picture, but this polish goes on much more blue than is pictured.</li>
            <li> A little thin and requires extra coats to cover but still very happy</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! It came more than a week earlier than expected - Which I love! The color is a perfect blend of blue and green, perfect to match my Easter outfit. It does go on a little streaky with the first coat, but is easily fixed with a second coat. Perfect color, perfect price, and perfect brand! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Pretty color mint reminds me of spring this is a popular color this season polish goes on well I used three coats to bring out the color more and a top coat for shine I have nothing negative to report on this polish pretty color great price.</li>
            <li> Its ok cuz its nail polish, but totally came out as an icy blue versus a mint that this image and the name portrayed. Disappointed but might use it in the future or give it to my neice</li>
            <li> This color is duller in person than what it shows on the computer. It seems to be more greenish. I still am satisfied with this color though and how long it lasts. And the price was just right, so i don&#x27;t feel too much of a loss.</li>
            <li> It is a great color. It was wrapped very carefully with lots of packing peanuts for protection and it arrived even earlier than scheduled. It is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Love the color. It is exactly the color in the picture. I do need to double coat like most nail polish. I don&#x27;t know why people are complaining about that.</li>
            <li> i got a very gray color, looking more like white , i like though but its is not what i wanted so be careful with your purchase</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly I use 2 layers. I just paint my nails a white base, Then let it dry, And the stuff goes on great, Hasn&#x27;t chipped or come off for more than a week! Love</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying China Glaze and honestly I&#x27;m not very impressed with the formula. It&#x27;s extremely thick but still manages to apply very streaky. However the color itself is a winner. It&#x27;s a dead on mint creme which doesn&#x27;t lean blue like most mints (Essie Mint Candy Apple I&#x27;m talking to you). I&#x27;m keeping it for now until I find something that applies better.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand many times and am always satisfied.  The package arrived quickly and in good condition.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Shelf Life is very limited -- Keep the cap tight and you will still have it dried and sticky in 6 months -</li>
            <li> The color is great but that&#x27;s about it.  I was expecting a shade more in the green family, its a little blue for me, but still a lovely color, though I think I&#x27;ll just use it on my toes from now on.  It takes FOREVER to dry, goes on streaky (even after 3 coats it does not look uniform) and thick.  My right hand looks like I painted it with house paint its so thick, just to get an even coat, not good.  I even tried putting 6 hours between coats and the polish still doesn&#x27;t get try enough to resist marking.  I wouldn&#x27;t paint your nails within 8 hours of sleeping with this polish, you&#x27;ll wake up with those infuriating bedsheet creases over your manicure!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite color, but still pretty.</li>
            <li> Love. The color not crazy about china glaze the nail  polish was too thick.  Either it was a bad bottle or the brand sucks.</li>
            <li> Looks minty and light green in picture, but in person it is a very pale blue.&lt;br /&gt;Looks minty and light green in picture, but in person it is a very pale blue.</li>
            <li> Love it just as I expected</li>
            <li> Perfect for spring and summer!!  It is the same color as the picture above. It lasts for about a week.</li>
            <li> pretty color and even application after a few coats. Not as green as it looks though but still pretty !</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> Lighter than CG For Audrey. Kind of a really pale green. Goes on smoothly and usually done in 1-2 coats, typical China Glaze</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be more neon, I guess? It looks sort of pale, almost white, in indoor lighting, and the formula started to chip after only a day. I used SVQDT and I don&#x27;t know if it reacted weird with the polish or what but it was literally flaking off. I&#x27;ve never really had that sort of problem with CG polishes before. Awkward.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly and the color is unique and actually some different from what your used to good for any season really</li>
            <li> I really love the color of this but its a difficult for me to apply.  It kind of goes on almost like white out.</li>
            <li> I needed a green nail polish and was very surprised to get a blue! Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love this color and it is one of my favorite shades of blue (while looking for a shade to compare it to I found celeste on wikipedia) but its not the green I saw in the picture.</li>
            <li> I did not believe the color received looked like the color in the picture.. It ended up not being the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> A+++++. Fabulous crate and ship. Exactly as described</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty, but much lighter than the pictures I had seen on the internet. Though I can&#x27;t help to be a tad disappointed, I&#x27;m excited to use it! (:</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it was as described and a perfect mint color. I really loved that the nail polish looked like the color in the picture. That really don&#x27;t happen very often!</li>
            <li> It looks mint green in this picture....but got it today and its more of a robins egg blue. Cute color but not the color i needed to match a dress i got for easter. I will use in future, but looks nothing like picture. Thanks or quick delivery :)</li>
            <li> Nice color with cool undertones.  The polish is opaque-ish.  Works best when applied in thin layers.  Looks awesome on my chocolate colored toes.</li>
            <li> I love this color . This is my first time wearing china glaze and it is very nice. I love the consistency and the way it applies. The color is opaque and dries quickly. It lasts for four days with a top coat but I don&#x27;t mind because I love it so much that I reapply it all the time! Definitely a favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! I love this minty green color - so glad that it&#x27;s in style right now! The polish itself is very professional and doesn&#x27;t chip easily (I always apply two coats and a clear top coat). I didn&#x27;t have to touch up for a couple of weeks. I&#x27;m a big fan of China Glaze products.</li>
            <li> I have a medium/dark skin tone, and I would have to say it doesn&#x27;t fit well with it under certain lighting. I do see the seafoam green/mint green there, no doubt about it, but also when it&#x27;s dark I see blue, then neon green, then mint, then something about 4 shades lighter than For Audrey. It&#x27;s a great purchase though, I&#x27;m coming back for more considering that I bought it at a cheaper price rather than $6.50 (Ulta)</li>
            <li> the color is beautiful got a lot of compliments... In the pic it can sometimes look like sea foam green lol but I put it on and its definitely a light mint green... and I love it. perfect for summer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time purchasing &#x27;China Glaze&amp;#34; product. The color is different then what I expected. It has more of pastel green color but I like how it brighten up my finger. I love it!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is so pretty!  My favorite of the season!  I would not have bought it in a store because the color looks dull in the bottle, however after putting two coats on your nails it is vibrant and the perfect mint color.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I got this product in the mail--not the color I anticipated from the graphic! However once on your nails it depends on the lighting weather it&#x27;s more minty green or grayish blue. Regardless, it&#x27;s a beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;I does take longer to dry than the usual polish...somewhat disappointing, but worth it if you have the time and patience.</li>
            <li> So, the picture makes it look like a mint colour ..but it&#x27;s more like a light blue.  Got this in the mail pretty fast, happy about that, thus, i&#x27;m giving it two stars.  Not going through the trouble of sending it back though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the color I wanted, beautiful and excellent quality polish. The color goes on perfect with the first coat, really love this nail polish! Beautiful color too, will definitely be buying more from this brand!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a pure green mint with no sparkle, This is perfect. It applies very pale but still bright.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t really the same color, like almost at all :( but its still nail polish so..</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. i love the way the color appears on my nails. it is very similar to the one of the model. buy it its cool</li>
            <li> Loved the color - received lots of compliments!  Didn&#x27;t turn my nails yellow which is always a risk with greens... I would definitely recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> The color is very very nice and easy to wear even you&#x27;re not extravagant. It illuminate your hands and very easy to applicate. As  I saw it&#x27;s very fast to dry and hold few days with any problem, I won&#x27;t same more time because I like to change my nail color often.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry good. The color is more blue green than pictured.  Save you money and purchase OPI instead</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was a dirty white color not this robins egg/Tiffany blue. I&#x27;m very unhappy with this item.</li>
            <li> i really like this the colour is excactly what you see here  a minty green its very intense.and it has a kind of  matte finish</li>
            <li> i love mint and i have been looking for mint colored nail polish and i found this, i love it so far</li>
            <li> I saw this unique color of polish and loved it! It shipped to me shortly after and I painted it on that night!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this polish I get sooooo many compliments&lt;br /&gt;where did you get that blah blah blah :)</li>
            <li> so glad i got this color price was good price compared to going some were else love it plan on buying more colors</li>
            <li> this is my favorite color of all the ones i have purchased this year.  it looks great on my toes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very cute color, it can cheap kind of easily, but with a good top coat you should be fine.</li>
            <li> It got here early but its not the color the picture shows Its really not even green but its still a good color for designs but still not what I was going for.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! Color is great and is very trendy right now! I apply two coats to get the best look!</li>
            <li> I had already read comments from previous buyers and i thought &amp;#34;heck i&#x27;ll just try it out myself.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Wow that was the dumbest thing I did. Wrong color!!!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the perfect minty nail polish for months now and I finally found it. I&#x27;m obsessed with this polish. The shipping was right on time and the product was wonderful.</li>
            <li> This color is soooo ridiculously cute. It is definitely my new favorite. I have to put on 2 coats for it to completely cover my nail because it leaves a few light spots, but its okay. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I got my nail polish and it didn&#x27;t even work every time I did it the nail polish would bubble.</li>
            <li> I like the color, it is more on the blue side, and to me, doesn&#x27;t really fit the picture well, but I still like the color. Applies thinly, so be generous with the amount you use for each nail. Two coats will probably give best results. Shipping was quick, good product.</li>
            <li> I loved this color from the moment I saw it. I bought it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, I decided to do my nails and noticed that the formula was fairly thick. I pushed forward though, the first coat was the most difficult; it went on streaky and dried slowly. A minimum of two coats is necessary to make this color opaque, most nails required a third coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this polish dries very slowly, I waited for approximately 45 minutes before doing anything that could potentially damage my nails, and even after waiting for so long a nail was smudged when I changed my shirt. On one nail the polish began to bubble so I redid it as well, making my \\&quot;quick\\&quot; manicure a rather lengthy ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the sample picture, the color appears to be  a creamy and soft looking mint color, but in my experience the color had softer blue undertones rather than the minty green shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the patience to work with this color, it is BEAUTIFUL, but if you&#x27;re looking for a smooth and easy formula to work with you might want to look elsewhere. I added two pictures to hopefully help better show the color despite the poor lighting (If I could give it three-and-a half stars I would).</li>
            <li> it looks  green in the product photo but when i open the package is more likr a baby blue with some green in it i still give it 5 because it looks adorable :D but is not as green as in the picture i like pastel colors took a week to get home but i made the order on a weekend but over all is good im happy</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I was expecting a minty green color (as the name of the polish and coloring in the picture suggests), but it was a very pale blue. Tragically disappointed</li>
            <li> I like the color of this nail polish. But it keeps not as long as I want. I will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The color of this nail polish is definitely not mint. If you apply several coats it eventually gets darker but then it smears easily.</li>
            <li> My friend loved this.  It was just the right color too.  The dealer shipped it in bubble wrap and a padded envelope so it arrived safe and sound.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with another China Glaze color, the color is very light with a white base and is too watery so it pools in your cuticles and sides of your nails. Needs thickened.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in the color I received. It is a very pale grey-ish blue, nothing like the picture at all. It&#x27;s a pretty color i guess, but not at all what i ordered</li>
            <li> Love this color! Doesn&#x27;t clump and paints so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I had been looking everywhere for the perfect mint pants and then the perfect mint shirt and then I came across this nail polish and I just had to have it. It is the perfect creamy mint polish!!</li>
            <li> WARNING! The color does not appear the same on the picture  above. The color is a blue and looks nothing like the picture. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This nail polish needs to be put on in 2 or 3 coats.  Otherwise, it comes out streaky.  Base coat and top coat needed as well, because it chips easily.</li>
            <li> The color I got is NOT the same as pictured. It does say Re-fresh Mint on the bottle, but the color I got is a white/gray/super light blue shade which is nowhere near this. NOT happy. I found this color in a local beauty supply shop and it looked way different than what I received,</li>
            <li> I ordered this polish because I thought the color would be mint green.  When It arrived, i opened the package to a weird looking grayish color.  It reminds me of the color of cement! Yuck, however the polish still goes on smooth and leaves a nice finish.  I cant take that away from the product.</li>
            <li> Pretty color exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color on the picture at all. It was more of a pale light blue color.</li>
            <li> I really love this color. It&#x27;s pastel plus has a nautical beachy look too. Kind of fits all the seasons plus it&#x27;s popular right now. It arrived super fast, well packaged and very worth buying. I applied it to my acriliyic nails and it looks amazing. It dries great plus stays nice and glossy.</li>
            <li> Excellent new color. Love it; one of the best products in this genre. Will definitely buy other new colors too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Perfect mint color! It&#x27;s a big hit with clients!</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t seem as it did online.  Not impressed since after sitting for a day or two it separates.</li>
            <li> This polish is far from the mint color pictured in the product description. It&#x27;s a pale grayish blue color. Dry time wasn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li> Only lost a star because the formula was pretty thin and I had to use three coats to achieve opaque.</li>
            <li> Ahhh, would buy local next time</li>
            <li> The polish came brand new as promised. I&#x27;ve been looking for a color that could apply for all year round and this was it. The color isn&#x27;t as blue as the photo,but a nice shade of maybe teal. However, it is a gorgeous color and is opaque after two thin applications.</li>
            <li> i have only swatched this color, i havent worn it yet but i cant wait! it looks so pretty! i already am in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this color! I get compliments every time I wear it and would recommend it especially on a fun bright day</li>
            <li> Not the color I was expecting it turned out even lighter than how it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> Color just as bright and beautiful as the picture!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what everyone is talking about. It&#x27;s not blue but mint. Maybe what you purchased was a knockoff but I just applied one coat and it was nice and even. No streaks and definitely not opaque. If you don&#x27;t use a base coat and a top coat it obviously won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I love this color, it matches so many of the trendy clothes out there right now. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The color looks nothing like the picture. Is more of an off white very light blue with a hint of creme. Nothing close to mint green. Save yourself the trouble and money.</li>
            <li> I accidently ordered 2 of these. When they came in I noticed the actual color was a bit lighter than the picture led on. The second bottle they sent me didn&#x27;t even match!! It is BABY BLUE!!! And yes they were both labeled Re-Fresh Mint. Do not order this! It&#x27;s a waste of money.. order in a store and get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> In my recent obsession with nail art, I have explored the ups and downs of the nail polish world. From different brands, to different textures, I have searched high and low for an all time favorite color. My journey has ended for I have found my one true love among all the nail polish bottles. This color is amazing as is the application. It is such a wonderful spring color. Goes great with Essie&#x27;s \\&quot;tart deco\\&quot;. I highly recommend this color and brand, and that is coming from a true nail polish feen.</li>
            <li> The nail polish arrived quickly and was in good condition. I am very happy with the prompt service I received. China Glaze is always a must.</li>
            <li> arrived within expected time and I loved the colour ! I&#x27;d love to purchase more further on. would totally recommend it for anyone else. it fits perfectly with the dress I bought from Alegra K</li>
            <li> Color matches the photo.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted. I didn&#x27;t think it would be the same color as the picture, but it is! I highly suggest this to ever girl/woman out there that loves nail polish! ALL the China Glaze products are just amazing! The nail polish doesn&#x27;t come off a day later either! It stays on for quit some time! Love, love, love this product!!!! :)</li>
            <li> In the picture the color looks brighter but when i got it is was a dull blue. Not a greenish color like it looks.</li>
            <li> I luv it. It looks really pretty im getting a lot of compliments at work :) u can put some glitter too</li>
            <li> Re-fresh Mint is such a clear, perfect shade of watery minty aqua (it&#x27;s more of a pale Tiffany blue than mint, truth be told - but SO beautiful). Super cute on tanned feet, but I think it will be equally great after summer too; it&#x27;s pale and minty without being either too colorless or veering off into pukey &#x27;hospital green&#x27; territory. Very wearable. And it has lasted FOREVER on my toes with a coat of Seche Vite. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product exept for how it is a more pale blue color then a mint green. I am a little dissaponted but it still is a pretty color. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but pretty nail polishes are like red buses.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I thought. Arrived on time and the color was exactly like I thought it would be. No complaints from me!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the minty green color I thought it was, but in person it is a very very light baby blue color.</li>
            <li> this sucks. i was so excited to get this and now im angry because the color in the picture is nothing like the real bottle....</li>
            <li> The color looks differently than my monitor but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s all in my settings.&lt;br /&gt;My package arrived on time and very protected.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to purchasing products from you again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> feels like it never dries</li>
            <li> BEST MINT COLOR TO DATE! I have a new love for China Glaze, very milky and thick polish. Better than OPI which is starting to thin.</li>
            <li> I am a china glaze junkie.  There nail polish is amazing.  This color is simply beautiful, so many compliments!  A must for spring.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick an there were no problems with anything. It came in perfect condition and i love the nail color and recommend buying. This was one of the smoothest shipments I&#x27;ve ever gotten. 😀😀😀</li>
