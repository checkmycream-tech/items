            <li>Its kind of funny</li>

            <li>I use this on my thighs every night wake up with a huge difference im hooked♡♡♡♡...</li>
            <li>I am a mom of 3 and strongly believe in showing true results for this type of product or none at all.</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>

            <li>Exercise and a good diet also help of course but not necessary in order to see results.  </li>
            <li>The product comes in quite a large squeeze-tube bottle, which will surely last months and is great for dispensing exactly the amount I need.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is natural , so I&#x27;m not applying a lot of chemicals to my skin.</li>
            <li>I will keeping using the cream since I like the fresh feeling of it.</li>
            <li>applied it as directed in circular motion until it was absorbed.</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I noticed actually the first week, but wanted to wait to see more results before leaving a review.</li>
            <li>, I was embarrassed at first but not after using this cream</li>
            <li>MY LEGS ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING BETTER SINCE I STARTED USING IT.  </li>
            <li>I have seen results in the first 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Some items only include the product, and I like to know how to get the most out of products I buy.</li>
            <li>I mean come on what I better way to tell my mom sorry for ruining her body through child birth then to buy this perfect cream that can help her regain her once tight beautiful skin</li>
            <li>would recommend this product, the only reason I gave it a 4 star is the strong scent on the product.</li>
            <li>Nothing is a miracle in a bottle, so lets be realistic but this is close!</li>
            <li>Did not see too much difference</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>The cellulite is definitely not as obvious as it used to be prior to applying this cream religiously, so I&#x27;ve been able to wear skirts more often without worrying about how my thighs look from the back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is extremely effective at diminishing the appearance of cellulite, but it takes a few applications before you will see results.</li>
            <li>that is not at too overwhelming like other cellulite/stretch mark creams.</li>
            <li>I know a cream will not be a fix all, and must be added with proper diet and exercise, and making sure you flush your system with proper water intake.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this beauty product .</li>
            <li>I have been using Sasha Nicole Cellulite Cream Treatment with High Caffeine and Retinol for about 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying for this price to see if you to get the same results as I did.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a little over a month now and can honestly see the difference in my thigh regions and even around the back of my upperarms.</li>
            <li>I just placed a new order.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a pretty big difference!!!</li>
            <li>my skin is smooth and softer and skin is tightening, doesnt have a bad smell, is not thick, and rubs in nicely.</li>
            <li>This luxurious non sticky formula is made with a proprietary blend of natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>This formula was originally developed for exclusive spa use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I been using the treadmill daily or if its really the cream.</li>
            <li>It is pretty thick in texture; definitely thicker than lotion, but still applies easily and evenly.</li>
            <li>I did notice a sticky feeling on my legs and a slight cool effect as I slipped my jeans on, as well as the lingering scent.</li>
            <li>I will definitely try that and see if it can completely get rid of my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products like this and didn&#x27;t notice much.</li>
            <li>The skin is tighter, less dimply and much smoother.  </li>

            <li> The skin is tighter, less dimply and much smoother.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that it takes a while to dry completely, otherwise it will cause you to feel sticky if you immediately put your clothes on after, but this is expected with all creams.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this as long as I keep seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect a miracle cream, but I think with long term use, it would help tone out the cellulite ( adding exercise helps too).</li>
            <li> The small dimples have not completely disappeared (as expected - this is not a miracle cream), but my skin is so much smoother and firmer around that area.</li>
            <li> I kept an open mind knowing not everyone has the same results and was even skeptical after reading positive reviews, as no pics were posted.</li>
            <li> I did use  it every single day with massage and exercise and diet  </li>
            <li> I did have big hopes for that cream however after using for over a month and a half nothing change on my skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also so big that you likely won&#x27;t have to buy another for at least 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not really seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rubbed this cream onto the back of my thighs for about 2 weeks now, and I began seeing results a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Bottle nearly empty</li>
            <li> (Slightly tacky if you do not allow to air dry fully to skin and rub in well)</li>
            <li> it is small and only lasted me 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The cream is an off white color and very thick and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I can notice a difference in my heavy cellulite areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this that long, so I don&#x27;t expect dramatic results yet.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been rubbing the cream in with just my hand for the past 2 weeks, and it seems to be working just as well.</li>
            <li> The smell is weird but doesn&#x27;t last for long(hopefully know one else</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is hard, so it doesn&#x27;t begin flattening or rolling up the way toothpaste tubes</li>
            <li> Been using this cream s little over month..love it!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic results in my cellulite, but I have noticed some improvement.</li>
            <li> unfortunately there is no improvement whatsoever</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would work.</li>
            <li> It works to diminish ugly cellulite dimples, lumps and ripples.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>

The skin is tighter, less dimply and much smoother.  Exercise and a good diet also help of course but not necessary in order to see results.  It only takes 1-2 minutes a day to apply this product plus it smells pleasant.</li>

            <li> It worked so amazingly I use this on my thighs every night wake up with a huge difference im hooked♡♡♡♡... i also bought my mom some for mothers day I mean come on what I better way to tell my mom sorry for ruining her body through child birth then to buy this perfect cream that can help her regain her once tight beautiful skin lol jus sayn...you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, not only does it work great it gives you what it says! AND IT SMELLS WONDERFUL.  I am happy I chose this cream over others!</li>
            <li> Disappointed! Did not see too much difference and I did like that whenever you are applying it through massage, it will turn into crumbs.</li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks this cream has shown improvement. I noticed actually the first week, but wanted to wait to see more results before leaving a review. Nothing is a miracle in a bottle, so lets be realistic but this is close! The texture is nice and the smell is very pleasant. No burning sensations or tingling. (Slightly tacky if you do not allow to air dry fully to skin and rub in well) but it is nothing that is unbearable and does not stick to or stain. I have applied this cream in a hurry and thrown on clothes and does not stain or get on to material, despite. It is by far the best one I have tried yet. My &amp;#34;before and after&amp;#34; pics are with applying twice a day, faithfully, every morning &amp; night after showering. I used just enough to cover area using sparingly as I could as bottle is only 4 oz. Pictures have not been re-touched at all, nor photo shopped. I am a mom of 3 and strongly believe in showing true results for this type of product or none at all. Keep an open mind as I did, all things do vary to everyone&#x27;s body type. I kept an open mind knowing not everyone has the same results and was even skeptical after reading positive reviews, as no pics were posted. But I can say with 100% honesty this worked for me. It&#x27;s definitely worth trying for this price to see if you to get the same results as I did. (the pic showing one leg so you can truly see my cellulite, I was embarrassed at first but not after using this cream so I&#x27;m gladly to show my results!!!)... Best of all my results were with no changing of my diet or exercise, just used cellulite creme every day &amp; night. Good luck hope you have great results too. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I been using it for 2 weeks, I seen an improvement but too be honest .....I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I been using the treadmill daily or if its really the cream. I will keeping using the cream since I like the fresh feeling of it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I really like it I need to order more!</li>
            <li> I got thus as a promotional item. I was skeptical that it would work. I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic results in my cellulite, but I have noticed some improvement. I haven&#x27;t been using this that long, so I don&#x27;t expect dramatic results yet. I will continue to use this as long as I keep seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li> I ve tried many creams. This is the best so far. It kinda tightens up your skin. Nothing totally eliminates the problem, but this helps</li>
            <li> MY LEGS ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING BETTER SINCE I STARTED USING IT.  THE CELLULITE IS GOING AWAY!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and works quickly my skin is smooth and softer and skin is tightening, doesnt have a bad smell, is not thick, and rubs in nicely. I have received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Been using this cream s little over month..love it!! I can see the difference. I would definitely recommend this to my family/friends!!</li>
            <li> I have seen results in the first 2 weeks.  I just had to order another bottle becasue it is small and only lasted me 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Not really seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sasha Nicole Cellulite Cream Treatment with High Caffeine and Retinol for about 3 weeks now. I use it in the morning after my shower and again in the evening before bed. I have seen a bit of a smoother skin tone since using it. I don&#x27;t expect a miracle cream, but I think with long term use, it would help tone out the cellulite ( adding exercise helps too).</li>
            <li> I was able to order this product through a new seller promotion at a discount in exchange for my valuable feedback.&lt;br /&gt;The cream came nicely packaged, in the box, with an insert on product tips and information. I love that! Some items only include the product, and I like to know how to get the most out of products I buy. I noticed a very strong fragrance from the bottle. It was not opened and was not leaking.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a very strong citrus. The cream is an off white color and very thick and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it as directed in circular motion until it was absorbed. I did notice a sticky feeling on my legs and a slight cool effect as I slipped my jeans on, as well as the lingering scent. That finally went away after about an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;I love that these types of products have the added caffeine in them to try and get your circulation going to minimize those fat cells. I know a cream will not be a fix all, and must be added with proper diet and exercise, and making sure you flush your system with proper water intake. But I do think after using this for a couple weeks, that I am seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, the only reason I gave it a 4 star is the strong scent on the product. I&#x27;m not a fan of heavy perfumes. I&#x27;ve added photos for you to see what the product looks like.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Cellulite Cream for close to 3 weeks now and I have seen a pretty big difference!!! My skin appears so much smoother on my legs, I absolutely love this stuff!!! And would strongly encourage anyone with stubborn cellulite to give this cellulite cream a try, I&#x27;m sure your going to love it just as much as I do:-)</li>
            <li> This product is extremely effective at diminishing the appearance of cellulite, but it takes a few applications before you will see results. I&#x27;ve rubbed this cream onto the back of my thighs for about 2 weeks now, and I began seeing results a few days ago. The small dimples have not completely disappeared (as expected - this is not a miracle cream), but my skin is so much smoother and firmer around that area. The cellulite is definitely not as obvious as it used to be prior to applying this cream religiously, so I&#x27;ve been able to wear skirts more often without worrying about how my thighs look from the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself has a very pleasant fragrance (citrusy with a touch of mint) that is not at too overwhelming like other cellulite/stretch mark creams. It is pretty thick in texture; definitely thicker than lotion, but still applies easily and evenly. The product comes in quite a large squeeze-tube bottle, which will surely last months and is great for dispensing exactly the amount I need. The bottle itself is hard, so it doesn&#x27;t begin flattening or rolling up the way toothpaste tubes do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that applying this cream with a massaging mitt or a derma roller should make its effects even more effective, so I will definitely try that and see if it can completely get rid of my cellulite. However, I&#x27;ve been rubbing the cream in with just my hand for the past 2 weeks, and it seems to be working just as well. The only thing is that it takes a while to dry completely, otherwise it will cause you to feel sticky if you immediately put your clothes on after, but this is expected with all creams. Overall, this is a great product that truly improves skin tone! The bottle is also so big that you likely won&#x27;t have to buy another for at least 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was offered to me at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 days and feel like my skin is smoothing out.  Of course I add exercise to the routine to help w/ the firming affect. Its kind of funny but I feel a cooling and warming sensation in the places I use it. The smell is weird but doesn&#x27;t last for long(hopefully know one else smells it on me lol).</li>
            <li> Bottle nearly empty and I can actually see a difference. I&#x27;ve tried other products like this and didn&#x27;t notice much. I just placed a new order.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and can already tell a difference in my skin tone. I use it on my arms, tummy buttock and thighs!  I only wish you sold it in a larger container. 😊</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money. I do fitness comps and use only on problem areas/loose skin from babies etc....definite difference with this. Worth a try!</li>
